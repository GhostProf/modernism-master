Ideologies that have been superseded by more enduring political discourses
and literary res who have been succeeded by  greater authors are
frequently relegated to the footnotes of cultural scholarship. But
sometimes these lesser-known subjects of literary history, properly
attended to, provide unique opportunities for a richer understanding of
aesthetic developments. The study of British modernism, in particular,
can benefit from a willingness to examine forgotten political-cultural
relationships. Indeed, the period's extreme ideological complexity and
cross-fertilization has served to mask the important political roles
played by less celebrated artists in the formulation of modernist
aesthetic doctrine. This is particularly true of Katherine Mansfield.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Most studies either neglect to include Mansfield in their accounts of
modernism's emergence, or else try to correct this oversight by addressing
her influence on Virginia Woolf.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  She is largely thought of as someone who was "unaffected by contemporary
  literary trends and divorced from the great social, political and
  cultural events of her time."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  Even those who contend that she participated in the development of a
  "female modernism" that gave literary voice to "an emerging feminist
  consciousness," as well as those who acknowledge that her stories
  explore "the theme of the exploitation of women," claim that Mansfield
  failed to do so in a perceptibly ideological manner.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mansfield's earliest collected short stories, those published in the
years 1910-11, have been particularly ill-served by prevailing
views of her indifference to political and social controversy. These
are frequently dismissed as aesthetically unaccomplished and politically
na&iuml;ve. By 1920, Mansfield herself regarded them

<B></B>

as "immature," "juvenile," and "a lie."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
  Scholars have generally drawn upon these comments to argue that the
  stories simply mirror popular fears of German invasion or offer an
  unbalanced reflection upon her lonely confinement at a German spa in
  1909, where she gave birth to a stillborn child.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  Antony Alpers suggests that the stories, most of which were later
  republished in the volume <I>In a German Pension</I> , were
  influenced by the 1909 box office sensation <I>An Englishman's Home,</I>
  a "clumsy melodrama" that "gave crude expression to the warnings by
  General Roberts of German readiness for war."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  Patricia Moran argues that the stories are lamentable instances
  of feminine "revulsion and self-loathing" for "the female body's
  materiality," that they "demonstrate how deeply devaluations of women
  cripple and deform women's estimation of themselves, even when women
  consciously resist and revise those demeaning cultural scripts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Despite their lowly critical status, however, these works have a great
deal to teach us about Mansfield's politically engaged role in the
development of early British modernism. Originally published in the
British socialist magazine <I>The New Age,</I> these stories--viewed
in proper historical context--reveal that she contributed to one of the
least acknowledged, but nevertheless most important, shifts in political
outlook and literary taste of her time. Though not as fully achieved (or
even as modernist) as her later fiction, their occasional stridency and
callowness only serve to emphasize their transitional literary-historical
nature. Through their criticisms of German imperial culture and maternity
and formal rejection of plot and discourse, these stories served dual
political and cultural purposes. First, they undermined the authority of
the dominant Edwardian currents of state-governed socialism and suffragist
feminism while encouraging alternative forms of worker-governed socialism
and individualist feminism. Second, they initiated a closely related shift
from an influential Edwardian aesthetics of materiality and discursivity
toward a new modernist aesthetics of spiritual liberation and perceptual
immediacy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>The New Age</I> (1907-22) is of great relevance to an
understanding of the early politics of British modernism. From
1907-14, this weekly magazine, which had a large and diverse
circulation base of more than 3,000 readers was not only the most
significant clearinghouse of anticapitalist thought in Britain, but it
was also a site of culturally pivotal debate about socialism, feminism,
and the arts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  Due to the fierce commitment to freedom of expression of the magazine's
  gifted editor, A. R. Orage, the publication secured contributions from
  many of the most influential intellectuals and artists of the Edwardian
  era, including George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, Walter Sickert,
  G. K. Chesterton, Arnold Bennett, and Hilaire Belloc. In addition,
  Orage's no less pronounced editorial flexibility, love of controversy,
  and gifted eye for young talent, allowed the pages of <I>The New Age</I>
  to accommodate several important political and cultural movements that
  increasingly defined British intellectual life in the years leading
  to World War I.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Politically, <I>The New Age</I> was the birthplace of guild socialism,
a short-lived political theory that combined an anarcho-libertarian
hostility to state authority with a socialist commitment to communal
ownership of the means of production. At the time of its

<B></B>

founding in 1907, most of the magazine's contributors belonged to the
Fabian Society, a small organization of prominent socialist intellectuals
who wished to transfer property from individuals to the state through
gradual parliamentary reform. However, beginning in 1908, Orage began
soliciting articles from a range of dissenting strains of anticapitalist
opinion, most notably from well-known men of letters Chesterton and
Belloc. Out of the heated discussions which ensued, the contributors to
<I>The New Age</I> eventually formulated guild socialism as an alternative
socialist ideology. Unlike the Edwardian Fabians, who sought to redress
capitalist ills through state regulated control of industry, employment,
and social welfare, guild socialism encouraged workers to reject the
systems of elected government, reject state interference in their lives,
and seize control of industry through strikes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>The New Age</I> was also the birthplace of an important strain of
individualist feminism with close ties to both guild socialism and
the anarcho-libertarian thought of Dora Marsden's magazines <I>The
Freewoman</I> (1911-2), <I>The New Freewoman</I> , and
<I>The Egoist</I> (1914-20), the latter two of which later served
as equally important sites of modernist literary activity. When <I>The
New Age</I> was rethinking its allegiance to Fabian state socialism,
many of its contributors were simultaneously reexamining their support
for women's suffrage and the organizations that promoted it. These
contributors attacked what they perceived as suffragists' misdirected
focus on celebrating motherhood, a stance they believed kept women
intellectually crippled. And they also demanded that suffragists--like
striking laborers--desist from placing all their hopes in the vote and
take full responsibility for their own liberation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Most significantly, <I>The New Age</I> was a key birthplace of
British modernism. In conjunction with the magazine's efforts to
combine a tenacious commitment to individual liberty with a larger
project of collective political liberation, a related aesthetic
shift took place. Initially, the magazine championed the writings of
Fabian-affiliated authors Shaw, Wells, and Bennett, whose work was
widely thought to be (however counterintuitive this may sound today)
the most revolutionary and avant-garde of the period. But as Fabianism
lost favor in the magazine, so did these authors, whose plays and novels
were thought to share state socialism's indifference to matters of spirit
and individual freedom. Increasingly embracing the work of younger and,
at the time, relatively unknown literary res such as Katherine
Mansfield, T. E. Hulme, and Ezra Pound, these artists' contributions to
<I>The New Age</I> offered an attractive alternative to the work of Shaw,
Wells, and Bennett and an equally attractive ideological basis for an
antistatist political culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mansfield's earliest published stories in <I>The New Age,</I> those
that appeared between February and August 1910, participated in this
political and cultural ferment through their prominent and forcefully
negative portrayals of German imperial culture and maternity. By
criticizing Germans and motherhood, they castigated a tendency among
Fabian socialists, suffragists, and their respective fellow-travelers,
to regard citizens as physical specimens and national commodities. As
critics have often noted, these stories highlight the supposedly abhorrent
corporeality of German culture. For example, "Germans at Meat" (3 March
1910) depicts a group of German diners at a rest cure

<B></B>

pension as crudely voracious creatures obsessed with consumption,
excretion, and conquest. When not dripping soup on their clothing or
remarking on how well their digestive tracts "retain" certain foods,
they make hostile sexual comments to the story's English narrator
and unambiguously threaten her homeland with attack. At the beginning
of the tale, while describing his prowess at consuming large English
breakfasts, the aptly named Herr Rat boasts, "I have had all I wanted
from women without marriage" (<I>SS</I> 37). Then, reinforcing the close
relation of his unconstrained appetites for women and English cuisine,
he stares at the young narrator in a manner that suggests a desire not
just to rape her but to conquer England. "He fixed his cold blue eyes on
me with an expression which suggested a thousand premeditated invasions"
(<I>SS</I> 38). Later, another guest at the pension makes the link between
sexual violence and German military attack even more explicit by casting
the relationship between Germany and England as one between a powerful
male and a defenseless woman: "'Don't be afraid,' Herr Hoffmann said,
'We don't want England. If we did we would have had her long ago'"
(<I>SS</I> 40).
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mansfield's earliest <I>New Age</I> stories are also, as has often been
recognized, fiercely antimaternal. They express anger and disgust with
the physical traumas and disrements of pregnancy. The "Frau" in "The
Child-Who-Was-Tired" (24 February 1910) complains that her "insides are
all twisted up from having children too quickly" (<I>SS</I> 97).
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  The young waitress in "At 'Lehmann's'" (7 July 1910) can hardly bear
  the sight of the pregnant wife of her employer, regarding the woman's
  enormous swollen belly as "ugly--ugly--ugly" (ibid. 76).
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
  And the narrator of "Frau Fischer" (18 August 1910) boldly declares, "I
  consider child-bearing the most ignominious of professions" (ibid. 55).
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While some scholars have perceived that Mansfield's early fiction is
anti-German and antimaternal, however, none has recognized the extent
to which these aspects of her work are ideologically intertwined. In
the context of prewar British cultural discourse Germany was not only
regarded as an immediate military threat to Britain, but also considered
a nation whose dynamic birthrate and economy posed long-term questions
about the status of Britain as a great power. For many of Mansfield's
contemporaries, Germany's military ambitions and birthrate were obverse
sides of a single coin: if left unchallenged, they would together spell
doom for Britain's imperial aspirations. These widely held cultural
anxieties were of enormous concern to the milieu of Edwardian intellectual
debate out of which Mansfield's stories emerged.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although neither Shaw nor Wells expressed animosity towards Germany,
they and other Fabian-affiliated intellectuals in <I>The New Age</I>
believed that the nation represented a challenge to Britain. Shaw had
long been concerned with preserving British imperial hegemony in the
face of increasing foreign competition. As early as <I>Fabianism and the
Empire</I> , he sought to stem national decline by laying plans
for the "effective social organisation of the whole Empire."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  And by the time he published <I>Getting Married</I>  at the height
  of Britain's naval arms race with Germany, he expressed great concern
  at the "alarming rapidity" with which British marriage practices were
  "beginning to depopulate the country."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
  Wells, too, regarded German industry and population growth as threats
  to British imperial ambitions. In his novel <I>The</I> 

<B></B>

<I>New Machiavelli</I> , the protagonist direly warns that "Germany
is beating England in every matter upon which competition is possible":
"Germany, with a much larger population, a vigorous and irreconcilable
proletariat, a bolder intellectual training, a harsher spirit, can
scarcely fail to drive us at last to a realization of intolerable strain."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In fact, Germany was in many ways the model upon which Edwardian
socialists sought to base their proposed reforms. Questions of "national
efficiency" and racial fitness, of which Germany was considered a leader,
became prominent concerns of the Fabian Society.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
  The Society, actively seeking to influence British governmental policy,
  quickly proposed a program of state regulatory control of industry,
  employment, housing, health, and sanitation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
  It was thought that such interference with the free market would not
  only secure greater social justice, but also enable "the Englishman,"
  in Shaw's words, to do what "the German can do in social organization."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
  In a less official context, Shaw and Wells promoted the role of eugenics
  in raising the birthrate and improving the nation's racial stock.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
  In <I>Man and Superman</I> , Shaw called for "the socialization
  of the selective breeding of man," and in <I>The New Machiavelli,</I>
  Wells's protagonist proposed to "biologize imperialism": "Women
  . . . must become more and more subordinated as individually independent
  citizens to the collective purpose" of "bearing and rearing good
  children."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
  Although these were more radical proposals than either man was willing
  to subscribe to in his more strictly political writings, they reflect
  a belief that biology and breeding were vital national concerns.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mansfield was keenly aware of the perceived link between the German
military threat and presumed British racial decline. In "Germans at
Meat," the same uncouth Germans who blatantly threaten invasion make
much of the fact that England's birthrate is declining.

These same Germans further suggest that England's soldiers are physically
unprepared to counter a German attack. After the narrator assures her
fellow diners that neither she nor her countrymen are afraid of invasion,
Herr Rat responds, "Well, then,

<B></B>

you ought to be. . . . You have got no army at all--a few little boys
with their veins full of nicotine poisoning" (<I>SS</I> 40).
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While Mansfield clearly regarded Germany as a military threat, she
flatly rejected the idea that Britain needed to compete with Germany
on its own terms. Not only are her stories unrepentantly antimaternal,
they are also deeply critical of what she perceives as the Germans'
obsession with the physical and the sexual. They suggest that Germans'
preoccupation with bodily concerns makes them willing participants
in their own spiritual debasement and social commodification. This is
particularly evident in the case of the Widow in "Germans at Meat." By
having this character pick her teeth with a hairpin while criticizing
the narrator's vegetarianism and childlessness, Mansfield demonstrates
that Germans' concern with carnality and breeding is inherently coarse
and degrading. In addition, by having her blithely speak about babies
being placed on a supper-table amidst a wealth of foodstuffs, Mansfield
insinuates that Germans regard themselves and their children as little
more than national and familial resources, a point confirmed by the
jingoistic Traveller, who loudly proclaims Germany to be "the home of
the family" while biting into his potato.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is too infrequently noted that Mansfield regularly celebrated the
efforts of women to escape this demeaning social model in her fiction. The
same semiautobiographical narrator who fends off the slights and insults
of her fellow diners in "Germans at Meat" equally vigorously defends her
spiritual integrity and intellectual independence in other tales. In
"The Luft Bad" (24 March 1910), she resists strong social pressure to
define herself in physical terms. The story is set in an open-air German
spa where men on one side of an enclosure are "chopping down trees and
sawing through planks, dashing heavy weights to the ground, and singing
part songs," and women on the other are encouraging the narrator to dress
in "nothing larger than a handkerchief" and join them in sunbathing and
talking about the "ailments and measurements and ills that flesh is heir
to" (<I>SS</I> 79). However, after watching a young woman speak pantingly
of how she is "perspiring so splendidly" and listening to "the brownest
woman" she had ever seen talk of the benefits of eating only raw fruit,
nuts, and vegetables, the narrator refuses to be shamed into parading
around half naked or focusing exclusively on her weight or physical
conditioning (<I>SS</I> 80). Turning her back on these women, she climbs
on a swing and, in a brief moment of psychological and emotional freedom,
ascends towards "white clouds trail[ing] delicately through the blue sky"
(<I>SS</I> 81).
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In "Frau Fischer," Mansfield's narrator similarly resists social pressure
to define herself in terms of sex and childbearing. Throughout the story,
the title character, a loud and overbearing widow, takes an intrusive
interest in the marital status and sex lives of all the young women she
encounters. When she first arrives at the pension where the narrator is
staying, Frau Fischer upbraids a widowed pension employee for not having
married off any of her eligible young daughters. Although Frau Hartmann,
"in an ashamed and apologetic voice," explains, "We are such a happy
family since my dear man died," Frau Fischer is decidedly unsympathetic to
the idea that her daughters might be happier free of husbands (<I>SS</I>
50). "But these marriages--one must have courage; and after all, give
them time, they all make the happy family bigger--thank

<B></B>

God for that. . ." (<I>SS</I> 51). In keeping with the replacement
of a picture of Jesus Christ by that of the Kaiser in Frau Fischer's
room, the intrusive widow is concerned only that these daughters have
lots of children. When she attempts to impose her views on the story's
wedded but childless narrator, however, she meets with far more spirited
opposition. Far from being intimidated by Frau Fischer's criticisms of
her childlessness or the fact that she is staying at the pension without
her husband, Mansfield's narrator boldly declares childrearing, as already
indicated, "the most ignominious of all professions," casually claims to
"like empty beds," and stiffly rebuffs the widow's efforts to draw her
into further conversation (<I>SS</I> 55).
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By thus repudiating the idea that citizens should be regarded as physical
specimens, sexual vessels, and national commodities, Mansfield did more
than criticize a purportedly German social ideal; she played a crucial
and heretofore unacknowledged role in the discrediting and redirection
of those Edwardian currents in <I>The New Age</I> that subscribed to this
ideal. For example, she implicitly cast doubt on the wisdom of addressing
capitalist inequities through the Fabian model of state regulatory
control. This is particularly apparent when one compares her fiction
with the contemporaneous political criticisms of Chesterton and Belloc,
who did more than anyone else in <I>The New Age</I> to stir indignation
against the Fabians. In his criticisms of the 1909 Minority Report of
the Poor Law Commission (the Fabian Society's most detailed blueprint
for the formation of a socialist welfare state) Belloc argued that this
ostensibly humanitarian reform proposal sought to organize "the poor like
a flock of sheep" . He revealed that clause 29 granted governmental
committees control over "that province of enquiry that is most offensive
to the poor (cross-examination upon their physical condition, interfering
with domestic arrangements, the enforcing of compulsory vaccinations,
etc.)" (ibid. 556). He also bitterly disclosed that clause 82 provided
for "management" of "the able-bodied unemployed." Quoting from the report
itself, he pointed out that if unemployed members of the proletariat could
not find work through one of the proposed labor exchanges designed to
eliminate unemployment, this clause "granted" these unfortunate members
of society assistance in a labor "colony" where they were "'to receive'
(by force of course) 'such physical and mental training' as the politician
'may think fit.'" (<I>SS</I> 557)
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
  While Mansfield's stories were not so pointedly political, they no less
  vehemently rejected the idea that men and women should be regarded as
  material resources.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mansfield's stories also undermined faith in Shavian and Wellsian
eugenics, which enjoyed considerable popularity at the time among
socialist intellectuals. By revealing the brutalizing and debasing effects
of excessive interest in birth and sex in her stories, she added her voice
to those of a variety of essayists in <I>The New Age</I> who sought to
show that eugenicists were leading Britain down a path to barbarism. Like
M. D. Eder, who in 1909 had described eugenics as a "criminal doctrine"
that would lead to "slaughter" and the oligarchic division of humanity
into two unequal classes--"leaders on one side, hewers of wood and drawers
of water on the other"--she decried the application of principles of
animal husbandry and slaveholding to free citizens.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
  She also echoed Francis Grierson, who in 1910 talked of the dangers of
  "'progressive' thinkers"

<B></B>

denying "the psychic part of man." Pointing, like Mansfield,
apprehensively toward Germany, "the hot-bed of modern materialism,"
he asserted, "Nothing but a hatch now separates us from primitive
barbary. Underneath is the lair of the wild beast, whose growls are
as audible and menacing as were those of the old Roman arena when Rome
thirsted for blood."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mansfield even aligned her fiction with <I>The New Age</I>'s growing
tendency to regard the spiritual liberation of rank-and-file laborers
as the proper focus of socialist revolution. Her stories' celebration of
female spirit and identity amidst demeaning social circumstances clearly
paralleled the magazine's valorization of working class efforts to defend
their industrialism and integrity in the face of capitalist exploitation
and state socialist meddling. This is especially evident in Orage's
commentary on the era's many wildcat strikes and work stoppages. If it
was not yet clear that these spontaneous demonstrations of discontent
could provide the basis for a worker-led reorganization of industry
along guild lines, it was nevertheless obvious to him that they were an
important sign of "social progress," the necessary precondition for the
dawn of a "new age" of human freedom.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In short, the editor and contributors to <I>The New Age</I>--Mansfield
in particular--regarded women's and workers' growing awareness of
their innate psychological worth as offering an amplified scope for
human endeavor, a model for social reconstruction not predicated on the
brutish management of one's fellow citizens.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to participating in the refashioning of Edwardian socialism,
Mansfield's anti-German stories played a pivotal if still unrecognized
part in the reformulation of mainstream Edwardian feminism, one that
preceded the more celebrated contributions of Marsden by over a year. By
suggesting that women who willingly embraced the "ignominious profession"
of childbearing demeaned themselves and inhibited the development of
untapped spiritual and mental faculties, she identified her writings with
a combative new strain of individualist feminism. This is especially
clear when one situates her fiction in relation to contemporaneous
critical polemics by her friend Beatrice Hastings. Like Mansfield,
Hastings and her feminist allies in <I>The New Age</I> mocked the idea
that motherhood was an ideal that feminists should encourage or pursue,
all well before Marsden raised the same issues in her magazines.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
  One contributor to the magazine found it appalling that suffragists
  claimed that they would use the "Power of the Vote" to "protect the
  mother and help the child," indeed to do their "duty to the race." "We

  meetings," she commented in 1909, "and we pat ourselves on the back
  and tell ourselves we are doing something very heroic in getting so
  hot in so noble a cause." In her view, the physical experience of
  motherhood was far from ennobling: "It is a very pleasant sensation
  to suckle a child,

<B></B>

if one can; so pleasant that the mother's sensuous enjoyment is frequently
reflected in . . . the vacuous smile of one whose brain is empty and
whose body is at ease."

Hastings was no less critical of feminist idealizations of
maternity. Indeed she found it unconscionable that international feminist
author Olive Schreiner could encourage women in her study <I>Women and
Labour</I>  to discover "the joy of giving life, the glory and
beatitude of a virile womanhood." "The choice before the majority of
women," commented Hastings in 1911,

is to enter the professions, arts, and crafts by force and in force or to
degenerate. Olive Schreiner, however, is not content to give this plain
and sensible piece of advice, but she must needs spoil it entirely by an
unnecessary, a reactionary, and, indeed, an inconsistent addition. It
is a great truth, she declares, "and one on which I should not fear to
challenge the verdict of long future generations," that the endeavour
of women should be "towards a higher appreciation of the sacredness of
all sex relations." If that is to be the case then farewell to any hope
of women taking all labour for their province and competing with men
in professions, arts, and crafts. For the truth must be told that it is
precisely by <I>lowering</I> his appreciation of the sacredness of all
sex relations that intellectual man at any rate has won his position. Nor
should we fear to challenge the verdict of long future generations that
the same deflation of the importance of sex will prove necessary to
women if they are to enter the intellectual spheres where men now labour.

In Hastings's opinion, by "exaggerat[ing] the importance of sex and
parentage," Schreiner encouraged women to enter the professions with
a crippling "mother-hunger still in their hearts," in short to be, as
Mansfield's fiction suggested, insufficiently intellectual and serious
in their pursuit of individual fulfillment.

The most important and lasting contribution that Mansfield's stories
made was to the reconceptualization of what it meant to be aesthetically
innovative. As her anti-German stories came to occupy an ever more
prominent place in the magazine, Orage and other contributors increasingly
accused the widely esteemed literature of Shaw, Wells, and Bennett--as
Mansfield indirectly did--of being guilty of the "tendency . . . to
deny the existence of [the] soul and to regard it as, at best, only a
compound of the appetites, desires, and experiences of the mind."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
  <I>The New Age</I>'s drama critic, Ashley Dukes, denounced Shaw for
  treating his plays' characters as the Fabians treated the working
  classes--that is, as little more than objects of national appropriation
  and maintenance. Excoriating Shaw's materialism in 1911, he remarked,

In a close echo of Mansfield's "Germans at Meat," Orage criticized Wells

Mansfield's fiction also served as the leading edge of an effort
to reconceive the early twentieth-century aesthetic avant-garde in
psychological and spiritual terms. Although she is not generally discussed
in relation to Hulme and Pound, who also wrote extensively for <I>The New
Age,</I> she shared their desire to break with widely held materialistic
conceptions of human nature. Like their groundbreaking Imagist poetry,
which in Hulme's words sought through the expression of "individual
idiosyncrasy" to give form to evanescent moments of consciousness that
revealed the world to be a place of "freedom and chance," Mansfield's
stories attempted to disclose vistas of intellectual and spiritual
freedom that existed outside materially defined boundaries of identity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
  What is more, her tales also set the oppositional terms by which
  Virginia Woolf and other major modern novelists would later lay claim to
  cultural authority. Long before Woolf's celebrated 1921 essay "Modern
  Fiction" took Bennett and Wells to task for being "materialists"
  concerned more with the "body" than the "soul," Mansfield's tales
  offered a comparable critique in more specifically political terms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The other means by which Mansfield facilitated the emergence of new
variants of socialism, feminism, and modern literature was more strictly
formalistic. By rejecting plot and discourse and foregrounding the
dangers of abstract conceptual language in her more self-consciously
modernist stories of late fall, she criticized a widespread tendency
among Edwardian socialists and feminists to encourage the political
delegation of agency. In addition, she aligned her fiction with a
contrasting movement to advocate self-government in politics and
perceptual immediacy in aesthetics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The two stories that best exemplify these concerns are the companion
pieces "The Journey to Bruges" (24 August 1911) and "Being a Truthful
Adventure" (7 September 1911). Like most of Mansfield's finest work,
neither provides obvious plot development or conceptual focus. In
paradigmatic modernist fashion, each story unfolds in an apparently random
manner, without the benefit of the kind of orienting authorial comment
that was so prominent in Edwardian and late Victorian fiction. In "The
Journey to Bruges," for example, the semiautobiographical first-person
narrator encounters a range of more or less ordinary individuals during
her travels, none of whom becomes the subject of thematic scrutiny
or plays a significant part in subsequent events. At the beginning of
the story, the attention she directs towards two young men in her train
compartment suggests that they will go on to play prominent roles. Their
dialogue, which is reported almost entirely without comment, gives
every indication of building towards a conflict that will require
resolution. Playfully dubbed "the Enthusiast" and "the Mole" by the
narrator--the former for his excited talk and the latter for his neutral,
gray clothing--a tension almost immediately manifests itself between
them upon their taking their seats:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

"Look here, old man," said the Enthusiast, "I want to change all our
places. You know those arrangements you've made--I want to cut them out
altogether. Do you mind?"

<B></B>

"No," said the Mole, faintly. "But why?" "Well, I was thinking it over
in bed last night, and I'm hanged if I can see the good of us paying
fifteen bob if we don't want to. You see what I mean?" The Mole took
off his pince-nez and breathed on them. "Now I don't want to unsettle
you," went on the Enthusiast, "because, after all, it's your party--you
asked me. I wouldn't upset it for anything, but--there you are--you
see--what?" Suggested the Mole: "I'm afraid people will look down on me
for taking you abroad" [<I>SS</I> 14].

Despite the fact that the narrator tells us, "My heart yearned over
the Mole's immediate future," this plot thread and potential source of
thematic focus cuts off almost as abruptly as it begins (ibid. 15). After
the Enthusiast denies the Mole's last statement, insisting on "how sought
after he had been," the two companions nap the remainder of the journey,
only waking to disembark from the train and leave narrator and reader
forever ignorant as to how they will sort out their differences (ibid.).

Other portions of "The Journey to Bruges" refuse equally forcefully
to cohere into a linear narrative. Although readers today would not
find the story particularly disorienting, it would have challenged the
expectations of readers of Shaw's, Wells's, and Bennett's works, which
even at their most unconventional remained concerned with viewing life
through an organizing lens of ideas. The story begins:

A German family, their luggage neatly buttoned into what appeared to be

 a homeopathic young clergyman, his black dicky flapping over his shirt,
 stood at my elbow. We waited and waited, for the cloak-room porter could
 not get rid of the German family, who appeared to be explaining to him
 by their enthusiasm and gestures the virtue of so many buttons. At last
 the wife of the party seized her particular packet and started to undo
 it. Shrugging his shoulders, the porter turned to me. "Where for?" he
 asked. [<I>SS</I> 13]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The tale commences in medias res, without any omniscient narrative
voice to contextualize the porter's remarks or even to identify their
intended recipient. Are the porter's words directed at a member of
the German family that is introduced in the second paragraph? The
tale's first-person narrator? The answer is not at first apparent or
unequivocally ascertainable. Even after reference is made to the German
"wife," ambiguity remains as to whether she is absolutely the "lady"
in question. Likewise, it is not at first evident what causes the German
family to frustrate the porter. The fact that there is a language barrier
must be inferred from their impassioned "gestures" and baffling behavior.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mansfield gives readers no more conceptual overview of events than her
first-person narrator possesses at the time they take place. Like Hulme
and Pound--her modernist compatriots in <I>The New Age</I>--she exhibits
a close affinity with such turn of the century philosophers as Friedrich
Nietzsche, Henri Bergson, William James, and F. H. Bradley, who argued
that reality lay in the immediate flux of sensory appearance and not in
a rational, conceptual order beyond it. The disclosure of information
in "The Journey to Bruges" is rigorously sensory and retains much of
the unexplained

<B></B>

and aleatory flavor of raw perception. No one's name is disclosed, the
specific cause of the German family's agitation is never identified,
and the "odd canvas trouser legs" that hold the family's luggage remain
mysteriously foreign. Despite the fact that the narrator later remarks
of the clergyman, "My sensitiveness glimpsed a symbol in his eye,"
we are never told the nature of this symbol (<I>SS</I> 13).
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
  Nor does he or the German family play any subsequent role in the
  tale. Like the Enthusiast and the Mole, who also remain nameless,
  these res simply join a host of randomly encountered individuals
  in the story who enable Mansfield to represent the fragmentary and
  discontinuous quality of immediate, quotidian experience.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although "Being a Truthful Adventure" is less rigorously antidiscursive
than "The Journey to Bruges," it is much more overtly polemical. From
the very beginning, the story dramatizes the false lures and perils
of ideational language and thought. At the commencement of the tale,
which picks up where "The Journey to Bruges" leaves off, the exhausted
narrator has arrived in Bruges and is consulting a guidebook while
awaiting a room at a hotel.

"The little town lies spread before the gaze of the eager traveler like
a faded tapestry threaded with the silver of its canals, made musical by
the great chiming belfry. Life is long since asleep in Bruges; fantastic
dreams alone breathe over tower and medieval house front, enchanting the
eye, inspiring the soul and filling the mind with the great beauty of
contemplation." I read this sentence from a guide-book while waiting for
"Madame" in the hotel sitting-room. It sounded extremely comforting, and
my tired heart, tucked away under a thousand and one grey city wrappings,
woke and exulted within me . . . I wondered if I had enough clothes with
me to last for at least a month. [<I>SS</I> 18]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The gaping distance between the high-flown abstractions of the
guidebook promising beauty, dreams, and comfort, and the more palpable
realities of Bruges--which have already left the narrator's "tired heart"
dampened under "a thousand and one grey city wrappings"--establishes the
oppositional thrust of the story. As the narrative unfolds, she discovers
that the "fantastic dreams" promised by the guidebook are nowhere
to be found and that to entrust her "gaze" to this seductive verbal
intermediary is not to achieve a swifter and more authoritative knowledge
of her surroundings, but rather to keep herself ignorant, dependent, and
perpetually disappointed. Instead of spending her stay, as the guidebook
pledges, "filling [her] mind with the great beauty of contemplation,"
the narrator finds herself, while following its instructions, contending
with a succession of insensitive and overbearing service employees whose
efforts to "assist" her are more intrusive than helpful. This culminates
with her taking on the services a surly boatman who insists, against her
express wishes, on talking constantly, taking on unwanted passengers,
and, worst of all, mechanically directing her attention to all the
sights along the canals, "Turn your head this way--to the left--to the
right--now, wait one moment--look up at the bridge (ibid. 22)."

What makes this critique political, and not simply the sour musings of a
disillusioned aesthete or tourist, is the story's ending. There Mansfield
links the perils of ideational language with the illusory promises of
the vote. After escaping the obnoxious

boatman's clutches, the narrator retreats to a meadow where she hopes
finally to view Bruges through her own unaided eyes. No sooner does she
start to examine the landscape around her, however, than an old school
acquaintance, Betty Sinclair, and her recently wed husband--both of
whom have their heads bent over the very same guidebook she has just
abandoned--impose themselves on her:

"Katherine! How extraordinary! How incredible after all these
years!" cried she. . . . "Where are you staying; have you been
here long? Oh you haven't changed a day--not a day. I'd have known
you anywhere." She beckoned to the young man, and said, blushing
as though she were ashamed of the fact, but it had to be faced,
"This is my husband." We shook hands. He sat down and chewed a grass
twig. Silence fell while Betty recovered breath and squeezed my hand. "I
didn't know you were married," I said stupidly. "Oh, my dear--got a
baby!" said Betty. "We live in England now. We're frightfully keen on
the Suffrage, you know." Guy removed the straw. "Are you with us?" he
asked, intensely. I shook my head. He put the straw back again and
narrowed his eyes. "Then here's the opportunity," said Betty. "My dear,
how long are you going to stay? We must go about together and have long
talks. Guy and I aren't a honeymoon couple, you know. We love to have
other people with us sometimes." [. . .] "Unfortunately I have to go
home quite soon. I've had an urgent letter." [. . .] "But the quaint
streets and the Continental smells, and the lace makers--if we could
just wander about--we three--and absorb it all." I sighed and bit my
underlip. "What's your objection to the vote?" asked Guy. [ . . . ]
"I always had the idea that you were so frightfully keen on the future
of women," said Betty. "Come to dinner with us to-night. Let's thrash
the whole subject out. You know, after the strenuous life in London,
one does seem to see things in such a different light in this old-world
city." "Oh, a very different light indeed," I answered, shaking my head at
the familiar guide-book emerging from Guy's pocket. [<I>SS</I> 23-4]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although it might seem surprising at first that the story's independent
young narrator, who travels by herself across Europe, should be so cool
towards Betty and "the suffrage," she makes the grounds of her contempt
clear by linking both with the discredited guidebook. Whereas the narrator
has come to distrust the abstract language of the guidebook--regarding
as specious its promise to provide a more satisfying and authoritative
knowledge of her surroundings than she can achieve on her own--Betty
remains its dupe, just as she also remains the gull of a woman's suffrage
movement that makes equally abstract pledges on behalf of the vote. She
has na&iuml;vely entrusted her gaze to this seductive text and gushes
blithely about "quaint streets" and "Continental smells" of which she
obviously has no first-hand knowledge.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This disabling delegation of authority to the guidebook parallels Betty's
equally crippling delegation of feminist agency to women's suffrage
organizations. Betty clearly believes that in order to be "keen on the
future of women" one need only place one's trust in the suffrage cause,
that voicing support for the vote will cure gender inequality and other
feminist concerns far more quickly and effectively than any individual
acts of her own. But as Mansfield is at pains to demonstrate, just as
the abstract language of the guidebook leaves its readers fundamentally
ignorant of Bruges, so too does Betty's voluble talk about the vote
leave her unenlightened as to her own continued enslavement to gender
conventions and male dominance. Excepting her attachment to the

<B></B>

suffrage cause, she could not be more captive to custom. She has a young
child, enthuses about lace, and bubbles over with sentimental prattle
of a stereotyped "feminine" nature. Above all, she remains unable to
imagine a role for herself outside her marriage. When Betty proposes
that she and the narrator "go about together and have long talks," it
never occurs to her not to include her husband Guy. She ironically takes
pride in the fact that she and Guy "love to have other people with [them]
sometimes," not realizing just how much such a comment reveals about her
lack of independence. Similarly, when she talks about her enthusiasm for
"the Suffrage," she always does so using the pronoun "we," as he uses
"us," as if the cause were as much her husband's as her own.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The contrast between Betty and the narrator is particularly instructive
in outlining the grounds of Mansfield's critique. The story ends by
establishing a sharp contrast between two kinds of feminism, each shaped
by a different approach to language. The first is of the type espoused
by Betty. It is more a matter of talk than deeds, of having "long talks"
about the vote and "thrash[ing] the whole subject out" over dinner. The
second is quietly exemplified by the narrator, who has rejected not only
mediated knowledge and agency, but also all idle speech. The narrator may
never identify herself as a feminist, but it is clear from Betty's shock
that she does not support the vote and by her fiercely independent actions
that the narrator not only has a well-established reputation for feminism
but that she also acts on her beliefs. By traveling alone, rejecting
the authority of the guidebook, and refusing to be intimidated by Guy's
"intense" questioning, she demonstrates that she will cede her autonomy
to no one. What is more, her reluctance to give expression to her views
or idly engage Betty in conversation attests to the deep seriousness of
her commitments. In contrast to Betty's ceaseless shallow conversation,
which is regularly punctuated by such empty phrases as "you know" and "my
dear," the narrator's silent nods and terse statements bespeak a refusal
to trivialize her feminist principles, to substitute talk for action.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By criticizing women's suffrage in these terms, Mansfield contributed
in fundamental and heretofore unrecognized ways to the development of a
new antistatist political culture. As with her criticisms of the German
social ideal, her antidiscursive stories are an aesthetic elaboration
of the political commentary of unlikely modernist forebears Chesterton
and Belloc, whose criticisms of representative government, like their
critiques of state regulation, played a key role in fostering a climate of
hostility to Fabian socialism. In 1909, two years before "The Journey to
Bruges" and "Being a Truthful Adventure" appeared in <I>The New Age,</I>
Chesterton criticized parliamentary politics--in terms later taken up by
Mansfield--for being overly abstract, insufficiently grounded in immediate
experience. As someone who believed that property was the foundation of
all power, he contended that Fabian faith in the efficacy of democratic
political reform was fundamentally misguided. In his view, electing a
socialist majority to Parliament would not lead (as many Fabians supposed)
to the "taking away of the private fortunes" of capitalists. Instead,
it would result in these same financial oligarchs, through the influence
of their wealth, continuing under a socialist guise "to manage our yet
more concentrated affairs." He wrote, "A small, rich, and generally

<B></B>

trusted class . . . are the masters of England; they will probably be
the masters of any big political reform, including Socialism; they will
be the masters, because they will be the paymasters."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
  Later, in 1911, Belloc expanded these arguments in <I>The Party
  System,</I> a book he coauthored with Chesterton's disaffected Fabian
  socialist brother Cecil. By affirming in her fiction that the vote
  was largely substanceless, Mansfield lent support to Chesterton and
  Belloc's arguments that, until socialists, laborers, and other enemies
  of plutocracy directed their attention to the foundation of capitalist
  power (property and money), any electoral victory won by Fabians
  or laborers would be purely illusory--the victory of "inapplicable
  theoretic abstraction."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In a similar manner, Mansfield implicitly supported Orage's calls
for greater labor emphasis on strikes. Her rejection of the vote and
encouragement of the direct seizure of sociopolitical independence by
women was an extension of his efforts to encourage greater self-reliance
among the working classes. As early as 1910, Orage had argued that
organized labor did not have "anything whatever to gain by being in
politics at all." He wrote,

Calling attention to the steep decline in wages that had coincided with
organized labor's entrance into party politics--much as Mansfield would
later call attention to the feminist backsliding that attended women's
involvement in suffrage politics--he advocated direct action in the form
of strikes. "The governing classes are infinitely less afraid of the
working-man's vote than of his strike," he declared, a point that would
only grow in significance over the next year as wildcat work stoppages
rocked Britain, terrifying capitalists and revealing fault lines between
government and rank-and-file laborers that <I>The New Age</I> regarded
as the promising beginning of a new, worker-led form of socialism and
industrial reorganization.

As important a role as Mansfield's antidiscursive stories played
in the early foundation of guild socialism, they performed an even
more pronounced part in the continued propagation of individualist
feminism. Like her critique of the German social ideal, Mansfield's
critique of the vote is inextricably linked to the now critically
underappreciated but at the time path-clearing model of feminist politics
practiced by Hastings, who in conjunction with Mansfield's fictional
endeavors, developed a modernist and libertarian-tinged strain of feminism
that has mistakenly been thought to have been the sole creation of Dora
Marsden. Beginning in 1909, when Marsden was still a loyal member of
the Women's Social and Political Union, Hastings criticized suffrage
politics--in a manner that Mansfield later embraced--for being every bit
as disconnected from immediate, individual experience as conventional
party politics. Under the pseudonym D. Triformis, one of several names
under which Hastings wrote to give the illusion that her views were held
by a critical mass of contributors, she

<B></B>

mocked the leaders of the W.S.P.U. for promising, "in an orgie of
chimerical benevolence," that the vote could protect "married women
from rivalry" and provide for a "regular lien on the wages" of their
husbands. While she admitted that "the position of all women would be
improved by the removal of the sex disability in politics and that the
vote [was] a symbol of the moral restoration of womanhood," she denied
that the vote was anything more than a symbol. "Decidedly we object to
the illusory hopes held out to the married woman that when such women as
pay taxes shall have the vote the conditions of marriage will change for
the better," she asserted. "The million and a half future women electors
could not honestly promise any change at all, even if this million and
a half were all bent in the same direction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like Mansfield, Hastings criticized suffrage politics for leaving its
adherents fundamentally unaware of their own continued submission to
gender conventions and male dominance. In a 1909 letter to the magazine
under the pseudonym "Beatrice Tina," the name she used to publish her
notorious feminist polemic <I>Woman's Worst Enemy--Woman</I> ,
she argued, "Some of the leading suffragists who hail Mary Wollstonecraft
as their model would cut that free-living woman dead if they could meet
her to-day in a social gathering."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
  Later, in 1910, she claimed that the leaders of the W.S.P.U. were more
  concerned with the reactionary strengthening of the bonds of marriage
  than they were with freeing women from custom and convention. In her
  view, the "payment of wives by individual men," the most ill-considered
  and unrealistic of the organization's promised reforms, was "a revolting
  idea." Far from being a possible step towards greater liberty for women,
  it was merely "a further scheme for protection." Until women took
  it upon themselves to assert their independence--a point emphasized
  by Mansfield in her fiction--the vote would accomplish nothing for
  them. To the plea that "the world is hard upon woman," she responded,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

The world is not hard upon women: women are. Women make the conventions
which are more cruel and rigid than any man-made laws. . . . Until
domestic women themselves perceive their folly, their degradation,

more intellectual suffrage societies had better avoid them and their
plaintive petitions and charters.

Finally, in order to gauge the full extent of Mansfield's identification
of her early fiction with individualist feminism, the formerly
unremarked parallels between her fiction and the feminist polemics
of Women's Freedom League founder Teresa Billington-Greig must be
disclosed. In January 1911, in a major coup for Hastings and Orage,
"Truculent Teresa" quit the W.F.L., a splinter group of the W.S.P.U., and
published in <I>The New Age</I> the first fruits of her long-simmering
discontent with the women's suffrage movement. These scathing articles,
which later formed the basis of her celebrated treatise <I>The Militant
Suffrage Movement--Emancipation in a Hurry</I> , lent authority
to Hastings's longstanding criticisms. Billington-Greig claimed, as
Mansfield shortly would, that the W.S.P.U. had betrayed the cause of
feminism, that in its exclusive pursuit of the vote it had forsaken
more fundamental fields of feminist endeavor. She also contended that
"feminist rebels" had initially rallied to the W.S.P.U.

<B></B>

because they found in the organization's "abandonment of the worship of
propriety" an "aggressive proclamation" of "the right of insurrection"
and "the right of self-government." But now that the W.S.P.U., in its
haste to acquire the vote, had reached out for the support of those
respectable, tax-paying women who would be most likely to benefit from
any initial reform of the franchise, the organization had succeeded only
in reducing itself to something "quite commonplace and conventional"--"a
movement of political revivalism." In commentary that could almost have
served as a blueprint for Mansfield's criticism of Betty in "Being a
Truthful Adventure," Billington-Greig argued that the W.S.P.U. sought to
"impose a yoke of emotional control" and "mental and spiritual slavery"
on its members that corrupted the entire suffrage cause.

ordinary self-subjection of women to men, to which it bears a close
relation. The yoke is imposed by a mingling of deliberately worked up
emotion, by the exercise of affectational and personal charm. . . . As
with all emotional degradation its victims glory in it. Every woman
snared ensnares her fellow and adds the weight of her obsession to the
burden upon the minds of the rest.

In sum, her comments confirm that Mansfield's criticism of suffrage
politics does not stem solely from personal experience--as the very
title of "Being a Truthful Adventure" might suggest--but arises within
and belongs to the most important antisuffrage critiques of the period.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Prewar British modernism poses a dilemma to those who wish to link
its multifarious aesthetic experiments to a readily identifiable set
of political affiliations. While it is not obviously conservative in
outlook, neither is it identifiably leftist, liberal, or of the radical
right. Scholars who attempt to place early modernists in any one of these
camps are usually compelled to ignore evidence to the contrary. Mansfield
poses particular problems in this respect. Not only is she often not
properly admitted to be a modernist at all, but the tensions that are
manifest in her fiction rarely seem ideological in any familiar sense. If
one views Mansfield's fiction in the critically neglected intellectual
context of <I>The New Age,</I> however, it is possible to begin to
resolve this long-standing conundrum of modernist scholarship. Doing so
demonstrates that prewar British politics frequently directed different
lines of division than we are accustomed to encountering today. Socialism
itself was more fluid and open to definition at the beginning of this
century than our Cold War derived notions of "left" and "right" have led
us to believe--or even enabled us to acknowledge. In short, her fiction
discloses that modernist literary culture was antistatist more importantly
than it was "left" or "right" in contemporary terms. In addition to
including variants that envisioned a powerful role for the state,
there also developed out of debates in <I>The New Age</I> an interest
in formulating an antistatist variant of labor politics. And feminism
was no less various. Thus, out of the debates in the magazine, there
emerged a variant of radical feminism surprisingly hostile to the vote.

Analyzing Mansfield's stories in the context of <I>The New Age</I>
provides strong, fresh evidence of the role that she played in the
politically charged formulation of modernist aesthetic doctrine. It
uncovers the crucial part her fiction played in the critical overturning
of the politics and aesthetics of Fabian-affiliated literary titans
Shaw, Wells, and Bennett and its anticipation of later arguments of
Woolf and Marsden. Revealing that her fiction was at the center of
heated discussions about labor organization, women's suffrage, imperial
policy, and the role of the state in modern government also exposes
her previously unanalyzed affinities with Chesterton, Belloc, Hastings,
and Billington-Greig. Above all, it demonstrates that Mansfield is an
insufficiently appreciated modernist pioneer.

See in particular Sydney Janet Kaplan's <I>Katherine Mansfield and
the Origins of Modernist Fiction</I> (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University
Press, 1991). Kaplan persuasively argues that "Her innovations in the
short-fiction genre (especially the 'plotless' story, the incorporation
of the 'stream of consciousness' into the content of fiction, and the
emphasis on the psychological 'moment') preceded Virginia Woolf's use of
them, and they have been absorbed and assimilated--often unconsciously--by
writers and readers of the short story" .

Pamela Dunbar, <I>Radical Mansfield: Double Discourse in Katherine
Mansfield's Short Stories</I> (Ipswich, Suffolk: Ipswich, 1997), x. Dunbar
rightly argues that this attitude has been further reinforced by "the
formation of an unofficial Mansfield canon which favours apparently
tranquil pieces like 'Prelude,' 'The Garden-Party,' and 'The Doll's House'
while neglecting other, more patently disturbing works" (ibid.).

contends that Mansfield "did not connect her understanding of alienation
and victimization with either a Marxist or a feminist political
analysis. . . . She did not articulate her social critique of human
suffering in recognizably political terms" (16-7).
