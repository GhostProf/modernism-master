<p>Raymond Williams tells a story about F. R. Leavis from their years teaching together at Cambridge. At a meeting in 1961 to consider a new course on the novel, Williams recalls that "There was one major argument . . . The crux was whether the paper should be the English novel, or the novel in general. [Leavis] wanted the English novel only. A majority were against him."<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> After Leavis rejects the inclusion of European novels, in part because of the difficulties of translation, a committee member poses a further question: "'Then what about American novelists? Faulkner, for example'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">LRI</span>, 117). Williams notes,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>At this point I have to hold onto my seat. I have the clearest memory of what was said next, and of the mood in which it was said: one of fierce pleasure in the argument but also of surprising conviction. "Faulkner!" Leavis said. "When the Americans moved in on Europe after the War, they had to have a great novelist. That's who they chose, Faulkner." Nobody knew, at the time, what to say after that.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">LRI</span>, 117)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">This is more than an opinionated dismissal of a major American writer. Rather, Williams's anecdote highlights the anti-Americanism that Leavis demonstrated from his earliest published work. While such sentiments might seem to participate in general anxieties about American cultural hegemony during the Cold War, Leavis's anxieties can be traced back in time to the interwar years.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> Moreover, rather than a decorative flourish layered upon deeper insecurities, this reaction to America resides at the heart of Leavis's theories of literature and culture.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Although Leavis's critics have largely overlooked his abundant references to <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  America, Leavis relies on the example of America, and upon transatlantic comparison, as a <span style="font-style:italic;">method</span> in his cultural analyses.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> He wields the term "Americanisation"—a rough synonym for standardization—in ways that reveal the national subtext of the "mass civilisation" that Leavis understands to menace interwar England. Leavis's position as the self-appointed guardian of Englishness, an image that persists in critical treatments of his work and legacy, is made possible by the transatlantic connections and reactions underlying his nationalist projects. While Leavis is remembered as guardian of the high, the elite, and the English, I will contend that these discourses are importantly produced by the twin processes of Americanization and transatlantic comparison.</p>
<p>It is telling that Leavis situates the American canonization of Faulkner within a European context. Leavis's image of the Americans "moving in" on Europe has a history in his writing, as well as in European thought, dating back to the period after the First World War. Indeed, his seemingly stark reaction takes part in a broader European dialogue about the transatlantic encroachment of the United States. While some in Europe perceived America as a beneficial new source of commodified pleasures such as jazz records, Hollywood films, and Ford motor cars, others saw these same commodities as a threat to European values and traditions.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Leavis shares this sense of threat, yet his attitudes are particularly revealing in their differences from those circulating in Europe.</p>
<p>Two prominent critics exemplify major, distinct styles of European reaction to the idea of Americanization between the wars: the Frankfurt School theorist, Theodor Adorno, and the French social commentator, André Siegfried. Adorno, who has often been seen as an "anti-American intellectual elitist," despite his long-time residence in the United States, famously lambasted both jazz and the popular cinema as symptoms of what he and Max Horkheimer called the "culture industry."<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Like Leavis, Adorno lamented the corruption of the arts into bland fare aimed at the capitalist "consumer."<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Yet whereas Adorno emphasized the value of the arts in both Europe and the United States, Leavis turned decisively to Englishness as the antidote to what he saw as a growing cultural malaise. Adorno's concern was for the fate of the arts themselves; Leavis's was for the fate of the arts <span style="font-style:italic;">in the service</span> of a nation.</p>
<p>Leavis thus shared much in common with European nationalists such as Siegfried whose interests were based more in politics than aesthetics. Siegfried's widely-reprinted and translated works, including <span style="font-style:italic;">America Comes of Age</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Europe's Crisis</span> , played on circulating fears that the United States might supplant Europe in worldwide stature and influence. In prophetic terms, Siegfried records the transition to American ascendancy: "To America the advent of the new order is a cause for pride, but to Europe it brings heart-burnings and regrets for a state of society that is doomed to disappear."<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Siegfried's "heart-burnings and regrets" reflect a belief that the economic strength of the United States, often emblematized in the re of Henry Ford, was setting the stage for the destruction of Europe's cherished values and traditions. Leavis details similar anxieties in the 1930s. Yet where Siegfried chronicles the inevitable spread of the American "new order" throughout Europe, Leavis turned to literary and cultural education to prevent its spread throughout Britain. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>At the time of Leavis's most energetic cultural criticism, anti-American fears were so profuse that they sparked a range of responses, sometimes from surprising quarters. For instance, the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci lamented the "anti-Americanism . . . of the European petty bourgeois" and wondered if Henry Ford's methods might be turned to socialist ends.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Ford's potential for socialism was taken with even greater seriousness in parts of the new Soviet Union, where workers had begun to celebrate Ford and occasionally to name their children after him.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Leavis, who consistently attempted to distance himself from both socialists and the bourgeoisie, did not share any hope for Ford's revolutionary potential. For Leavis, the primary ideology in need of adherence was Englishness.</p>
<p>In Leavis's conception, England was distinct from Europe in its particular vulnerability to the mass culture—from the talking films to the gramophone recordings—of the newly-powerful nation with which it happened to share a language. Leavis's project sets him apart from prominent European intellectuals not only in its fierce, English nationalism but also in its specific turn to education for protection against the impending tide of U.S.-based styles of labor and leisure. Indeed, Leavis's tremendous influence upon the formation of the modern discipline of English studies emerged in part through his analysis of modernization and especially Americanization. Leavis's feelings about America are thus not ancillary to the story of his development of English studies. Rather, they are at the heart of his particular project of developing English studies for the English, a project whose ramifications can still be felt in English departments around the world today.</p>
<p>Before turning to Leavis's work, it is worth noting that a further implication of Leavis's rejection of Faulkner follows from its curious anecdotal recovery by Raymond Williams. As the re in British cultural studies most often placed in opposition to Leavis, Williams actively worked against Leavis's high cultural ideologies, yet he has acknowledged the enormous influence of Leavis's pedagogical aims and methods. While Leavis has been variously called a "genius" and "the single most influential re in twentieth-century English literary criticism," he has also been accused of "damaging arrogance and skepticism" and dismissed tongue-in-cheek as a "curmudgeon."<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Leavis, in short, holds a highly contested yet undeniable place in the history of cultural studies, modernism, and the development of English as a discipline. In turning to his pedagogical writings, it becomes clear that Leavis's influential role in the development of English as a discipline follows from his desire to design a field of study that would save England from Americanization. Leavis's anti-Americanism has also had striking consequences for cultural studies in its influence upon Richard Hoggart's landmark 1957 text, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Uses of Literacy</span>. Leavis, it becomes clear, is not only quick to use American culture as a name for the modernization of England, but actually relies upon the example of America, as threat or prophecy, in his reactionary invention of Englishness and his attempts to teach it to the nation. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Threat of Americanization</h1>
<p>From his earliest publication, a pamphlet entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Mass Civilisation and Minority Culture</span> , later collected in <span style="font-style:italic;">For Continuity</span> , Leavis presents literature and society as mutually constitutive, leading him to make the claim, in all earnestness, that only literary criticism can save modern England.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Part Arnoldian lament, part Spenglerian paean to decline, Leavis's pamphlet announces the need for an educated elite, or a "minority," who can analyze literature fiercely enough to rescue England from popular fiction, advertising, and the burgeoning hegemony of Hollywood. In the pamphlet, Leavis draws his primary example of standardization and machine culture from "a remarkable work of anthropology," the 1929 <span style="font-style:italic;">Middletown</span>.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Yet the natives in <span style="font-style:italic;">Middletown</span> are not English but American.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> As Leavis defends his choice,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>To this someone will reply that Middletown is America and not England. And it is true that in America change has been more rapid, and its effects have been intensified by the fusion of peoples. But the same processes are at work in England and the western world generally, and at an acceleration.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">FC</span>, 17)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Here America is exemplary in the material sense: it is the embodiment of the modernization and progress that has also begun to transform England. Leavis thus presents the anthropological investigation of America as a prophetic glimpse into England's future. Yet it is a future which appropriate attention to America can forestall. Leavis explains, "It is a commonplace that we are being Americanised, but again a commonplace that seems, as a rule, to carry little understanding with it. Americanisation is often spoken of as if it were something of which the United States is guilty" , when in fact, it is that which British proponents of standardization and progress are likely to hasten. Leavis returns to <span style="font-style:italic;">Middletown</span> as a touchstone throughout his early writings; in <span style="font-style:italic;">Culture and Environment</span> , co-written with his former student Denys Thompson, he succinctly labels it "an account of the process of dissolution."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> At the same time, he juxtaposes <span style="font-style:italic;">Middletown</span> against one of his other key texts, George Sturt's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wheel-wright's Shop</span> , which Leavis wistfully analyzes as a tribute to the lost Englishness of the artisan's village.</p>
<p>It is appropriate that <span style="font-style:italic;">Middletown</span> should be held up against <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wheelwright's Shop</span>, because as Leavis makes clear in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mass Civilisation</span>, part of what marks the dissolution of middle America is the arrival of the automobile. In strong terms, Leavis recounts, "we see in detail how the automobile (to take one instance) has, in a few years, radically affected religion, broken up the family, and revolutionised social custom" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FC</span>, 16). The problem of the automobile reappears emblematically at the end of <span style="font-style:italic;">Mass Civilisation</span> in a discussion of Henry Ford. Ford's matter-of-fact discussion of a future world ruled by machines—"Shall we not some day reach a point where the machine becomes all powerful, and the man of no consequence"—concludes that one "need not bother" about the future (<span style="font-style:italic;">FC</span>, 46).<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> In defense, Leavis intones his hope "that what we value most matters too much to the race to be finally abandoned and that the machine will yet be made a tool" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FC</span>, 46). His rejection of Fordist philosophy, as well as what he <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  calls "the official Ford legend," does not lead Leavis, like so many writers in the thir ties, to embrace communism. Rather, in a striking ideological conflation, he explains that the paths of both Marx and Ford lead to the machine, and disavows any need to choose between them.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>In his tributes to Englishness, Leavis turns time and again to what he proposes as its opposite: the modernization and progress that can be seen most clearly in America. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Culture and Environment</span>, Leavis draws the example of America directly into his pedagogy. Unlike in his previous work, Leavis conceived <span style="font-style:italic;">Culture and Environment</span> as a text for teachers of high school and grammar school. Yet rather than detailing classroom methods, this work revisits a number of Leavis's chief cultural concerns, especially standardization and mass culture. <span style="font-style:italic;">Culture and Environment</span> explicitly presents "a literary education" as the "substitute" for all that has been lost: the English "folksongs, folk-dances, Cotswold cottages and handicraft products" that symbolize "the organic community with the living culture it embodied" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 1). What threatens the younger generation is not that they will lose their connection to the organic past of English Cotswold cottages—for such a thing is already gone—but rather that they will forget to be properly nostalgic for it. The most direct way to inculcate them with Englishness is to help them define themselves against the worst, and thereby most modern, traits of the Americans. Leavis's attempts to educate via the exercises in <span style="font-style:italic;">Culture and Environment</span> reveal his rative reliance upon America even more clearly than <span style="font-style:italic;">Mass Civilisation</span>. It is an oft-told tale in colonial studies that Thomas Macaulay's 1835 proposal for civil servant examinations attempted to produce British subjects through literary study.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Yet while Macaulay turned directly to English literature, Leavis would train British school children into Englishness via the negative example of America. The study of literature is Leavis's life work, but his project of cultural preservation depends on the pedagogical value of America as an example.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Culture and Environment</span> thus does not dwell on literature but rather proffers a negative analysis of what Leavis calls civilization. To this end, it is divided into short analytic sections with titles such as "Advertising," "Levelling-down," and "The Use of Leisure." At the end of the work, in perhaps its most curious portion, Leavis and Thompson offer a series of exercises for use in the classroom. The genre of the school exercise is ideal for Leavis's purposes because it provides a vehicle for Leavis to reach and thereby to rescue the masses. Quite strikingly, these exercises do not tend to ask students to read or analyze literature; rather, they focus on modern and often explicitly American culture. The exercises themselves are for the most part extraordinarily over-determined, with only one suitable kind of response. For instance, Leavis asks students to compare "the 'Blues'" played on the radio with "complicated Elizabethan part-songs" sung in "educated homes" after supper (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 126–27), encouraging them to choose English music in the drawing room over debased American jazz on the wireless. Another exercise presents the Americans themselves for study: "'In fifteen years the American people have changed from essentially a home people to an automobile and movie people.' What other changes have accompanied that described here?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 127). As the ethnographic subjects most suited to Leavis's purposes, the "American <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  people" enter the exercise as a group familiar enough to consider and yet foreign enough to contrast to the English. Leavis's purpose rests on his dual conviction that English schoolchildren will generate a list of the changes wrought in the lives of modernizing Americans while viewing the Americans objectively, as if from a great distance, and thereby consolidate their Englishness.</p>
<p>Another exercise invokes the American ethnographic subject in even more telling terms. Leavis quotes from a 1928 travel narrative: "In spite of cars and radios the American peasant is still unbelievably in the backwoods; all his reading and writing and listening-in does not make him a whit more mentally up-to-date than the illiterate Spaniard, and leaves him far behind the country Frenchman."<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Asking the student to consider "what reflections on the nature of education are suggested by this extract" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 143), Leavis seems to hope that the student will be savvy enough to follow the implied argument that cars and radios do not lead the American peasant toward mental advancement. Curiously, the identification of the American worker as a "peasant" harbors connotations of the European class system, suggesting the extent to which the passage wishes to underscore a reversal: the American, commonly imagined to be up-to-date, is here a backwoods peasant, defined by the very vocabulary of feudalism. Indeed, as Leavis consistently demonstrates, technological progress and modernization are precisely what render the American culturally backwards and easily superseded by the "country Frenchman."</p>
<p>Not only Leavis but also his collaborators place considerable emphasis upon the Americanization of England. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Scrutiny</span>, Denys Thompson makes the observation that "If England is less Americanized than America, it is in the discreditable sense that less resistance to the advance of civilization has been developed."<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Thompson notes that England, ironically, is more vulnerable to Americanization than America itself, because its cultural elite has not become alarmed enough to mount a proper defense against such signs of civilization as advertising and Hollywood films. Speaking to an English audience, Thompson casts doubt upon "anyone who believes that this country is putting up a sturdy resistance to 'Americanization.'"<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> For Leavis, as well as for followers like Thompson, Americanization is the type of thing that can happen to England, because it is not tied to place, but to practices, modalities, and ways of being. Indeed, Leavis occasionally implies, not only England but also America itself might be saved from Americanization. Americanization thus cannot exactly be a process of national hegemony, nor can it be understood as the overlay of one culture upon another. Rather, Americanization, for Leavis, has become a special, exemplary name for modernization, one that is more concrete in that it harbors an example or referent to its process in its very name.</p>
<p>Thus although Leavis uses Americanization to mean modernization, the term retains the residue of its nationalist import. So the question urges itself again: if Leavis means standardization, why would he ever need the term Americanization? And if Leavis's utmost concern is with the fate of English culture, why the constant references to the United States? One answer is that Leavis has sensed, long before the Cold War debates about American hegemony and English decline, that definitions of modern English <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  culture depend upon understandings of American culture. Throughout his early work, Leavis reveals his investment in tracing how utterly transatlantic English culture threatens to become. As he implies via the exercises in <span style="font-style:italic;">Culture and Environment</span>, jazz on the radio has supplanted part-songs in the drawing room. The folk culture that Leavis cherishes, replete with all its homemade and quintessentially English signifiers—and English precisely because they are homemade, made-at-home, of the land itself—is now transformed into a mass culture that is marked not only by mechanization and mass dissemination but also by extra-national sources and flows. The idea of America helps to produce the idea of English culture for Leavis because the idea of America is that which must be negated—literally driven out of England—for English culture to survive.</p>
<p>Leavis's rhetorical assimilation of America into his definitions of Englishness has considerable implications for his presentation of class. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Culture and Society</span>, Raymond Williams is at pains to complicate charges of Leavis's elitism, stressing Leavis's position outside the class structure of university dons and highbrow literati. Leavis's middle-class upbringing in the town of Cambridge—his father ran a bicycle shop—puts him at odds with both Bloomsbury, which he openly denounced in his writing, as well as with the established faculty at Cambridge, where he was never truly institutionally supported. Williams applauds Leavis for attacking "the domination of the world of English by a small interlocking group" and for reducing "to its proper impotence the ordinary conception of a superior minority which happens to coincide with a particular social class" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CS</span>, 262). Yet attention to Leavis's invocations of America suggests that he marked class in England, that most important of categories to British cultural studies, in important and sometimes unnoticed ways by a transatlantic sense of national difference. That is to say, there is a way in which, strange as it may seem, Leavis's lament was that the working classes of England had given up their Cotswold cottages and village crafts and <span style="font-style:italic;">become American</span>. Interestingly enough, the designations American and English seem curiously mobile: T. S. Eliot, American by birth despite his British citizenship and ambiguous accent in the thirties, promotes Englishness while the English working classes, with their tastes in popular fiction and in cinema, seem to undermine it.</p>
<p>Leavis's particular style of distinction between Americans and Americanization is part of what permits him to assert confidently in his influential work, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Great Tradition</span> , "The great <span style="font-style:italic;">English</span> novelists are Jane Austen, George Eliot, Henry James, and Joseph Conrad."<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Of course, two of these four are not English by birth, though both James and Conrad were to an important degree anglicized.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> It has frequently been noted that two of the four are women, casting Leavis's introduction to the novel as the recuperation of a literary genre that had been taken less seriously in part because of its association with the feminine.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Yet it is also worth considering the two who are not English-born. While Leavis may have had his reservations about Faulkner, one of the small handful of high American modernists who was not for any length of time expatriate, he was quite happy to bring James into the fold. The easy inclusion of Conrad and James suggests again that it is not nationality as such but the mass cultural assault upon Englishness that Leavis would resist. Thus Leavis does not hesitate to recruit American modernists who represent high culture for the resistance to Americanization. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>For instance, Leavis was particularly devoted to Eliot's work early in the thirties, referring to Eliot as an "originator" among imitators in the late twenties and ultimately drawing on his criticism as well as his poetry.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Yet Leavis's admiration for Eliot was not always mutual. Leavis sent an early version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Mass Civilisation and Minority Culture</span> to Eliot for publication in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Criterion</span>. After sending Eliot a copy with requested corrections, Leavis was to receive no reply in return. <span style="font-style:italic;">Scrutiny</span> was soon founded, and Leavis ended up publishing his pamphlet in four sections therein.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> While he never abandoned his appreciation for Eliot, Leavis would turn his attention more fully to Lawrence, who held the kind of nostalgia for pre-industrial working-class Englishness that Leavis most admired. At one point, Leavis makes the claim that Lawrence has identified "the major, the inclusive problem of our time" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FC</span>, 138). To illustrate Lawrence's perspicacity, Leavis quotes from <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span>, in which Lawrence notes "a gap in the continuity of consciousness almost American, but industrial really" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FC</span>, 138). In his analysis of this particular quote, Leavis insists that "'industrialism' is only a subheading of the problem," which can be understood better by turning to the regional and national comparisons of Spengler's <span style="font-style:italic;">Decline of the West</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">FC</span>,138). While it does not account for Lawrence's canonization alongside the more experimental modernists like Eliot and Joyce, Leavis's fascination with Lawrence certainly aided Lawrence's literary reputation. Lawrence's feel for the English landscape and the horrors of industry ultimately allowed him to serve as the literary voice of Leavis's deepest concerns.</p>
<p>Not only did Leavis discuss writers now considered high modernists in his critical evaluations, but he also took on the issues that would come to define modernist poetics and prose. In "Joyce and 'The Revolution of the Word,'" a 1933 essay collected in <span style="font-style:italic;">For Continuity</span>, Leavis discusses the <span style="font-style:italic;">Work in Progress</span> that was to become <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span> with more than a few reservations. Chief among Leavis's laments is Joyce's free and neologistic play with the English language. To those who would support Joyce's rampant experimentalism, summarized by Eugène Jolas as Joyce's "right to audaciously split the infinitive," Leavis responds with tried patience: "as if any amount of splitting infinitives, mimicking the Master, pondering Gertrude Stein and E.E. Cummings and connoisseuring American slang, could revivify the English language."<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> In Joyce's hands, it seems, the English language has become insufficiently English. Yet rather than accusing him of Irishness, Leavis lights upon American poets, Stein and cummings, and American slang as the chief emblems of the Joycean assault on English. Leavis insists that the trouble with Joyce's work is that it is utterly international in scope, "a multi-directional flux" which compares unfavorably to Shakespeare's Englishness (<span style="font-style:italic;">FC</span>, 213). For Leavis in this moment, Shakespeare's Englishness emerges out of nothing less than Shakespeare's pliant use of an English language that was rich enough, in the time of the Renaissance, to enable Shakespeare to be possible. Shakespeare and the English language are thus mutually constitutive, each one enhancing and creating the other. Joyce, on the other hand, takes up neologistic word play and "American slang," thus betraying the English language through his attempts to exceed it. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Leavis and the Making of English Studies</h1>
<p>Although Leavis wrote copiously on the modernists, his solution to society's ills did not emerge directly from critical discussions of the writers or works themselves, but rather grew out of his plan for education. Specifically, Leavis championed the study of the English literary tradition through the development of English as a discipline in the university. Early in his career, Leavis began to link the need for educational reform with the development of literary study. In a 1932 essay, "The Literary Mind," Leavis notes, "To revive or replace a decayed tradition is a desperate undertaking . . . something in the nature of luck is needed; the luck, let us say, that provides a centre of stimulus and a focus of energy at some university. All that falls under the head of 'English'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FC</span>, 65). It is quite striking to note the faith that Leavis invests in the university in general and English in particular to put a halt to the decay of tradition. Because Leavis understood English to be the university discipline that would prepare teachers for the nation's schools—and Leavis did in fact inspire a number of university youths to become schoolteachers—he imagined English to have the potential to effect change throughout the culture on a massive scale.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Commenting on Leavis's influence on the development of English studies' uniquely grand ambitions, Perry Anderson notes: "Leavis commanded his subject, within his own generation. With him, English literary criticism conceived the ambition to become the vaulting centre of 'humane studies and of the university.' English was 'the chief of the humanities.' This claim was unique to England: no other country has ever produced a critical discipline with these pretensions."<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Anderson's sweeping claim for the grand, humanist pretensions of English studies reflects Leavis's utter confidence in the potential of English studies to transform the nation as a whole. While Anderson may exaggerate the uniqueness of the development of literary study in England, overlooking the importance of literary education in the British colonies and elsewhere, it is nonetheless the case that interwar England was primed for an intervention into national education in such a way as to make Leavis's ambitions possible.</p>
<p>In order to contextualize Leavis's radical pedagogical aims—and his desire to inculcate Englishness through literary study—it is necessary to consider the unusual educational climate in England after World War One. In 1918, Prime Minister Lloyd George gave a rousing speech at Manchester in which he pronounced that "an educated man is a better worker, a more formidable warrior, and a better citizen. That was only half-comprehended before the war."<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Lloyd George's speech reflected, in potent fashion, the pervasive sentiment in the culture that part of England's inadequacies could be seen by a comparison of German and English education. What is most interesting about Lloyd George's speech, however, is the extent to which his cry for "a more formidable warrior" led to the reform of English studies in the schools and the reinvention of literary education. At the time, humanist sentiment fostered the belief that the task of educating children in English literature would produce not only better citizens but also better soldiers. If Lloyd George's exhortation seems like little more than bluff political rhetoric, then it is worth noting the vim with which its precepts were followed in <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the next few years. On the same platform at Manchester, H.A.L. Fisher, the president of the Board of Education, emphasized the extent to which educational reform was centrally about class. Lamenting in political catchphrase that "the rich learn and the poor earn," Fisher called for a set of reforms which could counter the class divisions in an increasingly mechanized society .<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> While investigations of all subjects were carried out, the two reports on the teaching of English, George Sampson's 1921 <span style="font-style:italic;">English for the English</span> and the 1922 <span style="font-style:italic;">The Teaching of English in England</span>, generally known as the Newbolt Report, were among the most influential and enduring. For these were the reports that made a case for a new and humanizing approach to English, one that could renew the spirit of nationalism in England as well as restructure the nation.</p>
<p>Of the two reports, Sampson's is the more readable, if the less practicable. Above all, it is an exhortation to reform English education in the schools. Denys Thompson notes in a later preface to Sampson's book that English in the schools, before the two reports, was "a somewhat dull and mechanical affair" that treated mostly grammar and composition, with the occasional recitation of poetry.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> Sampson makes his case for the inadequacy of such educational methods by presenting the cultural situation as one of mechanization: "Modern mass-production does not require educated workers . . . the lift-man would work his switch no worse if he were quite illiterate and no better if he were a doctor of science."<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Education, according to Sampson, is misunderstood as preparation for the workplace. In an oft-quoted phrase, Sampson avers that "it is the purpose of education, not to prepare children <span style="font-style:italic;">for</span> their occupations, but to prepare children <span style="font-style:italic;">against</span> their occupations" (<span style="font-style:italic;">EE</span>, 27). Therefore, to return to the worker, "it is not as a lift-man that he is worth educating, but as a man. If the nation exclaims, 'What! All this education, and he only a lift-man!' it is uttering wickedness and stupidity: if the lift-man exclaims, 'What! All this education, and me only a lift-man!" he is uttering wickedness and doubtful grammar" (<span style="font-style:italic;">EE</span>, 24). Sampson's argument here tellingly gives the nation the ability to protect the worker through its attitude toward education. Sampson further insists that "English is by far the most important subject in elementary schools" (<span style="font-style:italic;">EE</span>, 34), themselves the most important for their ability to reach the greatest number. According to Sampson, the purpose of instruction in English is not to inculcate youth with grammatical rules but rather to transform society by preparing the masses <span style="font-style:italic;">against</span> their future occupations as machine operators or other caretakers of technology. Similarly, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Newbolt Report</span> poses the question, "What has English, and especially English literature, for the wayfaring man who misses the scholar's introduction."<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> While an answer is not immediately forthcoming, the report assures the reader that such an answer will involve "grave national issues" (<span style="font-style:italic;">TE</span>, 252).</p>
<p>In consequence of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Newbolt Report</span> and George Sampson's <span style="font-style:italic;">English for the English</span>, English pedagogy in the schools did indeed undergo strenuous reevaluation and change. While schoolchildren did not unanimously embrace Shakespeare and Donne as a lifeline to a lost Englishness, the appearance of English literary studies in its modern and current forms importantly grew out of the cultural climate that produced these reports. This reevaluation of pedagogy at the level of primary and secondary schools was roughly contemporary with changes of a similar sort at the level of the university. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Until the mid-nineteenth century, the study of English at Oxbridge, though not in Scotland, was largely philological, while Classics held sway as the traditional study of literature and aesthetics.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Although Classics fought for its place of prominence for some time, it could not fulfill the need for renewed nationalism as could English. Moreover, Classics could not speak to as broad a range of class positions nor prepare teachers for the changing primary and secondary classrooms. In the 1880s, the teaching of English was already on the rise, but it was associated with women's education and Mechanic's Institutes. Although the first professor of English at Oxford was appointed in 1904, the feeling of many there toward this new subject was expressed by a professor of theology who opined that English study was for "women" and the "second and third rate men who were to become schoolmasters."<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Leavis entered Cambridge University at a time when the Ph.D. was a recent and somewhat disreputable degree and English studies was still on shaky ground. While Cambridge had since 1883 offered a Litt.D., a doctorate based on the evaluation of published work, it did not introduce the Ph.D. until 1919. Leavis received the Ph.D. in 1924 and was mildly ashamed of having one. He even requested that the Ph.D. not be listed on the title-page of <span style="font-style:italic;">New Bearings in English Poetry</span> , insisting that it "would raise the worst suspicions, and, anyway, looks comic."<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> While Leavis may have been hampered by the indignity of holding a Ph.D., as well as by the newness of the discipline of English at an old university, he was also responsible for some of the most important changes to come to the teaching of English on the university level. As the discussion of <span style="font-style:italic;">Culture and Environment</span> has already revealed, Leavis saw education as the means to curb and counteract the effects of civilization in the form of industrial labor, popular fiction, cinema, and motor cars. In this way, Leavis's beliefs were concordant with those expressed in the reports of 1921 and 1922. Indeed, Leavis can be understood to posit an important ideological connection between the reforms in the schools and the creation of English as a discipline in the universities.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Because Leavis believed that the function of a university education in English was to produce schoolteachers who would inoculate children with Englishness, protecting them against the mass-produced pleasures and labors of the working class, he understood university English to participate vitally in his project of rescuing society through literary analysis. According to Francis Mulhern, Leavis saw education as the only way to change the environment, given that industrial progress could not be turned back.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> It might seem curious that Leavis therefore chose the study of literature and newly developing methods of literary criticism as the means to alter society. Yet for Leavis, literary criticism was in a certain sense the <span style="font-style:italic;">name</span> for this vast endeavor of societal change.</p>
<p>In his 1943 work, <span style="font-style:italic;">Education and the University</span>, Leavis explains that the English school at Cambridge "emancipated literary studies from the linguistic grinds."<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> With philology marginalized and Classics deemphasized, English is imagined as a new species of study, one that is neither rote nor mechanical and yet entirely relevant to the social situation of the modern moment. Leavis devotes an early portion of the text to a discussion of a theoretical work known as the Experimental College by the American educator, Alexander Meiklejohn. As Leavis quotes Meiklejohn, "Our first aim is not to <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  get liberal thinking done excellently but to get it done at all. In a word, we must recognize that the drift of American life is against those forms of liberal thinking which seem most essential to its welfare" (<span style="font-style:italic;">EU</span>, 22). Leavis's commentary is consonant with his early positions on modernity and America. He avers, "For 'drift of American life,' of course, we can read 'drift of modern life': American conditions are the conditions of modern civilization, even if the 'drift' has gone further on the other side of the Atlantic than on this" (<span style="font-style:italic;">EU</span>, 22). Once again, Leavis identifies America as exemplary of the progressive tendencies of modern civilization. Yet here Leavis expresses his hope that these modern tendencies can be curbed, if not entirely eradicated, by proper education. He notes that American universities bear the scars of modernization over English universities: "Even Harvard . . . appears to have suffered a great deal more from the last half-century of civilization than Oxford and Cambridge have done" (<span style="font-style:italic;">EU</span>, 28). This suffering can be counteracted by "liberal thinking" such as that found in the exercises in <span style="font-style:italic;">Culture and Environment</span>. It thus seems that Leavis's curiously transatlantic definition of liberal thinking is that which counters the drift of modern or Americanized life.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Consequences for Cultural Studies: The Case of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Uses of Literacy</span>
</h1>
<p>Leavis put such time and effort into writing about education, as well as into teaching itself, because he believed deeply that only educational reform could enact pervasive cultural change and that English was the only discipline to provide the means. Leavis's aims, however curiously condensed, were influential in the development both of literary criticism as a scholarly endeavor and of English as a central discipline in the humanities. Indeed, Leavis's work on teaching is the only aspect of his scholarship that Raymond Williams deems "wholly valuable" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 261). While Williams looks askance at Leavis's belief in members of the "minority culture" as the guardians of Englishness, he acknowledges Leavis's importance in the formation of both English and Cultural Studies at British universities, claiming that "<span style="font-style:italic;">Minority Culture and Mass Civilisation</span> . . . outlined a particular view of culture which has become very widely influential" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CE</span>, 252). Although it is true that Leavis has influenced English and Cultural Studies in ways that persist to this day, it is also true that Leavis was prophetic in his anticipation of styles of English reaction to American culture that would become full-blown by the Cold War. While the interwar years saw English uncertainty about the transatlantic shift in power, the years after the Second World War began to make plain the extent to which British imperial decline would be accompanied by the U.S.'s economic, militaristic, and mass cultural rise. In order to consider the ways in which Leavis was <span style="font-style:italic;">both</span> influential and far-seeing in his analyses of Americanization, it is worth turning to a different type of example, one drawn from the early development of cultural studies and the writing of one of its foundational res, Richard Hoggart.</p>
<p>Raymond Williams, E.P. Thompson, and Richard Hoggart are often considered the progenitors of cultural studies as it would become institutionalized and practiced in Britain.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Although Hoggart opened up the possibility for a new kind of academic practice when he founded the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the University <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of Birmingham in 1963, it was his first book, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Uses of Literacy</span> , that shocked many in England by proposing a new way of studying culture. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Uses of Literacy</span>, which Hoggart almost called, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Abuses of Literacy</span>, details the reading practices of the English working classes. Although <span style="font-style:italic;">The Uses of Literacy</span> considers the question of training the working classes in "critical judgement," it earned the disdain of many in mid-century English departments for seriously analyzing material other than literature.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> Attributing part of his inspiration for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Uses of Literacy</span> to the writings of Leavis and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Scrutiny</span> group, Hoggart notes the pleasure that came with his realization that "Leavisite methods . . . close analysis, listening to a text, feeling a text and its texture . . . were translatable into the study of popular culture" (<span style="font-style:italic;">UL</span>, 278). While Hoggart was capable of taking some working-class culture seriously, he was also sufficiently Leavisite to find aspects of mass culture from which the working class must be protected. In the example that follows from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Uses of Literacy</span>, the mass culture that menaces a segment of working youths is inextricable from the American culture industries—music and movies—that have produced it. This description of what Andrew Goodwin calls "Hoggart's notion of the working class as victims of American culture" reveals the way in which the nationalist definitions of culture presented by Leavis in the thirties permeated the foundations of postwar British cultural studies.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Leavis's influence can most clearly be seen in Hoggart's identification of "the juke box boys," a group of working-class youths who tend to read "comics, gangster novelettes, science and crime magazines" (<span style="font-style:italic;">UL</span>, 188). Encoded in the very name of the juke box boys is the music that entertains them: records that Hoggart notes are "almost all American" (<span style="font-style:italic;">UL</span>, 189). Hoggart describes these youths, who "spend their evenings listening in harshly-lighted milk-bars to the 'nickelodeons,'" as "boys aged between fifteen and twenty, with drape-suits, picture ties, and an American slouch" (<span style="font-style:italic;">UL</span>, 189). This is a curious description of a segment of the English working-class. It Americanizes not only their reading habits but their very corporeal style. As Andrew Goodwin has remarked, "is the British slouch then a superior posture"?<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> It seems that for Hoggart, an English or even a British slouch will not do, because the juke box boys are marked on a bodily level by their yearnings for American culture. In an even more pointed description, Hoggart observes that "the young men waggle one shoulder or stare, as desperately as Humphrey Bogart, across the tubular chairs" (<span style="font-style:italic;">UL</span>, 190). Here one must ask what it means for these markers of American culture to appear in the juke box boys' "stare" or "slouch." While Leavis indicted the working classes in their choice of popular entertainment, Hoggart suggests that their very bodies are disciplined and transformed by their fantasies of American culture. As Hoggart surmises, "Many of the customers—their clothes, their hair styles, their facial expressions all indicate—are living to a large extent in a myth-world compounded of a few simple elements which they take to be those of American life" (<span style="font-style:italic;">UL</span>,190).</p>
<p>In terms strikingly similar to those of Leavis, Hoggart distinguishes between the United States and the "myth-world" of Americanization. Particularly interesting is the way in which Humphrey Bogart's characteristic manners and "stare" take part in this mythos. Disseminated by Hollywood, Bogart's style was imitated in America <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  much as it was in England. Like Leavis, Hoggart makes clear that it is not the lived experience of Americans but the mass cultural processes of Americanization that pose the threat. In the end, Hoggart's indictment of the juke box boys—he calls them "the directionless and tamed helots of a machine-minding class" (<span style="font-style:italic;">UL</span>, 191)—embeds his references to American styles of leisure and habit within the more familiar picture of the modernization of England. Certainly, Hoggart is remembered for his work on mass culture in England and not for his occasional references to American music and film. Yet Hoggart's brief discussion of the juke box boys reveals the permeability of the concepts of mass culture and American culture and the easy ideological slippage from one to the other. Hoggart's central contribution to British cultural studies is of course his analysis of <span style="font-style:italic;">British</span> culture, yet it is revealing to discover this transatlantic stylization of the working-class, on the model of Leavis's thirties writing, in Hoggart's earliest and best-known work. While Hoggart acknowledges Leavis's influence in both inspiration and method, careful attention to the resemblances between Leavis and Hoggart reveals cultural studies, as well as English studies, to be predicated on a style of Englishness that would resist its own transatlanticity.</p>
<p>Terry Eagleton notes that Leavis not only influenced cultural studies, but that his importance to English literary studies is so fundamental as to be taken for granted. As Eagleton puts it, Leavis's reading practices, cultural ideologies, and intellectual mission have been absorbed into "the bloodstream of English studies in England" and "become a form of spontaneous critical wisdom as deep-seated as our conviction that the earth moves round the sun."<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> While many critics will attest to Leavis's centrality to the development of English studies in England, the transatlantic dimensions of his writings have less frequently been probed. Yet by turning our attention to Leavis's use of the example of America, it is possible to see how his influential development of pedagogical methods and English studies emerged in part through his repudiation of Americanization. Despite Leavis's commitment to developing, among the English working classes, a literary sensibility tenacious enough to protect them from jazz and Hollywood, Leavis's theories ultimately spread beyond the British Isles, contributing to the rise of American New Criticism. Indeed, the impact of his development of English into a core discipline of the humanities, as well as his commitment to close reading, can still be felt in the United States today. It is thus perhaps the greatest irony of Leavis's legacy that English studies in the United States emerged in part out of an intellectual project that defined itself, and the literary culture poised to rescue England, against the example of America.</p>
