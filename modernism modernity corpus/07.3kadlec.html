When Zora Neale Hurston published her now-celebrated novel, <I>Their Eyes
Were Watching God,</I> in 1937, a handful of critics objected to its
feathery characterization of rural southern African Americans. Richard
Wright was among those who urged Hurston to attempt a more "serious"
and politically responsible portrayal of black life in America; and Alain
Locke advised her to tone up her "surface[y]" "folklore" narratives with
hard-hitting "social document" techniques.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  It would be a stretch to suggest that Hurston turned to the Federal
  Writers' Project in 1938 in an effort to answer Wright's and Locke's
  appeals to social realism and the gritty substance of the modern
  document; the production of a federally subsidized tour guide can
  hardly have been the sort of social project that her critics had in
  mind. Still, it was in her position as an editor of the American Guide
  Series book, <I>Florida</I> , that Hurston first came to try her
  hand at documentary writing. Her contributions to the Florida guide are
  scant, but they are characteristically complex. The "Negro spirituals
  and secular tunes" that she recorded and transcribed for <I>Florida</I>
  may not be as "authentic" as they seem; and their uncertain status as
  documented "folk" materials suggests that, despite the progressive
  efforts of many who participated in the Federal Writer's Project,
  Hurston's conceptions of "culture" clashed with the varieties of culture
  fostered by the governmental documentary projects of the late 1930s.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The state and regional guides produced by the Federal Writers' Project
did more than feed and clothe writers during the Depression. They also
promoted new varieties of national pride during a decade rife with
radical political sentiment. As the art historian and theorist John Tagg
has noted, the liberal Roosevelt

<B></B>

administration compiled its massive factual and photographic archives
in an effort "to retrieve the status of Truth in [liberal governmental]
discourse." This "Truth" status had been "threatened by crisis," and its
"renegotiation was essential if . . . national and social identities
[were to be] resecured" in a manner that served both corporatist and
state interests.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  As part of a widely praised effort to provide a documentary "roadmap
  for the cultural rediscovery of America from within," the 378 books and
  pamphlets of the American Guide Series provided more than a compilation
  of the "raw cultural material" of myth and fact.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  They also functioned as the popular literary vanguard of a project
  that shaped radical dissent toward the imperatives of liberal reform.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The publications of the American Guide Series served both informational
and commercial purposes. Richard Wright's "sociological" contributions
to the Illinois project, for example, laid a groundwork for the stories
that he later published in <I>Uncle Tom's Children.</I> The gap between
the informational and commercial directives of the Federal Writers'
Project can be measured in the interval between the Guide Series'
Florida and Alabama projects. Hurston had traveled extensively through
these contiguous states when she gathered data for her studies of rural
southern African American culture in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and
the divergent Alabama and Florida guides therefore offer an apt index
of the imperatives that bore down upon the native Floridian who later
undertook government-sponsored documentary work. Although Hurston did not
participate directly in the making of the 1941 Alabama guide, this book
does list Hurston's <I>Mules and Men</I>  among its bibliographical
sources, and it contains a short but notable account of Cudjo Lewis,
the recently deceased African slave from the Mobile area whom Hurston
had interviewed for her as yet unpublished book-length study, "Barracoon."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of the two southern state guides, the Alabama guide is renowned for its
unsentimentalized portrayal of the Deep South's violent settlement. The
Roosevelt scholar William Leuchtenburg, for example, singles out the
Massachusetts and Alabama state guides for their exemplary historical
analysis and writing. "Though the [Guide Series] writers labored
under some constraints," Leuchtenburg claims, "their comments could be
unsparing." Offering an example of such sharp commentary, he praises the
Alabama guide's account of the disappearance of the state's "indigenous"
peoples:

In remarking on a site where the Colonial Dames of America had placed a
marker on the triumph of Civilization over Savagery, the authors of the
Alabama guide observed: "Here, in 1802, was negotiated one of the series
of treaties by which the United States absorbed the Choctaw lands at a
price of one broken promise per square mile."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not surprisingly, the guide's authors are more muted on the subject of
the ongoing strife between whites and blacks in Alabama. To their credit,
however, they do acknowledge that mutual racial "antagonism" had been a
feature of Alabama's history; and they discuss the rise of racist groups
including the Ku Klux Klan during the state's "Reconstruction" years.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Florida guide, by contrast, is little remembered for its documentation
of southern history. In this guide, Florida's history and culture are
introduced and discussed as a kind of currency for the contemporary
tourist trade. The southernmost state is a place not of anguished
monuments but of simulacra: its "palm-thatched" "Indian villages" and
"tribal flags" have been "hoisted" quickly in an effort to lure passing
motorists. In Florida, history is written first on profligate "highway
signboards." According to the guide, the doubtful "Seminole names" that
adorn these signboards "are more numerous and widespread . . . than are
the living members of the race. . . . The Indians themselves have made
the most of one profitable name. Since they discovered that the story
of Osceola is popular among tourists, that fiery war chief has acquired
many descendants, and most of the present-day Osceolas display their
names along the Tamiami Trail."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
  With its frank discussion of the state's self-fashioning as a tourist
  haven, and with a large proportion of its pages outlining tours for
  the modern sightseer, the <I>Florida</I> guide plainly functions as
  a subsidized lure to visitors.

The difference between the informational Alabama book and the more
openly commercial Florida guide is apparent not only in the contrast
between their respective treatments of regional history but also in
the guides' photographic illustrations. The Alabama guide features
stark photos of the state's power plants, coal miners, and white and
black sharecropper families; and these pictures are attributed to the
then-celebrated "social" photographers--Dorothea Lange, Marion Post,
Arthur Rothstein--who took them for the Farm Security Administration in
the mid- to late-1930s (. <A HREF="7.3kadlec_1.html">1</A> and <A HREF="7.3kadlec_2.html">2</A>). The neighboring Florida guide, on
the other hand, is sprinkled with mostly unattributed portraits of gardens
and golf courses, well-posed Seminoles, and turtle fishermen who decorate
idyllic beaches ( <A HREF="7.3kadlec_3.html">3</A>). Even the federally sponsored FSA photos that
appear in the guide serve to distance Florida from nationwide political
and economic concerns. Attributed to sponsoring agencies rather than to
the witnesses who breathe behind governmental lenses, the Florida photos
depict well-groomed laborers who seem unburdened by economic hardship
and environmental corrosion (. <A HREF="7.3kadlec_4.html">4</A> and <A HREF="7.3kadlec_5.html">5</A>). Florida may well have been
a prettier place than Alabama, but in the Florida guide, the call for
popular support for initiatives such as rural electrification and farm
subsidies gives way to the siren call of tourism.

In <I>Florida,</I> not just history and industry but also the arts revolve
around tourism. Apart from Hurston, the best-known contemporary writer
to have contributed to the guide was Wallace Stevens, whose praise of
lush, dewy Florida appears in a section on "Florida Literature." Stevens
labored as an insurance executive in Hartford, Connecticut, but here he
qualifies as a Florida writer because, like many other "poets" who have
been "aroused" by the southernmost state, he was "a regular visitor"
(<I>FL,</I> 147). In a tribute to winter getaways, the Florida guide
reprinted the following lines from Stevens's "Nomad Exquisite":

The tourist Stevens, we are told in the book's "Preface," graces the
pages of the Florida guide courtesy of Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., publisher
of <I>Harmonium</I> . No such fanfare accompanies the appearance
of Hurston, whose influence as a folklorist can be felt in the series of
Florida work songs that appear three pages later. Hurston's unattributed
contributions to the Florida guide appear in a chapter on the "Music and
Theater" of Florida, and they consist of a series of "Negro spirituals and
secular tunes" (<I>FL,</I> 149). The first six of the seven fragments
of spirituals and secular songs included in this chapter are work
songs. These range from a rowing song attributed to Fernandina slaves
to chain gang songs that "illustrate the Negro's relief in rhythm":

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is a tightly compacted narrative to many of these song fragments,
but the guide's "Music and Theater" commentator is more concerned to
discuss their social function and form. In apparent conformity to the
directives that Sterling Brown issued as the Editor of Negro Affairs
for the Federal Writer's Project, these work songs are transcribed in a
manner that highlights not their phonetic divergence from "standard,"
or Anglo-American, forms of "English" but rather their distinctive
idiomatic and musical properties.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  Freed from the crippling imperatives of minstrelsy, these slight
  fragments begin to challenge traditional distinctions between "low"
  forms of folk expression and "higher" literary forms. The repetition of
  single lines and verses, for example, can convey nuanced expressive
  differences. In many of the work songs of the Florida Negro,
  the guide informs us, "contrast and embellishment are obtained by
  stress and accent in the tune, rather than by a change of words" (FL,
  151). A song that is made up of a single phrase, with different words
  italicized in each of its three repetitions, illustrates such expressive
  embellishment. The last of the seven song fragments reads as follows:

This excerpt is really more of a blues than a work song, and it is
noteworthy not only because it exemplifies Brown's progressive call
for "unmeasured" transcriptions of African-American oral material,
but also because it helps us to identify Hurston as the author of the
"Music and Theater" section of the guide. Moreover, there is a story
behind this fragment--one that tells us something about Hurston's
apparent frustration with the Federal Writer's Project and with the
larger aesthetic and commercial directives that fueled the production
of state guides like Florida's. (Even in their most progressive phases
under relatively enlightened administrators like Sterling Brown, and
also Benjamin Botkin who became the head of the FWP's Folklore division
in 1938, the American Guide Series books would ultimately remain the
instruments of the liberal government that produced them.)
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  As it happens, the genesis of the heart-disease lyric that caps the
  Negro "Music" of Florida is as questionable as the ancestry of the
  state's "signboard" Osceolas. This blues song may not be from Florida,
  and it may not even be a Negro folk song in the way that the guide
  presents it. By tracing the heart-disease lyric to potential urban
  sources that raise doubt regarding its "authenticity," however, we can
  use this so-called Florida folk song to understand the conceptions of
  racial and cultural identity that vexed and enriched Hurston's work
  as both a cultural anthropologist and a state documentarian.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hurston's discomfort with her roles as both an anthropologist and
a documentarian should surprise no one who is familiar with either
modern anthropology or with state-sponsored documentary initiatives of
the late 1930s. In America, at least, both efforts were fundamentally
liberal, which is to say that they worked toward the refinement of a
fundamentally racist status quo. To call the anthropologist Franz Boas,
who was Hurston's teacher, a "racist" is probably something of a cheap
shot. Few public intellectuals contributed as much to the repeal of
blatantly racist scientific and legislative initiatives as did Boas. In
the 1920s and 1930s, however, his progressive conceptions of "culture"
were institutionalized in ways that Hurston quietly resisted. Boas himself
used the relative "difference" of the Negro's physiognomy as a tool to
combat the scientific racialist belief that Europeans could be divided
into stratified races or "sub-species"; and this may have contributed
to Hurston's privately expressed belief that "white people could not be
trusted to collect the lore of others."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
  Despite her lavish tributes to "Papa Franz" in <I>Mules and Men</I>
  and then later in her autobiography, Hurston remained uncomfortable
  working under Boas's sponsorship, and she often endeavored to conceal
  her fieldwork in the rural South from the hands of meddlesome New York
  anthropologists affiliated with Boas. When she was interviewing Cudjo
  Lewis, the elderly Alabama farmer who claimed to be America's last
  surviving African slave, for example, Hurston conspired with Alain
  Locke and Charlotte Mason to keep the Boasian anthropologist Paul
  Radin from making contact with Lewis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
  Later, in 1940, she complained to the anthropologist Jane Belo of the
  burden that Boas's technical crew had placed on her Sanctified Church
  project in Beaufort, South Carolina. "Now

<B></B>

I went to work right away," Hurston wrote, "to lay the foundation for the
white men to come in to take the sound pictures. I think we had better
make them [the Church members] a present because they are not taking to
it any too kindly."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If Hurston was less than enthusiastic as a participant in the project
of cultural anthropology, however, she was by all accounts a thoroughly
noncooperative member of the Federal Writers' Project. As one of the
editors of the <I>Florida</I> state guide, Hurston is said to have spent
most of her time working on her novel, <I>Moses, Man of the Mountain,</I>
and doing fieldwork for a second FWP project, <I>The Florida Negro.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
  Modeled on <I>The Negro in Virginia,</I> a much-praised federal
  project headed by Roscoe Lewis and edited by Sterling Brown, <I>The
  Florida Negro</I> never quite coalesced as a historical or ethnographic
  document. Its rambling and sometimes bitterly polemical 200 manuscript
  pages remained unpublished until 1993, when they were recovered amid the
  late-century revival of interest in the literary Hurston. Importantly,
  however, several of the songs that made it into the <I>Florida</I>
  state guide also appear in <I>The Florida Negro.</I> Similarities in
  their formatting and in the commentary that surrounds them enable us
  to identify Hurston as the author of the "Music and Theater" section of
  the Florida guide. In <I>The Florida Negro,</I> for example, Hurston's
  distinctive voice rings clear when she discusses accent as an integral
  feature of "Negro blues songs."

The Negro blues songs, of which Florida has many fine examples, belong in
the lyric class; that is, feelings set to strings. The oldest and most
typical form of Negro blues is a line stating the mood of the singer
repeated three times. The stress and variation is carried by the tune
and the whole thing walks with rhythm.

The final sentence of this excerpt makes it clear that Hurston's
contributions to the 1939 Florida guide were written in concert with,
and perhaps even composed out of,

<B></B>

early versions of her "second" FWP project, <I>The Florida Negro.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For the "Folkore and Music" section of <I>The Florida Negro</I> and for
the more hastily composed "Music and Theater" section of the Florida
guide, Hurston collected, transcribed, and analyzed folk material as
a federal documentarian. As a member of the FWP, Hurston had in fact
procured a tape recorder from the government during a trip to Washington,
and she began carrying it with her as she collected folk stories and work
songs in Florida in the late 1930s. Hurston had traveled with recording
equipment before, but when she worked as an anthropologist in the late
1920s and early 1930s, she had been inclined to gather and record her
data from memory. She described her earlier song-collecting methods to
the folklorist Alan Lomax in 1935:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

I just get in the crowd with the people when they sing it, I listen
as best I can, then I start to join in with a phrase or two and then
finally I get so that I can sing a verse. Then I keep on till I learn
all of the songs with verses then I sing 'em back to the people till
they tell me I can sing them just like them and then I take part and
try it out on different people who already know the song until they are
quite satisfied that I know it, and then I carry it in my memory.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Now, however, with her 1939 government-issue recording device in tow,
she would appear to have been participating in the more empirical
documentary methods that were being championed by various government
agencies under the Roosevelt administration. (In 1939, she did make
a series of recordings for the Library of Congress and the Folk Arts
Committee of the WPA; and these recordings can be heard today in the
Library of Congress.)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It may be no accident that the federally sponsored and technologically
enhanced fieldwork that Hurston performed in 1939 and 1940 more or less
put an end to her work as a folklorist and anthropologist. She continued
writing novels and essays after 1940, perhaps in part because novels
and essays were always what she wanted to write most. None of these
writings won her as much acclaim, however, as her earlier book-length
anthropological studies and the so-called folklore fictions, <I>Jonah's
Gourd Vine</I> and <I>Their Eyes Were Watching God,</I> that she published
alongside them in the 1930s. If the mainstreaming of a documentary culture
in the late 1930s served to dampen Hurston's interest in fieldwork, it
may have been because the social realist and commercial directives that
lay beneath this aesthetic prohibited Hurston from representing Negro
"culture" in the way that she imagined it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The pithy song fragment that rounds out the Negro "Music" of
<I>Florida</I> is a case in point. For the visitor to the southernmost
state, the words "Love ain't nothing but the <I>easy-going</I> heart
disease" are indigenous words that should issue forth like dew, releasing
hymns from beholders like Wallace Stevens, who, even when vacationing in
Florida, remains, by the guide's lights, "one of America's best modern
poets" (<I>FL,</I> 147). But are these Florida lyrics? Here, Hurston
seems not to have used her Folk Arts Committee tape recorder in the way
that FSA photographers had used cameras to document Florida's culture
of migratory farm workers, citrus packers, and bean

<B></B>

canners. Rather, she drew these lyrics from an earlier anthropological
study of rural Southern African American culture. "Love ain't nothing but
the easy going heart disease" is the last stanza of a so-called social
song---"East Coast Blues"--that Hurston included in an appendix to
her 1935 study, <I>Mules and Men</I>:

Since most of her material for <I>Mules and Men</I> was taken from
migrant African American workers in sawmills, turpentine camps, and
phosphate mines in Florida and Alabama, "East Coast Blues" may not have
been the native Florida material that Hurston represented it to be in
the Florida guide. (The "East Coast" in the title may well refer to
Florida's Atlantic coast, but the song clearly describes an exile's
wish to return to a distant home: "I'm going where the chilly winds
don't blow.") But was this lyric even indigenous to the <I>rural</I>
southern African American culture that Hurston treated in all of her
Florida writings? Even this is not as clear as it would seem.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hurston's letters to Langston Hughes indicate that the very trope that
distinguishes the "East Coast Blues"--the lines that brand love a kind of
"heart disease"--should have been known to Hurston before she began her
first round of folklore gathering in the rural South in 1927. An urban
variant of the lyrics to this so-called social song

appears to have reached Langston Hughes in 1926 through the New York-based
blues popularizer W. C. Handy.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
  Handy, who began collaborating with the New York- and Washington-based
  poet in 1926, had published words and music to a couple of blues songs
  that may be related not only to Hughes's poetry but also to Hurston's
  Florida song, "East Coast Blues." One of the two Handy songs that
  appear to have contributed to Hughes's poetic rendering of the bluesy
  heart-disease trope was "Careless Love," published in 1926.

The striking similarities between Hughes's "Gypsy Man" of 1927 and
Handy's "Careless Love" and "Shoeboot's Serenade" of 1926 and 1915 do
not necessarily mean that Hughes's blues poems are derived from Handy's
blues lyrics. Hurston, who knew Hughes well in 1927, in fact claimed
that some of his blues poems were taken straight from the mouths of
urban blues musicians themselves.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
  If this is true, it is possible that the last stanza of "Gypsy
  Man" represents but one of numerous variations on a trope that
  echoed through both the rural South and the Harlem cabarets of the
  1920s. What is interesting about this particular lyric is that Hurston
  mentioned it in a letter written to Hughes at the outset of her first
  folklore expeditions in the rural South in 1927. As a Barnard-trained
  anthropologist, Hurston had had trouble "pass[ing]" among the workers
  whose culture she wished to study and record.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
  Beginning in 1927, Hurston began writing to Hughes that she was reading
  his poetry in order to break the ice and to gain credibility among
  her rural Southern subjects. She described the reception of Hughes's
  poetry in great detail in a letter written in the summer of 1928:

What Hurston is describing in this passage is improvisation. The Saturday
night "skinners," or cardplayers, are not only quoting stanzas of Hughes's
"Hard Luck" from memory, but they are also adding their own verses
to the poem that yielded the title of <I>Fine Clothes to the Jew.</I>
These rural southern workers' enjoyment of poems like "Gypsy Man" may
be due to the fact that Hughes's urban blues poems derived from some of
the same sources as rural songs like "East Coast Blues." In fashioning
love as a kind of heart disease, Handy and Hughes had very likely drawn
from the reservoirs that Hurston was now trying to tap.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
  In feeding the material of "Gypsy Man" back to the work camps, however,
  Hurston was "contaminating" this folk reservoir with urban African
  American art forms. The rural southern workers who taught her the
  lyrics to "East Coast Blues," then, conceivably could have improvised
  the closing verse to that song--"Love ain't nothing but the easy going
  heart disease"--in an echo to the urban influence of Hughes and Handy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The exact genesis of the love-as-heart-disease lyric that Hurston recorded
in the Florida state guide can probably never be ascertained. This is
not due to Hurston's carelessness as a folklorist but rather to her
understanding of what sort of work she was doing when she ventured into
the field. As she stated over and over, "Negro folklore" was vibrant
not because it was authentic or indigenous to any people or place but
because it was "<I>still</I> in the making."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
  It was not something to be documented but something to be done. As
  they were used by anthropologists and government archivists alike,
  cameras and tape recorders did not play much of a role in this sort of
  vital activity; and the documentary aesthetics that underlay even the
  best FWP projects of the late 1930s were fundamentally at odds with
  Hurston's efforts to place <I>process</I> at the root of identity. The
  documentation of people and places signified for Hurston only if the
  act of documentation itself became a kind of cultural activity. This
  notion was lost not only on the social realist writers who objected
  to her "surfacey" characterization

<B></B>

of rural southern African Americans in <I>Their Eyes Were Watching
God</I> but also on the federal folk who, in administering a New Deal
for American tourists, portrayed America's emerging culture as a dewy
thing to "behold."

For a careful and compelling study of the relationship between
government photographic projects and liberal reform initiatives during
the Roosevelt years, see Nicholas Natanson, <I>The Black Image in the
New Deal: The Politics of FSA Photography</I> (Knoxville: University of
Tennessee Press, 1992). Natanson argues that reform initiatives such
as farm subsidies, and the federal photography archives that served
them, served to perpetuate a fundamentally racist status quo. Farm
subsidies in the rural South, for example, reached qualified white
farmers at up to seven times the rate that they reached qualified black
farmers . The Farm Security Administration's photographic archive
played a role in the disproportionate allocation of federal funds
(69-71). Through the FSA, government photographs were commissioned
and displayed publicly in order to garner popular support for costly
relief programs. As Natanson shows, portraits of impoverished black
farmers were often omitted from public displays of FSA photographs (217,
226). Through such omissions, poverty was "raced" as a white phenomenon
by the New Deal administration. To Natanson's discussion of the racial
management of the FSA archive, I would add that commercial imperatives
such as tourism also contributed to the erasure of black subjects, and
to the attendant disproportionate allotment of federal relief, in the
1930s. Although in the final analysis commercial pressures were closely
bound to liberal reformist ones, a comparison of the photographs in the
touristy Florida guide with those in the more reform-oriented Alabama
guide suggests that these commercial imperatives were in some cases more
damaging than liberal political ones.

Benjamin A. Botkin replaced John Lomax as the Folklore editor of the FWP

folkloric traditions; see George Hutchinson, <I>The Harlem Renaissance
in Black and White</I> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press,

very activity of collecting runs counter to the idea of folklore as a
living tradition.

her native culture she could not be understood because of her Barnard
intonations. She couldn't gain people's confidence; the locals claimed
to have no idea what she wanted. When Hurston returned to New York,
she and Boas agreed that a white person could have discovered as

Hurston first articulated her antiessentialist conception of "Negro

it as a font of "gorgeous possibilities" and as a tradition that was
"<I>still</I> in the making" (Zora Neale Hurston to Langston Hughes,

this conception of folklore ten years later on the opening page of her
manuscript for <I>The Florida Negro</I>: "Folklore in Florida," she wrote,
"is still in the making" (Hurston, "Works-in-Progress," 875).
