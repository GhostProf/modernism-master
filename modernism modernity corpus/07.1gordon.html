Even among critics exploring the political stakes of Anglo-American
literary modernism--or, more narrowly, of Virginia Woolf's literary
production--Woolf's 1931 novel, <I>The Waves</I>, has been read
persistently as a highly aesthetic (and therefore apolitical) experiment
in the representation of consciousness.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
The much commented upon experimental nature of the text is, of course,
evident from its opening pages: the disembodied narrative voice of
the first italicized interlude, with its abstract and highly ral
description of an unlocatable landscape, gives way in the first chapter
to the cacophony of the personalized yet significantly indistinguishable
voices that emanate from within the unstable circumferences of individual
characters--or, perhaps more accurately, are attached to proper names
that designate different but overlapping spaces of enunciation. Yet
even as we immediately are confronted by the formal properties that
arguably constitute the apogee of Woolf's narrative innovation, the
opening interlude introduces a ral trajectory that draws us beyond
the purview of the aesthetic, narrowly conceived. Describing a seascape
at dawn, Wolff posits an original state of relative undifferentiation,
in which "the sea was indistinguishable from the sky, except that the
sea was slightly creased as if a cloth had wrinkles on it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 The sun rises and sunders this undifferentiated state; "the air," we are
 told, "seemed to become <I>fibrous</I> and to tear away from the green
 surface flickering and flaming in red and yellow <I>fibres</I> like the
 smoky fire that roars from a bonfire" (<I>W</I>, 3; my emphasis). This
 state of fibrous differentiation is, however, only momentary, for we
 immediately read that "gradually the fibres of the burning



bonfire were fused into one haze, one incandescence." This unity
is itself quickly qualified by the statement that this incandescence
"lifted the weight of the woolen grey sky on top of it and turned it to
a million atoms of soft blue" (<I>W</I>, 3). The opening interlude thus
frames the novel by drawing our attention to a conceptual movement from
undifferentiation to individualization to a renewed form of wholeness or
collectivity that is understood as a state of fusion that paradoxically
maintains or supports a constellation of discrete atoms.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is, broadly speaking, this trajectory that Michael Tratner takes
up in the chapter of <I>Modernism and Mass Politics</I> devoted to
<I>The Waves</I>. Arguing the need to resituate British literary high
modernism in the context of a variety of collectivist projects that were
widely influential in the early part of the twentieth century, Tratner
understands the text as an exploration of a politically Left collectivism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Tratner turns primarily to the group psychology of Gustave Le Bon,
 Sigmund Freud, and William McDougall as the historical frame within which
 to approach the tension between individualism and collectivism in Woolf's
 text. I, however, shall contend that the text identifies a different
 terrain upon which to explore structures of collectivity. Though Woolf
 is undeniably interested in questions of psychology, I shall argue
 that she elaborates her understanding of collectivity or community
 not preeminently in terms of the mind, whether of the group or the
 individual, but rather that she turns instead to the bodily categories
 provided by neuroscientific discourse.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 To that end, it will be crucial to interrogate the text's preoccupation
 with what it describes as "the raw, the white, the unprotected fibre"
 of the human nervous system and to explore the various registers in
 which this re functions (<I>W</I>, 178). As we have noted, the
 text's opening page inaugurates this re in a nonphysiological mode
 through the repeated description of the process of differentiation
 as one of increasing fibrosis. I will pursue the trajectory suggested
 by this initial interlude in arguing that the text quickly redeploys
 this naturalistic metaphor and takes a different sort of fibre, that
 constituting the human nervous system, as the context within which to
 explore a movement from differentiation to fusion, from individualization
 to the fashioning of collectivity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This situation of the human body as the term around which forces of
individualization and structures of collectivity circulate constitutes
three problematics--historical, literary critical, and theoretical. In
an historical frame, attention to the relationship between Woolf's
text and neuroscientific discourse provides a means of exploring the
interanimation of literary modernism and other, contemporaneous forms
of cultural production. Without discounting the linguistic and formal
experimentation that is a defining characteristic of modernist literature,
and of which <I>The Waves</I> is a key example, my analytic approach
draws attention to both literary and medical/scientific language's
particular material history. Given that language simultaneously operates
in different cultural domains whose borders are relatively permeable,
attention to specific signifying clusters (in this case, those associated
with the fibres of the human nervous system) will allow me to examine the
processes through which communitarian cultural formations are produced in
the interactions of discursive domains of literature and medical science.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 To the extent that instances of linguistic contamination or

<B></B>

cultural proximity are insufficient to establish relations of strict
and unidirectional historical causality, my approach seeks neither to
identify a determining historical context for Woolf's literary corpus
nor to adduce its sociological or historical conditions of possibility
or intelligibility. This is not to say, however, that I seek simply
to demonstrate the radically transformative effects of her literary
practice upon other forms of cultural practice. Rather, I will approach
the transactions marked by the traces of linguistic contamination
as indicating a space in which different cultural regimes come into
contact in a variety of ways. This attention to what I have called the
material history of Woolf's language provides a means of addressing
the sociohistorical relations in which her language is embedded and
of grasping those relations as more than a narrowly determining set
of conditions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Interrogating Woolf's nervous tropology in relation to contemporaneous
neuroscience extends and complicates, in literary critical terms, the
sort of historicist analysis practised, for example, by Tratner. Whereas
his reading convincingly draws out thematic continuities between the
novel and the work of various theorists of collectivity, including Harold
Laski, Leonard Woolf, and R. H. Tawney, attention to the text's engagement
of neuroscience makes <I>The Waves</I> legible as more than a literary
presentation of social problems that simultaneously find articulation
in other modes of intellectual work. Gillian Beer has argued that Woolf
"was fascinated by communities" and that "the deep value which she accords
to communality . . . has to do with her practice of writing out of the
mass and out of the body."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 My contention is that by conceiving of community through the bodily
 categories of neuroscience, Woolf theorizes not only possible forms of
 collectivity but also the mechanisms through which communitarian projects
 of the early twentieth century literally incorporate themselves. The body
 becomes, in this context, more than merely a re either for society
 or for those affective elements of experience that are markers of the
 intensely individual. In addition to its resonance in these ral
 registers, the body must be considered rather more literally, as it
 is constituted as the object of inquiry by a variety of increasingly
 prestigious bioscientific disciplines. By raising the question of the
 social body in this way, Woolf's text insists that we approach bioscience
 as a particularly powerful means of accessing and comprehending the
 individual bodies that communitarian projects inevitably seek to grasp as
 their objects. To the extent that <I>The Waves</I> asks us to consider
 how historically extant structures of collectivity are incorporated
 in their bioscientific grasp of individual bodies, it simultaneously
 demands that we theorize the communitarian implications of a body that
 resolutely refuses to be assimilated by the language and procedures
 of bioscience. In exploring this affective body, a body that opens up
 and exposes the interiorized, subjective space of the neuroscientific
 body, I attempt to re-mark the limit at which an ethical, communitarian
 impulse announces itself.

"Bright Arrows of Sensation" and the Habituated Body
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the opening interlude of <I>The Waves</I> frames the text's overarching
trajectory when it describes a movement from brute undifferentiation
to individualization to a renewed state of indifference in fusion,
the opening chapter takes up the first phase of that movement in a
psychological register. Commencing with a series of short declarative
sentences conveying basic sense-data--"I see a ring," "I see a slab
of yellow," "I hear a sound" (<I>W</I>, 5)--the text introduces the
characters as young children whose phenomenological existence initially
is limited to rudimentary sense perception. Still within the confines of
its first page, the chapter quickly represents a move from sensation to
cognition, and the short declarations are supplanted by comparisons: "The
leaves are gathered round the window like pointed ears," Susan tells us,
and Louis chimes in with the observation that "A shadow falls on the path
. . . like an elbow bent" (<I>W</I>, 5). This progressive differentiation
of perceptual objects leads in turn to some measure of differential
identification on the part of the speaking subjects themselves, and by the
third page Louis defines himself in relation to the presence or absence
of others, suddenly realizing that, "Now they have all gone . . . I
am alone" (<I>W</I>, 7). The text's opening pages, in short, present
an extremely compressed developmental schema that takes the characters
from a stage of barely developed perceptual consciousness to a level of
significant cognitive ability and individualization. If the language of
the first chapter mimetically parades the characters through a process of
psychological development, the chapter concludes with a scene so crucial
that it will have been revisited four times by the end of the novel. This
scene thematizes the inevitable procession towards individuality and
recounts the moment at which the characters "troop upstairs like ponies
. . . stamping, clattering one behind another to take [their] turns
in the bathroom" where Mrs. Constable awaits, "girt in a bath-towel"
and brandishing her water-soaked, "lemon-coloured sponge" (<I>W</I>,
19). Submitted in his turn to this embodiment of the Law, Bernard
tells us that, "holding [the sponge] high above me, shivering beneath
her, she squeezes it. Water pours down the runnel of my spine. Bright
arrows of sensation shoot on either side. I am covered with warm flesh"
(<I>W</I>, 19). In interesting contrast to post-Freudian models, Woolf
understands the processes leading to individualization not primarily in
visual or linguistic terms but in terms of the physiological mechanisms
that produce the "bright arrows of sensation." Her interrogation of
individualism, that is, takes place in close proximity to the corporeal
model articulated by turn-of-the-century neuroscience.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To indicate briefly the salient features of this model, I refer primarily
to the widespread reductionist impulse evident in the psychology of
the period. Technological developments that allowed the bioscientist
to decompose the body into ever more minute constituent components
and to establish the chemical and mechanical relations between these
components frequently resulted in the assumption that questions of the
mind could be answered through appropriately scientific attention to
the body. Programmatically encapsulating this orthodoxy, for example,
Henry Maudsley's <I>Body</I> 

<B></B>

<I>and Mind</I> demands, "Surely it is time, we put seriously to ourselves
the question whether the inductive method, which has proved its worth
by its abundant fruitfulness wherever it has been faithfully applied,
should not be as rigidly used in the investigation of mind as in the
investigation of other natural phenomena." Indeed, shifting from the
interrogative to the declarative, he asserts that "To begin the study
of mind with the observation of its humblest bodily manifestations is
a strictly scientific method."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 This drive to apply the principles of physical science to the
 psychological realm is manifest, moreover, in the work of res
 as diverse and influential as Sigmund Freud and William James. Freud
 opens his prepsychoanalytic <I>Project for a Scientific Psychology</I>
 with the avowal that it is his "intention to furnish a psychology that
 shall be a natural science: that is, to represent psychical processes
 as quantitatively determinate states of specifiable material particles,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 and James introduces <I>The Principles of Psychology</I> with the dual
 claims that "a certain amount of brain-physiology must be presupposed
 or included in Psychology," and that the "psychologist is forced to be
 something of a nerve-physiologist."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The model of the nervous system made available by neurology and
neurophysiology is that of a series of relays conducting impulses from
the bodily periphery to the center and then to the periphery again,
with the central nervous system functioning as a switching station
between sensation and motivity. Afferent nerves are understood to
carry sensory excitation to the central nervous system, which then
discharges the quantum of nervous energy to the periphery in the form
of motor activity. Most contentious in this schema was the role of the
central nervous system in determining by which path, among a multitude of
possibilities, any given nervous impulse would be discharged. Suspicious
of appeals to volitional categories in the explanation of this
decision-making process, and in many cases attempting to account
for supposed acts of will in physiological terms, neuroscientific
models turned instead to the physical characteristics of the nervous
system. Fairly representative in this respect is James's description of
the "plasticity" of nerve tissue and the notion of habit that becomes
its predicate:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
<I>Plasticity</I> means the possession of a structure weak enough to
yield to an influence, but strong enough not to yield all at once. Each
relatively stable phase of equilibrium in such a structure is marked by
what we may call a new set of habits. Organic matter, especially nervous
tissue, seems endowed with a very extraordinary degree of plasticity
of this sort; so that we may without hesitation lay down as our first
proposition the following, that <I>the phenomena of habit in living beings
are due to the plasticity of the organic materials of which their bodies
are composed</I> [<I>PP</I>, 110, emphasis in original].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Insisting that "the philosophy of habit is . . . in the first instance, a
chapter in physics," and that habit is "at bottom a physical principle,"
James suggests that the nervous system is physically altered by the
nervous energy it transmits (<I>PP</I>, 110). Once a given type of
afferent impulse is discharged via a specific motor pathway, the system
is altered such that subsequent impulses of that type will be more likely
to be discharged in the same way. Repeated patterns of transmission and
discharge literally

<B></B>

"leave organic impression[s]" on the fibres of the nervous system, and
James goes so far as to suggest that, "it is not simply <I>particular
lines</I> of discharge, but also <I>general forms</I> of discharge,
that seem to be grooved out by habit in the brain" (<I>PP</I>, 116,
130, emphasis in original). Beyond emphasizing the deterministic
implications of this model, according to which patterns of behavior
are physically scored into the nervous system, it is worth noting that
James is also fairly representative in the conclusions to which his
psycho-physiological model leads. In his account, the "physiological
study of mental conditions is . . . the most powerful ally of hortatory
ethics." "The hell to be endured hereafter, of which theology tells," he
warns, "is no worse than the hell we make for ourselves in this world by
habitually fashioning our characters in the wrong way. Could the young
but realize how soon they will become mere walking bundles of habits,
they would give more heed to their conduct while in the plastic state. We
are spinning our own fates, good or evil, and never to be undone. Every
smallest stroke of virtue or of vice leaves its never so little scar"
(<I>PP</I>, 130-1). Habit is, for James,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
the enormous fly-wheel of society, its most precious conservative
agent. It alone is what keeps us all within the bounds of ordinance, and
saves the children of fortune from the envious uprisings of the poor. It
alone prevents the hardest and most repulsive walks of life from being
deserted by those brought up to tread therein. It keeps the fisherman
and the deck-hand at sea through the winter; it holds the miner in his
darkness, and nails the countryman to his cabin and his lonely farm
through all the months of snow; it protects us from invasion by the
natives of the desert and frozen zone. It dooms us all to t out the
battle of life upon the lines of our nurture or our early choice, and
to make the best of a pursuit that disagrees, because there is no other
for which we are fitted, and it is too late to begin again. It keeps
different social strata from mixing [<I>PP</I>, 125].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The model of the nervous system exemplified by James's psychology, thus,
has dual implications. In the first instance it provides a physiological
ground for the formation of moral character and the production of
individual subjects. In the second instance, it differentiates individuals
from one another through the maintenance of a rigid social structure
that extends from the narrowly communal to the global. The nerves and
the forms of habit they facilitate provide the key to understanding both
the mechanical formation and functioning of individual subjects and the
ways in which such individuals are integrated as distinct constitutive
components into the machinery of larger-scale social bodies.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is precisely these twofold ramifications of the neuroscientific body
that <I>The Waves</I> interrogates. For if Bernard's individualizing
encounter with Mrs. Constable is initially represented as the source
of a vaguely pleasurable ambivalence, as the narrative proceeds, its
rememoration and rearticulation increasingly cast it in a different
light. By Bernard's summation in the final chapter, he revisits that
event and its myriad subsequent analogues and is led to conclude that
"Sometimes indeed, when I pass a cottage with a light in the window
where a child has been born, I could implore them not to squeeze the
sponge over that new body" (<I>W</I>, 200). This desire to protect the

<B></B>

infant is indicative of Woolf's analysis of the bodily regime in
which Mrs. Constable's sponge is only the first step. The end of the
process inaugurated by Mrs. Constable, in contrast, is articulated
by Neville. "Change is no longer possible," he laments, "We are
committed. Before, when we met in a restaurant in London with Percival,
all simmered and shook; we could have been anything. We have chosen
now, or sometimes it seems the choice was made for us--a pair of tongs
pinched us between the shoulders. I chose. I took the print of life not
outwardly, but inwardly upon the raw, the white, the unprotected fibre"
(<I>W</I>, 178). Or, as Bernard suggests in a similar vein:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It was different once. . . . Once we could break the current as we
chose. How many telephone calls, how many post cards, are now needed
to cut this hole through which we come together, united, at Hampton
Court? . . . We are all swept on by the torrent of things grown so
familiar that they cast no shade . . . and in this unconsciousness attain
the utmost freedom from friction and part the weeds that grow over the
mouths of sunken channels. We have to leap like fish, high in the air,
to catch the train from Waterloo. And however high we leap we fall back
again into the stream [<I>W</I>, 180].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In both these cases, Woolf articulates the threat posed by
Mrs. Constable's sponge with direct reference to the language of
neuroscience. Both Neville and Bernard represent the consequences of a
deterministic bodily mode. For Neville change and choice are no longer
possible because he has been pinched between the shoulders, taken
the print of life on the fibres of his nervous system, and Bernard
feels at the mercy of the unassailable torrent of the familiar, the
habitual. Drawing on the commonplace neuroscientific trope of the nerves
as riverbeds whose channels are progressively deepened by currents of
nervous energy, Bernard describes a freedom that is not of choice, but
rather a freedom from choice produced by habit. Moreover, Bernard's
statement makes manifest an antagonistic relationship between this
model of embodiment and the possibility of community. Aligning the
habitualized body with forces of individuation and differentiation,
he suggests that only to the extent that the frictionless flow of the
familiar can be resisted is community possible, can the characters
"come together, united."

Unsettling the Habitual--A "Great Society of Bodies"
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is, however, precisely this possibility of coming together that Woolf
seeks to explore. She is not content merely to replicate positivist
science's mechanical model of the body, a body in which, as Bernard
puts it, "Muscles, nerves, intestines, blood-vessels . . . make
the coil and spring of our being, the unconscious hum of the engine
. . . [that] function[s] superbly. Opening, shutting; shutting, opening;
eating, drinking; sometimes speaking--the whole mechanism seem[s]
to expand, to contract, like the mainspring of a clock" (<I>W</I>,
217-8). Throughout the text, she is equally at pains to articulate an
alternate model of embodied subjectivity that is most clearly represented

<B></B>

in her characterization of Jinny. Early in the text we are given an
account of Jinny's participation in a tennis match, after which she
states:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I must throw myself on the ground and pant. I am out of breath with
running, with triumph. Everything in my body seems thinned out with
running and triumph. My blood must be bright red, whipped up, slapping
against my ribs. My soles tingle, as if wire rings opened and shut in
my feet. I see every blade of grass very clear. But the pulse drums so
in my forehead, behind my eyes, that everything dances--the net, the
grass; your faces leap like butterflies; the trees seem to jump up and
down. There is nothing staid, nothing settled, in this universe. All is
rippling, all is dancing; all is quickness and triumph [<I>W</I>, 31].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Reveling in the connective force of her pulsing blood, Jinny resides
triumphantly in her body. Standing in stark contrast to both the
rigidifying and ordering effects of Jamesian habit and Bernard's clockwork
body, Jinny's subjective mode is defined by her body's vitalistic capacity
for spontaneity. Both her self-perception and her perception of the world
around her are shaped by the dance of her blood: "there is," as she says,
"nothing staid, nothing settled, in this universe." By countering the
neuroscientific body in this way, Woolf's representation of Jinny's
form of embodiment is consonant with a well-established tradition of
vitalistic reaction to the deterministic effects of positivist science--a
tradition that, among Woolf's contemporaries, prominently includes Edward
Carpenter, Henri Bergson, and D. H. Lawrence.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Consistently represented through this metaphorics of dance, Jinny's
vitalistic mode of embodiment is extended to articulate a structure of
collectivity. For Jinny there is "a great society of bodies" that, when
they come into contact, call out to one another (<I>W</I>, 49). "Our
bodies communicate," she claims, and the form of this communication
finds its example in dance:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We yield to this slow flood. . . . In and out, we are swept now into this
large re; it holds us together; we cannot step outside its sinuous,
its hesitating, its abrupt, its perfectly encircling walls. Our bodies,
his hard, mine flowing, are pressed together in its body; it holds us
together; and then lengthening out, in smooth, in sinuous folds, rolls
us between it, on and on [<I>W</I>, 82-3].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The form of community predicated upon Jinny's embodied subjectivity is,
thus, less a form of relation between fixedly discrete individuals than
a process of merging in a dynamic flow of a corporate body.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the type of flow exemplified by both Jinny's blood and the dance
stand in contrast to the ever more strictly and efficiently channelled
flows of nervous energy in the habitualized body, Woolf's challenge to the
individualizing and deterministic discourses of neuroscience becomes overt
during the two dinner party scenes in which the six characters literally
come together in a community. Explicitly appropriating the language of
neuroscience, Woolf has Jinny respond to Rhoda's observation that "one
thing melts into another": "Yes . . . our senses have widened. Membranes,
webs

<B></B>

of nerve that lay white and limp, have filled and spread themselves and
float round us like filaments, making the air tangible and catching in
them far-away sounds unheard before" (<I>W</I>, 110). No longer limited
to their role as long-fixed relays between sensation and action, the
nerves, in this articulation, become an extensive web that structures
the melting of one thing into another and makes new forms of sensory
experience possible. Extending this reration of the nervous system,
Neville supports Louis's claim "that these attempts to say, 'I am this,
I am that,' which we make, coming together, like separated parts of one
body and soul, are false" by representing the nerves as the basis of an
encompassing communal architecture (<I>W</I>, 112). Shifting abruptly
from his sense that "change is no longer possible" because he has taken
"the print of life . . . upon the raw, the white, the unprotected fibre,"
he declares, "I am merely 'Neville' to you, who see the narrow limits of
my life and the line it cannot pass. But to myself I am immeasurable; a
net whose fibres pass imperceptibly beneath the world. My net is almost
indistinguishable from that which it surrounds. It lifts whales--huge
leviathans and white jellies, what is amorphous and wandering" (<I>W</I>,
178). No longer functioning to individualize and separate, the nerves
as Neville imagines them mark a collective space not dissimilar to
what we have seen Jinny describe as the "perfectly encircling walls" of
the dance. Within this space, the lines that divide one character from
another, or the characters from the world that surrounds them, are no
longer distinct.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is important to note the extent to which Woolf predicates
this possibility of collectivity upon a mode of vital, affective
embodiment. Whereas the novel consistently associates forces of
individualization and differentiation with taxonomic and traditionally
narrative linguistic modes, the affective body remains unassimilable
to the ordering regimes of such representational projects and as such
provides a basis for community. Louis presents perhaps the most obvious
example of the taxonomic language of the individual. Armed with his
businessman's red pen and ledger book, he is driven to locate all aspects
of life on their proper line and column, literally to account for the
world in which he finds himself. Even the trivialities of day-to-day
existence are submitted to this drive, and he insists that "With my
Australian accent I have sat in eating-shops and tried to make the
clerks accept me, yet never forgotten my solemn and severe convictions
and the discrepancies and incoherences that must be resolved" (<I>W</I>,
167). His use of language aims at classifying and fixing that which is
both without and within; perceptual processes, for instance, become the
occasion for representational ordering, as when he announces, "This
I see for a second, and shall try tonight to fix in words, to forge
a ring of steel" (<I>W</I>, 30). Insistently differentiating him from
and situating him in relation to what surrounds him, Louis's endless
taxonomies culminate in the moment at which he tells us, "on the letters
in the wire basket I sign my name, I, I, and again I" (<I>W</I>, 141). In
so doing he exemplifies the process through which "All the furled and
close-packed leaves of [his] many-folded life are now summed up in
[his] name; incised cleanly and barely on the sheet" (<I>W</I>, 138).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The text suggests that this reiterative solidification of the "I" through
which incoherences, negations, and multiplicities are compressed and
unified within the subject--

<B></B>

a sort of linguistic analogue to the habitualizing and individualizing
force of repeated patterns of nervous discharge-- must be overcome if the
possibility of community is to be realized. The two dinner party scenes
once again provide the clearest instances of such an overcoming. On the
occasion of the first dinner, Louis himself is led to claim that:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It is Percival . . . sitting silent as he sat among the tickling grasses
when the breeze parted the clouds and they formed again, who makes
us aware that these attempts to say, "I am this, I am that," which we
make, coming together, like separated parts of one body and soul, are
false. Something has been left out from fear. Something has been altered,

be separate we have laid stress upon our faults, and what is particular

In the face of the individuating and qualifying force of language--the
insistently compelling claims of "I am this, I am that"--Louis posits
the possibility of an underlying state of unifying commonality, beyond
all particularity, red by the perfect symmetry of a "whirling
. . . circle." If Louis can only posit this form of collectivity, Neville
reminds us of its grounding in the affective body. Taking up Louis's
theme, he muses:

these roaring waters . . . upon which we build our crazy platforms are

But I eat. I gradually lose all knowledge of particulars as I eat. I
  am becoming weighed down with food. These delicious mouthfuls of roast
  duck, fitly piled with vegetables, following each other in exquisite
  rotation of warmth, weight, sweet and bitter, past my palate, down my
  gullet, into my stomach, have stabilized my body. I feel quiet, gravity,
  control. All is solid now. Instinctively my palate now requires and
  anticipates sweetness and lightness, something sugared and evanescent;
  and cool wine, fitting glovelike over those finer nerves that seem
  to tremble from the roof of my mouth and make it spread (as I drink)
  into a domed cavern, green with vine leaves, musk-scented, purple with
  grapes. Now I can look steadily into the mill-race that foams beneath

Another instance in which the nerves come to re an encompassing,
organic, communal architecture, this passage makes explicit the embodied
basis of community. Describing the sequence of events through which he is
gradually drawn from the realm of reason, language, and identity to that
of affective embodiment, it is only with the complete abandonment of the
former that Neville can access the dynamic collective source of stability
that subtends his existence. Eschewing language and its primary function
of individuation and particularization, he loses a sense of individuality
as he sinks into a gastronomically induced affective state in which he
"gradually lose[s] all knowledge of particulars." Positing this tension
between language, reason, and particularity on the one hand, and affect,
embodiment, and unity on the other, the text is once again consistent
with a tradition of vitalistic thought. To reinvoke

<B></B>

Bergson, Carpenter, and Lawrence, it is worth noting that despite
significant differences that are especially apparent in terms of
their communitarian implications, their projects all articulate an
understanding, shared by this aspect of Woolf's text, of the vital order
as a fundamental unity in relation to which supposedly discrete units
or identities are viewed as the distorting, if necessary, effects of
intellectual operations.

If, then, Woolf turns the language of neuroscience against itself in an
attempt to think and write of community, the question remains, How are
we to assess the vitalistic form of community her text articulates? In
order to approach this question it will be necessary to reframe slightly
Woolf's engagement of the neuroscientific body and to distinguish more
sharply the modes of community the novel presents. One such mode, as
Jane Marcus has argued, is the patriotic English nationalism and its
supporting "myth of individualism and selfhood" that <I>The Waves</I>
criticizes ("BR," 137). Michael Tratner makes a similar point when he
draws on Leonard Woolf's understanding of imperialism as the principle
of individualism transposed into the geopolitical realm to argue that
Virginia Woolf's critique of individualism goes hand in hand with
her critique of nationalism and imperialism. Given this alignment of
individualism with a particular form of nationalist community, Woolf's
interrogation of the individualizing function of the neuroscientific body
would seem to support the line of argument advanced by Marcus and Tratner.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 By extension, then, the turn to the affective body and the form of
 community that becomes its predicate (a community not grounded in
 the individual) can be seen as an attempt to imagine a more desirable
 structure of collectivity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When, however, we return to the scene of the first dinner party as the
fullest articulation of this alternate communal mode--and in so doing,
it will be necessary to differentiate more carefully between the two
dinner parties than I have so far--it becomes clear that this affective
community is itself not unproblematic. If the text's reration of
the nervous system is attractive insofar as it provides the basis for a
communitarian project that ostensibly stands in opposition to nationalist
community and its cult of the great individual, the model of community
at which it arrives remains dangerously close to what Jean-Luc Nancy
has described as "organic community." Suppressing social difference
and leaving no place for an experience of being-together in which the
enclosed totalities of individual subjects are exposed at the limit of an
unshareable alterity, this form of community is corporatist and manifests
itself either in the subsumption of individual members under the re
of a leader whose body signifies the unity of all those in whose place
it stands, or in the sacrifice of individual subjectivity in an act of
fusion that forms the higher-level totality of the community as Subject.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Organic community is, for Nancy, "not only intimate communication
 between its members, but also its organic communion with its own
 essence. . . . [I]t is made up principally of the sharing, diffusion,
 or impregnation of

<B></B>

an identity by a plurality wherein each member identifies himself only
through the supplementary mediation of his identification with the living
body of the community."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Perhaps his most succinct definition of this communal form is one
 governed by "the goal of achieving a community of beings producing in
 essence their own essence as their work, and furthermore of producing
 precisely this essence <I>as community</I>" (<I>IC</I>, 20). Important
 here is the polyvocal sense of "work," for if organic community is the
 product of its members' <I>labor</I>, the form of that product is a
 work of art, understood as the self-enclosed, remainderless totality
 of the <I>oeuvre</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 The imperative of the work governs the form of community that the
 first dinner party works to produce, an imperative encapsulated in
 the characters' projective creation of Percival, the absent center
 around which the text revolves. Absent from the text except in the
 memories and thoughts of the other characters, Percival exists only
 as the product of his friends' imaginative and identificatory labor;
 in working to fashion the social space enabled by the proper name
 "Percival," the characters produce him as the essential embodiment
 of their being-in-common. Percival, as Louis reminds us, "makes [the
 characters] aware that these attempts to say, 'I am this, I am that,'
 which [they] make, coming together, like separated parts of one body and
 soul, are false" (<I>W</I>, 112). And if Louis declares the realized
 work of community with his announcement, "Something is made," Jinny
 gives form to this vague "something" when she implores, "Let us hold
 it for one moment . . . this globe whose walls are made of Percival"
 (<I>W</I>, 118-9). The communal space that has hitherto been
 articulated with recourse to the language of the affective body is, in
 this instance, substantially embodied by "Percival," a mythic production
 of the characters in which they initially recognize idealized versions
 of themselves and that ultimately constitutes the collective identity to
 which their individual selves are sacrificed. To return, in this context,
 to Tratner's linking of individualism and imperialist nationalism, it
 will be important to distance ourselves from his somewhat too hasty
 valorization of collectivism as a sufficient countermeasure. For in
 sacrificing their particularity as individual subjects to merge in a
 form of collective consciousness, the form of collectivity the characters
 fashion remains subjective.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Though the community achieved in the first dinner party counteracts
 atomistic individualism, it does not escape the logic of the Subject,
 a logic all too compatible with both nation and empire.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the mythic fashioning of Percival is initially emblematic of
the problems inherent in the structure of collectivity to which the
novel turns, by the occasion of the second dinner party he, or more
precisely, his death, will have become central to Woolf's response to
these problems. Percival's death is, of course, literally central to the
progression of <I>The Waves</I>; occurring midway through the text, it
is announced by the short shocking statement, "He is dead" (<I>W</I>,
124). While Percival's death is key to Woolf's satirical attack on what
Marcus calls "the cultural narrative of 'England' . . . created by an
Eton/Cambridge elite who (re)produce the national epic . . . and elegy
. . . in praise of the hero," his ignominious demise should not be read
as merely ridiculous or pathetic ("BR," 137). Notwithstanding the irony
of having Percival, knight errant and imperial champion, meet his end
in an accidental fall from the

<B></B>

back of a flea-bitten mare, his death initiates a critical reconsideration
of both the affective body and the structure of collectivity it
enables. Following quickly on the heels of the first dinner party,
Percival's death calls the characters to ask what is at stake in the
representational schema that fashions him. Having produced the myth
of Percival as the myth of community, they must now reflect upon the
ramifications of their labor and its product.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In speaking of Percival's "mythic" status, it will be important to
recall Nancy's understanding of "myth" or "fiction" as those linguistic
modes that do the work of organic community and produce the community
as their work:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Absolute community--myth--is not so much the total fusion of individuals,
but the <I>will</I> of community: the desire to operate, through the
power of myth, the communion that myth represents and that it represents
as a communion or communication of wills. Fusion ensues: myth represents
multiple existences as immanent to its own unique fiction, which gathers
them together and gives them their common re in its speech and as
this speech [<I>IC</I>, 57].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Myth is, thus, distinguished not primarily by its referential status but
by the extent to which it <I>operates</I> to produce community. Rather
than representing community to a group of individuals or communicating
some information about community that its members then hold in common,
mythic speech is itself the operation of community--it is through the very
act of mythic speech that community takes place. Given this tautological
loop in which <I>myth</I> and <I>community</I> are locked--whereby
myth can be said to communicate only itself as the taking place of
community--it becomes impossible to think of community without myth
or blithely to pursue a project of demythologization. If, in Nancy's
formulation, all community necessarily takes place through the operation
of myth and that operation is independent of myth's referential function,
efforts to establish an unmythic form of collectivity through the
exposure of a given myth's suspect referential status will gain no social
purchase and will only perpetuate the operation of an adversarial mythic
community. In this context the limitations of a reading that understands
<I>The Waves</I> as simply engaged in satirizing imperialist, nationalist
community--what Marcus characterizes as Woolf's "merciless parody" of the
"myth of individualism and selfhood" and of the re of the imperial
hero that is its manifestation--become evident because the force of satire
or parody lies in its ability to ridicule, or demythologize, its object
("BR," 137).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Woolf's text undoubtedly engages in this sort of satire, the height of
which is the circumstances of Percival's death, and in so doing critiques
the ideological ramifications of the historically particular form of
community he represents. It does not, however, limit itself to this
critique, and the sheer event of Percival's death allows it to pursue
the logic of mythic community to the point of what Nancy calls its
"interruption."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Beyond her demythologizing tactics, Woolf develops a mode of writing
 that gives voice to this interruption and re-marks a limit at which
 the work of community--its individual member subjects, and the logic
 of the Subject itself--is

<B></B>

opened up and exposed by the interactions of singular beings that
cannot be put to work in the operations of myth. This "voice of
interruption" is most audible in the characters' reactions to Percival's
death. Uninterested in what the myth of Percival represents and unable
to find language adequate to the fact of Percival's death, Rhoda, for
example, is led to ask, "'Like' and 'like' and 'like'--but what is
the thing that lies beneath the semblance of the thing? . . . Now that
lightning has gashed the tree and the flowering branch has fallen and
Percival, by his death, has made me this gift, let me see the thing"
(<I>W</I>, 134). No longer the "something [that] is made" in the work
of mythic community, he is, in death, merely "the thing" to which myth
is inadequate and that constitutes its interruption (<I>W</I>, 118).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Faced with the unthinkable event of Percival's death, Rhoda rejects
Louis's response, aware that "If we submit [Louis] will reduce us to
order . . . [and] smooth out the death of Percival to his satisfaction"
(<I>W</I>, 132). She decides instead to go to a music hall, and her
description of the vocal performance she witnesses is extraordinary:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
swollen but contained in slippery satin, the seagreen woman comes to
our rescue. She sucks in her lip, assumes an air of intensity, inflates
herself and hurls herself precisely at the right moment as if she saw
an apple and her voice was the arrow into the note, "Ah!"
<P>
An axe has split a tree to the core; the core is warm; sound quivers
 within the bark. "Ah!" cried a woman to her lover, leaning from her
 window in Venice. "Ah, ah!" she cried, and again she cries "Ah!" She has
 provided us with a cry. But only a cry. And what is a cry? [<I>W</I>,
 133]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Unwilling to "smooth out" Percival's death in the process of
representation, narration, or mythologization, Rhoda recognizes,
nonetheless, her obligation to bear witness to the "thing" he has
manifested to her, and in the moment of the vocal performance, she finds a
means of understanding her obligation. Instead of the "'like' and 'like'
and 'like'" of representation, she is confronted with the "'Ah!' and
'Ah!' and 'Ah!'" of the vocalist's "cry," an utterance that returns
Rhoda to the affective body without allowing that mode of embodiment to
become the basis of a communitarian myth. The affective charge of the
singer's cry is pregnant with a significance that it cannot signify, and
as such it allows Percival's death to open onto an alternate communal
mode. The language of the cry refuses to qualify his death, to make
it comprehensible through the memorializing production of a communal
fiction; it does, however, inarticulately indicate the sheer fact of his
death, a fact that the characters share even as they are confronted by
the painful insistence that they can neither properly make Percival's
death their own nor make it the ground of a shared subjective space.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In a parallel moment, Bernard responds to Percival's death with a visit
to the National Gallery. Equally scornful of Louis's desire to "smooth
things out," he insists:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
but I still resent the usual order. I will not let myself be made yet to
accept the sequence of things. I will walk; I will not change the rhythm
of my mind by stopping, by looking; I will walk. I will go up these steps
into the gallery and submit myself to the influence of minds like mine
outside the sequence. There is little time left to answer the question;

<B></B>

 my powers flag; I become torpid. Here are pictures. Here are cold
 madonnas among the pillars. Let them lay to rest the incessant activity
 of the mind's eye, the bandaged head, the men with ropes, so that I
 may find something unvisual beneath. Here are the gardens; and Venus
 among her flowers; here are saints and blue madonnas. Mercifully these
 pictures make no reference; they do not nudge; they do not point. Thus
 they expand my consciousness of him and bring him back to me differently
 [<I>W</I>, 104-5].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Rejecting the sequentializing effect of the phrases he constantly
produces, Bernard finds solace in the affective quality of the pictures he
views. The paintings make no appeal to the representational faculty of his
"mind's eye" but present him with something "unvisual." Antireferential
and nonindexical, the images do not inscribe Percival within a fiction
of unity and foundational stability but "bring him back to [Bernard]
differently." This difference produced by Bernard's affective experience
pertains not only to Percival but to Bernard himself. If Bernard's
experience in the gallery brings Percival back differently by manifesting
the persistent necessity of remembering him before and beyond the work of
memorializing fiction, it also installs a difference within the subject,
the "me," to whom Percival returns. Exposing the individual to the
singularity of an otherness that it can neither incorporate within the
closure of the subject nor render the basis of a higher subjective mode
(a "We") to which it can sacrifice itself, the demands of remembrance
thematized by Bernard's experience are also the demands of an impossible
community. This community is based not in the undifferentiating fusion
of its individual members in a transcendental whole but precisely in
their common exposure to, their sharing of, that which properly can be
neither communicated nor shared.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Turning from the affective body as a vital principle of integration and
organic unity to an understanding of the affective body as manifesting
the limit re-marked by the singularly unrepresentable "thing" that the
characters hold in common but can never properly share, by the second
dinner party, <I>The Waves</I> insists that the desire for community
must be negotiated in a very different register, and in a different
language, from that of the characters' first "coming together." Closing
in Bernard's voice, Woolf refuses the mythologizing narrative of the
"summing up" that would be proper to an organic notion of community
(<I>W</I>, 199). Instead, she has him articulate a series of questions:
"What is the phrase for the moon? And the phrase for love? By what name
are we to call death?" (<I>W</I>, 199) Bernard responds:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
I do not know. I need a little language such as lovers use, words of one
syllable such as children speak when they come into the room and find
their mother sewing and pick up some scrap of bright wool, a feather,
or a shred of chintz. I need a howl; a cry. When the storm crosses the
marsh and sweeps over me where I lie in the ditch unregarded I need no
words. Nothing neat. Nothing that comes down with all its feet on the
floor. None of those resonances and lovely echoes that break and chime
from nerve to nerve in our breasts, making wild music, false phrases. I
have done with phrases [<I>W</I>, 246].

this prose into poetry. The little language is enough" (<I>W</I>, 219).

articulation of this tension in his understanding of the relationship
between individual selves and what he calls the universal Self of the
vital universe. In Carpenter's view humanity resides predominantly in a
state of consciousness (closely associated with the operations of the
intellect and a scientific temperament) that emphasizes identity and
distinction and thereby renders inaccessible the realization of a vast,
vital connectedness that underlies such distinctions. In a passage whose
similarity to Neville's ration of the nerves as a web that subtends
and unifies all of existence makes it difficult not to read it as Woolf's
source, Carpenter imagines the overcoming of this intellectual state
of consciousness:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
This body, in fact, is the expression and grows out of those great
creative feelings of which I have just spoken. Through Love it becomes
a body built into the lives of others, and positively sharing their
organic life and vitality. Since Faith and Courage inspire it, it is
well based, firm to stand the shocks of Time and Accident; extending
its domain over the elements; incorporating in itself the sea and the
wild creatures, and so unafraid of them; surrounding Chance and taking
it captive. Its consciousness of immense Extension in time and space
indicates its ethereal character; its consciousness of Power indicates
its strongly material composition; its consciousness of Knowledge,
the penetrating subtle quality of it. And so we forebode, beside and
within the very local body which we know best (and which is expressive
of our more local selves), another body expressive of our more universal
nature--a body built of swift, far-extending ethereal elements, subtle
and penetrating, yet powerfully massive and material; closely knit in
itself, not easily disturbed or dislocated, enduring for &aelig;ons;
yet sensitive in the highest degree, and twining its nerves and fibres
through all Creation--sharing the life of all creatures [Carpenter,

Beyond articulating the individualizing function of the habitualized body,
neuroscientific discourse itself makes the link between individualism
and an explicitly conservative, communitarian project. In James, the
habitualized body preserves both class distinctions between "the children
of fortune" and the "envious . . . poor," and racialized distinctions
between a presumably civilized white readership and the hostile "natives
of the desert and frozen zone" (<I>PP</I>, 125). Unsurprisingly,
Maudsley's project supports, indeed presupposes, a similar social
model. In outlining his "inductive" approach to the "investigation
of mind," he contends that "we ought certainly to begin our inquiry
with the observation of the simplest instances--with its physiological
manifestations in animals, in children, in idiots, in savages, mounting
by degrees to the highest and most recondite facts of consciousness"
(Maudsley, <I>Body and Mind</I>, 148).

Writing of an alternate model of community, Nancy suggests that:

<!--_extract-->
Community is the community of <I>others</I>, which does not mean
that several individuals possess some common nature in spite
of their differences, but rather that they partake only of their
otherness. Otherness, at each moment, is the otherness of each "myself,"
which is "myself" only as an other. Otherness is not a common substance,
but it is on the contrary the nonsubstantiality of each "self" and of its
relationship <I>with</I> the others. All the selves are related through
their otherness, which means that they are not "related"; in any case,
not in any determinable sense of relationship. They are together, but
togetherness is otherness [Jean-Luc Nancy, <I>The Birth to Presence</I>,
