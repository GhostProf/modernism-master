In intellectual circles today, it is fashionable to argue that modernism
and its counterpart, avant-gardism, as the dominant "world views" that
influenced the nature of style for most of the twentieth century, have
been replaced by postmodernism, not only in the arts but in popular
culture. According to a French scholar, "Avant-garde art still exists but
it treads water and upsets no one. . . . Modern art no longer scandalizes
its public."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 It has become the new academy, a new form of
official art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>


<P>
Modernism and avant-gardism, which presume the existence of clear-cut
distinctions between different types of aesthetic endeavors, are
perceived today as elitist in comparison with postmodernism, in which
high culture is no longer viewed as aesthetically superior to popular
culture and dominant cultures are no longer more significant than
minority cultures. The shift from modernist to postmodernist styles is
viewed as a consequence of social, political, and cultural changes that
have altered the relationships between different social groups and the
dominant culture, as well as the ways in which these social groups can
be plausibly represented by cultural categories.

<P>
The enormous proliferation of different forms of popular culture (cinema,
television, and popular music) transmitted by film and electronic
media has made it difficult to ignore the aesthetic influence of these
cultures in everyday life, and, at the same time, has had the effect of
marginalizing traditional arts, such as painting, theatre, dance, poetry,
and experimental music. The concept of two cultures, one aesthetically
superior and identified with the arts as traditionally defined, and the

<b></b>
other aesthetically trivial and identified with culture produced
for mass audiences, has ceased to be convincing. From the postmodernist
perspective, all forms of culture today mix elements from different
styles and different time periods, erasing the distinctions between high
and low cultures and between dominant and minority cultures.

<P>
Unfortunately, the enormous amount of discussion and debate about the
significance and impact of these types of styles has created what are
in fact stereotypical images of both postmodernism and modernism, and
particularly the role of avant-gardes. As Wilson has observed, our
"generalizations begin to seem to have more to do with the creation
of a cultural myth about 'our times' which . . . seeks to create a
stereotype of the present in the present."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 The modernist
avant-garde is characterized in terms of its alleged aloofness from
popular culture and political concern rather than in terms of its
critique of modernity, specifically the latter's commitment to the
belief in progress.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Avant-garde art tends to be identified
with its post-World War II phase of experimentation with artistic form,
while its engagements with political issues in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries are forgotten (<I>PC,</I> 237). Instead of
being aloof from popular culture in the late nineteenth century, French
avant-garde artists often appropriated motifs from certain aspects of
popular culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Curiously, while the avant-garde tends to be
derided in discussions of postmodernism, the concept has not been entirely
abandoned. Postmodern artists, while eliminating clear distinctions
between popular culture and art in their works, are sometimes described as
using avant-garde strategies. Boyne and Rattansi argue that postmodernists
in relation to their battle against modernism constitute an avant-garde
in the same sense as the dadaists and surrealists in their opposition
to post-impressionism ("TPP," 10). Connor describes postmodernists as
using "a lexicon of cultural subversion and deconstruction which is
partly inherited from modernist culture and its avant-garde theories"
(<I>PC,</I> 166- 67).

<P>
At the same time, some writers have argued that postmodern
theorists exaggerate the extent to which postmodernity has replaced
modernity. Kellner suggests that there may be "continuities" as well as
"discontinuities" between the two types of societies and suggests the
relevance of Williams' distinction between "residual," "dominant," and
"emergent" cultures. "Using Williams' distinctions we might want to
speak of postmodernity as an emergent tendency within a still dominant
modernity which is haunted as well by various forms of residual,
traditional cultures.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>


<P>
Collins has pointed to "the simultaneous presence of [postmodernism]
alongside modernist, pre-modernist, and aggressively non-modernist styles,
all enjoying significant degrees of popularity with different audiences
and institutions" (quoted in <I>PC,</I> 177). Wilson provides an example,
that of a subcultural style, punk, as "modernist, as postmodernist,
and as an avant-garde manifestation" ("NCS," 214). In the past fifteen
years, the electronic media have appropriated the looks and tactics of
the avant-garde. Caldwell claims that "every framework of the avant-garde
. . . had become highly visible in some form in the corporate world of
the new television."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Kaplan, in 
<b></b>
an attempt to classify
music videos in the 1980s, found that all the categories she identified
used avant-garde strategies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 One of her video categories
was postmodernist. Some advertisements, particularly for clothing
manufacturers, replace clarity with ambiguity in order to attract the
attention of a public so sated with advertising messages it no longer
bothers to notice them.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 One technique has been to present
ambiguous images whose connotations are unclear and which do not appear to
have an obvious connection with the product being advertised. Sometimes
these images are intended to be disturbing or at least provocative,as
Goldman and his colleagues note: "To confuse further the ideological
field, some advertisers now actively encourage multiple readings as they
try to recapture the attention of alienated viewers by encoding messages
that are ambiguous, incomplete, or polyvalent."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>


<P>
The assimilation by the mass media of stylistic devices associated with
the avant-garde raises the question of the extent to which oppositional
themes are being disseminated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Goldman and his collaborators
note: ". . . behind the apparent ideological randomness of the ads and
the multitude of different voices with which they address viewers, lie
the familiar guiding assumptions of commodity consumption and a remarkable
ideological regularity structured by the framework of ads."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>


<P>
Kaplan points out that oppositional messages are likely to be "overridden
by the plethora of surrounding texts" (<I>RRC,</I> 65). The sheer volume
of messages of all kinds being transmitted by the mass media tends to
obliterate the effect of oppositional messages when they do appear; high
culture, in contrast, framed oppositional messages in such a way as to
highlight their effect: an entire evening at the theater devoted to a
particular playwright, an entire gallery or museum wing devoted to the
work of a particular artist for several weeks. Finally, as some of the
properties of high culture are being absorbed by certain forms of popular
culture, the hierarchalization of culture is being replicated in the
latter: popular music is being reclassified in terms of "classics" and
"non-classics."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>


<P>
These ambiguities in the discussion of the relationship between
postmodernism, modernism, and avant-gardism suggest that it is useful
to rethink conceptions of the nature, meaning, and significance
of avant-gardism and postmodernism in contemporary culture. In this
paper, I will examine these issues as they appear in the work of fashion
designers. Fashion with its emphasis on images and incessant change ought
to constitute the epitome of a postmodernist cultural form. Its aesthetic
content is often seen as trivial and its social content as promoting
narcissism and self-absorption on the one hand and thoughtless consumption
of unnecessary products on the other. To what extent do fashion designers
engage in avant-gardist, as opposed to postmodernist, practices? Can the
history of fashion design be interpreted in terms of distinct genres or
styles that prescribed aesthetic conventions and traditions against which
avant-gardes rebelled? Have these genres disappeared and been replaced
by parody and pastiche, the hallmarks of postmodernism?

<P>
Two authors who have written extensively about the sociology of fashion
disagree on this point. While Wilson finds some elements of parody and
self-parody in contemporary 
<b></b>
 fashion design that appear to fit a
postmodernist outlook, she argues that other characteristics, such as
pastiche and the "nostalgia mode" that supposedly are indicative of
postmodernist style "have been pervasive in popular culture (including
fashion) throughout the twentieth century and . . . earlier" ("NCS,"
226). She is skeptical of the existence of a postmodern zeitgeist or
ethos as defined by leading postmodern theorists such as Jameson and
Baudrillard.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Significantly, Yves Saint Laurent, who does
not perceive himself as postmodernist, has been described as basing
his collections on "allusions to a treasure trove of sources ranging
from Proust to the theatre, styles of painting, and, as times go, even
references to his own work."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>


<P>
By contrast, Kaiser and her colleagues point to the heterogeneity
in 'fashionable' looks, the blurring of binary categories, and the
manipulation and violation of cultural codes by fashion designers as
indications of the presence of a postmodernist outlook.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

The incoherence of styles in the aggregate leads to pervasive ambiguity
in the appearances that consumers construct from the array of styles in
the postmodernist fashion marketplace.

<P>
For this analysis, I will draw examples from the activities of fashion
designers, past and present, who have worked or shown their collections in
France since that country has been the center of fashion in the Western
world for the past two hundred years. Paris remains the center of the
international fashion world as the place where contemporary designers are
compelled to display their work in order to obtain both recognition as
innovators and a foothold in the global market. It has been in the past,
and remains today, a location for the display of highly innovative designs
that are not necessarily adopted immediately.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 At the same
time, fashion design in Paris and elsewhere has acquired the institutional
trappings of the art world. Fashion museums, sometimes called costume
institutes, collect and preserve clothes from previous centuries,
obtain clothes from contemporary designers as they appear, and produce
retrospectives of the work of leading designers. The auction market, a
major center for the sale of works in the fine arts, now includes sales
of designer clothing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 As did their counterparts earlier in
the century, successful designers often assume the role of collector,
patron of the arts, and exemplar of upper class taste. First, however,
it is necessary to identify elements of avant-gardism and postmodernism
in cultural styles.

1. Avant-gardist and Postmodernist Aesthetic Practices
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Analysis of a wide range of uses of the term, avant-garde, shows that
it has been applied to three types of changes: in the aesthetic content
of art, in the social content of art, and in the norms surrounding
the production and distribution of art works. For example, the term
"avant-garde" is applied to the aesthetic content of art objects when
those works represent a redefinition of conventions for creating art,
often in such a way that they are perceived as violating taboos and
as shocking or offensive, or when they involve the use of new tools
or techniques, or concern with
<b></b>
 the nature of use of techniques
<I>per se</I>, and when they redefine what can be considered an art
work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 The term is applied to the social content of art works
when they express social or political values that are critical of or
different from the dominant culture, when they attack art institutions,
and when they attempt to redefine the boundaries between high and popular
culture. Finally, the term is applied to creators of art works when they
attempt to redefine the social context for the production of art (for
example, appropriate role models, critics, and publics for artists), the
organizational context in which art is displayed and distributed, and
the social role of the artist in terms of his or her participation in
other social institutions, such as education, religion, and politics. By
any standards the term "avant-garde" can cover a wide range of aesthetic
and social practices.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>


<P>
Postmodernism is difficult to characterize in part because of its
preoccupation with ambiguity and contradiction. According to Boyne
and Rattansi, "Many doubt whether the term can ever be dignified by
conceptual coherence" ("TPP," 9). Postmodernism obliterates categories
and classifications. As a result, it seems to be characterized more by
qualities that it does not have than by qualities it has. Postmodernist
works are polysemic, having no fixed meanings or, to put it differently,
multiple meanings. Authoritative interpretations of texts are neither
expected nor possible. In postmodernist works, signifiers are unstable,
changing, contradictory, or disconnected. Binary oppositions between
signifiers are blurred (<I>RRC,</I> 55). Signifiers are 'collaged'
together but often fail to produce coherent sequences (<I>RAS,</I>
200). In place of the modernist's commitment to the development of a
particular style, the postmodernist is not interested in style conceived
as a consistent, integrated set of aesthetic elements but in pastiche and
bringing together disparate elements from many previous texts, regardless
of whether they produce a coherent entity. Because many of the texts that
postmodernists plunder are works that were widely disseminated in the past
and hence meaningful to many people, postmodernism creates feelings of
nostalgia for the past. According to Goldman, the meaning of postmodernist
texts cannot be discerned from analyzing the texts themselves, but only
by asking where the elements in the text come from (<I>RAS,</I> 214).

<P>
The social content or significance of the postmodernist work is
not that of opposition to the dominant culture but that of exposing
or reinterpreting subversive elements in the dominant culture and
in minority cultures. According to Connor, "Much postmodern aesthetic
theory . . . attempts to restore the repressed political dimensions of
aesthetic and cultural activity of all kinds" (<I>PC,</I> 224).

<P>
The social context of postmodernism in terms of an organizational
environment for the production or display of these works is left
unspecified. Unlike the works of modernist avant-gardes, which were
generally created and displayed in very distinct settings in a relatively
small number of major Western cities, postmodernist works are created
in a great variety of settings, ranging from organizations that produce
culture on an industrial scale to small groups that belong to minority
cultures and work with very minimal resources.

2. Fashion Design and the Emergence of an Avant-garde
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
The connections between fashion and the avant-garde are intriguing because
both are concerned with what one art critic described years ago as "the
shock of the new." However, the two terms have very different connotations
in the popular mind. The term "fashion," particularly when applied to
clothing, refers to a phenomenon that is new but has been rapidly and
widely accepted, implying that its acceptance does not require a major
shift in world view on the part of the public. It is in tune with the
zeitgeist. By contrast, the term "avant-garde" implies a phenomenon
that is difficult to understand because it challenges the public's
preconceptions and consequently is not immediately accepted by the public.

<P>
According to the best known model of the diffusion of fashion, new
styles are first accepted by members of the upper class and gradually
spread to members of the middle and lower classes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 When a
new style has become widely accepted, it is abandoned by the upper class
in favor of a new one. This model assumes the existence of a dominant
style that is widely followed, and is a fairly accurate description of
the diffusion of fashion in Europe and America during the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries (until, approximately, the 1960s). The role
of the fashion designer was epitomized by Charles Frederick Worth, an
Englishman who worked in Paris and created styles that were adopted by
European royalty and aristocracies and by the upper middle class and the
demimonde of courtesans and actresses. Worth initiated the tradition of
<I>haute couture,</I> clothes made to order for clients who bought them
directly from designers. Fashion design as <I>haute couture</I> emphasized
style and technique: style, such as the dominant silhouette, provided
a unifying theme; technical details provided diversity. Fashion evolved
according to its own internal dynamic, following a logical succession of
cycles based on shapes of the skirt; bell, back-fullness (the bustle),
and tubular.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Clothing had to be perfectly executed,
as customers knew that it would be carefully scrutinized at social
gatherings by friends and acquaintances. Decisions by Paris designers to
use a particular type of material or accessory had enormous consequences
for fashion industries in the Western world, affecting the prices of
textiles and sometimes the survival of entire factories.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>


<P>
During most of this period, while clothing styles at times changed
radically, fashion change was not associated with an avant-garde. True,
some designers had considerable influence on the way women dressed in the
early twentieth century; but they rarely sought to challenge established
aesthetic conventions or comment on social relationships through their
use of clothing motifs. For example, Gabrielle Chanel, who was a major
contributor to the costume of twentieth century women, produced very
simple clothes, stripped of superfluous detail and decoration, that could
be (and were) repeated endlessly with slight variations. Her innovations
included the simple black dress that she advocated as a basic item for
every woman's wardrobe, the cardigan suit that became most famous when
she revived it in the 1950s (when she was in her seventies), and the
sweater which quickly replaced blouses for many purposes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

Her clothes were compared to uniforms and to assembly-line 
<b></b>
 products like
cars. When it first appeared, <I>Vogue</I> described her black dress
as "a Ford signed Chanel."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Her clothes were intended for
women of all social ranks, although only the rich could afford to buy
the clothes she actually sold. Since her clothes were easy to copy, her
designs were quickly made available to a very diverse clientele.

<P>
During the same period, the clothes created by another major fashion
innovator, Madeleine Vionnet, did not evolve from one season to
another, but in any particular season her collection exhibited
a complete repertoire of her major technique: different types of
draping.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Vionnet's research on drapery led to innovations
that had an enormous influence on other designers and that are still
important today. According to Milbank, "Vionnet was called the Euclid
of fashion, and geometric shapes predominate in all her collections as
decorative and functional devices . . . [her] clothes were masterpieces
of the art of dresssmaking (<I>CGD,</I> 163).

<P>
Probably the first fashion designer whose work can truly be characterized
as avant-garde was Elsa Schiaparelli, who began her career in the late
1920s. Like Chanel, she was a close friend of leading avant-garde artists
of the period, such as Marcel Duchamp, Francis Picabia, Tristan Tzara,
and Salvador Dali; but unlike Chanel, who was primarily a patron rather
than a collaborator, Schiaparelli attempted to translate the ideas of
dada and surrealist artists into clothing design.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>


<P>
Schiaparelli's designs in the 1930s were not merely influenced by
surrealism, but constituted a very real collaboration with a group of
artists who were exploring the significance of the body and clothing in
their paintings and sculpture. The results of this collaboration were
clothes that challenged aesthetic norms and traditions prevalent in the
construction and design of Western clothing and that questioned, at times,
political and social ideologies rising in prominence during the decade.

<P>
Surrealism provided Schiaparelli with an aesthetic rationale for
engaging in outrageous experiments in which artifacts and body parts
were placed in unusual locations, such as a hat in the form of a shoe
and eyes, lips, or arms becoming decoration for dresses and coats. The
goal of the surrealists was to create new connotations for body parts
and familiar artifacts, dismantling familiar connections and creating
new, surprising alliances. The intent was to disrupt normal thought
processes, to subvert conventional meanings, and to stimulate new and
possibly irrational associations (<I>FAS,</I> 108)

<P>
With Salvador Dali, Schiaparelli collaborated on the creation of the Tear
Illusion Dress in which a dress with pictures of tears in its fabric was
paired with a cape in which the tears were real, thus violating the norm
of perfection inherent in designer clothing and intimating associations
between expensive clothing and the dilapidated clothing of the poor
(<I>FAS,</I> 114).

<P>
The difference between Schiaparelli and other designers of that period can
also be interpreted in terms of Becker's distinction between craftsmen
and artists.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Becker defines a craft as a compilation of
knowledge and skills that can be used to produce useful or beautiful
objects, such as pottery, furniture, and clothing. According to 
<b></b>
 Becker,
craftsmen produce their work to order--for clients or employers. For
ordinary craftsmen, utility is the major factor in evaluating his or her
creations, while for artist-craftsman beauty and aesthetic qualities are
paramount. The works of artist-craftsmen often become minor arts. They
may be displayed in museums and art galleries and win awards. These
craftsmen are less dependent on evaluation of their work by individual
clients; instead they are evaluated by a larger circle of gatekeepers,
including directors of art galleries and museum curators.

<P>
The artist-craftsman develops and perfects his techniques, rather than
subverting them. Most <I>haute couture</I> designers before the 1960s
were artist-craftsmen. One of the leading designers in Paris in the
postwar period, who epitomized the tradition of <I>haute couture</I>, was
Balenciaga whose approach has been described as follows: "Armed with a
very elaborate technique that he had himself invented, he did not cease
to develop and perfect it without abandoning the canons which constituted
his style: rigor, unremitting effort, elegance and beauty."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>


<P>
The difference between these artist-craftsmen and avant-garde artists
is seen when the latter "invade" crafts. In this situation, avant-garde
artists use the skills of the craftsman, but the objects they make are
deliberately neither useful nor beautiful. Instead, the artist who is
using craft skills to make art works attempts to create objects that are
unique--totally different from other objects. For example, a contemporary
fashion designer, Jean-Paul Gaultier, playing the role of avant-garde
innovator recently showed an outfit the front of which was an elegant
Balenciaga-style sculpted white dress while the back was completely bare
except for fishnet hose and a flower.

3. Fashion Design and Avant-gardes in the Age of Postmodernism
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Beginning in the 1960s, understanding fashion change requires a new
model. Fashion change can no longer be understood entirely as a process
of diffusion from elites to the rest of the population. Instead, in any
particular season, there are numerous styles worn by members of different
age groups and different life styles. Some fashions diffuse downward
from elites and others diffuse upward from denizens of urban minority
ghettos.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Some styles are not diffused at all, but remain in
the enclaves where they originated. Young designers are less concerned
with setting fashion than with establishing a personal style and thereby
achieving visibility in the fashion world. Designers who continue to
extend the tradition of <I>haute couture</I> are disappearing. In this
chaotic environment, it is possible to identify designers whose work is
avant-gardist or postmodernist, though many designers vacillate between
the two.

<P>
One group we may call "the classicists." They represent an older
generation of designers who continue to observe the conventions of
<I>haute couture</I>, making beautiful clothes in the tradition of the
artist-craftsman. On the occasion of the retirement of one of the last
members of this group, Hubert de Givenchy, <I>Le</I> <I>Monde's</I>
fashion 
<b></b>
critic commented: "His collection . . . was a manifesto
of balance, clarity, rigor, the grammar of French taste applied to
couture. . . . Each detail conformed to an absolute order of lines, of
perfect diagonals, of silk jackets that never creased against the body,
but still clung to it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>


<P>
The approach to fashion design that underlies the tradition of <I>haute
couture</I> is one in which styles and techniques evolve over time, as
exemplified in the work of Balenciaga. According to Milbank, "Balenciaga's
whole work was thematic, each collection growing out of the last; his
collections, in fact, were more intrinsically related than those of
practically any other couturier" (<I>CGD,</I> 320).

<P>
As an example of the nature of his creative style, he invented the
three-quarter sleeve but in the process experimented with numerous
variations: "manche mont&eacute;e non ajust&eacute;e, raglan, pivot,
pingouin, gigot, dolman, chauve-souris."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Similarly, in the
1950s, Dior devised a series of new silhouettes, to which he gave names
taken from the letters of the alphabet: the H line, the A line, the Y
line, and the S line. These lines were created, systematically varying
the basic components of a dress: the width of the shoulders and the
fullness and narrowness of the skirt.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>


<P>
A second group of designers might be called "the avant-gardists." For
them, <I>haute couture</I> has functioned analogously to an established
art style, against whose conventions they have rebelled. One of the
first designers in the postwar period to engage in avant-gardism was Paco
Rabanne. Beginning in the 1960s, he created clothes that were so original
that many of them were virtually unwearable. His goal has been to use
materials that have not been considered appropriate for clothing, such
as metals and plastics, which he views as representative of contemporary
life (he believes that cloth will eventually disappear). His self-image is
that of an artist, a sculptor making works that are unique.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

"Real creativity is iconoclastic," he has recently said. "The future
will belong to the person who explodes fashion."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 His work is
in many museums, but it is not clear whether it should be classified as
"sculpture," "industrial design," or "fashion."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>


<P>
Another means of challenging aesthetic conventions involves the
creation of clothes that express values that are the antithesis of those
expressed in Western clothing generally and in the French tradition of
<I>haute couture</I> specifically. A Japanese designer, Rei Kawakubo,
who is based in Japan but shows her collections semiannually in Paris,
created clothes in the early 1980s that violated major characteristics of
Western clothing as epitomized by <I>haute couture</I>. Western clothes
are expected to be symmetrical. By contrast, symmetry is unimportant in
traditional Japanese clothing and in the work of Kawakubo. For example, a
dress may have three sleeves or one side of a jacket may be longer than
the other. Another characteristic of French <I>haute couture</I> which
Kawakubo's clothes have violated is perfection of craftsmanship; hand
stitching is expected to be perfect, the cut impeccable. Rei Kawakubo
has designed sweaters that are full of holes and dresses with unfinished
ragged hems.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Machines are deliberately manipulated so that
what they produce is flawed (<I>RK,</I> 80).
<b></b>


<P>
Clothes with holes or other imperfections are also viewed as social
statements, as oblique references to the clothes of homeless women and
as veiled attacks on the decadence of western fashion (<I>RK,</I> 80). In
Paris and other fashion capitals, the effect of Kawakubo's clothes in the
early eighties was iconoclastic. According to Sudjic, "Placed against the
background of mainstream fashion of the period . . . Kawakubo's designs
were radically unfamiliar. Indeed some of her garments were interpreted
as an out-and-out assault <I>on the very idea of fashion"</I> (<I>RK,</I>
70, author's italics).

<P>
In the 1990s, young designers like Jean Colonna and Martin Margiela
also produce clothes that deliberately defy the perfect craftsmanship
of <I>haute couture</I>: trousers that are too small, rumpled jackets
and dresses, jackets attached in the middle of the back with a large
safety pin, and jackets with buttons and buttonholes that do not
align.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Even more iconoclastic because it constitutes a threat
to the economic basis of fashion is Margiela's project of creating new
styles from cutup pieces of second-hand garments (<I>SS,</I> 114).

<P>
Subverting the aesthetic conventions of <I>haute couture</I> was also
an objective of the early collections of French designer Jean-Paul
Gaultier. His work was characterized by avant-gardist transformations
of widely accepted values and icons in the <I>haute couture</I>
tradition: using a type of costume associated with one activity for
another very different purpose (an aviator's jacket becomes part of
an evening dress), or taking up details from lingerie (corsets serve
as outerwear). Alternatively, Gaultier took a major icon of <I>haute
couture,</I> the Chanel jacket, and reproduced it in fake fur using as
a belt a chain made for flushing a toilet.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 His objective
was to change the usual meanings attributed to clothes and other objects
that could be appropriated as apparel, such as the jam jar lids that he
used to make bracelets. His philosophy was that, in terms of aesthetic
values, anything was possible and nothing was sacred. In contrast to the
way clothing had been interpreted previously, he showed that the same
piece of clothing could be interpreted in many different ways, depending
upon how and with what it was presented.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Contrary to the
previous norms of fashionable dress, Gaultier argued that being in fashion
depended not so much on <I>what</I> one wore, but <I>how</I> one wore it.

<P>
Some designers, particularly women, have been engaged in subverting social
conventions concerning the way that gender is expressed in clothing. For
example, Kawakubo's designs do not conform to norms concerning the
expression and enhancement of female sexuality in the tradition of
<I>haute couture</I>; her clothes conceal rather than enhance female
sexual attributes. Martin describes her as suppressing sexuality and
sensuality: "Every seduction of flesh is forsaken, every indication of
eros is sublimated."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Kawakubo has explained her point of
view as follows: "We must break away from conventional forms of dress
for the new woman of today. We need a strong new image, not to revisit
the past" (<I>RK,</I> 81).

<P>
Other designers ridicule stereotypical notions of female sexuality by
emphasizing them to an extreme degree. According to Drier, "Parodying the
stereotype, taking it to extremes . . . they begin to open the way--to
humor, to play, potentially to the 
<b></b>
freedom to reconstruct, and thus
redefine the terms of what it means to be a woman."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>


<P>
Another characteristic of the avant-garde is the attempt to redefine the
social role of the artist and the context in which art is displayed and
distributed. The avant-garde artist assumed the role of rebel or, at the
very least, the role of someone who was sufficiently marginal to be able
to attack social conventions. Some fashion designers express a sense of
personal alienation of a sort that has been traditionally associated with
the avant-garde artist, such as Japanese fashion designer Yohji Yamamoto:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Our work, like all creative activity, ought to rip apart the opaque
curtain of social conventions. We are agitators, and, at the same time, we
have to try to belong to the establishment. This is one of the paradoxical
aspects of our activity. The Americans say to me: "Mr. Yamamoto, you
are not successful." I reply: "Thank you." The notion of success in the
American sense has nothing to do with my work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Finally, some fashion designers have altered the context in which their
work is displayed by showing their collections in locations that lack
the connotations of elegance and wealth that are generally associated
with designer clothing, such as subway stations, supermarkets in poor
neighborhoods, and abandoned housing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 The stores where
these clothes are sold are also used to convey statements about the
artistic intentions of the designers. Working closely with architects,
Kawakubo invented decors for her shops that were totally different from
those of traditional shops selling women's clothing or other types of
merchandise for personal consumption. Sudjic reports that her stores
"bore no resemblance to the traditions of shop design as they existed
at that time, no merchandise was visible in the window and little was
on show within the store itself" (<I>RK,</I> 114).

<P>
Frequently imitated in the subsequent decade, her stores have more in
common with the white, pristine spaces of many art galleries devoted
to modern or contemporary art than with traditional department stores
or boutiques. One consequence of the austere and somewhat forbidding
environments in which her clothes were sold was a redefinition of the
traditional clientele for luxury clothes: socialites, actresses, and
businesswomen. As Sudjic points out, "Instead of broadcasting its wares to
passers-by, the store acted as a filter. Its character demanded a certain
confidence from the customer--those who would not feel comfortable with
the clothes would be unlikely to brave the shop" (<I>RK,</I> 114).

<P>
As is the case with many of the avant-garde designers who violate
aesthetic conventions of <I>haute couture</I>, Kawakubo's clientele in
the West consists largely of intellectuals, artists, professionals, and
women who work in the fashion industry. "These," according to Sudjic,
"are clothes that appeal to those who see themselves as outside of the
conventional idea of fashion" (<I>RK,</I> 81).

<P>
A third group of designers might be called "the postmodernists." While
the avant-gardist attempts to be iconoclastic, in however minor a way, the
postmodernist 
<b></b>
prefers to play on ambiguity, creating effects that can
be interpreted in different ways or are difficult to interpret because
they are not intended to express a clear message. A Belgian designer,
Ann Demeulemeester, attempts to create gender ambiguity by blurring
binary categories: "I try always to design a woman who is at the same
time masculine and feminine. . . . A person who would be too masculine
or too feminine would be less appealing to me: a style which favors only
coquettish and very feminine women seems void to me."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>


<P>
Androgyny prevails, luxury is undercut with "street looks," and pastiche
dominates--the continual reshuffling of fragments of preexisting
texts. While in the past designers drew on previous styles to create new
work, today they simply recreate them in order to juxtapose different
periods and ambiences. The difference between these approaches to the past
can be seen in Dior's adaptation of late nineteenth-century style. Rather
than producing a copy, he used elements from the older style to create
what is probably the most famous twentieth-century style, the New Look. By
contrast, a postmodernist, John Galliano, duplicates styles from different
periods and juxtaposes them in the same collection.

<P>
An analogue to the postmodernist project of repudiating the modernist
cult of originality by creating and selling identical copies of famous
paintings (<I>PC,</I> 239) is found in the work of Belgian designer Martin
Margiela, who recently consecrated his collection to the production of
exact copies of collections of clothing that had been created decades
before. What he chose to copy, however, were collections that had
no prestige whatsoever in the tradition of <I>haute couture</I>: the
complete wardrobe of a doll in the sixties, ceremonial robes from the
turn of the century, and black school uniforms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>


<P>
The postmodernist designer also redefines the public's relationship to
fashionable clothes. According to this approach, fashion is an individual
matter; each woman is expected to assemble her own style of dress, one
that is appropriate for her, from a variety of elements, rather than
automatically purchasing and consuming a total look. The fashionable woman
is seen as an individual who does not espouse a single style but uses a
variety of styles in order to express different facets of her personality
or to enable her to participate in a variety of social settings. This
attitude toward the clientele contrasts with that traditionally expressed
in <I>haute</I> <I>couture</I> that the client was expected to be dressed
exclusively by a single couturier, who dictated an entire wardrobe.

<P>
Some designers are identified with both avant-gardist and postmodernist
strategies. A British designer, Vivienne Westwood, who shows her
collections in Paris, exemplifies a postmodernist approach to fashion
design in terms of her emphasis on parody and ambiguity. One example from
a 1990 collection was an outfit entitled "Half-dressed City Gent" which
consisted of a man's large shirt with a loose collar and a tie worn with
pink knickers on which was a graffiti of an enormous penis. An item from
her 1989 collection for men was a pair of tights, intended for women,
with 
<b></b>
a leaf covering the genitals. Worn with traditional male
attire on the feet, the intention was to cultivate doubt.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>

Is the person male or female?

<P>
Westwood's method of making clothes has been compared with that of a
nineteenth-century avant-garde poet, Arthur Rimbaud. What they have in
common, argues Ash, is a technique of "surmontage" ("PC," 175), the
layering of idea upon idea, "a sort of surmontage of dissimilarities
(cultural and technical) from which comes a new form and from which
emerges a new idea, whether concerning sexuality, dress, cut, history,
painting, music, dance, catwalk performance, philosophy, age, youth, time"
("PC," 165).

<P>
In the mid-1970s Westwood, in collaboration with a music entrepreneur,
created one of the most successful oppositional clothing styles,
punk. Abuse of the body and clothing expressed derisive and nihilistic
attitudes toward establishment values. They used razor-slashed t-shirts,
sewn to simulate scars, t-shirts showing the Queen of England with a
safety pin through her nose and mouth, bondage chains, and hair styles
in garish colors.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 In 1975, Westwood's partner organized the
first punk band, the Sex Pistols, comprised of working-class men from the
neighborhood near their clothing store, and dressed them in this style.

<P>
The "punk sensibility" applied to fashion design continued to be
perceived as avant-garde, even in the early 1990s. Counter-cultural
styles, like punk, are able to violate social taboos to a much greater
extent than is possible for designers who have to sell clothes to the
general public, and provide the principal examples of this type of
avant-gardism. In the case of punk, offshoots, such as body piercing,
drag, and sadomasochistic dress, were adopted primarily by the young and
by sexual and racial minorities. Their eventual adoption by mainstream
designers, such as Calvin Klein, signaled the end of their identification
as avant-garde.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 Countercultural styles are frequently copied
by fashion designers, an indication of a postmodernist sensibility, but
the change of context has the effect of negating oppositional elements.

4. Postmodernist and Avant-gardist Themes in Designer Collections
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
An examination of descriptions of French designer collections over a
ten-year period reveals that certain themes have recurred year after
year.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Rather than evolving or progressing, the styles
presented each year by French designers have fluctuated in their relative
emphasis on a set of themes that can be conceptualized in terms of binary
oppositions. Four dominant themes recur: futurity-tradition, masculinity-
femininity, luxury-pauperism, and bodily concealment or nudity. Typically
the avant-garde designer has emphasized the binary pole that appeared to
be the antithesis of luxury fashion, while the postmodernist has engaged
in a strategy of blurring binary opposites.

<P>
Futurity-tradition was one of the most prevalent themes: a postmodernist
blurring of time periods, often with emphasis on nostalgia for the past,
the passage from old to new, past to present, ethnic to contemporary. What
has led to the increasing use 
<b></b>
of intertextuality as an aesthetic
technique is the phenomenon of "semiotic layering" that results from
the constant proliferation and continual redefinition of images in
all the visual media (film, television, advertising, painting, and
fashion). Turim defines it as "the accrual and transformation of meanings
associated with an artifact as it passes through history, or as it is
presented in different versions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 Media culture has provided
"visual databanks" that are constantly being redisseminated and make the
past immediately available in a way that was never possible before, a
phenomenon that permits postmodernist designers to play on the multiple
meanings that have become attached to artifacts and styles from the
distant and recent past.

<P>
In the same season, it was typical for designers to revive clothing
styles identified with several different decades of the twentieth
century or historical periods from previous centuries. Others used an
exotic setting from the past, such as Renaissance Venice, as a source of
inspiration. While Wilson has argued that designers were drawing on past
styles long before the period that is generally defined as postmodernist,
referencing the past appears to have escalated and become increasingly
anarchic. Incorporating details from contemporary ethnic cultures is an
equivalent strategy, since ethnic cultures are remnants from earlier
periods; it has provided an additional source of ambiguity based on
cultural fusion. Africa, India, China, and Islam were frequently evoked
in these collections. One designer was described in the following terms:
"In a great melting-pot of motifs and forms, Christian Lacroix pays
homage to all the folklores of the world. His luxurious hippies jump
without transition from a large peasant dress to a knotted outfit with
multi-colored Peruvian stripes and pearled fringes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>


<P>
By contrast, futurity, an attempt to create designs with no references
whatsoever to the past, rarely appeared. Only a Japanese designer based
in Paris, Issey Miyake, produced season after season extraordinary
shapes using materials never before used for clothing. According to one
description, "His clothes, danced rather than worn, seemed to weigh
nothing on the body and adhere to the slightest movement. It is the
effect of a transparent gauze made from a fiber which captures light
and clings gently to the skin."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>


<P>
The theme of sexual ambiguity (masculinity-femininity) also appeared year
after year in many of these collections. Sexual ambiguity was evoked by
juxtaposing items identified with masculine and feminine clothing. In
1991, the Paris collections for summer, 1992, included the following:
men's jackets in dark colors worn over a brassiere or a bustier of
thin strips of plastic; over-sized men's jackets over tops made out
of material that resembled a course fisherman's net; neckties worn
with skirts with seams open to the hip; severe men's jackets worn over
bodysuits in leather.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
Fashion reporters spoke of designers
"playing in depth with masculine-feminine ambiguity" or "playing with the
idea of the masculine."
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 While in some collections, masculine
and feminine themes were mixed in the same costume, in others, they were
mixed in the collection as a whole: men's jackets, vests, and trousers
alternating with nudity, transparency, and cut-outs. While women have
incorporated elements 
<b></b>
of masculine clothing into their outfits for
centuries, the extent of gender blurring in these collections is peculiar
to the contemporary period.

<P>
The theme of luxury-pauperism entailed elements of avant-garde
subversion and opposition, including the juxtaposition of minimalism
to the perfection of couture clothing, asymmetry to symmetry, and
street fashion to luxury. The simulation of poverty in clothing can be
interpreted as commentary on the excessive luxury of fashion (exemplified
in these collections by the use of expensive materials and embroidery, and
the reappearance of trains with evening dresses). Younger designers were
particularly likely to create clothes that suggested poverty in response
to luxury. Pauperist motifs included partially unraveled sweaters or
sleeves, seams on the outside of clothing, torn materials, and clothing
that was either too large or too small. "Everything is a question of the
means, of details, of the method of treating materials. One tears them,
one crushes them, one burns them. One covers them with 'dirty' marks,
bleaches them or, alternatively adds rich embroidery."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>


<P>
One designer's collection was described as "wandering between Sarajevo
and the Salvation Army" while another designer's clothes in the same
season exhibited "exceptional opulence." In one collection, pauperism was
contained in a single detail, an unfinished row of stitches and a piece
of thread dangling on the front of a dress. A subtheme of pauperism was
a concern for ecology, indicated by an emphasis on simple materials such
as raphia and hemp and the use of shells and pebbles for jewelry.

<P>
A fourth theme, concealment-nudity, became increasingly popular
during the decade. Breasts and midriffs were bare or covered with
transparent materials or with crochet or net that revealed as much as
they concealed. In one collection, a bridal costume consisted of nothing
more than a bouquet of flowers and a piece of string. Lingerie such as
brassieres and corsets frequently replaced outerwear.

<P>
The significance of this theme is ambiguous. In the past, female nudity
has generally evoked powerlessness and subordination. However, emphasis
on female nudity in collections by both male and female designers may
reflect changing attitudes toward female sexuality; it can suggest the
idea that women are capable of dominating, rather than being dominated
in, sexual relationships. Pop singer Madonna defends her use of explicitly
pornographic imagery in her videos by claiming that she remains in control
of her image and that she is not a passive sex object.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 In
this sense, emphasis on nudity can be interpreted as an avant-gardist
violation of a bourgeois taboo.

<P>
The overall effect of these collections was one of enormous variety
and apparent change because different elements in the repertoire were
evoked each season. In fact, however, the underlying themes remained very
similar. Each piece of clothing could be deciphered in terms of a complex
set of allusions to the past and to various sexual identities. Some items
of clothing could be interpreted as "assaults" on the entire enterprise of
luxury fashion or as commentaries on bourgeois conceptions of concealment
of the body. At the same time, these collections included other types
of 
<b></b>
avant-gardism (such as jackets that were designed not to be
closed) and numerous examples of surrealism (a hat consisting of a box of
Kleenex worn with a costume constructed of a material that looked and felt
like paper; a "trompe l'oeil" of blue jeans painted on canvas trousers).

<P>

5. Conclusion
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
In the field of poplar culture, postmodernist approaches appear to coexist
uneasily with avant-gardism. Holding the attention of audiences that
are increasingly sophisticated at interpreting complex visual and verbal
imagery requires the use of more varied techniques than were necessary
before the emergence of the electronic media.In fashion design, the
avant-gardist attempts to subvert aesthetic conventions by taking
an oppositional stance, while the postmodernist oscillates between
conventional and unconventional codes, creating effects of polysemy,
ambiguity, and parody. For the avant-gardist, the major technique for
communicating meaning is symbolic subversion; for the postmodernist,
intertextuality. These two tendencies have displaced the classical
approach to fashion design that reworked elements from the past to produce
styles that, while related to the past, were neither copies nor pastiches.

<P>
The oppositional qualities of avant-gardism are muted when juxtaposed
with postmodernism. For the prototypical avant-garde artist of the past,
avant-gardism constituted his or her entire identity: it influenced
not only art works, but social relationships and political views. But
for many practitioners of avant-gardism in popular culture, it is
merely a technique, not an identity, a device that is adopted for a
specific purpose and quickly abandoned. Emphasis on avant-gardism and
postmodernism, in both elite and popular culture, has led to enormous
variety, but not to evolutionary change or coherent messages. In the
deflationary atmosphere of postmodernism, the mystique of the avant-garde
has been submerged--perhaps forever.
