<P>
I want to return to Marjorie Perloff's point about Michaels's terminology
and periodization, in order to confirm her claim that the scope of <I>Our
America</I> is less comprehensive than its subtitle suggests. The term in
dispute is of course modernism, which is conventionally distinguished from
a good deal of writing, painting, and music produced by twentieth-century
artists. Modernism indicates some affiliation by resemblance or avowal
across the generic boundaries of music, painting, and literature, or even
intellectual disciplines like physics, philosophy, psychology, and
sociology between the years--in Anglo-American academic literary
history--1909, taking the first Futurist manifesto as the starting point,
and maybe 1930 or a little later.

<P>
Michaels's nativist modernism is much more nativist than modernist: the
connections of his authors to international trends in other arts or areas
of expression are faint (William Carlos Williams and Langston Hughes are
the exceptions). One reason this matters is that terms like modernism and
romanticism are reserved for especially comprehensive historical trends,
such as seem in motion when artists or thinkers in diverse media begin to
collaborate. Michaels's subject is a distinct range of modern writing more
than modernism. His period begins with the end of World War I and runs
through the 1920s, which in literary-historical terms was a time of
fruition more than inception. Modernism in the English language peaked in
1922, when <I>The Waste Land</I> and <I>Ulysses</I> appeared, and 1923,
when William Carlos Williams's <I>Spring and All</I> was brought out at
his own expense, and Ezra Pound wrote the


<B></B>


Malatesta Cantos. A good
fourteen years of intellectual and especially artistic agitation and a
world war led to the peak of those years.

<P>
Michaels's nativist modernism is fearful of contact with the new
immigrants and even more of African Americans. The attraction to incest in
William Faulkner, and other authors, as Michaels shows, expresses just
this phobia. Michaels presents a strong case for a close fit between
literary and political history--Willa Cather's <I>The Professor's
House,</I> for instance, and the Immigration Act and the Indian
Citizenship Act of 1924 (<I>OA,</I> 30)--that serves our short-term
professional interests well. Do literary historians engage the issues that
determine the future of our America? Yes, certainly: the texts we teach
address just the issues that govern debate about political and social
policy. The long-term problem is exactly this reassuring fit. If literary
history fits social and political history too snugly, it becomes
redundant, after one has examined the history of legislation, say. Fear of
immigrants in Congress, the courts, and then--small surprise--in novels
and poems too.

<P>
Literary history is better justified just where it records some deviance
from social, political, and institutional history. The deviance I have in
mind is visible when writers dream of a different country than the one to
which they are born. Michaels loves to expose the nativist-modernist
folly--articulated by Calvin Coolidge--of becoming what you already are.
But I think of Ernst Bloch's courageous advocacy of French surrealism in
<I>Heritage of Our Times</I>  just when Germany was enforcing Nazi
conformity;
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 his claim, taken up by Fredric Jameson in <I>The
Political Unconscious,</I> is that literary texts rightly desire a
different world. Bloch wrote in 1918 that the "spirit of utopia exists in
the ultimate predicate of all great expressions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 That is the
revolutionary dimension of artistic expression. Michaels excavates a
spirit of realism and conformity instead, or a neat fit between political
history and artistic expression.

<P>
My point can be felt more concretely in the case of William Carlos
Williams. Michaels rightly shows how Williams enthusiastically expresses
Coolidge's impulse to become more American, but Williams's deviant
imagination of rape and miscegenation complicates this picture. <I>Spring
and All</I>  is about violation, though significantly not incestuous
violation. The core myth there is that of the abduction of Persephone, the
crossing of virginal purity with hellish alterity. Remember too that
P&egrave;re Rasles, the male hero of <I>In the American Grain</I> ,
is distinguished by his will "TO MARRY . . . to hybridize, to
crosspollenize" with the North American continent and its Indian
inhabitants; Jacataqua, a female hero of the book, is distinguished as a
leader by "her mixed French and Indian blood."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Her power and
articulateness comes not from being one of a tribe of Indians (the rest of
her tribe seems not to speak or act), but from being both European and
Indian. Hybridity meant the invention of new subjects, of new life forms.
Michaels's account of the many white writers who romanticized simply
becoming Indians is only one part of the imaginative life of the time.

<P>
Williams, Marianne Moore (as David Kadlec has shown), and Pound were all
fascinated by exogamy, hybridity, crossings.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Pound fondly
remembered the brilliance of Henri Gaudier-Brzeska's conversation in
prewar London; "It might be exogamy,"


<B></B>


Pound said of the topics, "or
the habits of primitive tribes, . . . or aesthetics."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
Pound's
account of the merits of literary translation is red in just these
terms: one literature needs the "cross" with its contrary, or other; this
is the life of literature. He himself set out from a suburb of
Philadelphia, where his parents did missionary social work with Italian
immigrants at the beginning of the century, to begin his literary career
in Venice. When he got to London he spent years hammering at British
insularity, insisting above all that the English recognize their need for
southern Mediterranean literary culture. When he returned to America in
1912, uncertain whether his literary future lay in the States or Europe,
this is what he described:

<P>

I see . . . a sign in the surging crowd on Seventh Avenue (New York). A
crowd pagan as ever imperial Rome was, eager, careless, with an animal
vigour unlike that of any European crowd that I have ever looked at. There
is none of the melancholy, the sullenness, the unhealth of the London
mass, none of the worn vivacity of Paris. I do not believe it is the
temper of Vienna.
<BR>
<BR>
One returns from Europe and one takes note of the size and vigour of
this new strange people. They are not Anglo-Saxon; their gods are not the
gods whom one was reared to reverence. And one wonders what they have to
do with lyric measures and the nature of "quantity."
<BR>
<BR>
One knows that they are the dominant people and that they are
against all delicate things.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
It would require only a little archaeology on the first paragraph to show
that Pound's vision of the urban crowd derives from the
fin-de-si&egrave;cle European race discourse about degeneration. This new
strange people is a mongrel mass, as Pound sees it, and he admires it,
even while fearing its rude vitality. This is the prose of the Progressive
era, not Michaels's nativist-modernist period, and Michaels identifies a
greater flexibility about race among Progressive writers than among their
slightly later colleagues. Pound had only irony then for the American
interest "in being itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 He was, as Keith Tuma has shown,
very influenced by Progressive policy, but was he to just that extent not
a modernist?
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Are we to think of the poet-critic who developed
an immensely influential program for literary translation, related closely
to this passage from <I>Patria Mia,</I> as simply working out the
consequences in the 1920s of Progressive thought?

<P>
This is the moment to question the aptness of literary history positing a
divide at 1918, as American political historians do, rather than at 1914,
as American and European cultural historians commonly do. The difference
in periodization here is short, in historical terms, but significant.
Michaels's nativist modernism begins after World War I, which is to say
after intellectuals had been forced to abandon dreams of a comprehensive
European culture based on a confederation of European states--another
Enlightenment. The surrender of that hope is just what enables Perloff and
many cultural historians to distinguish the enthusiasm and radicalism of
the <I>avant guerre</I> from the grimmer years that interest Michaels.

<P>
Michaels argues cogently that "America would mean something different in
1925 from what it had meant at, say, the turn of the century; indeed, the
very idea of


<B></B>


national identity would be altered" (<I>OA,</I> 2). His
further claim is that international modernists such as Pound and T. S.
Eliot were more of the old world than of the new, because they never saw
the work that the concept of race would come to perform. My point then is
that stay-at-home modernists like Williams and Moore, as well as
international modernists like Pound and Eliot, saw the need to become not
just what you already are but in fact something entirely new: namely,
hybrids. How wonderful, really, that just when legislators were promoting
exclusive immigration policies, some writers were exploiting not just that
impulse, as Michaels shows, but its contrary too. That, I think, begins to
look like a literary history that recovers some of the richness of an
intellectual life worth living.

<P>
The issue of literary evaluation arises when one examines an understanding
of American modernism that does not accommodate Pound, Eliot, or Moore.
Michaels was recently asked by a student why we should admire or even care
about his nativist-modernist authors who apparently excelled at
constructing rationalizations for Negrophobic racism. <I>Our America</I>
suggests that Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Cather, and others are
considerable authors exactly because they engaged meaningfully with the
ideas and crises of their moment. This is an evaluative argument
altogether familiar to readers of nineteenth-century criticism and social
thought: literature is considerable because it takes up the live thought
of its moment. Authors who labor with the senescent thought of their
predecessors are by this account less considerable. For example, Henry
James's preoccupation with class difference just when race was displacing
class as a principle of social differentiation left him seeming
pass&eacute; or, in Michaels's words, "insufficiently alert to racism's
potential as a technology of social organization" (<I>OA,</I> 56-57).
James missed an opportunity to reinvent the social thought of his time.
When Michaels speaks of the dissociation of race and culture, he is
analyzing a step in the development of political thought or culture in
America. His writers shaped that thought. However racist this thought was,
it was not stupid, as he shows; Michaels's method so vigorously explicates
the <I>reasons</I> behind this or that statement--

<P>

<P>
--that it is not surprising that he implicitly esteems logic and
effectively arrayed reasons, even when they entail ugly consequences.

<P>
Those authors whose texts were not efficiently governed by reasons and
rationales--Gertrude Stein and Moore, but poets generally, come to
mind--cannot fare well by this evaluative criterion. Another way of
putting this is to say that Michaels's method of analysis depends on quite
familiar modes of representation. The account


<B></B>


of modernism that he
intends to displace--viz., that modernism derived from a crisis in
representation--cannot be fully met by Michaels's method of paraphrase and
logical analysis. Stein's <I>Tender Buttons</I> , for instance, is
not adequately engaged (nor does Michaels try) by analyzing this or that
premise about national identity that may surface occasionally; nor can the
author of <I>Kora in Hell</I>  and <I>Spring and All</I> be
adequately engaged by a critical method that deals comfortably with the
pseudophilosophy of the posthumous <I>Embodiment of Knowledge</I> but
rather avoids the complicating illogic and excess of his poems and
expressionist prose. There is an important connection between Williams's
imaginative attraction to hybridity and extreme exogamy--as in rape by
numerous strangers
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
--and his belief that new poetic forms are
"additions to nature."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Michaels's method does not attend
closely to poetic form, let alone allow for it as a source of knowledge or
innovation.

<P>
What, then, is a just assessment of Michaels's nativist modernism? Well,
the more cosmopolitan modernism of James, Pound, Eliot, and Moore seems
actually reinvigorated by this acute examination of their successors who
made a too compliant peace with the ideas and even the laws of their time.
Nativist modernism, 1918-29, appears a distinct and dishonorable (if
not unique) chapter in the history of the Anglo-American and European
international movement in the arts known as modernism. Michaels has fully
demonstrated the need to subdivide the historical category of American
modernism in order to accommodate his nativist modernism, but it will not
do to let his term substitute for the more comprehensive term, or to
overlook the dialectic within his own period between the writers drawn to
utopian exogamy and those who imagined instead the purity of endogamy.
This dialectic is familiar to scholars of international
modernism--Marinetti's swarthy nurse and Mafarka's male
parthenogenesis
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
--and it is part of American literature too.
The endogamous impulse of Michaels's nativist modernists, such as
Faulkner, should be understood in relation to  the exogamous impulse of
"earlier" writers, such as Pound;  the exogamous impulses of other
writers of the same period, such as Moore; and  the exogamous impulses
of these same nativist modernists, because such a writer as Williams
seemed to feel the pull in both directions. The writers who did not see
the work to be done by the dissociation of race and culture seem to
Michaels to have fallen out of step with the onward march of mind. They
held instead to another vestige of the Enlightenment: the notion that
making oneself a citizen of the world or at least a European was an
ambitious and better project than making one what one already was, i. e.,
American. Given Michaels's persuasive critique of 1990s identitarian
cultural politics, it is puzzling that he underestimates the utopian
interest in exogamy and miscegenation in the larger modernist era. He
seems to esteem more highly the engag&eacute; project that he explicates
so brilliantly but also condemns.
