For centuries it was in large part through the common telling of its
stories and the imaginative loyalties they fostered that Jewish survival
was ensured. But the two enormous and linked transformations of Jewish
existence in this century--on the one hand, the Zionist move-ment and the
establishment of the state of Israel, and, on the other, the previously
unimaginable horror of the Shoah--profoundly altered the patterns
discovered in--or, as I will argue, imputed to--the nar-ratives that are
now constructed to articulate the meaning of Jewish history.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Because the kinds of stories we tell ourselves and one another are
a central portion, perhaps even the core of who we are, and, more
technically, because the ways we narrate and order those stories
are as significant in their effect as is their thematic content,
the impli-cations of literary techniques go far beyond what strictly
formalist considerations suggest. Especially when the story is one of
a com-munal historical catastrophe, there is an urge to make sense of
it by relying upon one of the most basic of all narrative techniques:
foreshadowing. Yet, implicit in foreshadowing is the image of a closed
universe in which all choices have already been made, in which human
free will can exist only in the paradoxical sense of choosing to accept
or wilfully--and vainly--rebelling against what is inevitable. This
is the case whether the foreshadowing takes place at the theological,
historical, or psychological level.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Christian apologetics, Marxist teleology, and psychological determinism
are striking instances of how powerful our impulse toward foreshadowing
can be, and illustrate how it is bound to seem arbitrarily colonizing of,
and condescending to, any moments that threaten to exceed its interpretive
grasp. Thus, the Christian Church Fathers' reduction of the Hebrew Bible
to a cycle of prefigurations of and preparations for the Gospel story
is, for all its intellectual dexterity and inventiveness (especially
the elaboration of figural allegory), rightly viewed by Jews as a
brutal impoverishment of the original texts. "Supersessionist" theology
necessarily reduces the predecessor text to an "Old Testament," whose
independent signi-ficance is annulled once it is construed as only the
first stage of a process culminating in the annunciation of a "new" and
more complete truth. Think for a moment of the Pauline Epistle in which
the wandering of the Jews in the desert is read as a <I>figura</I> of the
challenges facing the first Christian communities, or the ways in which
the Christian exegetical tradition interpreted the story of Jonah as a
prefiguration of the Savior's Passion, with the three days in the belly
of the whale foreshadowing the three days when Christ harrowed Hell. In
its encounters with the Hebrew Bible, Christian hermeneutics read the
central events of Jewish tradition as "witnessing," in the sense of
foreshadowing, the authority of its own stories. Hence, for example, the
pressure  to rename a narrative like the Hebrew Bible's <I>Akedah</I> or
"Binding" of Isaac as the "Sacrifice" of Isaac, in order to make the
Jewish story interpretable as an anticipation of Christ's sacrifice
on the cross.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Indeed, there is a strong sense in which
the very idea of history as a linear unfolding from darkness toward
light, and from ignorance toward truth is rooted neither in Jewish nor
in classical thinking, but, as Jonathan Boyarin has argued, entirely
in "the early church fathers' idea of the progression from Judaism
to Christianity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 And, much as the Jewish and pagan world
found the claims of the first Christian missionaries incomprehensible, to
someone not already persuaded of the truth of their secular revelations,
the conventional Marxist explanations of why the working class stayed
so loyal to their national governments at the outbreak of the First
World War, or of why large sections of the German proletariat adhered to
Nazism, often against their own economic interest, can seem astonishingly
dismissive of the peculiarities of each specific circumstance.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Against foreshadowing, and as its formal and theoretical antithesis,
I want to propose a concept for which Gary Saul Morson has coined
the term "sideshadowing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Sideshadowing champions the
incommensurability of the concrete and refuses the tyranny of all
synthetic master schemes; it rejects the conviction that a particular
code, law, or pattern exists, waiting to be uncovered beneath the
heterogeneity of human existence. Instead of the global regularities
that so many intellectual and spiritual movements claim to reveal,
sideshadowing stresses the significance of random, haphazard, and
inassimilable contingencies, and instead of the power of a system to
uncover an otherwise unfathomable truth, it expresses the ever-changing
nature of that truth and the absence of any predictive certainties in
human affairs. Or, in Robert Musil's more subtly ironic formulation, what
we need to recognize is the reality of underdetermination: "The Principle
of the Insufficient Cause." As Ulrich, Musil's Man without Qualities,
explains, "you know of course what the principle of the sufficient cause
is. Only, people make an exception where they themselves are concerned. In
real life, by which I mean our personal and also our public-historical
life, what happens is always what has no good cause."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To concentrate upon the sideshadowed ideas and events, upon what did not
take place, does not cast doubt upon the historicity of what occurred,
but is to view it as one among a range of possibilities, a number of
which might, with equal plausibility, have taken place instead. The one
that actually happened, though, exists from then on with all the weight
afforded by the singularity of what we might call its event-ness. Only
the brightness of an actual event can cast sufficient shadow for
sideshadowing to matter, and only the felt force of a life can give
impetus to the counterlives that seize the imagination. Counterlives
count because they are a constituent element of the lives we have, just
as it is often by the shadows the sun casts, not by its direct light,
that we can best calibrate where we stand. To keep the claims of both
the event and its unrealized alternatives in mind may be more perplexing
as a theoretical formulation than as an ongoing act, and problems that
critical habit and grammar often urge us to see cleanly divided are in
practice usually vitally, and even messily, intertwined. Accordingly, to
show just how crucial is the conjunction of life and counterlife, event
and its sideshadow, requires not so much a global schema as a sequence
of careful acts of local scrutiny focusing upon the ways particular
problems are figured in our narratives today.

Our instinctive gratitude to what frees us from the too-strictly plotted,
the too-seamlessly inevitable story, undoubtedly accounts for much of
our pleasure in experimental fiction. But this responsiveness to the
improvisatory is changed decisively at those moments when con-temporary
history and literature intersect, when the issue becomes one of
representing an event with whose occurrence we are still attempting to
come to terms.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The more devastating the event, the greater the compensatory pressure
to comprehend it according to the strictest teleological model as the
climax of a grim trajectory whose inevit-able outcome it must be. This
sense of wrenching inevitability, like a tragic hero's vain efforts to
avoid his fate, is the cornerstone not only of Aristotelian tragedy, but
of its most powerful literary descendants across genres and epochs. Yet
a historical cataclysm, no matter how ter-rible, is not a tragedy, and
to interpret it as one would denature the character of what I earlier
called its event-ness. Undeniably, when an occurrence is so destructive
for a whole people as was the Shoah, it is difficult not to respond to
it as one would to a pre-scripted tragedy, that is, to interpret it as
the simultaneously inconceivable and yet foreordained culmination of
the entire brutal history of European anti-Semitism. But tragedy is an
arranged genre and it is essential to bear in mind that no historical
event, no paradigm of struggle, resistance, and loss, can transform the
death of countless human beings into a tragedy, if only because real
events never happen as part of an already narrated form.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is important to specify that nothing I have said so far argues for
historical skepticism or questions the moral claims upon us of events
from the past. Rather than casting doubt upon the event-ness of history,
sideshadowing helps us to reckon the human cost of an occurrence

<B></B>

by
reminding us of all that its coming-into-existence made impossible. The
nonlives of the sideshadowed events that never happened are a part of
the emotional/intellectual legacy and aura of each actually occurring
event,
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 inflecting it in distinct ways, as, for example, the
extinction of the culture that sustained Yiddish as a spoken and literary
language has pro-foundly changed the way in which Jewish life has been
represented since 1945. As Berel Lang rightly insists, "the immediate
horror of the death camps has made it difficult to conjure the lives
that might have been in lieu of the deaths that were--but this, too,
obvi-ously constitutes the actual and continuing loss."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

I think that some conception of side-shadowing is already intuitively
present whenever we talk about the extent of the horror inflicted by the
Nazis; indeed without such a concept, part of the devastation wrought by
the Shoah would be permanently blocked from consciousness. Yet, while
there is nothing con-troversial about formally describing the workings
of sideshadowing in this context, entailed in that account are a number
of further implications that directly contest many of the most common
narrative practices and theoretical premises flourishing today.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To have chosen to contest the claims of foreshadowing even in narratives
of the Shoah is to confront a seemingly intractable counterinstance, on
the principle that if the validity of sideshadowing can be discerned
here, where it seems so difficult to recognize, then its pertinence
in cases that are not as morally and theoretically arduous will be
more readily apparent. If the Shoah is so critical a test case it is
precisely because it is also the one in which so much is at stake,
humanly as well as epistemologically, in the simultaneously impossible
and unavoidable debate about its meaning. At the same time, it is
important to emphasize that I am not claiming that the enormity of
the Shoah makes the consideration of more quotidian historical events
superfluous. But narratives about the Shoah can serve as exemplary test
cases for my position both because of the importance of the Shoah for
modern consciousness and because it has so often been represented through
a plot governed by a logic of historical inevitability. Such emplotment
either explicitly or implicitly rejects the relevance of sideshadowing,
and hence provides the kind of totalizing master narrative against which
the counterhistory proposed here can be heard most effectively.

The realization that we ourselves are often still deeply implicated in
historical conflicts and debates whose terms we have not so much shaped
as inherited leads to the most pervasive, but also the most pernicious,
variant of foreshadowing, the variant that I think can be best understood
as "backshadowing." In backshadowing, the shared knowledge of the
outcome of a series of events by narrator and listener is used to judge
the participants in those events <I>as though they too should have known
what was to come.</I> Thus, our knowledge of the Shoah is used to condemn
the "blindness" and "self-deception" of Austro-German Jewry for their
unwillingness to save themselves from a doom that supposedly was clear to
see. Backshadowing of this kind, and the presumptions it nourishes, run
unchecked, and often uncriticized, throughout histories, biographies, and
novels focusing on the life of

<B></B>

Austro-German Jewry, until, in Michael
Ignatieff's powerful description, "just as the cultural achievement of
the empire is overshadowed by the empire's collapse, so the achievement
of Jewish emancipation within the empire is overshadowed by its infamous
finale...In no field of historical study does one wish more fervently
that historians could write history blind to the future."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But the dilemma cannot be solved by consciously "blinding" ourselves
to the future in our histories, if only because it is not at all clear
how we either can or should try to bracket all knowledge of the Shoah
when we write about the community that perished in it. The discretion
required, a discretion that sideshadowing is particularly concerned to
teach us, is  not to see the future as preordained; and, as a direct
corollary,  not to use our know-ledge of the future as a means of
judging the decisions of those living before that (still only possible)
future has become actual event. The issue here has nothing to do with an
<I>aporia</I> of undecidability and everything to do with the demands of
decorum in its full classical sense: the difficult attempt to work out
which modes and techniques of representation are appropriately responsive
to the exigencies of different human experiences. The two linked forms of
discretion I have specified seem, as is so often the case with questions
of side-shadowing, uncontroversial enough as general principles, yet
in practice they have scarcely ever been heeded in narratives about
the Shoah. Thus, to return to Ignatieff's critique of histories of
Austro-German Jewry, "because we know that the path for Vienna's Jews
led to Mauthausen and Theresienstadt concentration camps, it is easy
to be ironic at the expense of those Jews who believed in assimilation
into a milieu that was to expel them so brutally... [But to do so is
to] evaluate the victims by the degree of prescience with which they
antic-ipate their victimhood...and add to the heavy burden of Jewish
messianic destiny, the absurd requirement that they be more prescient
than other peoples."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Such a requirement is precisely what
marks numerous accounts about the victims of the Shoah, without their
authors seeing that it drains all meaningful reality (that is, a reality
made up of specific choices and decisions) from the lives of the people
being described. In place of this reality, such accounts substitute an
often intolerable, even if unintended, superiority shared by author and
reader over the heads, as it were, of the book's subjects.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As a concentrated instance of what I have thus far defined in more general
terms, consider the following sentences from a recent and much-praised
biography of Franz Kafka. After mentioning the birth of Kafka's sister
Elli, on 15 September 1889, the biographer, Ernst Pawel, writes: "Earlier
that year, in the not too distant Austrian town of Braunau, one Clara
n&eacute;e Pl&ouml;zl, wife of the customs inspector Alo&iuml;s Hitler,
had given birth to another of the emperor's subjects, a sickly infant
whose survival seemed doubtful. He survived."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Mentioning
the son born to a Braunau customs inspector called Hitler can only
elicit the kind of tawdry <I>frisson</I> Pawel is trying to achieve
if we let ourselves be susceptible to an egregiously blatant act of
backshadowing. In 1889 no connection existed yet between the Kafka and
Hitler families, and to gesture backward from the terrible years when
such a connection, in the form of murderer and victim, did come to
occur, is so shamelessly manipulative that it would be easy to laugh
away, except that one finds it as a crucial topos in innumerable other
texts on the same theme. Pawel's biography is dense with similarly
embarrassing moments. Toward the end of the book, for example, as
Kafka is approaching his early death, Pawel writes, "the family doctor
urgently advised another extended rest, and

<B></B>

Kafka, <I>faute de
mieux,</I> settled on a boardinghouse in the Bohemian mountain village
of Schelesen, now Zelizy, not far from what was to become the infamous
Terezin concentration camp, through which all three of his sisters passed
on their way to the gas chambers."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These descents into what one may call a kind of Hitler-kitsch
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

are especially alarming because reviewers of the book proved themselves
so responsive to exactly this strain in Pawel's writing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 More
unsettling still, many of his tropes surface elsewhere in different hands
and genres. Thus, in a study by political scientist George S. Berkeley,
<I>Vienna and Its Jews: The Tragedy of Success,</I> it is startling to
come across the following sentence right after a mention of the famous
suicide/murder of Crown Prince Rudolph and Mary Vetsera at Mayerling
in January 1889: "The other event of special significance to the Vienna
Jews which occurred in 1889 passed unremarked by almost everyone, Jew and
Gentile alike. Three months after Rudolph's death, in the border village
of Braunau, a son was born to Alo&iuml;s and Klara Hitler."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

It is worth lingering for a moment on the astonishing phrase "unremarked
by almost everyone," with its surely unintended and risible hint
that someone actually did notice the event--perhaps three wise men
mysteriously alerted to the demonic nativity in Braunau by a kind of
negative illumination--but the coincidence of imagination and phrasing
in the Pawel and Berkeley books requires more than merely being noticed
and dismissed. Of course the similarity is not due to plagiarism of any
sort; rather, it is the result of a fascination with Hitler that strongly
mobilizes both writers' fantasies. Arthur C. Danto, in a wonderfully
apposite jest against predestination and foreshadowing, once quipped, "No
one came to Madame Diderot and said, 'Unto you an encyclop&aelig;diste
is born.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Danto's irony works so economically because
the notion it reduces to absurdity is one to which almost no one would
subscribe in the first place. But it is just as true that no one came
to Frau Hitler in Braunau and said: "Unto you a <I>Reichsf&uuml;hrer</I>
is born." Both the quotations by Pawel and Berkeley rely for their force
on just such a premise.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If we laugh at the example of Madame Diderot and yet are capable of
responding with a shudder to the portentous news of Hitler's birth
without seeing its absurdity, it can only be that in the face of evil
on as great a scale as Hitler embodies, there is a general freezing up
of normal intellectual discriminations. Yet exactly these moments of
confrontation with the monstrous require more, not less, clarity, and
demand a greater measure, rather than an abdication, of the ability
to stay focused on fundamental distinctions. One of the disturbing
"pleasures" apparent in numerous recent fictional representations of
Hitler (works as dif-ferent in their structure and rhetoric as, for
example, a film like Hans J&uuml;rgen Syberberg's <I>Hitler: Ein Film
aus Deutschland,</I> or a prose fantasy like George Steiner's <I>The
Portage to St. Cristobal of A.H.</I>) is the way their narratives
derive their energy from--and hence transport their audience to--an
emotional register whose intensity supposedly places it beyond moral
discriminations. In <I>Crime and Punishment,</I> Dostoevsky anatomized
the feverish excitement that arises when abandoning oneself to the
contemplation of horror is confused with authentic imaginative freedom,
and a kind of lumpen Raskolnikovism is discernible in what has become a
flourishing "Hitler industry." As Alan Mintz has warned, "the fascination
with evil is a highly appetitive faculty,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 and there is a
demoralizing sense in which rhetoric like Pawel's and Berkeley's feeds
exactly this most dubious of urges.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The difference between, on the one hand, a perspective dominated by
backshadowing, and on the other, one that respects the variety in
how people understood their own positions

<B></B>

and the contradictory
expectations with which communities debated important decisions, turns
on what Frederic Maitland defined as the first rule for comprehending
history: an awareness that events now far in the past were once in
the future.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Part of the reason why Maitland's formulation is so important to a theory
of sideshadowing is that it helps bring into focus the differences between
my position here and that of works like Danto's <I>Analytical Philosophy
of History.</I> Although I have gratefully seized upon Danto's jest about
Madame Diderot, it is important to acknowledge that unlike Ignatieff,
Danto is not arguing that historians should "write history blind to the
future." On the contrary, he stresses that while an account of Diderot's
subsequent career would make no sense if uttered by Madame Diderot or by
a hypothetical angel attending his birth, such a judgment is un-avoidable
for later historians. Danto further implies that without a knowledge of
later events, any historical account may be seriously inadequate and
incomplete. But he is equally at pains to warn against histories that
include "descriptions of events...which make an essential reference
to later events--events future to the time at which the description is
given. In effect [such works] are trying to write the history of what
happens <I>before</I> it has happened, and to give accounts of the past
based upon accounts of the future."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Phrased in this way,
it becomes clear that the issue is in part determined precisely by the
intended chronological scope and ideological /moral assumption of a
specific historical account. In terms of my argument here, I believe
that only when narratives about pre-Shoah European Jewry are able to
incorporate the different ways individuals evaluated their circumstances
at the time, and can do so without flaunting a foreknowledge of the
impending catastrophe, is it possible for a genuine sense of grief,
unadulterated by anger or condescension at the "inevitable" truth that
went unnoticed, to be heard clearly.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A history of European Jewry that continues into the Nazi period obviously
must include a detailed discussion of the Shoah, but  if the story
were to stop earlier, for example at the end of World War I, it need
not allow, and indeed may only be deflected by allowing, the knowledge
of the coming genocide to structure its account of the prior epoch; and
 even when the narrative makes the Shoah central to its description,
it should not use the author's and reader's knowledge of that catastrophe
to impose the terms within which earlier events are analyzed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
J&uuml;rgen Habermas, in an argument directly indebted to Danto, but
still more committed to a theoretical horizon that appears to legitimize
backshadowing, insists that

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Historical accounts make use of narrative statements. They are
called narrative because they present events as elements of stories
[<I>Geschichten</I>]. Stories have a beginning and an end; they are held
together by an action. Historical events are reconstructed within the
reference system of a story. They cannot be presented without relation
to other, later events...The sentence, 'the Thirty Years War began
in 1618,' presupposes that at least those events have elapsed which
are relevant for the history of the war up to the Peace of Westphalia,
events that could not have been narrated by any observer at the outbreak
of the war...The predicates with which an event is narratively presented
require the appearance of later events in the light of which the event
in question appears as an historical event.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One way to highlight the issue at stake here is to confront Habermas's
account with a contrary formulation in which we imagine a German burgher
running through town shouting,
<B></B>



 "the Thirty Years War has just
begun!" The distinction, in other words, is not only one of foreshadowing
and backshadowing, but also of the horizon of consciousness and knowledge
that one is seeking to describe. There is nothing wrong with a historian
narrating events from a perspective of a time future to his subject
matter and knowing more about that subject than its contemporaries could
have--e.g., the length of a given war--but such knowledge should not
delude the historian into thinking that the future was inevitable simply
because it happened, nor should he use it to judge the way contemporaries,
existing without such information, viewed their own circumstances and
decided upon particular courses of action. Moreover, and crucial to the
larger question of narrative techniques, both Habermas and Danto assume a
curiously restrictive notion of what constitutes a "story." Both archaic
and postmodern narratives make clear that stories need not have a single
beginning and a single end; indeed, they need not even have a single,
chronologically-ordered series of actions. As soon as the paradigmatic
structure for an extended narrative is not limited to the well-wrought
novel developed over the past two hundred years, it becomes clear that
some of the fundamental storytelling conventions of our culture have never
fallen under the sway of a single story unfolding along an irreversible
temporal continuum. History can be understood as readily by these earlier
(mythic) and later (postmodern) categories of narrative organization as
by the linear, determined trajectory of a story that Habermas and Danto
posit as the sole available model. We could rephrase Habermas by saying,
"stories need have no beginning or end; they are held together by actions
and their sideshadows." But Habermas pushes his case still further by
insisting both that the historian <I>necessarily</I> use his greater
knowledge precisely to create a "coherent story":

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
A series of events acquires the unity of a story only from a point of view
that cannot be taken from those events themselves. The actors are caught
in their histories; even for them--if they tell their own stories--the
point of view from which the events can take on the coherence of a story
arises only subsequently.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But we should notice here again the assumption that a story has
"coherence," by which Habermas means specifically the coherence of
a classically shaped and closed narrative. The crux of the matter is
that a certain view of history is, in reality, determined not so much
by principles of historiography but by a prior and na&iuml;ve view
of what constitutes a story <I>tout court.</I> If we reconceive our
understanding of the possibilities of storytelling and entertain more
flexibility in our possible models, if we do not insist upon closure
and the retrospective judgment that closure is allowed to dictate, then
the point of view of any single moment in the trajectory of an ongoing
story has a significance that is never annulled or transcended by the
shape and meaning of the narrative as a (supposed) whole.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The problem is that the particular flourishing of historical consciousness
that began in the nineteenth century ended up by making the historian, or
at least the thinker as historical system builder, whether in the form of
a pure philosopher like Hegel, a philosophically trained revolutionary
thinker and polemicist like Marx, or a conservative vulgarizer like
Spengler, seem the one best equipped to interpret the world. But these
kinds of historical analyses, especially when they are part of a larger
philosophical vision, tend to legislate the future, as well as to explain
the present and past, in terms of a single, coherent system whose laws
the philosopher-historian has uncovered. The inevitability of these
laws not only renders

irrelevant, it also removes any significance from imagining alternative
paths. Within such a logic, alternatives are "mere daydreams." The
task for sideshadowing is to restore the legitimacy of reflecting
upon what might have taken place instead. Sideshadowing's attention
to the unfulfilled or unrealized possibilities of the past is a way of
disrupting the affirmations of a triumphalist, unidirectional view of
history in which whatever has perished is condemned because it has been
found wanting by some irresistible historico-logical dynamic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What sideshadowing explicitly rejects is a certain view of how events
assume meaning for us, a view perhaps most powerfully put by Wilhelm
Dilthey:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We grasp the significance of a moment of the past. It is significant
insofar as a linkage to the future was achieved in it...The individual
moment [has] significance through its connection with the whole, through
the relation of past and future...But what constitutes the peculiar nature
of this relation of part to whole within life? It is a relation that
is never entirely completed. One would have to await the end of one's
life and could only in the hour of death survey the whole from which
the relation of the parts could be determined. One would have to await
the end of history to possess all the material needed for determining
its significance.

It is worth asking why it should be exclusively the end of the story that
determines how one interprets everything that went before? How much of
a specifically Christian theological perspective has been unwittingly
imported into a historiographic context by this privileging of what
sounds remarkably like a secular Last Judgment? To place such heavy
weight upon "the end of one's life and...the hour of death" reveals this
metamorphosis of a Christian <I>topos</I> with particular vividness. Both
on the personal biographical level, and on the historical one, there is no
reason to accept the retrospective authority of the last days. Dilthey's
attitude here exactly parallels those who say that the Shoah, as the
death of the Austro-German Jewish community, must be understood as a
judgment upon that community, as the event by which everything earlier
acquires its final sense. It is not the smallest irony of such arguments
that, while speaking from a perspective supposedly consonant with Jewish
traditions and values, they actually rely upon the deepest strands of
a Christian metaphysics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But intimately linked, as it clearly is, to a sense of the importance of
sideshadowing, the rejection of the sense-making authority of the future
to determine how we interpret past events still leaves unspecified a way
to clarify the difference between <I>prediction</I> and fore-shadowing. A
constituent part of our sense of the present moment is an imaginative
invest-ment in some of the futures that might come out of it. Because
presentness already includes anticipation, prediction does not in
itself violate the integrity of presentness. Some form of prediction
is an inherent aspect of how we organize our world, affecting both
greater and smaller plans, whether moment by moment or at decisive
turning points. In prediction one makes the best guess possible about
an <I>unknown</I> future, a guess limited by all the partiality of
one's knowledge, temperament, and desire. But in both foreshadowing and
backshadow-ing the writer continuously passes judgment on each of the
projects and predictions of his characters by drawing on the plenitude
of his greater information about the end of the story. Since he knows
which events "really mattered," which plans will bring disaster and
which success, the existence of his subjects as human beings engaged in
an ongoing effort to shape their own futures is denied any substantive
meaning. In texts based upon historical events

<B></B>

known to both
the author and reader, the narrative may <I>seem</I> concerned with
registering the predictions of the characters. But the intrusion of
foreshadowing, the network of portentous signs that signal the future
of the characters and their world, is particularly deceptive because it
is based upon the shared familiarity of a known outcome. In historical
novels, unless the horizon is kept strictly within the consciousness of
the characters themselves, any surplus of knowledge or interpretation is
an instance of pure backshadowing from an already established future,
even if, technically, it presents itself in the rhetorical modes of
either prediction or foreshadowing.

Although everyone's list will surely differ, it is all too easy to think
of representations of the Shoah whose lapses into tastelessness and
exploitation are deeply offensive and which, in their vulgarity, risk
coarsening the collective memory. But rare though they are, there is a
handful of works that have been painfully and movingly illuminating,
whether texts by sur-vivors as different from one another as Primo
Levi's meditations on his concentration-camp experiences and Dan Pagis's
poems <I>Transformations,</I> or entirely imagined narratives like David
Grossman's remarkable novel <I>See Under: Love,</I> semi-fictionalizations
like Heinz Schirk's film of <I>The Wannsee Conference,</I> or many
of Alain Kleinmann's paintings. The best of these, moreover, testify
convincingly against an excessive insistence that <I>only</I> the
gathering of facts has ethical validity--a kind of fetishization that
is all the more insidious because, as the Czernovitz-born  Israeli
novelist Aharon Appelfeld cautions, "the numbers and the facts were the
murderer's own well-proven means. Man as a number is one of the horrors
of dehumanization."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is true that of the few authentically moving fictionalizations
of the Shoah, even fewer are actually set inside the death camps, as
though a kind of imaginative closure in the face of the horror made
such scenes unrepresentable. The urge to erect a kind of ethical taboo
prohibiting the fictional representation of the concentration camps is
in part justified--and no doubt in part also motivated--by  an awareness
of how many recent works contain scenes set in the death factories in
order to mobilize the emotions that such extreme situations elicit. The
kind of <I>frisson</I> for which Pawel grasps by linking the births
of Kafka's sister and Hitler bears a family resemblance to the way
William Styron uses the Auschwitz scenes in <I>Sophie's Choice</I>
to give his novel an intensity it would otherwise lack. And both of
these in turn are not as far removed as their authors might think from
the use of concentration-camp settings as a staple of sado-masochistic
pornography. But there is also another, and perhaps even more prevalent
danger that haunts many readers of literature on the Shoah: that of
becoming so caught up in the material that, compared with its intensities,
other themes, ideas, and emotions seem insignificant. This seems to me
an extraordinarily misplaced and even pernicious response, but it is
nonetheless sufficiently seductive and widespread to require conscious
resistance. Norma Rosen's article, "The Second Life of Holocaust
Imagery," for example, is characteristic of this tendency. Rosen, who
is not herself a camp survivor, insists that "for a mind engraved with
the Holocaust, gas is always that gas. Shower means their shower. Ovens
are those ovens. A train is a freight train crammed with suffocating
children."

 Although she qualifies this grisly
description with the scarcely less overwrought acknowledgment that
"of course this does not always happen. Some days the sky is simply
blue and we do not wonder how a blue sky looked to those on their way
to the crematoria,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 it is difficult to read the texture
and rhetoric of the whole passage except as symptomatic of an almost
clinically obsessive identification with the suffering of others. One
of the more enduring of the many horrors of the Shoah is that it seems
to give such identifications the justification of a highly developed
historical/moral imagination about the agony inflicted upon one's people.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No writer on the Shoah has been more aware of the risks of representing
the ultimate viciousness of the Shoah, or more careful to avoid feeding
an appetitive fascination with evil, than Aharon Appelfeld. A child
of wealthy, thoroughly assimilated Bukovina Jews who were murdered
in the Shoah, the nine-year-old Appelfeld survived by escaping alone
from the Transnistria Camp. Thereafter, he stayed alive by hiding
in the forests, and occasionally working for local peasants until
the Russian army took him along as an assistant cook and helper in
their sweep westward. Finally, he ended up in a refugee camp on the
Italian coast, from which he was taken to Palestine by the Zionist
youth rescue movement. Appelfeld, beyond any other prose writer,
is credited in Israel with having made the Shoah into a legitimate
theme for novelists. Writers like A.B. Yehoshua acknowledge that
"Appelfeld... opened up new possibilities for treating the Holocaust in
literature," and he reminds us how much resistance Appelfeld's novels
initially encountered among an Israeli public that, before the Eichmann
trial, wanted to hear as little as possible about the world inhabited
by the murdered Jews of Europe.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Central to the success of
Appelfeld's writings has been the care he exercises in not allowing the
violence of the killers to be directly represented in his novels. In fact,
there are hardly any Nazis in Appelfeld's books at all. His narratives
of the Shoah take place among the secularized Jews of Austria and its
eastern border states, and when the world of the surrounding Aryan
majority is directly visualized, it is always in the form of peasants,
minor officials, and morally compromised, but not openly sadistic fellow
townsmen, rather than through the typical bludgeon-wielding SS guards
of Shoah exploitations. By avoid-ing explicit reference to the Shoah,
and more particularly, by refusing to allow the archetypal scenarios of
concentration-camp savagery to orchestrate the emotional force of his
stories, Appelfeld succeeds in short-circuiting any possibility of the
sado-masochistic identification that haunts literature on the genocide.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But what Robert Alter has praised as Appelfeld's "art of intimation," his
"habitual strategy as a writer haunted by the Holocaust to concentrate
on its historical margins, either prelude or aftermath,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 is
purchased at the price of a psychological reductiveness and a historical
flattening that ultimately may not be much preferable to the lurid
repertoire of horror scenes it was intended to replace. The best way
to illustrate the cost of Appelfeld's technique is to look closely
at <I>Badenheim 1939,</I> the first and most critically acclaimed of
his novels to have appeared in English.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Badenheim is a
typical Austrian spa town, where prosperous, thoroughly secularized
Jews spend their vacations enjoying the restorative mineral baths,
the rich hotel food, and the cultural life of an annual musical and
theatrical summer festival. In the novel, the town becomes a microcosm
of the world of Austro-German Jewry with its cultural pretensions, its
rejection of any overt signs of Jewishness, especially as embodied by
the "vulgar <I>Ostjuden</I>" (Jews from Eastern Europe whose style of
dress, language and

<B></B>

religious observance exacerbated the unease of
westernized Jews),
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 and its hallucinatory refusal to confront
the danger that was literally enclosing it from every side.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>

Already a modern, if unacknowledged, ghetto, Badenheim, in the course
of the novel, is turned into a Third Reich transit camp by a series of
ever-tightening legal restrictions imposed by the governing "Sanitation
Department," until eventually, the final directive for a compulsory
"resettlement" to the East orders the entire population to the railway
station where "an engine coupled to four filthy freight cars" 
emerges to take them to their destination. Even at the end, although the
Jews of Badenheim have been deprived of their freedom, their jobs, and
their contact with the outside world, and have been ordered about like
so much chattel (although without any overt physical coercion that would
violate the book's fable-like tone), they retain their by now clearly
absurd optimism. Dr. Pappenheim, a renowned impresario, and the most
fully described character in the book, ends <I>Badenheim 1939</I> with
the cheerfully encouraging comment, "If the coaches are so dirty it must
mean that we have not far to go" .

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But every reader of the novel knows the names of the stations where
the train will dis-gorge its passengers, and if Appelfeld can avoid
mentioning Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, or Mauthausen it is only because of
his certainty that the reader will do so in his place. The reader hears
the desperate will to lie to oneself in Pappenheim's final words and
understands how soon and how savagely that Panglossian confidence will
be silenced. And what is of crucial importance, the reader understands
this precisely from a deep familiarity with the kinds of Shoah texts
and images Appelfeld is applauded for having excluded, so that in a
sense everything that Appelfeld formally bars from his fictional world
he invites back in by virtually compelling his readers to stage the
horrific set pieces in their own imaginations. Ultimately, there is less
difference than either Appelfeld or his admirers would like to claim
between a concluding sentence like "If the coaches are so dirty it must
mean that we have not far to go" and Pawel's "in the...Austrian town of
Braunau, one Clara n&eacute;e Pl&ouml;zl, wife of the customs inspector
Alo&iuml;s Hitler, had given birth to...a sickly infant whose survival
seemed doubtful. He survived." <I>Badenheim 1939</I> is so confident of
its reader's familiarity with descriptions of Nazi bestialities that
it never needs to mention them at all in order to have their specter
loom in the interstices of every scene and dialogue. Thus, when Gabriel
Josipovici interprets Appelfeld's "silence" about the Camps as an implicit
"condemnation" of writers who "mythologize" the Shoah and whose texts
feed our horrified fascination with the details of the extermination
process, he pinpoints the finest impulse in the novels but ignores the
extent to which their power is only made possible by the success of all
the narratives Appelfeld's restraint is supposed to rebuke.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>

It is primarily with these texts and images that <I>Badenheim 1939</I>
is in dialogue, and what is lost thereby is the reality of Austro-German
Jewish life, as well as an acknowledgment of the individual complexity
on which genuine understanding depends.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One way to crystallize the general implications of Appelfeld's practice in
terms of my earlier discussion is to see how it completely forecloses any
chance at sideshadowing. Since the relentless glare of the Shoah is ever
present, not merely at the book's end but throughout its unfolding, it
floods the various scenes with its overpowering significance so that
none of them can have a consequence independent of that all-dominant
one. Appelfeld himself clearly recognized the aesthetic and moral problem
raised by backshadowing: his determination

<B></B>

 to avoid directly
representing the Shoah by ending the novel before the killings actually
began is part of this recognition. But since he never tries to voice
a more flexible vision of history, his novel incorporates none of the
openness of sideshadowing, and his decision to exclude the actual violence
of the genocide remains an isolated scruple unrelated to achieving an
authentic understanding of the world of the victims.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To acknowledge the validity of sideshadowing is not merely to reject
historical inevitability as a theoretical model. More importantly, it
means learning to value the contingencies and multiple paths leading
from each concrete moment of lived experience, and recognizing the
importance of those moments not for their place in an already determined
larger pattern but as significant in their own right. This is what
I think of as a "prosaics of the quotidian," and it is fundamentally
linked to the historical logic of sideshadowing. At a crucial point in
<I>Badenheim 1939,</I> the narrator tells us: "But the people were still
preoccupied with their own affairs--the guests with their pleasures
and the townspeople with their troubles" .
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 This
"preoccupation with their own affairs," as much as the denial of their
Jewishness, is what the novel regards as the unpardonable sin of everyone
in Badenheim, and in Appelfeld's narrative it leads to consequences like
the characters' general refusal even to discuss the fact that overnight
"a barrier was placed at the entrance to the town. No one came in or
went out" . Concern with the immediate and local, the familial and
private, is judged inherently unworthy, an act of betrayal of others
and of blindness to one's own deeper interests. Measured against the
Shoah, as everything in <I>Badenheim 1939</I> is, Appelfeld's charge
carries an intuitive plausibility, but it only makes sense if we agree
to that standard of measurement; his scale loses its meaning if we
consider, for example, that concern with one's ethnic identity, with
the welfare of others in one's community, or with the nature of the
political dispensation under which one lives, are themselves also local
and personal matters, as much a part of prosaics as our "daily pleasures
and troubles." In his contempt for prosaics, or, more accurately, in
his linking of prosaics with pure selfishness, Appelfeld invokes a
standard that he had explicitly rejected when it was forced upon him
as a survivor-immigrant in the early years of Israeli statehood. To
his teachers in the Zionist youth movement, Appelfeld himself later
complained, "personal experience was simply not worthy of recall. Only
if you had been a pioneer...a partisan. Suffering by itself did not
merit attention--unless it served a collective purpose."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

What prosaics argues, though, is that a genuinely democratic, rather
than a tyrannical, collective purpose can arise only out of the shared
aims and hopes of the individuals who make up the larger group; such a
purpose is the meeting-point, not the liquidation, of the innumerable
separate preoccupations and motives of everyone who agrees to work for
the realization of the collective purpose.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Beneath the melancholy of its coolly satiric tone, the deeper irony of
a work like <I>Badenheim 1939</I> is that while it finds a new idiom
in which to narrate the margins of catastrophe, it also finds itself
entrapped in the very explanations it deems unacceptable as soon as they
are spelled out more clearly. Appelfeld himself has spoken with passion
and sorrow about "this anti-Semitism directed at oneself...Even after the
Holocaust Jews did not seem blameless in their own eyes. On the contrary,
harsh comments were made by prominent Jews against the victims for not
protecting themselves and fighting back."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 (Appelfeld is
presumably referring to Hannah Arendt, among others.) Although it is
their assimilationism and lack of Jewish pride, not their inability
to fight, that is satirized, Appelfeld's characters collaborate so

<B></B>

fully in their destruction that among those "prominent Jews" who
make "harsh comments" about the victims of the Shoah, it is difficult
not to include the author of <I>Badenheim 1939</I> as well.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What may seem like only formal decisions about how much knowledge of
the future to include in a narrative set in an earlier epoch, or about
how much to let the narrative glance sideways and project forwards to
events that never happened, is already thematically charged and thereby
morally significant. If it is absurd to see the "great world-historical
event" of 1875 as Lenin's fifth birthday, and if we can smile at the
idea of a secular angel arriving in Langres in 1713 to tell Madame
Diderot that she would soon give birth to a great encyclo-p&aelig;diste,
then we also have to learn to absolve from any blame those Jews who
attended the summer festivals of Salzburg or Badenheim and went about
dressed in <I>Trachten</I> rather than in the paramilitary gear of the
<I>Haganah</I> or the <I>tephillin</I> of the orthodox. There is ample
reason to find preposterous the argument that it is now time to forgive
the murderers; but enough time has passed for us to realize that it was
always partially the shame of not having been there to help them survive
that made blaming the victims of the Shoah so much a part of how the
history of European Jewry has been figured since 1945. Sideshadowing
eliminates neither historical responsibility nor moral judgment, but it
insists we assign them prosaically: to individuals and individual actions
where such judgments properly belong. It is these specific actions and
choices made by individual people that constitute the history we inherit
and with which our own actions and choices must ultimately come to terms.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To summarize and then extend my argument thus far as succinctly
and polemically as possible: I think that in the ways the history of
European Jewry has usually been narrated, its annihilation in the camps
is granted a kind of negative teleology that then retroactively provides
the terms by which its entire experience prior to the Third Reich
is judged. And as we have seen, backshadowing of this sort, whether
in the melodramatic formulations of a Pawel or Berkeley, or in the
elegiac ironies of an Appelfeld, inevitably denatures the very different
possibilities facing Jews living at different historical moments, under
radically incommensurate and often rapidly changing conditions. It has
also made the Shoah the foundation for a certain kind of modern Judaism
in which the claims of victimhood as constitutive of Jewish experience
throughout history are asserted either for their potent political charge
or as cultural talismans to be celebrated or chafed against depending
on the particular spokesman's temperament and intentions. Beyond the
immediate political consequences of such a position, consequences
that include, but are not limited to, an emotional/rhetorical climate
in which successive Israeli administrations seek to mobilize Jewish
loyalty through a calculated appeal to the same tragic story  (i.e.,
"Eretz Israel as the last refuge of the [inevitably persecuted] Jews"),
there is a more insidious corollary to privileging the Shoah in such a
way. Whether unwittingly, or as part of an explicitly accepted belief,
each time the Shoah is evoked in the terms I have described, it relies
upon the

<B></B>

logically prior assumption that the real "proof" of the
worth of an individual, a doctrine, or a political/ethical system, is
how it holds up under the harshest testing imaginable--a kind of <I>in
extremis veritas</I> interpretation of an entire culture and all of its
specific practices.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Clearly nothing of what I have written should be taken as an attempt to
disparage the ongoing studies of the historical roots, political context
and (if this is the right phrase) bur-eaucratic "institutionalization"
of the Shoah. But analysts are right to underline the fact that Menachem
Begin was the first Israeli Prime Minister regularly to invoke the Shoah
in his major addresses, and anyone fascinated by the evocative power of
narrative and rhetorical patterns will register how fraught with risks
such a backward glance can be when it encourages, implicitly or by design,
apocalyptic fears through the medium of its evocations.  As we can see
today both in Israel and in the American political and academic body, once
victimhood is understood to endow one with special claims and rights,
the scramble to attain that desig-nation for one's own interest group
is as heated as any other race for legitimacy and power. Victimhood, one
needs to remember, is scarcely a fixed term and there is something truly
depressing in the clamor of competing voices to prove whose distress has
been more per-sistent and devastating, and whose claims to compensatory
rectification are therefore more worthy. For a particularly demoralizing
example of this tendency one need look no further than the August 1991
Crown Heights turmoil between the Lubavitcher and the black communities
and the ways in which it was immediately inscribed within competing
nar-ratives of victimization. Long infuriated by the perceived special
treatment accorded to the Lubavitchers, black anger was triggered when
a car in the Grand Rebbe's entourage jumped a curb and struck two black
children, killing one, Gavin Cato, and seriously injuring his cousin,
Angela. In the three days of riots that ensued, a twenty-nine-year-old
Australian Jewish scholar, Yankel Rosenbaum, was murdered and two more
Hasidic men were stabbed. The assaults were accompanied by intense
anti-Semitic harassment in which Jews were directly compared to slave
owners, and the death of Cato was seen as a direct continuation of the
callous disregard for black lives on the slave ships and plantations. In
an article revealingly entitled "Invisible Man: The Lynching of Yankel
Rosenbaum," David Evanier recounts how "the media at best treated the
accidental death of Gavin Cato and the murder of Rosenbaum as morally
equivalent. The worst ignored Rosenbaum entirely. The conflict between
blacks and Jews was seen as being in balance, with the 'social justice'
edge going to the blacks... Anti-Semitism was not mentioned in any
editorial about Crown Heights in New York newspapers until August 29
[nine days after the killing] in the <I>New York Post.</I>"
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>

But even though Evanier's accusation of moral obtuseness on the part of
the New York media seems to me in the main justified, his own narrative
is itself decidedly problematic. The reason the media tended to see "the
'social justice' edge going to the blacks" was primarily because in the
United States, Jews are not regarded as a vulnerable minority, while
African-Americans are perceived, both rhetorically and legally, in such
terms. But instead of contesting the whole ideology of justification
by degree of historical victimization, Evanier, as the title of his
piece clearly announces, wants only to reassign the status of principal
victim first by casting Yankel Rosenbaum as the 1991 equivalent of the
unnamed black narrator of Ralph Ellison's <I>Invisible Man,</I> and
then by claiming that the Lubavitchers today run as great a risk of
public lynchings as did Southern blacks during the Jim Crow era. The
Lubavitcher



community itself, in the form of the "Crown Heights
Emergency Fund," placed a full-page <B></B>
advertisement in <I>The New York
Times</I> on 20 September 1991 under the heading "This Year Kristallnacht
Took Place on August 19th Right Here in Crown Heights." Their version of
what Leo Strauss had called a <I>reductio ad Hitlerum</I> was rightly
perceived by those who had been in Germany on <I>Kristallnacht</I>
(9 November 1938) as an outrageous comparison. The brutal beatings and
mass arrests of thousands of Jews, the looting of Jewish homes and stores
throughout the country, and the burning of Jewish synagogues, libraries,
and community centers, all organized and planned by the state itself,
simply bears no relationship to the events in Brooklyn.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>

However, I am not concerned here to re-examine the circumstances leading
to the death of Gavin Cato and the murder of Yankel Rosenbaum, but
rather to question the entire urge to establish one's credentials as an
eternal victim in order to claim an unassailable moral high ground. Such
a claim can only be substantiated by interpreting each unhappy event as a
repetition/continuation of the worst experiences in the communal memory,
with the result that it almost seemed to both sides to have been Nazis
and slaveholders who confronted one another, rather than citizens of
Brooklyn in 1991.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 Were the consequences of such distortions
not so pernicious, they might almost be comic: the image of a Southern
plantation owner with <I>peyas</I> (sidelocks), dressed in a Hasidic black
coat and wearing his <I>tallit</I> (prayer shawl) and <I>tephillin</I>
(phylacteries), confronting a black dressed in the SS regalia of the
Aryan master race has an undeniably macabre absurdity to it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Moreover, as my examples make clear, in spite of current assumptions
in this country, to criticize the rhetoric of victimhood does
not mean aligning oneself with any particular political party or
direction. Throughout much of this century in Europe, the primary
political expression of the sense of being injured, of anger at having
been reduced to the role of a marginalized victim, has been the province
of the far right. Fascism and Nazism both capitalized on and fueled
the <I>ressentiment</I> of people who were convinced that they had
been unfairly mistreated, while others (usually the Jews, but also
intellectuals, homosexuals, members of Masonic Lodges, etc.) received
unmerited privileges. Hitler, in particular, regularly appealed to the
Germans to see themselves as innocent victims of a host of interlocked
evils ranging from the Versailles treaty to parliamentary corruption,
all secretly orchestrated by an international Jewish conspiracy intent
on world rule. Insofar as the increasingly problematic categories of
"left"- and "right"-wing positions still retain any useful meaning today,
it is instructive to see that the position of justification by one's
historical affliction is invoked in Israel largely by the political
and cultural right, while in North America and the United Kingdom
this is done primarily by the left. Yet people who are quite willing
to resist the Likud Party's invocation of the Shoah to legitimize its
policies are swayed by analogous arguments derived from the horrors of
slavery, or the history of gender-, race-, and sexual-inclination-based
discrimination and violence, in order to justify the creation of a newly
ennobled victim-group whose refrains of oppression are manipulated for
legislative and political ends.

This
same distinction holds true, unpopular though such a view is, for victims
of AIDS, racism, rape, or cancer, or any of the numerous brutalities and
inequities that continue to flourish in our society. Indeed, it seems to
me an indecency to assume that victims are somehow "ennobled" by their
(usually involuntarily undergone) suffering, since such an assumption
necessarily endows the cause of the suffering with the capacity to bring
out a previously hidden worthiness. If anything, as the experience of
recent history has shown, too sharp a sense of one's own victimization
can easily lead to a compensatory urge to tyrannize over others, and
those convinced of their unique victimhood are quite likely to prove
tyrants both to themselves and to others if given the chance, whether
their frustration is confined to a protest against the curriculum in a
modern university, expressed in the mob violence of an urban riot, or
vented in political rallies like those cheering Ariel Sharon in the most
recent <I>Gush Emunim</I> settlement in the West Bank.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For Jewish thought, what is most troubling in the conjunction of
foreshadowing and the sense of victimization in narratives like
Appelfeld's or Pawel's is its complicity with the dispiriting
clich&eacute; that sees in the entirety of Jewish existence nothing
more than a wrenching from horror to horror. It is exactly against what
Sal&ograve; Baron called this "lachrymose view of Jewish history" as only
a <I>Jammergeschichte,</I> an endless tale of woe, that the best volumes
of modern Jewish historical and cultural studies have been written. In
a crucial essay on the "Deformations of the Holocaust," Robert Alter
urged that "it is as important to study how the Jews <I>lived</I> as
how they died."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 In many ways, I believe that it is Alter's
formulation, with its principled refusal to interpret the Shoah as
the single grounding event of Diaspora Jewish history, that offers a
genuinely productive relationship to the achievements, as well as to
the pain, of the past two centuries of Jewish experience.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But just as important, I want to insist that <I>any</I> sense of
identity as constituted primarily by victimization is an extraordinarily
problematic basis for either an individual or a group to build upon,
and the sad truth is that, in contrast to the celebrated opening of
Tolstoy's <I>Anna Karenina,</I> it is "unhappy" consciousnesses that
so much resemble one another in their misery, while happiness is always
singular and hard-won. More challengingly, though, and, against much of
the writing done today on the Shoah from both religious and philosophical
perspectives, I believe that very little about human nature or values
can be learned from an <I>in extremis</I> situation except the virtual
tautology that extreme pressure brings out extreme and extremely diverse
behavior. Beliefs, ideas, values, and people are tested best in the daily,
routine actions and habits of normal life, not in moments of extraordinary
crisis, and because foreshadowing can only point to a single, inherently
dramatic, rather than typical and quotidian resolution, it must privilege
the uniquely climactic over the normative and repeatable. To reject
the validating force of extreme crises involves both formal and ethical
decisions precisely because such a rejection, based as it is on a moral
stance, will necessitate the search for a new form of writing in order to
articulate its new understanding. Only a prosaics of sideshadowing can, I
think, do justice, both humanly and philosophically, to the richness, of
the claims of the ordinary, because it recognizes how various the strands
of that ordinariness really are, and how shrilly thin by comparison



are the dramas we usually take as revelatory. More specifically, because
the Shoah has been appropriated so often during the past four decades
as an all too-available archetype of both personal and collective
suffering, its meaning has been assimilated to the most conventional
<I>donn&eacute;es</I> of our epoch. Despite the 
<B></B> 
ritual insistence on the
singularity of the genocide, the "final solution" has itself become one
of the most often adduced instantiations of an unexamined and deeply
false commonplace--the belief that the real worth of our culture can
only be authoritatively tested at the extreme limit of human behavior.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For someone who has been through the blackness of the concentration
camps, the conviction that the experiences undergone there have revealed
a fundamental truth about the world often seems irresistible. In Lawrence
Langer's extraordinary analysis of taped interviews made with survivors of
the Shoah, Irene W. explains that the "extreme pessimism" that haunts her
is part of a "total world view" in which she feels that she has learned
the real "truth about people, human nature, about death...[I emerged]
knowing the truth in a way that other people don't."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 We
need to be extraordinarily careful neither to condemn sur-vivors for
the bitterness that they insist is only the "truth" the rest of us are
too sheltered or afraid to acknowledge, nor to share their judgment in
our own thinking. For many, but by no means all survivors, their time in
the camps is the central truth of their lives, and stays with them, in
Langer's phrase, like "a communal wound that cannot heal."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>

We need to respect their "total world view," but it is not, nor should we
try to make it, the truth of ours. It is the <I>singularity</I> of the
concentration camps, not their representative or emblematic character
that we need to keep clearly in focus, especially now that the Shoah is
invoked so often to sub-stantiate and lend emotional force to a diffuse
range of arguments about modern society, fundamental human nature, and
the character of Western culture as a whole.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In spite of the impassioned self-identification with and search for an
absolute (even though absolutely negative) meaning in the experience of
the Shoah, no one becomes a survivor either by virtue of being a Jew
or by the intensity of their absorption in the history and literature
of the Shoah (e.g., Sylvia Plath's notorious lines from "Daddy": "An
engine, an engine / Chuffing me off like a Jew. / A Jew to Dachau,
Auschwitz, Belsen. / I began to talk like a Jew. / I think I may well
be a Jew").
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 This fact needs to be emphasized because it
can serve as a corrective to an unconscious, but therefore all the
more insidious, "idealizing" (in the sense of "taking as a globally
instructive model") of the Shoah. Because so much of our culture is
still strongly bound to the belief that the truth lies in the extreme
moments which "ordinary bourgeois life" covers over, and that it is
only at the (appropriately named) "cutting edge" of the unthinkable
that the most valuable insights lay hidden, it has become possible, by
a truly grotesque inversion, to interpret the ruthlessness of the Shoah
as offering the most authentic--because most horrendous--image of the
underlying reality of our world. Although the extent, brutality, and
single-mindedness of the Nazi genocide are unprecedented, its narrative
incorporation into what one can call an ideology of the extreme has
the paradoxical, and entirely unintended effect of assimilating it to
a cultural tradition that itself encouraged a turn to the excessive and
the apocalyptic. (Notice here, as well, how this paradox, in which the
genocide is simultaneously regarded as utterly unique and yet emblematic
of the modern world, perfectly recapitulates the contradiction between
interpreting the Shoah as at once unimaginable and inevitable.)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The fascination with the brutal and the dangerous holds a compelling
place in our culture's imagination. In Joseph Conrad's <I>Lord
Jim,</I> for example, the narrator, Marlow, tells his listeners that
"the truth can be wrung out of us only by some cruel...catastrophe,"
and Jim himself is advised that the only way to test himself is by
seeking out the most extreme

<B></B>

and trying circumstances possible:
"to the destructive element submit yourself...In the destructive element
immerse."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 But as Dostoevsky had already predicted at the end
of the nineteenth century, it is not that far from the celebration of
authenticity, risk, and spon-taneity to envisaging murder as the final
and potentially purifying confrontation with "the destructive element"
in humankind. Moreover, as Sidra DeKoven Ezrahi points out, it is Jewish
culture that regularly has been "decimated by the apocalyptic fantasies
of others,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 and in the refiguring of the extermination of
European Jewry it is especially important not to allow an internalized
version of that same imaginative legacy to dictate the terms within
which the Shoah is interpreted.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There is a subtle but clear link between the view that the truth stands
out most clearly in an extreme situation and the conviction that a hidden
system or pattern exists waiting to be uncovered beneath the diversity of
normal human existence. Both attitudes long for global revelations and are
contemptuous of random, haphazard, and inassimilable contingencies. Both
are in quest of a revelatory moment that will disclose the <I>one</I>
truth that matters. Against this notion of truth being found at the utmost
hazard of life, the prosaics of sideshadowing wants to locate it in the
ordinary and quotidian actions of our communal existence. To grasp just
how provocative this proposition really is, it is worth emphasizing that
sideshadowing encourages the same skepticism towards Hegelian or Marxist
teleological readings of history as it does towards earlier master tropes
like chiliastic numerology. Sideshadowing is defined by its attention
to the pressures of randomness and contingency, to a view of the self as
an aggregate of ever-changing habits, memories, and experiences, shaped
in part by unforeseen and unforeseeable circumstances, and to a notion
of truth as precisely what is <I>not</I> a puzzle to be solved or a
revelation to be authenticated in a uniquely climactic struggle. Hence,
too, prosaics insists upon an understanding of time as a succession
of content-rich differences, rather than as an endless repetition of
identically meaningless units suddenly punctuated and redeemed by the
thunderclap of the significant cataclysm.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Jewish thought, the privileging of the claims of victimhood has created
what Michael R. Marrus calls "the triumphalism of pain,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>

but versions of that triumphalism flourish through-out Western society,
operating simultaneously at the level of high art, mass culture, and
political rhetoric. The British writer Michael Frayn shrewdly asks why the
paradigm of literature should so closely resemble a kind of <I>Consumer's
Report</I> description of a new product: "Like electric toasters, the
characters of fiction are tested, by stress and crisis, until they
break down. And the convention is that what emerges at this point is
their 'real' nature, which has up till then remained hidden from others
and even from the owners of the nature themselves."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 The
strength of this paradigm is evident throughout our culture, not merely
in literature, and its persistence testifies to the interpenetration of
tropes from one register to another. If the narration of Jewish history
has any generalizable lesson, it is surely to illustrate the dangers
of such a convention. The fact that Jews, as often as anyone else, lay
claim in their own self-interest to a special access to truth derived
from their unprecedented suffering only shows the persistence of a
cultural <I>topos</I> even among those who, in other ways, have sought
strenuously to shed the victim's role.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For a prosaics of sideshadowing, the question of how to live one's
ethnic, racial, or sexual heritage is a subset of the more general
issue of finding a proper relationship to temporality and communal
identity. Against current ideologies that compete about which one of
these

<B></B>

aspects, most commonly either the ethnic or the sexual,
should be seen as somehow foundational for the entirety of one's being,
prosaics regards each one as an equally valid ground base upon which one
learns to play out the infinitely complex variations that constitute our
freedom. Mikhail Bakhtin would argue that counterlives are imaginatively
enriching because, to adapt Caryl Emerson's apt phrase, they remind
us of the primacy of the differences we <I>make</I> over those with
which we are born.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 As a corollary to this theme one can
add Michael Frayn's insistence that "we don't choose a moral response
[from a pre-established set of options]; we construct one."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>

The step-by-step, never identical construc-tion of a life, a history, and
an ethic is the core of a prosaic practice and the principal imaginative
lesson of sideshadowing.

Because the word "holocaust" carries with it a penumbra of
unwelcome Christological echoes and still more unwelcome implications
of a divinely sanctioned sacrifice, I have preferred to use the
Hebrew word "Shoah" throughout this essay in referring to the Nazi
genocide. "Holocaust" is derived from the Greek <I>holokauston</I> used
in the Septuagint in the sense of "totally consumed by fire." In the
Septuagint it refers specifically to sacrifice by fire, assonant with
the Hebrew term for sacrificial offering, <I>olah</I>, which, as Berel
Lang explains,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
designates the type of ritual sacrifice that was to be completely burnt
(as in Leviticus 1:3). The English usage of holocaust in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries elaborated this literal sense of a religious burnt
offering; later, the term began to appear as a metaphor for sacrifice
more generally ...Both the Hebrew designation <I>shoah</I> ('wasteland'
or 'destruction,' as in Isaiah 10:3 and Proverbs 3:25) and the Yiddish
variation of the Hebrew <I>churban</I> ('destruction')--the latter
traditionally applied to the destruction of the Temples and then reapplied
metonymically to other destructions--are more accurately descriptive than
'Holocaust,' because they imply a breach or turning point in history
(<I>and</I> because they reject the connotation of 'sacrifice').

Austrian Jews had long been in the habit of vacationing
at resorts that were hospitable to them, less out of any particular
"clannishness" or desire to remain exclusively among their own kind
than as a consequence of being barred from numerous other spas. George
Berkeley quotes a proclamation by the mayor of one of these spa towns,
Maria Tafel, issued in July 1920: "It has been repeatedly observed that
Jews are finding lodgings and meals in Maria Tafel. Owners of hotels,
coffee houses, and inns are requested not to cater to Jews...Maria Tafel
is the most famous health resort in Lower Austria and not a Jewish
temple." Berkeley adds that "another resort community, Erfinding,
decreed that no Jew could stay in the town for more than twenty-four
hours." (Berkeley, <I>Vienna and Its Jews,</I> 158.) In 1922, in order
to be allowed to stay overnight in the resort town of Mattsee, near
Salzburg, Arnold Schoenberg was asked to produce a certificate of baptism
to counter charges that he was a Jew. Although Schoenberg had converted
to Lutheranism in 1898, the incident at Mattsee, along with others of
a similar character, acted as a catalyst for the composer's return to
Judaism. (Robert S. Wistrich, <I>The Jews of Vienna in the Age of Franz
Joseph,</I> [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989], 630-32.) Thus,
no matter how assimilationist, or how eager to deny their identities,
long before the date of the novel's actions, vacationers in a place like
Badenheim would have been sufficiently conscious of being Jews to have
chosen (or been indirectly forced) to go to a resort that was ready to
accept them. Moreover, Appelfeld is fully aware of these details, and
freely uses them in his other novels. <I>The Age of Wonders,</I> for
example, opens with the twelve-year-old narrator's memory of when he
and his mother were suddenly expelled from the vacation resort where
they were spending the summer of 1938.

Similarly, on 29 October 1992, when seventeen-year-old
Lemrick Nelson, Jr. was acquitted of all charges in the murder of
Rosenbaum, the black and Hasidic communities were united in the conviction
that the whole trial was determined by racist motives. But for the first
group, Nelson's initial arrest and trial was the result of collusion
between a corrupt police force and a suborned city medical examiner's
office eager to find a "black sacrificial lamb"; for the second group,
the teenager's release was seen as due largely to the jury's anti-Semitism
and fear of mob violence. An official report of the entire Crown Heights
episode, commissioned by New York Governor Mario Cuomo and overseen by
Richard Girgenti, the state's Director of Criminal Justice, concluded
that the entire city administration, including the Mayor David Dinkins,
the Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown, and top police commanders, were all
at fault for not preventing the escalation of violence. The report also
blamed inept police procedure in handling the evidence against Lemrick
Nelson, and prejudicial "statements and demeanor" by the presiding judge,
New York Supreme Court Justice Edward Rappaport, for Nelson's complete
acquittal. Racism, the report concluded, was not a major issue in the
jury's verdict. (<I>New York Times,</I> 21 July 1993, A1, B10.)

"Daddy" in <I>The Collected Poems of Sylvia Plath</I> (New
York: Harper and Row, 1981), 223. No doubt a different reading of the poem
would emphasize its rhetoric as the recreation of a child's distorted
vision--the language of a child who grew up in America during the war
and internalized American propaganda images. But such a reading, defended
to me most forcefully by my colleague Alex Zwerdling, still seems to me
ultimately unpersuasive.
