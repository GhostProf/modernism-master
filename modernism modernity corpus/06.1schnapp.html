Every culture has its founding myths, and a culture like our own, built
upon the worship of technics and science, is no exception to the rule.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 If many of its inaugural texts and artifacts proudly proclaim their
 resistance to the blandishments of mythology in the name of a brave
 new post-mythological world, others (perhaps with greater honesty and
 lucidity) identify this very stance as modernity's founding myth. For
 them, the dream of overcoming all prior mythologies constitutes a
 revolutionary myth. It promises access to a technicist Olympus through
 not only an overcoming of history, but also the advent of a heroic
 new humankind emancipated from the shackles of temporality. Such a
 text is the 1909 "Foundation and Manifesto of 
 
  
 
 Futurism": a document
 which, for all its bombast and bathos, rightly deserves the key place
 that it was long ago assigned in accounts of the birth of cultural
 modernism. The manifesto opens with a clash between objects that is
 also an intergenerational clash. It pits copper mosque lamps perforated with stars against their
own "electric hearts": light bulbs whose brilliance they constrain; light
bulbs ting to break out. The copper mosque lamps stand in for a larger
inventory of objects--plates, cabinets, oriental carpets--inherited by the
manifesto's author, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, from his father. Objects
that bear witness to the poet's upbringing in Alexandria, Egypt, but
that, in so doing, crystallize everything that the manifesto subsequently
identifies with the term pass&eacute;ism: ancestral indolence; the
celebration of dead or moribund things; world-weariness; a taste for the
precious, the arcane, and the exotic; repugnance for the present. This
past-centered, contemplative paternal world, responsible for the decor of
the poet's apartment on Milan's Via Senato, is about to be left behind
by the manifesto's second paragraph. The catalyst for its abandonment
is the flow of traffic. A passing trolley and a roaring automobile drive
Marinetti and his young friends out into the streets, where, bathing in
the stark, artificial glare of the new public sphere, they can proclaim
the overcoming of "mythology" thanks to the appearance of two new modes
of transportation: automobiles ("we are on the verge of experiencing
the birth of the Centaur") and airplanes ("soon we will see the first
Angels fly!").
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mythology is overcome inasmuch as, in Marinetti's view and in that of
his era, technology actualizes what was once only a poetic dream or a
theological fiction. It gives rise to "living" machines that are also
machines for living: machines that, because endowed with powers of agency,
intuition, and moral autonomy, are capable of serving as prosthetic
enhancements of human bodies and psyches. Two body/ machine complexes
are mentioned in the passages just cited: the driver/automobile complex
red by the Centaur and the pilot/airplane complex red by the
Angel. The first structures the central episode of the 1909 manifesto:
the automotive flight into the outskirts of the city culminating with
a crash cast as the actual scene of Futurism's birth.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 It is this drive and accident, and the transformative impact ascribed to
 it that constitute my springboard for the following reflections. Before
 the accident, Marinetti appears bound to a shadowy fin-de-si&egrave;cle
 world of mosque lamps and oriental carpets; after his rebirth in the
 "good factory muck [with its] impasto of metallic shavings, useless
 sweats, and celestial shards," he emerges as the new metallic man with
 a pulsing light-bulb heart: the prophet of a gospel addressed to all
 the living men on the earth whose points include "singing the love of
 danger," "exalting aggressive movement, feverish insomnia, the sprint,
 the mortal leap, the slap and the punch," the glorification of war
 as the "hygiene of the world," and the demolition of institutions of
 memory such as museums, libraries, and academies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 The new humanity forged through this initiation rite is literally
 and ratively in the global driver's seat: "the ideal lance-like
 projection of the steering wheel that he grasps in his hands," states
 point five, "crosses the Earth, in the course of its own speeding orbit."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Two questions stand at the core of the present inquiry: first, why the
choice of a speeding automobile as the vehicle for this metamorphosis
which I take as the emblem of the transformation of premodern into modern
man; and second, why the



emphasis upon traumatic birth (or why must a crash resolve the initial
clash)? The answers that I provide are necessarily speculative but place
Futurism's founding myth at the culminating point of an anthropology of
speed and thrill that evolved over the course of two prior centuries:
an "anthropology" inasmuch as it envisages accelerated motion not as a
neutral physical event that leaves the traveler and the context traveled
through unchanged. On the contrary, the transportation revolution of the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries precipitated fundamental perceptual
and psychic changes in human subjects and in the fantasies that governed
their modes of interconnection with landscapes traversed and viewed:
changes that suggest a tight linkage between the history of transportation
technologies and that of optical devices, from phantasmagoria to moving
pictures, such that the story of moving vehicles is, from the start, the
story of moving cameras; changes that so blur the distinction between
the categories of realism and the hallucinatory or the fantastic that
they demand a rethinking of the commonplace notion that modernism marks
a revolt against naturalism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The following essay represents little more than a test drive of a
book-length argument that, in its full unfolding, will include full
treatments of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's accident in the <I>R&ecirc;veries
du promeneur solitaire</I>; of John Mytton, sporting gentleman and
wanton seeker of accidents whether riding horses or driving gigs and
phaetons, and of the film magicians Georges Meli&egrave;s, R. W. Paul,
and Mack Sennett, codifiers of crashes as a generative comic device. Here
the itinerary has been reduced to a series of shortcuts running from
Delisle de Sales's 1771 <I>Lettre de Brutus sur les chars anciens et
modernes</I>; to Thomas De Quincey, whose hallucinatory experience of
landscape atop a mail-coach prered his later opium-induced imaginings;
to caricaturists such as George Cruikshank; to the Andy Warhol of the
early 1960s whose silk-screened <I>Car Crashes</I> coincide with his
first icons of Elizabeth Taylor; and to, finally, Vaughn, the hero of
J. G. Ballard's novel <I>Crash</I>  whose life of auto crashes
culminates in "his only true accident": the automotive masterpiece for
which he has been rehearsing his entire life--a crash landing atop the
same movie actress (whose failure qualifies it all the more as his only
<I>true</I> accident).
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Five complementary hypotheses inform this drive: first, that a
 fundamental bifurcation occurs by the beginning of the nineteenth century
 between <I>passenger</I>-centered and <I>driver</I>-centered modes of
 transportation or, to state the matter otherwise, between modes of mass
 transit and individual transportation, whether in the experiences and
 fantasies to which they give rise or in the sorts of discourses that are
 elaborated in order to regulate and represent them; second, that once
 technology devised a sufficient buffer between the surface traveled, the
 force of propulsion, and the individual traveler, it became possible
 to envisage speed as a kind of drug, an intensifier, an <I>excitant
 moderne</I>; third, that the human subject of speed--typically 
 <B></B> 
 the
 driver--whom I will refer to later as the <I>kinematic subject</I>,
 once reshaped by repeated experiences of this stimulant, finds himself
 caught in an addiction loop, threatened, on the one hand, by monotony,
 and, on the other, by the need for ever



new stimuli in order to maintain the same level of intensity; fourth,
that the crash becomes a necessary feature of this loop structure, at once
vouching for its legitimacy (by crystallizing the very intensity for which
it stands), serving as a regenerative device (by initiating a new cycle of
hyperstimulation), and marking an absolute limit (death); and fifth, that
every accident requires a viewer, or better, a <I>voyeur</I> to relay its
stimulus out into the world. The accident, in short, will emerge as the
locus of a form of trauma that, contrary to prevailing traumatocentric
accounts of modernity, engenders neither psychic blockage nor new
sure-fire forms of regimentation or alienation. Rather, in the works I
am here examining, trauma thrills. The thrills in question may be cheap
or expensive, private or public, humble or exalted, but, whatever their
nature, they represent, I will argue, a distinctively modern redaction
of the sublime. In the eighteenth century the sublime transported spirits
enclosed in motionless bodies; in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
it spirits away bodies that are themselves transported. In both cases
it plays a key role in engendering modern forms of individualism and in
secularizing the supernatural and relocating it in the everyday. If the
driver was a god or angel in pre-modern times, the gods or angels of the
modern era will be found holding the reins or sitting behind the wheel, so
identifying individuality with the possession of and mastery over wheels.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Accelerated motion emerged early on as one of modernity's heroic themes,
but it was hardly an invention of the modern era. Hence the recurring
emphasis in this essay on the prehistory of the modern anthropology
of speed and thrill. Such a rear view mirror gaze is absent from most
cultural histories of modern travel and transportation: histories that,
troping the claims made by their objects of study, reduce speed's history
to that of motorization and mechanization.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Omitted in the process is all but passing reference either to antiquity
 or to the coaching and horsemanship subcultures of the pre- or early
 motorized era. The latter sub-culture's rise to prominence during the
 second half of the eighteenth century took place in a context where
 there was acute sensitivity to questions of historical precedence. It
 unleashed a veritable <I>querelle des anciens et des modernes</I>,
 hinging upon comparisons between ancient and modern carriage designs,
 driving styles, racing practices, engineering techniques, and roadways;
 a <I>querelle</I> definitively resolved in favor of the moderns only
 in the early decades of the nineteenth century. Already a defining
 feature of the early history of industrialization, granted a place of
 honor in Diderot and D'Alembert's <I>Encyclopedia</I>, the coaching
 revolution is the rupture event in this essay's narrative. I argue that
 it, not the development of railways or motorcars, first set the terms
 for the entanglement of modern notions of subjecthood with experiences
 of accelerated motion. But the break in question is an incomplete one,
 haunted by the premodern and ancient past to such a degree that, to
 this day, totemic or mythological names like Aurora, Viper, Valkyrie,
 Jaguar, Fury, Electra, and Cobra 
 
 <B></B> 
 
 still vie with technicist acronyms
 like 635csi and 900ss for primacy as names of motor vehicles.



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In reestablishing the inaugural role performed by the pre-motorization
phase of the cultural history of speed, I also call attention to
ancient precedents that were regularly recalled in the course of
their modern overcoming. I infer that the enduring nature of these
processes of cultural-historical imitation and translation, points
not only to the struggle to confer legitimacy upon unfamiliar (and
therefore threatening and thrilling) new phenomena, but also to some
fundamental continuities of an anthropological sort. A few features of
rapid motion's association with pleasure, power, and joyous fear, that
is, appear to qualify as transhistorical and transcultural facts. Since
time immemorial children have felt the fascination of fast-moving
objects; spun themselves dizzy and silly; achieved rapture by means
of rocking, swinging, sliding, and running; simulated crashes and
smash-ups. Such childhood intoxications may be vascular, muscular,
perceptual or erotic in nature. Some appear to have greater purchase
upon the masculine psyche, though most are common features as well of
girlhood development. But, whatever their nature or gender contours, they
readily translate into a wide array of adult pleasures and pursuits,
from literal inebriation to athletic competition to military drills to
genital couplings to mystical transports. The convergence contributes to
an <I>erotico-transcendental</I> characterization of speed that seems to
be nearly universal. Velocity is attributed to sovereign and supernatural
agents (like monarchs, fairies, and angels, who can both move rapidly and
immediately transform their words into actions in the physical world),
to forces of nature (like thunderbolts and winds), and to the movements
of the heavens. When and if mortals partake of it, velocity's effect
is <I>rapturous</I> either in the calamitous sense illustrated by the
myth of Phaeton, son of the Sun god and the Western tradition's first
reckless teenage driver--or in the metamorphic sense illustrated by the
story of Erichthonius, the mythical inventor of the chariot as prosthetic
extension of self, deified as a constellation according to legend. And
the vehicle by means of which rapture is accomplished becomes at once the
image of a transred self, an object of desire in its own right, and
the crystallization of desire's logic of excess. Every car is a vehicle
of and for desire: an observation that applies every bit as much to the
erotically ornamented, owner-driven cabriolets of eighteenth-century
Paris as it does to J. G. Ballard's cars that crash to come.

 The auto accident had transpired more than four months earlier: on
 October 15, 1908, to be exact, with Marinetti, aged 31, at the wheel
 of a four-cylinder Fiat sporting cabriolet, custom-manufactured 
 
 <B></B> 

for
 its owner (as was then the standard practice) (<A HREF="6.1schnapp_1.html"> 1</A>). A contemporary
 newspaper report reads:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

This morning, a bit before noon, F. T. Marinetti was heading down Via
Domodossola in his car. The vehicle's owner was at the wheel accompanied
by a 23 year-old mechanic, Ettore Angelini. Although the details of the
incident remain sketchy, it appears that an evasive maneuver was required
by the sudden appearance of a bicyclist, and resulted in the vehicle being
flipped into a ditch. Marinetti and mechanic were immediately rescued by
two race car drivers from the Isotta and Fraschini factory, Trucco and
Giovanzani, each in his car. Marinetti was transported to his apartment
by the former and seems to have received little more than a scare. The
mechanic was taken by Giovanzani to the Institute on Via Paolo Sarpi,
where he was treated for minor wounds.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even before its literary reworking, the scene has all the trappings of
a modern allegory of the sort that abound in the writings of Simmel
or Benjamin. The poet proceeds down the boulevard of the industrial
metropolis like a mechanically enhanced <I>fl&acirc;neur</I>, observing
everything and nothing. Distinguished amidst the flow of pedestrians
and vehicles by the costly coach which surrounds him as if it were his
modern coat of armor, he is literally and ratively in the driver's
seat. Swiftly and unexpectedly another modern subject, of lesser rank,
a cyclist, crosses his path. Shocked, he attempts an evasive action that
is fated to fail because the rapidity of the apparition exceeds the pace
of ratiocination. The result is a collision in which the poet's pose of
singularity and sovereignty is unmasked as a tawdry illusion. Man and
machine are ripped asunder; the thrill of speed gives way to terror and
paralysis; the cyclist pedals on indifferently; the urban crowd bears
witness to the unmasking; a newspaper places the event in circulation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Shock was not a distinctive phenomenon of the nineteenth century, tied to
the rise of motorized conveyances, contrary to what is usually assumed
by modern cultural 

<B></B>

historians. Closely affiliated with classical and
early modern psychologies of rapture and ecstasy, its codification as
a secular experience was already fully underway during the preceding
century (often within the framework of theorizations of the sublime).
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>



What motorization did bring, however, was greater scale and a greater
diffusion, and shock's consequent embrace as a major theme of the emerging
sciences of psychophysiology and psychology. From its earliest appearance
in studies of newly defined ailments such as "railway spine," where
it was envisaged as a physical tearing of bodily fibers, through its
reformulation in psychoanalysis as a violent rending of the psyche's
stimulus shield, shock was universally characterized as a pathogen. So,
the driver of our motorcar might be expected to present a range of
symptoms of disease: either immediately "impaired or perverted motion,
impaired or perverted sensation, impaired or perverted emotional,
intellectual, or moral intelligence"
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 or delayed manifestations of hysteria that will subside only with
 time. In the words of John Eric Erichsen, the pioneering author of a
 1882 study <I>On the Concussion of the Spine, Nervous Shock and Other
 Obscure Injuries of the Nervous System</I>: "It will be found that as
 the patient recovers from the immediate and primary depression of the
 shock, he, or more frequently she, becomes greatly agitated, nervous,
 or truly hysterical, often manifesting great excitement, and being
 soothed and pacified with difficulty."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 To this account Freud would add a rative understanding of
 the wounding process that differentiates more clearly (though
 problematically) between the shocking event and its traumatic long-term
 consequences. Because of the overwhelming nature of the stimulus
 involved, the crash ought to precipitate the sort of psychic blockage
 associated with the terrors of trench warfare: a neurotic fixation upon
 the event and a constant, even obsessive rehearsal of its details, that
 hinders all further psychic development.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Similarly, if the driver were Walter Benjamin's dandy or Georg Simmel's
 metropolitan man, his response might well be expected to consist in some
 sort of reaction-formation to the lingering sense of horror and its
 paralyzing effect: the adoption, for instance, of an intensified pose
 of aloofness and indifference to protect the psychic stimulus shield
 against future injury, combined with a propensity to pre-emptively
 shock others in order not to be shocked back.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the 1909 manifesto the pattern is otherwise. Marinetti returns to the
crash site only once and, while he borrows from the physical/psychological
profiles just retraced, he systematically inverts their meaning, recasting
trauma as ecstasy, accident as adventure, death drive as joy ride. Here,
as in Futurism's subsequent history, shocks, or, as they were often
referred to in the scientific literature, <I>thrills</I>--registered
epidermally and/or as psychic disturbances, are actively sought out:
sought out on the highways; in the trenches; in galleries, theaters, and
stadiums; in the streets. Irrespective of where they are found, shocks
re as engines of bliss: as orgasm, rapturous play, release from
the constraints of analytical reason, regression to states of infantile
narcissism or pre-Oedipal boundarylessness. Rather than paralyzing or
blocking, rather than needing to be parried by a defensively formed
subject, they sunder bonds to the past and, in their place, forge new
links: links between 

<B></B> 

men, machines, and their environment; links that
extend the individual's physical and mental reach. In the specific case
of Futurism's founding myth, the crash and the scare that it engenders
wed flesh to metal, thereby giving birth--or so the manifesto



claims--to a metallized and multiplied humanity, immune to the threats
posed by degeneration, fatigue, mortality, and an overburdened historical
consciousness. The event marks a fresh start to be followed by a
potentially infinite series of fresh starts. Like the crash-site photos
in Ballard's novel that shape every new conjunction of chrome, plastic,
fluid, and flesh into a "small museum of excitement and possibility,"
it stops the action only to unleash renewed surges of drives and desires.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 There can be no real gap thus between the ecstatic instant in which,
 feeling "his heart deliciously pierced by the [vehicle's] red-hot iron
 of joy," Marinetti is simultaneously metallized and ejected, and the
 continuation of the Centaur's voyage towards ever new thrills: "They
 thought my beautiful shark was dead," concludes the manifesto, before
 proclaiming its eleven-point platform, "but a mere caress was enough
 to revive it, and see it now resuscitated, speeding away anew on its
 powerful fins!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Shark and driver were merely playing dead; theirs was a <I>petite</I>
 <I>mort</I>. Quickly revived, welcomed into the eternally youthful
 fraternity of race car drivers with wheels, they rush off to crush new
 barriers and to crash new worlds. Accidents can happen along the road to
 Damascus or the Via Domodossola. And once they do, they tend to become
 turning points, taking on an air of irreversibility or necessity.

The above fable of death and rebirth might seem superfluous, given that
the manifesto is about to proclaim the racing car as the paragon of
modern beauty-in-motion, superior to the static beauty of the Victory of
Samothrace. But the history of transportation systems suggests, on the
contrary, that it describes one of modern individualism's key rites of
passage. From the mid-eighteenth century onward there had developed
two interconnected though separate cultures of transportation:
one that is best designated as <I>thrill-based</I>; the other as
<I>commodity-based</I>. The first is, characteristically, the province
of drivers (and of passengers who are "driver-identified"). Akin to
"cruising," it envisages the purpose of the journey as the journey
itself, independent of the practical imperatives of getting from here to
there. It views the space to be traversed as <I>space to be consumed</I>
(whether as outer spectacle or inner <I>dur&eacute;e</I>) by a human
subject who is conceived of as the author and administrator of his or
her speed. The second, the near exclusive concern of passenger-centered
studies like Wolfgang Schivelbusch's justly celebrated <I>The Railway
Journey</I>, envisages the journey instead in instrumental terms: as
movement within a network of departure and destination points between
which extends only vacant, useless <I>space-space to be collapsed</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Though both models require the sort of accelerated motion made available
 by technologies that detach traveler from vehicle and vehicle from
 context, the first strives to convert this detachment into <I>new modes
 of reattachment</I>, while the second 
 
 <B></B> 
 
 does the opposite: it reinforces
 the process of detachment by isolating and enclosing human passengers
 as if they were packages.



<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The dichotomy is perhaps too sharply drawn, given that the thrills to
which I allude may correctly be viewed as a subjective correlative
of commodification and commodification as thrill's objective
correlative. Any reduction of the one to the other, however, runs
the risk of underestimating the disruptive potential of thrill and
neglecting the genetic role it performs vis &agrave; vis modern forms of
individualism. So let the distinction stand as a heuristic device. During
the tens of centuries that human beings rode horses, velocity remained
a cultural theme of mostly secondary significance. Either cosmic (as
in the whirling of the celestial spheres) or comic (as an inversion
of the <I>gravitas</I> expected of authority res), it was either
otherworldly--the attribute of angels, demons or gods--or, if thisworldly,
identified with the lower social orders: with messengers, couriers,
entertainers, and thieves. Which isn't to imply that accelerated motion
was unappreciated in pre-modern times. The contrary, of course, is
true. Armies were praised and feared for the speed of their war chariots;
athletes admired for their fleet-footedness; and professional charioteers
vied for glory in Roman hippodromes much like contemporary race car
drivers. Topics of this sort abound in ancient art and literature, from
Pindar's fleet-footed warrior-athletes to Virgil's Erichthonius who
"first dared to couple four steeds to the car, and to stand victorious
over the flying wheels."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 No more indicative example of this corpus could be found than the myth
 of Phaeton. Taunted about his uncertain origins, the son of the sun god
 seeks reassurance from Helios himself, who promises to grant his son's
 every wish. As proof of his divine ascendancy, Phaeton requests what
 has now become the absolute proof of passage into adulthood throughout
 the industrialized world: the keys to dad's car--in this case, the
 reins to the solar chariot. Phaeton's inability to maintain control
 of the vehicle's powerful horses, allegorized over many centuries as
 the passions, leads to a thrill ride and cosmic calamity among whose
 latter-day counterparts one may count the automotive deaths of teen-idols
 like James Dean.

Velocity serves as an agent of individuation and conquest, much as will
be the case in modern times, with the ground traversed being envisaged as
the site upon which the god-like individual establishes his empire. But
competition and fame were the aims of Horace's <I>domini terrarum</I>,
not the pursuit of aesthetic experiences with initiatory implications

Early modern carts, carriages, and coaches did little to alter the
situation described above inasmuch as through the beginning of the
eighteenth century, their nature was either practical--the transportation
of cargo or passengers over modest distances--or processional--the
display of aristocratic power and prestige. It was, of course, not
impossible to employ them for purposes of accelerated travel and coaches'
upsurge in popularity first within and then outside courtly circles
by the turn of the seventeenth century induced panic in the likes of
the waterman-poet John Taylor whose pamphlet <I>The World Runnes on
Wheeles</I> casts them in the role of <I>upstart Hell-carts</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 (<A HREF="6.1schnapp_2.html"> 2</A>). But whatever the merits of these infernal conveyances with
 respect to Taylor's beloved ferry boats, coaches provided a far slower
 and more awkward means of locomotion than riding on horseback. The
 same goes for the diligences employed by Royal Messageries throughout
 Baroque and Enlightenment Europe. As late as 1790 these elephantine
 ancestors of modern buses and trains were designed to carry several dozen
 passengers riding high above the road in capacious cabins, suspended
 upon leather straps attached to axle-mounted metal perches or whip
 springs. Unreliable, vulnerable to highway robbers, dangerous despite
 their slowness, weighing up to five tons, sites of unexpected amorous
 and not-so-amorous encounters, they were famous for tipping over as
 well as for rocking their passengers into collective states of nausea.

So speed meant horses. But the mere experience of riding on horseback was
not enough to establish a modern culture of velocity. Speed's rise as a
cultural thematic, its move into an everyday realm of perceptibility, its
adoption as sacrament of modern individualism, became possible only with
the development of mechanical buffers between rider, horse, and roadway:
buffers that enable new fantasies of attachment, first, between rider
and engine, and, then, according to a more complex logic, 

<B></B> 

between rider,
engine, vehicle, and/or landscape. The event is charted in passages like



the following (dating from 1837), which first become frequent around
the turn of the nineteenth century:

The man who rides a horse, feels a pleasure when the creature responds
willingly to his purposes; and when he responds unwillingly, he feels a
pride in the exercise of his power to compel him to obedience. Even when
a horse is vicious, there is a pleasurable excitement in riding him. The
rider's nerves are strung, his senses are quickened; eye, hand, and ear
are alike on the alert; the blood rushes through the veins, and every
faculty is aroused.

Horses served as humankind's first kinetic prosthesis. From time
immemorial, warriors and knights had been identified with their
mounts. But the horse belonged to another order of being. It was a
detachable, external marker of the hero's power: an object to be won
and worn like armor, a diadem or a sword. By the end of the eighteenth
century, the terms of the fantasy have altered. Man and animal now belong
to precisely the same order of being. The <I>homme de cheval</I> and the
<I>cheval d'homme</I> have both become expressions of a single life force
that has organized all creatures as living machines (. <A HREF="6.1schnapp_3.html">3</A>, <A HREF="6.1schnapp_4.html">4</A>). In the
words of Jean-Claude Izouard Delisle de Sales, 

<B></B> 

the eighteenth century's
most passionate critic of the new culture of speed: "At first



glance, the horse seems everything but a dangerous beast: the bands
that encircle his body, the irons attached to him, the bit that has
been devised so as to render his movements more exact, and the spurs
with which he is prodded to move more rapidly: all this bespeaks of a
highly organized automaton who moves only according to the will of the
intelligent being that governs him."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 But a second glance confirms and contradicts the first. Just as woman and
 man are doubles and polar opposites, so it is with horse and rider. Their
 interaction breeds not only a battle for mastery, but also arousal,
 electricity, erotic friction: forces that are readily transferable
 to other sorts of machinery. Who is the true force of propulsion in
 the inset passage cited above, horse or rider? The answer is clearly
 "both." An early ancestor of the Futurist Centaur and contemporary
 sport motorcyclist, this neurologically tense, aroused human subject, in
 conflict with but confused with a neurologically tense, aroused mount
 whose nature he shares is the product of a revolution that began in
 the mid-eighteenth century with the development and popularization
 of lightweight two-wheel cabriolets and four-wheel phaetons, the
 predecessors of modern sports cars.

  Propelled by teams of horses, associated with luxury, liberty, and
  license, these vehicles were driven along public thoroughfares by
  the owners themselves: an absolute novelty at the time and one that
  was widely perceived as a menace both to morality and to class and

 Which is to say that driving became a "necessity" of modern life nearly
 two centuries before suburban youths began to pester their parents

From the outset, the driver was a dandy who required the supplement of
wheels. Wheels intimately associated with the rapidly spinning wheels
of fashion that may assume the form of cabriolets and phaetons or of
subsequent <I>automates organis&eacute;s</I> like the "dandy horses"
that were all the rage during the first decade of the nineteenth century
(. <A HREF="6.1schnapp_5.html">5</A>, <A HREF="6.1schnapp_6.html">6</A>). Indeed, the Baron of Drais's invention, tellingly referred
to by him as a <I>Laufmaschine</I> (running machine) and by others as
a "walking accelerator," "pedestrian carriage" or "pedestrian hobby
horse," played a key transitional role, on the one hand, by literally
mechanizing the horse in the collective imaginary, and, on the other,
by radicalizing the notion that the modern subject was, by definition,
a subject in motion, a thrill seeker, a <I>v&eacute;loceman</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 More than a century before Simmel's "metropolitan man" and a good half

For the dandy-fl&acirc;neur-driver garbed in his or her vehicle, wheels
furnish a new mode of recreation and self-creation. Be they horseless

perambulation, as <I>kinetic self-display</I>. Wheels re as the locus
of a new subjectivity and a new social identity. They mirror the driver's
standing: his literal "hobby horse." But, in so doing, they reshape
society along the lines suggested by Mercier and Delisle de Sales. New
class distinctions arise: between drivers and pedestrians; between
owner-drivers and driver-chauffeurs; between seekers of thrills and
seekers of passage; between owners of coup&eacute;s, phaetons, enclosed
carriages, carts, and hackney cabs. Other distinctions blur as lords,
clothiers, clerks, and dancers merge into the undifferentiated form of
mass spectacle and collective rush known as <I>traffic</I>. The traffic
jam was, from the beginning, the liturgical ritual of modern times by
means of which a new kinematic humanity, a humanity with wheels, becomes
one in its multiplicity.

The spread of this "epidemic" of mobile self-display, thanks to which
individuality became identified with administration of one's own speed,
terrified rural populations and transformed cities like Paris and London
into nightmarish killing fields in the eyes of many observers. Mercier
states that "he has earned the right to criticize the barbaric luxury
that are today's coaches, having been knocked to the pavement on three
different occasions and nearly run over alive."

 Like many of his peers, Louis Charles Fougeret de Monbron, writing in
 1759, sees traffic in an apocalyptic light: "a spirit of vertigo and
 drunkenness seems to have overcome these funereal sites."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 His views are echoed a half century later in an official report by the
 central offices of the canton of Paris ("[most men and women driving
 cabriolets] proceed at frightening speeds, yielding a daily crop of
 fatal accidents") and in graphic works such as George Cruikshank's <I>The
 Comforts of a Cabriolet or the Advantages of Driving Hoodwinked</I>, in
 which the mere crossing of a dog at a Hyde Park intersection is enough
 to precipitate a three-fold mangling of cabs, horses, passengers,
 and coachmen
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>

 drivers, whom they were quick to identify as avenging gods much like

 him into "Toad the terror, the traffic queller, the Lord of the lone

 Such behaviors are seen as being in keeping with the infernal character
 of their favorite conveyance: the cabriolet. "And what

"who coolly and gratuitously throws open the gates to his residence and
rushes out like a madman in pursuit of a thousand peers and thrusts upon

Whether or not the effects of this revolution were as nightmarish as

 res for England over the subsequent seventy-five year period continue
 this trend, with 18,000 carriages registered in 1775 and 106,000 in 1840.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 With this multiplication came efforts to widen and straighten out
 streets, regulate traffic, differentiate sidewalks from roadways,
 standardize wheel sizes, devise forms of insurance coverage, and
 legislate liability in the case of accidents. Efforts that had the
 effect also of encouraging a further acceleration of motion. But from
 the standpoint of speed, the key threshold was crossed only at the
 turn of the nineteenth century with the development of two isolating
 technologies: first, Eliot's 1805 invention of the elliptical spring,
 which permitted carriages to be hung low on springs and lightened by
 eliminating the need for perches; and second, MacAdam's scientific
 approach to roadbuilding, according to which "a road ought to be
 considered" less as a building requiring a massive stone foundation,
 than "as a [lightweight] artificial flooring forming a strong, smooth,
 solid surface, at once capable of carrying great weight, and over which
 carriages may pass without meeting any impediment."

The history of "the elastic substances interposed between the wheels and
the passengers or load, in order to intercept the concussion caused by
the wheels revolving on an uneven surface" is little studied, relegated
to periodicals read only by those nostalgic for coaching days and
coaching ways.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 But its impact upon both driver/passenger perceptions was second
 only to that of modern paving technologies. As already indicated,
 the earliest modern carriages relied upon rigid perches anchored to
 the four corners of a vehicle's lower chassis in order to protect the
 seating area against the jarring effect of roadway ruts. The coach's
 body was hung from these perches on longitudinal leather straps that
 were supplemented with "check" straps so as to limit lateral rocking as
 well as forward or backward loading. The result was a swaying movement
 punctuated by violent jolts. "Is there a man left alive," asks a later
 proponent of steel suspension systems, "who has ridden on the footboard
 of an aristocratic town coach or chariot without springs, and [not]
 had the calves of his legs shaken down over his ankles, or the lower
 part of the muscles thickened till the legs resembled bed-posts?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 This sort of pummeling was bad enough, but along with bruises came the
 <I>terra firma</I> equivalent of seasickness. In the words of Walter
 Scott: "the motion is as a ship rocking or beating against a heavy sea,
 straining all her timbers as she drives over the contending waves."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Only during the final decades of the eighteenth century did improvements
in steel fabrication techniques make possible a new generation of
suspension-system designs which included laminated cantilever springs
(with a rigid mount at one end and a live mount at the other) and single
or double sweep semi-elliptic "grasshopper springs." The revolution
entered its mature phase in 1805 when Eliot obtained a patent for joining
two semi-elliptics together in a single elliptical spring. Eliot's
invention inspired a wide range of modified elliptic systems like the
four-spring platform adopted on mail coaches, all of which absorbed
jolts and enhanced traction to a hitherto unimaginable degree. Just like
the truck and bus suspensions that are their descendants, these systems
reduced kinematic drag and increased maneuverability and stability, while
providing a smoothed out ride. Detaching driver and passenger from the
brute physicality of the roadway, they pursued the elusive dream of a
buffered reattachment. Their ideal was and still is the achievement of
<I>road feel</I>.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Better known and better studied is the history of road building.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 Ancient Roman accomplishments were legendary in this domain. So to
 a greater degree than in the case of carriage designs, there arose a
 technological <I>querelle des anciens et des modernes</I> whose outcome
 soon proved favorable to the moderns. Roman practice was characterized
 by massive constructions made up of as many as five strata, resulting
 in a costly, but robust sort of self-supporting lateral wall that held
 up well under the slow traffic for which it was designed. The growth
 of cities and expanded trade patterns fueled a revival of enthusiasm
 for Roman roadways during the seventeenth century, but their image of
 "incomparable grandeur and power" began to wane as new, scientific
 approaches promised more economical solutions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Solutions that would eventually overturn the logic of prior road building
 for they no longer envisaged

<B></B>

roadways as self-supporting artificial constructions akin to buildings
or walls, but rather as smooth and impermeable membranes directly
connected to and thinly applied over a natural support with the aim of
shielding this natural foundation against water seepage and the effects
of accelerated traffic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The perceptual impact of the shift cannot be overstated. From the
fortress-like emblems of human resistance to an always encroaching and
hostile natural landscape that roadways once seemed, they evolved instead
into imaginary prolongations of the natural/national landscapes to which
they granted access. For all their artifice and technical refinement,
in other words, roadways now attained an increasing "intimacy" with
their natural support and surroundings in the collective imaginary:
so much so that <I>road feel</I> became intertwined with contemporary
conceptions of a <I>feeling for landscape</I>. And this intertwined road
feel and feeling for landscape, in turn, became interwoven with traveler's
national feelings. It gave rise, that is, to a new nationalist mythology
that envisaged roadway networks--be they English turnpikes, German
<I>Autobahnen</I>, Italian <I>autostrade</I>, or American freeways--as
the arterial system of the nation's body and driving along them as a
form of communion. By the turn of the century, the eighteenth-century
literature of the sublime and the picturesque thus becomes ever more
literally a road literature, with the romance of the road itself
increasingly framing the experience of landscape.

The principal father of the modern roadway was John Loudon
McAdam. Celebrated as the "Colossus of Roads" or as "McAdam the Magician"
by cartoonists and journalists alike, McAdam had no engineering background
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 (<A HREF="6.1schnapp_8.html"> 8</A>). But from 1804, when he became general surveyor for the
 Bristol Corporation, through the years of his reports to parliament
 (1810-1823) to the time of his death , he became Europe's
 leading advocate of a simple but radical notion: that roadways required
 no foundation at all.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Rather, a properly drained, prepared, and protected

<B></B>

subsoil could support just about any load. The challenge, as McAdam saw
it, was to insure drainage and stress-reduction by devising a strong
and stiff roadway surface capable of acting as a coherent mass. This he
accomplished by placing a first layer of broken stone atop a slightly
cambered natural formation which was raised above the water table. A thin
top coating of extremely fine angular broken stone was laid down over
this base, so that the grinding action of passing wheels might rapidly
compress it into the so-called "road metal" or water-bound cement that
soon became known as <I>macadam</I>. So it was that the levels of carriage
comfort, control, and speed provided by new suspension systems found
their ideal complement in a paving technology whose basic principles
have remained unaltered to the present day. (The sole decisive change
between the era of McAdam the Magician and Norman Bel Geddes's <I>magic
motorways</I> being the use of bituminous tar instead of water as a
binding agent, so as to remedy the dust problems created by fast-moving
rubber tires.) "Macadamisation in modern times," wrote William Bridges
Adams in his 1837 <I>English Pleasure Carriages</I>, "has contrived to
make streets and roads as level as bowling greens . . . "
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 A contemporary added: "Even at the present wonder-working period, few
 greater improvements have been made in any of the useful arts, than
 in those applied to the system of traveling by land. Projectors and
 projects have multiplied with our years; and the fairy-petted princes
 of the Arabian Nights' Entertainments were scarcely transported from
 place to place with more facility or despatch, than Englishmen are at
 the present moment. From Liverpool to Manchester, thirty-six miles, in
 an hour and a half!--surely Dedalus is come amongst us again. . . . "
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Indeed, it was rolling smoothly out along the vast new network of alleys
 that the human subject of speed, the kinematic subject, would establish
 his empire. Thanks to Eliot and McAdam, the gods could come alive once
 again as contemporary Englishmen.

The absorption and removal of physical impediments, the enhancement
of traction, the creation of roadway and railway networks as regular
bodies sectioning irregular natural landscapes, all established not only
the preconditions for accelerated travel, but also for the simultaneous
emergence of a thrill-based culture of velocity and its commodity-based
complement. By 1820, the two had come together in a single contrivance:
the high-speed mail-coach or stage coach whose legacy was gradually taken
over by trains during the ensuing decades. By 1900, with the invention
of automobiles, they will have split off, with cars (motorcycles and
airplanes) becoming engines of thrill and trains (buses and tramways)
the conveyors of commodities. But let the mail-coach serve as an emblem

<I>from the inside</I>, where, like the passenger of the old diligences

Mail-coaches were frightfully fast by nineteenth-century standards,

conduits for the diffusion of news.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 John Palmer, the deviser of Britain's famously efficient national
 system, referred to his as "mail machines" and took it upon himself to
 standardize their design, to impose regular and rapid switches in horse
 trains, and to monitor their adherence to highly demanding schedules
 by equipping each vehicle with tamper-proof clocks
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 (<A HREF="6.1schnapp_9.html"> 9</A>). One result was the professionalization of the once lowly

 he was now transred into the much admired and emulated practitioner
 of a new high-speed <I>art</I>: driving "four in hand."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 The maximum speeds sustained by Palmer's <I>artists</I> may seem
 unexceptional today, but it is worth underscoring the point that
 "the ten-mile-an-hour flyer of the 1830s carried people who had seen
 incredible accelerations in their lifetimes--a trebling and quadrupling

<B></B>

of average speeds--and had never got over it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 One such person was William Hazlitt, who declared that "some persons

 that pour down Picadilly of an evening, tear up the pavement and devour

  Low-slung and built atop so-called "patent boxes," English mail-coaches
  were so lightweight that they could accommodate only seven paying
  passengers--four "insiders" and up to three "outsiders"--which is
  to say that their superior speed and reliability translated into
  elevated ticket prices. This said, traditional class distinctions were
  maintained. As had been the case with diligences, seats on the inside
  were costly and reserved for what one observer called "a porcelain
  variety of the human race," while external seats were inexpensive,
  dangerous, and reserved for mere "delf-ware."

Like Society [l'&Eacute;tat], a diligence has three compartments. The
aristocracy occupies the coup&eacute;; the bourgeoisie occupies the
interior; the popular classes occupy the rotunda in the back. But outside
on the imp&eacute;riale, atop everyone else, ride dreamers, artists,
and men belonging to no social class (les gens d&eacute;class&eacute;s).

The driver's perch, "bench" or "box" had long been referred to in French
as the <I>banquette b&acirc;ch&eacute;e de l'imp&eacute;riale</I>. Its
transformation into a site of privilege of a socially transgressive,
even revolutionary sort may be directly traced back to its use
by eighteenth-century travelers as a platform for experiencing the
picturesque and the sublime. So it is hardly surprising that, under a
regime of accelerated motion, the <I>imp&eacute;riale</I> became the
outdoor laboratory within which these aesthetic categories were reworked
in the service of new kinematic forms of subjectivity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Well before the advent of trains and automobiles, mail-coach passengers,
especially occupants of the <I>imp&eacute;riale</I>, identified the
experience of speed with dream-like states: flight, intoxication, rapture,
horror, hallucination. "It's a horrible thing to spend a night on a
mail-coach," reports Victor Hugo in his travel journal <I>Le Rhin</I>,
"one isn't in a vehicle, so much as a tornado. The mail-coach seems to
have gone into a frenzy."
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 For others like Sainte-Beuve, drunken-driving or drunken-riding are
 the mail-coach norm: "first, there is the drunkenness of feeling
 oneself indolently moved and projected by a rapid impulse towards an
 encounter with destiny; then, there's the naive pride of being gazed
 at and envied, across entire villages, in front of homes, by those who
 have been left behind."
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 The link between rapid motion, individuation, and an expanded sense of
 selfhood matching expanded horizons is picked up by the young Balzac:
 " . . . if only you knew how strongly I aspire to seize hold of nature
 by means of a long high-speed race across Europe, how strongly my soul
 thirsts for that which is vast, infinite, for nature seized as a whole
 and not in its details, nature judged according to its grand framings,
 be they wet with rain or rich with sun, in the course of traversing
 spaces and seeing countries rather than villages."
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
  Precisely the

<B></B>

same language carries over into reports of early or first-time railway
travel. For Thomas Carlyle, the train grants access to the fantastic:
"The whirl through the confused darkness, on those steam wings, was
one of the strangest things that I have ever experienced--hissing and
dashing on, one knew not whither . . . Out of one vehicle into another,
snorting and roaring we flew: the likest thing to a Faust's flight on
the Devil's mantle."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 The actress Fanny Kemble, likewise, imagines the train as a tame dragon
 who flies "panting along his iron pathway": "You cannot conceive what
 that sensation of cutting the air was . . . When I closed my eyes
 this sensation of flying was quite delightful, and strange beyond
 description."
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 Jeanne, the heroine of Maupassant's <I>Une Vie</I>, seeing "the
 countryside, trees, farms, villages speed by," recognizes in that
 hallucinatory flight, the catalyst of an inner transformation: "
 . . . terrified by the speed, rapt by a new life, [she is] transported
 into a world that is no longer hers, no longer that of her tranquil
 youth and monotonous existence."

Whether riding on mail-coaches, hobby horses or trains, or even
when engaging in the contemporary fad of fast-paced hiking known as
"pedestrianism," these and other contemporary witnesses were in agreement
that speed was more than just the mark of modern times. Speed was the
distinctive drug of modernity, a stimulant and intensifier akin to those
analyzed by Balzac in his <I>Trait&eacute; des Excitants modernes</I>
: tea, sugar, eau de vie, tobacco, and, especially, coffee (with
whose accelerative effect on thought-processes and addictive properties
Balzac was well acquainted).
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
  Unlike the somber diligence and train passengers portrayed by artists
  such as Honor&eacute; Daumier and Adolph Menzel, these voyagers--all
  of whom, whether outside or not, ultimately imagine themselves as
  <I>outside voyagers</I>--report feeling neither cut off from one another
  nor from the landscape. On the contrary, they assert their closeness
  to the engine that drives them, the vehicle in which they travel,
  and the landscape which they traverse: a closeness that they dream
  of literalizing by taking the reins and sitting in the driver's seat
  like the amateur coachmen of the early nineteenth century enamored of
  driving "four in hand" just like the <I>artists</I> whom they venerated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 Precious testimony to this effect comes from Thomas De Quincey's <I>The
 English Mail-Coach</I>; an essay in which the author of <I>Confessions
 of an Opium Eater</I> recounts how "the anarchies of his subsequent
 dreams" were unleashed by his Oxford-London rides atop a mail-coach:

in the class of horses selected for this mail service; 4thly, through

<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 and the subject takes possession of the entire visual field, is triggered
 by an optical effect that recurs in nearly every early description
 of accelerated motion and underlies the design of thrill rides in
 nineteenth-century amusement parks as well as their cinematic shows:
 namely, <I>a reversal of perspective such that it now appears as if it
 is the landscape that is in motion and not the traveler; or, rather,
 that the landscape is in motion for the traveler</I>. The effect is a
 familiar one in reports of mail-coach travel. One author describes the
 astonishment of a time-traveler from the early eighteenth century who
 awakens one hundred years later only to find that there is no longer
 such as thing as a stagecoach stop: "[before he can utter the word
 "breakfast"] the waiter, the inn, and indeed [the town of] Hounslow
 itself (<I>terraeque urbesque recedunt</I>), disappeared in the
 twinkling of an eye. Never did such a succession of doors, windows,

The landscape has come unmoored and wheels about as if driven by an
immobile engine at its center. Its constituent elements remain familiar:
trees that make up

forests, clocktowers that summon peasants to humble abodes, flocks of
sheep, towering mountains, serpentine rivers. But, no longer "fixable"
within the viewing parameters of the picturesque or the sublime, these
elements have come alive. The firm ground upon which they once stood
has been dematerialized, reduced to a veil of dust, so they drift,
intermingle, and merge (as in the sheep=homes=red dawn equation of
the middle stanza) within the fold of a hallucinatory whole. Tightly
sprung around the river's serpentine coil, this spectacle is that of
a new kind of viewer: a seer who has sprouted wheels, <I>a kinematic
subject</I>, a little god for whom the clock ticks out visionary
rhythms, not external time. And what he awakens to is a vision of
empire-in-the-round. Armies retreat before his movements, treated here
as akin to conquests; the roadway rolls out an infinite red carpet; his
half-sleep and half-wakefulness intoxicates the mountains; only his eye
can seize the coil that seizes the landscape. The poem bears witness to
Nerval on drugs. His drug of choice is speed. From Nerval's dawn coach

him for "even greater ecstasies, triumphs, and freedoms" linking his
life-rhythms to the four-cycle rhythms of the machine, to Jo&atilde;o do
Rio, for whom "the auto paces [<I>rithmiza</I>] our vertiginous life,
the lust for speed, the frenzy to attain goals, our sense of morality,
esthetics, pleasure, economy, and love," generative powers are ascribed to
this reversal in perspective which makes the landscape into the speeder.

 "Generative" because the loss of a stable perceptual framework, enforced
 by the perception of danger, immediately gives rise to a subjectivity
 that, because imperiled, now claims to "live bigger" and to experience
 an expanded sensorium thanks to an intensified inter-agency with its

The vital experience of the glad animal sensibilities made doubts
impossible on the question of our speed; we heard our speed, we saw it,
we felt it as a thrilling; and this speed was not the product of blind
insensate agencies, that had no sympathy to give, but was incarnated
in the fiery eyeballs of the noblest amongst brutes, in his dilated
nostril, spasmodic muscles, and thunder-beating hoofs. The sensibility
of the horse, uttering itself in the maniac light of his eye, might be
the last vibration of such a movement; the glory of Salamanca might be
the first. But the intervening links that connected them, that spread
the earthquake of battle into the eyeballs of the horse, were the heart
of man and its electrical thrillings--kindling in the rapture of the
fiery strife, and then propagating its own tumults by contagious shouts
and gestures to the heart of his servant the horse.

the inter-agencies are gone in the mode of communication between the
horse and his master out of which grew so many aspects of sublimity under
accidents of mists that hid, or sudden blazes that revealed, of mobs that
agitated, or midnight solitudes that awed. Tidings fitted to convulse all
nations must henceforwards travel by culinary process; and the trumpets
that once announced from afar the laurelled mail, heart-shaking when

From Longinus through Kant, the sublime was the aesthetic category of
movement: "The sublime moves, the beautiful charms," reads the opening

Sublime</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></SUP>
 Later, in the <I>Critique of Aesthetic Judgment</I> he added that
 its representation in nature sets the mind in motion and that "this
 movement, especially in its inception, may be compared with a vibration,
 i.e. with a rapidly alternating repulsion and attraction produced by
 the same Object. The point of excess for the imagination . . . is like
 an abyss in which it fears to lose itself . . . "
<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
 Whether in Burke or in Kant, the abyss is laid open by rapid trigger
 mechanisms: convulsive motions, perceptions of danger or pain, violent
 shocks. But the stimulus must remain at a safe remove: "when danger
 or pain press too nearly" writes Burke, "they are incapable of giving
 any delight, and are simply terrible; but at certain distances, and
 with certain modifications, they may be, and they are delightful, as
 we every day experience."

 Already in the eighteenth century, there was uncertainty about where
 to draw the line between safety and peril, aesthetic play and physical
 terror, distance and proximity, planning and surprise. The line begins
 to vanish altogether once the viewer's platform is placed in rapid
 motion, as on De Quincey's mail-coach. The result is a sublimity that
 no longer leads beyond the passions to an awareness of human superiority
 over nature, as the later Kant would require. Rather, the new sublime of
 speed finds its fulfillment in spectacular accidents--fires, revolutions,
 hallucinatory landscapes, crashes, news events, panics--unruly events
 that, no matter how remote, remain so menacingly close that they can
 be measured on a scale of intensity but not delight. Aesthetic play has
 been recast as dangerous play and the prevalence of adjective over noun
 or noun over adjective declared unresolvable in the course of charting
 modernity's "punitive expedition into [humankind's] own nervous system."

 foster a feeling of safety and its subjective correlative: a sensation
 of tedium that can be alleviated only by means of the reading, sleep or
 awkward conversation documented in period cartoons. All are devices that,
 in the eyes of the railway's harshest critics, contribute to reducing

Reified or not, the human masses conveyed by the locomotive are encouraged
to doubt their speed. Rather than hearing, seeing, and feeling electrical
thrillings, they are invited to relax to the soothing syncopation
of muffled clickety-clacks. In the words of a contemporary railway
engineer: "There's nothing frightening about speed when the traveler
who benefits from it remains unaware of his velocity. With well-built
machines, well-tested materials, and a good rail bed, the speed of 120
kilometers per hour ought to cause no alarm."

The promise/threat of accident, of course, does not vanish as a
result. But whereas its overt presence structures the entire logic of a
thrill-based culture of transportation, here it is repressed. Reliability
and regularity become the norms of accelerated motion and any interruption
of them assumes the form of a cataclysmic return. "Cataclysmic" on the
psychic front, because of the overwhelming and unexpected nature of the
stimulus; "cataclysmic" on the social front, because of the event's scale
and spectacle value. The technical literature that developed around these
catastrophes mixes paeans to safety with a sensationalist rhetoric of
accident. It marks its distance from the culture of thrill by engineering
systems of crash avoidance, charting traffic flows, and trumpeting an
end to all accidents. It marks its proximity by trafficking in the most
lurid details of "the dark martyrology . . . of famous catastrophes that
bloody the map of today's railways."

vibratory one: "Perhaps the one circumstance which more than any other
gives a peculiar character to a railway accident is the thrill or jar,
the <I>ebranlement</I> that is transmitted through everything subjected
to it. It is this vibratory shock (which by some is compared to an

train crashes and boiler explosions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF90" HREF="#FOOT90">90</a></SUP>
 Yet a less intentionality-driven reading attends far better to the
 specificity of the caricaturist's art: a rapid mass medium conjoining
 the real and the fantastic, trafficking in laughs, surprises, and
 up-to-the-minute commentary, framed by the latest news--a medium always
 already implicated, like its cinematic successor, in a rhetoric of
 collision. It is hardly gore or horror, for instance, that prevail in
 Hugh Hughes's <I>The Pleasures of the Rail-Road</I>  (<A HREF="6.1schnapp_0.html"> 10</A>),
 Robert Seymour's <I>Going it by Steam </I> (<A HREF="6.1schnapp_1.html"> 11</A>), or in any
 number of anonymous cartoons published in <I>Punch</I> (<A HREF="6.1schnapp_2.html"> 12</A>), but
 rather an outburst of technical flourish, glee, and inventiveness. All
 are works--and many more by the likes of Daumier, Cham, and Cruikshank
 could be cited--in which crash victims seem to have become every bit
 as much circus acrobats or vaudeville entertainers as sufferers from
 physical or psychic injuries. Leaving behind the confines of their
 conveyance, their bodies fracture and multiply, sail through the
 air, merge into fields of wood, copper, iron, smoke, and steam as if,
 having entered a new realm of bliss, they find themselves free from the
 constraints of biology, space or time; unperturbed by history, memory,
 and class identity; released from the iron-clad laws of industrial
 development. The explosion itself res as the uncorking of a bottle
 of champagne, an aerial choreography, or the sudden transformation of
 a once-static boiler into a sprinting and unhinged metallic man. All
 of which hints that beneath the thin veil of tragedy and trauma, there
 lurks a vision of the crash as a distinctively modern form of spectacle
 and subject formation. A form of spectacle and subject formation of the
 sort more fully codified in early trick films such as Cecil Hepworth's
 <I>How it Feels to be Run Over</I> , whose illusory collision
 between auto and audience links seeing cars to seeing stars; and
 <I>Explosion of a Motorcar</I>  which culminates in a shower of
 arms, legs, heads, and auto parts. In these instances, as throughout the
 early cinema, fleshly and metallic bodies are subject to dismemberments,
 shocks, and explosions whose effects are gleefully displayed and quickly
 overcome. They crash on screen and crash the screen as if to impress
 the viability of a volatile new mode of being upon the audience.

Pleasure trains found a non-utilitarian counterpart in the switchback
railways that hurtled human cargoes down mountainsides like those
of Pennsylvania's Mount Pisgah starting in 1872, which is to say in
the first experiments with what soon thereafter came to be known as
"roller coasters."
<SUP><a NAME="REF91" HREF="#FOOT91">91</a></SUP>
 Initially referred to as "scenic railways," the latter's history
 can be traced back to seventeenth-century Russian ice-slides and
 eighteenth-century <I>Folies du Jour</I> found in places like
 Paris's Parc Monceau. It enters its mature phase in the last third
 of the nineteenth century, when designers like Thompson transformed
 the rides into high-speed kinematic machines combining tunnels and
 curves with rapid shifts between outside environments (usually sublime
 mountainscapes) and inside environments in the form of scrolling panels,
 panoramas, and tableaux depicting grottoes, ancient Egyptian landscapes,
 Biblical episodes, and disaster scenes with moving parts
<SUP><a NAME="REF92" HREF="#FOOT92">92</a></SUP>
 (<A HREF="6.1schnapp_3.html"> 13</A>). These sorts of radically disjunctive temporal and spatial
 effects had already been anticipated

<B></B>

by the design of steam-powered carousels.
<SUP><a NAME="REF93" HREF="#FOOT93">93</a></SUP>
 A steam tractor/ organ complex, first at the carousel's periphery, then
 at its center, had been pumping out power, music, and motion for nearly
 a half century (<A HREF="6.1schnapp_4.html"> 14</A>). It stood still while driving the rotation of a
 platform alternately supporting horses, trains, cars or bicycles whose
 smooth or undulatory motion was exaggerated by a counter-rotating hub
 bearing representations of landscapes and beveled mirrors. Sometimes
 encased within buildings studded with gas or electric lights, these
 life-sized kaleidoscopes left their traces in the design of a wide
 array of later vertigo rides going by names like "The Mystic Screw,"
 "The Scenic Spiral Wheel," and "The Cyclone Bowl." Stripping away all
 the optical and theatrical trickery, these limited their workings to
 what may be viewed as the core operation of all amusement park rides,
 however different they may appear: the transformation of passengers into
 modern whirling dervishes who, once passed through a sort of spatialized
 centrifuge, could be expected to wander about as if drugged, trembling
 with fear and giddy with excitement.

Not surprisingly, the threat/promise of accident plays a determining role
within the fold of turn-of-the-century magic kingdoms. Its presence was
highlighted at the boundary line between the world of play and the world
of work: on the painted flats, for instance, employed by Luna Parks to
draw in audiences with promises of "An Automobile Dash for Death Down
a Mountain at One Thousand Miles an Hour" or "A Journey from This World
to the Next" in the form of "The Great Train

<B></B>

Wreck" (<A HREF="6.1schnapp_5.html"> 15</A>). Within the park walls, it was regularly evoked on the
outer panels that crowned the first carousels, as well as on the facades
of Bioscopes and Electric Theaters inviting spectators to experience
illusory collisions between representation and reality such as those
staged in Hepworth's and Edison's films.
<SUP><a NAME="REF94" HREF="#FOOT94">94</a></SUP>
 The attractions themselves were, in turn, both designed and designated
 so as to place peril in the foreground as, for instance, the Covent
 Garden circus's 1904 <I>Circle of Death</I>, mimed by the various mystic
 cyclones, spirals, and screws (<A HREF="6.1schnapp_6.html"> 16</A>). And every crossing of the
 line from play to terror, every thrill ride accident and calamity--not
 infrequent in the early years--was seized upon and sensationalized by
 newspapers in order to relay the electrical thrillings to the outside
 world.

Contemporary accounts suggest that, like the driver of Marinetti's Fiat,
the thrill rider approached his experience of speed and fright as an
emancipatory <I>ebranlement</I> to be repeated time and time again. He

turned upside-down, much like the flying passengers of Cham's scenic
railway or, eighty years later, Rube Goldberg's coaster riders released
from ordinary temporal, spatial, and psychosocial constraints. But what
is the nature of the stimulus being sought? (See . <A HREF="6.1schnapp_7.html">17</A>, <A HREF="6.1schnapp_8.html">18</A>). Does it
simply provide an opiate-like escape from workaday tedium? Is it simply
a training exercise, a dress rehearsal for the nerve-wracking routines
of modern everyday life? Or are its thrillings the revolutionary ones
envisaged in Vladimir Tatlin's political <I>montagne Russe</I>, the
proposed <I>Monument to the Third International</I> ?
<SUP><a NAME="REF95" HREF="#FOOT95">95</a></SUP>
 ( See <A HREF="6.1schnapp_9.html"> 19</A>). Has the thrill-seeking passenger, in other words, merged
 into the revolutionary mob, the human double of Burke and Kant's infinite
 and, therefore, sublime ocean, the oceanic mass dipped in and out by
 modern heroic individuals, be they dandies and/or dictators?
<SUP><a NAME="REF96" HREF="#FOOT96">96</a></SUP>
 Or has he become the sovereign dandy/dictator himself, animated by
 the illusion that the world is rushing by <I>just for him</I>: that
 it is <I>his</I> world, <I>his</I> spectacle, <I>his</I> hallucination
 to shape and/or to wreck? Whatever the answer, one thing is certain: a
 single dose of speed is never enough. Whether in the logic of amusement
 parks, modern transportation cultures, revolutionary movements, news
 media, or the cultural-political avant-gardes, thrill must follow
 thrill. Which means that accident must follow accident. De Quincey moves
 from mail-coaches to opiates; Marinetti from cars to airplanes to war;
 the thrill rider from attraction to attraction; the revolutionary dreams
 of permanent revolution.

The return of the specter of repetition brings my argument full circle,
for you will recall that it was the locomotive's dulling regularity
that accounted for De Quincey's dismissal of steam power as a "culinary
process," rejected in favor of the mail-coach's electrical/animal
surge. By the end of the century, the terms have altered but the

<B></B>

stakes remain the same. The contrast is no longer between the circuits
formed by insensate machines and sensate beings, but instead between
two distinct but interlocking regimes of repetition, both of which
couple bodies with machines and both of which presuppose accelerated
motion as their norm. One, grounded in Enlightenment ideals, thinks of
men and machines as <I>machines &agrave; reprise</I> [as duplication
machines] and, like Goldberg's mild-mannered passengers decrying roadway
irregularities on their way to an amusement park, it identifies modernity
with the return of sameness: standardization, reliability, predictability,
the leveling of differences. The other, anti-Enlightenment in spirit,
thinks of men and machines as <I>machines &agrave; surpris</I>e [as
surprise machines] and, like Goldberg's thrill riders always eager for
another "go around," identifies modernity instead with non-recursive modes
of repetition: with novelty, danger, unpredictability, the multiplication
of differences. A number of key features from the opening scene of the
founding manifesto of Futurism fall more clearly into place within this
setting. Its talk of death "pulling up alongside me at every curve"; its
insistence that the motorcar is an individualized "panting beast with a
torrid heart" whose steering wheel hangs over the driver "like the blade
of a guillotine"; its hallucinogenic characterization of speed; and,
most of all, its portrayal of the crash as the moment of the movement's
birth: all of these features, like the accident in which they culminate,
cannot be dismissed as atavistic carryovers from the pre-industrial
era (. <A HREF="6.1schnapp_0.html">20</A>, <A HREF="6.1schnapp_1.html">21</A>). Rather, they aim to exorcise a specific threat:
namely, that the triumph of modern technics will extend the rule of
Enlightenment reason over all aspects of everyday life at the expense of
the individual--<I>both the human and the mechanical individual</I>. This
is why Futurism's counter-proposal, its "religion-morality of speed," is
built around unstable techno-primitive hybrids like the modern Centaur:
a detachable creature, neither railbound nor lawbound, composed of enemy
twins--a human subject, called upon to metallize himself and to impose
his distinctive vital impulses or <I>scatti</I> upon the always menacing
machine, and an automotive/equine double, endowed with powers of agency
and moral autonomy, within whose metallic chest thunders a <I>motore a
scatto</I> no less explosive and unpredictable than the driver's racing
heart. A direct heir to the cabriolets of the eighteenth century and
real-world counterpart to amusement park thrill rides, the automobile
is thus invoked as Futurism's birth vehicle not on the basis of its
functionality, but because its design was unstandardized, its performance
unreliable, and its movements governed by whim alone. Much faster than
the earliest generation of airplanes, the equal of all but the fastest
trains, it was a literal horseless carriage: a custom-built frame yoked
to a motor whose rattling valve trains, combustion cycles, and electric
thrillings were every bit as palpable and unruly as the animal engine
driving De Quincey's mail coach.

Speed is the medium that ensures that the conjunction between human
and mechanical individuals will engender not relaxation and tedium,
but bigger living: quickened senses, aroused faculties, expanded powers
of vision; acts of heroism, improvisation, and innovation; spectacular
crashes and catastrophes; eruptions of

<B></B>

laughter and glee. For this effect to be achieved, however, velocity must
avoid becoming routinized. Only a constant increase in the stimulus it
provides can avert the danger that danger itself will be driven out of
the perceptual field. There is no escaping the resulting addiction loop
or its aporias. Constant stimulus increases end up engendering resistance
and/or the very tedium they were meant to ward off. This leaves the crash
alone as a way out of the loop. But just as speed can become routine, so
too the crash can become normalized. Even Vaughn, Ballard's prophet of
a coming Autogeddon, is forced to admit that "one car crash looks just
like another."
<SUP><a NAME="REF97" HREF="#FOOT97">97</a></SUP>
 The threat can held at bay by varying every crash's details, like Mack
 Sennett's <I>Lizzies </I>

<B></B>

<I>of the Field</I>  with its protean pile ups or Meli&egrave;s's
<I>The Impossible Voyage</I>  whose seriatim accidents couple cars
to pedestrians to trains to zeppelins to spaceships to buildings within
the framework of a joyous rampage wherein everything is destroyed yet
no one is hurt. But fated eventually to become just another "normal
accident," the crash's stimulatory effect must necessarily attenuate
unless it leads, in turn, to a "true" and definitive accident: one that
brings the cycle to a close through the driver's death. The only way
to save the normal accident, that is, is to transform every accident
into a dress rehearsal for a death collision, a premiere that is also
a final performance.

 is Warhol alone who brings the story of <I>Crash</I> to a provisional
 close. For his serial patterns of stars and cars replay my inquiry's
 central problematic of thrill and repetition in a more comprehensive and
 original manner. In the "Death in America" series, the ideal of doing
 <I>like a machine</I> translates into a non-recursive but repetitive
 system that sets off lurid images of intertwined cars and drivers
 against flat fields of orange, yellow, green, red, and white in such
 a way that they echo one another both internally and externally, but
 never without visual irregularities or accidents. The individual frames,
 exploring as they do a kind of no-man's land between photojournalistic
 sensationalism and the icy look of police crash-site photos, traffic
 freely in voyeuristic thrills. But the latter reach the viewer by
 means of a detour. The appeal of the subject matter is distanced
 by enhancing the silk-screened photo's black and white graininess,
 only to be reintroduced in the form of colored planes whose jarring
 ornamentalism creates a sense that the thrills have been flattened out
 and rendered cool.

Pop art's romance with the car crash came about within a postwar context
in which the speeding motorcar had been naturalized much like the speeding
train at the time of Futurism's birth. This naturalization was effected
by similar means: through an array of technologies designed to isolate
driver and passenger from the roadway, and the roadway, in turn, from
the world, including softened suspensions; passenger compartments
transformed into sealed cocoons equipped with autonomous sound and
climate systems; rationalized superhighway networks. Cornerstone of
the utopic, peril-free suburban universe regularly evoked in Warhol's
photographs, the automobile retains a sublime and dangerous flip side
that affiliates it with De Quincey's mail coach and Marinetti's killer
shark. Still a prosthetic enhancement for modern "dreamers,

<B></B>

artists, and men belonging to no social class" and an accelerator of
auto-erotic tremors, the car is for Warhol a mechanical individual
akin to the theme park ride. Itself a star, it is also a star-vehicle
and star-maker. But never more so than when it collides with or for an
audience. In each and every accident car and riders are cast, in Ballard's
words, as "the principal actors at the climax of some grim drama in an
unrehearsed theater of technology, involving crushed machines, the dead
men destroyed in their collision, and hundreds of drivers waiting beside
the stage with their headlamps blazing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF101" HREF="#FOOT101">101</a></SUP>
 Is it any surprise, then, that Warhol could also produce celebratory
 icons of everything from carriages to cars?
<SUP><a NAME="REF102" HREF="#FOOT102">102</a></SUP>
 Hardly (. <A HREF="6.1schnapp_2.html">22</A>, <A HREF="6.1schnapp_3.html">23</A>). But

<B></B>

even when implementing the Futurist slogan that "a racing car . . . is
more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace" one senses that the
unrehearsed theater of technology is now being viewed, as it were,
from the far side of the culture of thrill. The primary location of
the artist's ego and eye has shifted from the fiery thrillings of the
<I>imp&egrave;riale</I> to the icy fire of a more distant site, a site
occupied by an omnipresent mechanical voyeur. The machine in question
and the machine that Warhol most wishes to become is not the car, but
rather the camera. The latter's automatism, its speed of image capture,
the potentially unlimited reproducibility and manipulability of its
output, render the camera the orchestrator of sequences of real and/or
imaginary pile ups so vast and repetitious that they could easily fill
any and every "museum of excitement and possibility." Which is to say
that, for Warhol, the camera as engine of thrill leads inexorably to
the camera as engine of monotony. Machines, he avers, are about "liking
things" and liking things means being machine-like "because you do the
same thing every time. You do it over and over again."
<SUP><a NAME="REF103" HREF="#FOOT103">103</a></SUP>
 So the story of <I>Crash</I> ends neither with a bang nor with a whimper,
 but with an outcome that the founding manifesto of futurism could never
 have envisaged, not to mention embraced: the emergence of tedium itself
 as the greatest thrill of all.

Thanks to a nearly acritical embrace of Benjamin's writings, American
cultural studies have all too readily conferred upon Baudelaire's
epoch an inaugural role vis &agrave; vis modernity that could just as
easily be extended back to the prior century. For all his greatness,
Baudelaire was, after all, often little more than a recycler of
commonplaces, and his hallucinatory Paris is none other than that of
Louis S&eacute;bastian Mercier's <I>Tableau de Paris</I>  made up
of "tableaux &eacute;loquents qui <I>frappent</I> l'oeil dans tous les
coins des carrefours, et quelle galerie d'images, pleine de contrastes
<I>frappants</I> pour qui sait voir et entendre!" ("eloquent tableaux
that <I>strike</I> the eye at the corners of every crossroads, and what
a gallery of images, replete with <I>striking</I> contrasts for he who
knows how to look and listen!"). Cited from <I>Tableau de Paris</I>,
ed. Michel Delon, <I>Paris le jour, Paris la nuit</I> (Paris: Robert
Laffont, 1990), 31, italics mine. The catalogue of pre-nineteenth
century representations of shock is a large one, but would include
the violent collision described in Rousseau's second promenade ("Je ne
sentis ni le coup ni la chute, ni rien de ce qui s'ensuivit jusqu'au
moment o&ugrave; je revins &agrave; moi" ["I felt neither blow nor fall
nor anything that occurred after until I came to"]) responsible for
his rebirth ("Je naissais dans cet instant &agrave; la vie . . . " ["I
was born to life in that instant . . . "), on which subject see <I>Les
R&ecirc;veries du promeneur solitaire</I> (Paris: Garnier-Flammarion,

<I>Lettre de Brutus, sur les chars anciens et modernes</I> (London, 1771)
(hereafter abbreviated <I>LBCAM</I>), as, for instance, in his claim
that cabriolets are dangerous to drivers and pedestrians alike because
"at the very same instant a citizen hears the noise and recieves the
blow that mutilates him: a mother loses her child before becoming aware

I take seriously the notion that conversion stories like Saul's
transformation into Paul (recounted in Acts 9, 22, and 26) on the road
to Damascus or Augustine's turn towards the holy book in bk. 8, ch. 12 of
his <I>Confessions</I> may be viewed as "accidents" typologically linked
to modern vehicular-accident myths. In both cases, the irruption of the
divine is a traumatizing/thrilling event that, by definition, effects a
violent and unexpected rending of ordinary human consciousness. Paul is
blinded and falls to the ground; Augustine's countenance is immediately
altered as he hears the supernatural summons to "take up and read,"
which, once obeyed by means of the random opening of the Bible, yields
a sudden and instantaneous feeling of inner luminescence. What from the
human perspective appears an aleatory event, is revealed in retrospect
as the realization of a divine plan or "turning point" which, from
the moment of the "accident" onward promises regular doses of the
supernatural (i.e. rapturous thrills). The typological link between
these two categories of "accidents" seems to me confirmed by the constant
recurrence of martyrdom themes in the modern literature of accident from
the coaching era to the present, particularly with reference to celebrity
"martyrs of speed" like James Dean and Ayrton Senna.

Wolfgang Schivelbusch, <I>The Railway Journey: The Industrialization
of Time and Space in the Nineteenth Century</I> (Berg: Leamington Spa,
1986). The book first appeared as <I>Geschichte der Eisenbahnreise</I>,
(Munich: Carl Hanser Verlag, 1977). While I am much endebted to
Schivelbusch's study, mine departs from his in two key respects: a)
I argue that most of the effects that Schivelbusch ascribes to the
development of railway systems were already fully manifest under the
regime of carriage transportation: the rationalization of roadways, the
standardization and quantification of time and space, the acceleration
of life, etc. In my view, trains mostly democratized and intensified the
impact of these already codified developments. b) Schivelbusch's principal
concern is with what I have referred to as the "commodification" side
of the divide, while I am concerned instead with the formation of new
models of individuality in relation to transportation technologies. He
therefore emphasizes a mass conveyance, the train; while I emphasize
smaller-scale conveyances such as coaches, cabriolets, and automobiles. It
goes without saying, however, that trains could (and often did) serve
as engines of thrill, just as carriages or automobiles could (and often
did) provide experiences of trauma and alienation akin to those endured
by many train travelers.

The link between coaches and libertinism goes back at least as far as
Taylor the Water Poet, who argued that "the <I>Cart</I> is an open and
transparant Engine, that any man may perceive the plaine honesty of it;
there is no part of it within or without, but it is in the continuall
view of all men: On the contrary, the Coach is a close hypocrite, for
it hath a cover for any knavery, and curtaines to vaile or shadow any
wickednes . . . " (<I>The World Runnes on Wheeles</I>, 240). To the
coach's immorality on the "inside" correspond later concerns about its
external immorality, like those expressed by Rousseau's Saint Preux:
"Elle [Julie] ne doute pas que je n'exag&egrave;re beaucoup sur les
peintures scandaleuses dont on orne &agrave; grands frais ces voitures
. . . comme s'il &eacute;tait plus beau de s'annoncer aux passants pour
un homme de mauvaises moeurs que pour un homme de qualit&eacute;! Ce qui
l'a surtout r&eacute;volt&eacute;e a &eacute;t&eacute; d'apprendre que
les femmes avaient introduit ou soutenu cet usage, et que leurs carrosses
ne se distinguaient de ceux des hommes que par des tableaux un per plus
lascifs." ("She doubts not that I exagerate a great deal with regard to
the scandalous and costly paintings with which vehicles are decorated
. . . as if it were preferable to proclaim to passerbys that one was
a man of bad habits rather than a gentleman! What especially appalled
her was to learn that women had initiated or embraced this practice and
that their coaches were distinguishable from those of men thanks only
to their even more lascivious decoration.") <I>Julie ou la Nouvelle
H&eacute;lo&iuml;se</I> (Paris: Garnier-Flammarion, 1967), 401. Driving
oneself, a practice increasingly enjoyed by affluent women as well as men
during the second half of the eighteenth century, compounded the scandal,
for it blurred the boundary between the sexes as well as that between the
leisure and the working classes. Female drivers were frequently accused
of having transformed themselves into "public women" (i.e. whores).

Driving "four in hand" involved holding the reins to all four horses
directly from the driver's box (without recourse to a postilion riding
one of the lead horses), a dangerous and exacting task that made coachmen
the envy of many aristocrats: "The men who drove the crack mails were
famous, and revered as a pop singer is today. The young bloods copied
their favorites as much as they could by learning the jargon of the
road and wearing appropriate clothes, the many-caped greatcoat and the
low-crowned hat. One young gentleman had his teeth filed so that he
could whistle through them in the approved fashion; many braved the
worst weather conditions in order to be in the honored place by the
driver." Jean Holdsworth, <I>Mango. The Life and Times of Squire John

The full passage compares coaching to railway travel: "The modern modes of
travelling cannot compare with the old mail-coach system in grandeur and
power. They boast of more velocity,--not, however, as a consciousness, but
as fact of our lifeless knowledge, resting upon <I>alien</I> evidence: as,
for instance, because somebody <I>says</I> that we have gone fifty miles
in the hour, though we are far from feeling it as a personal experience
. . . But, seated on the old mail-coach, we needed no evidence out of
ourselves to indicate the velocity. On this system the word was not magna
loquimur, as upon railways, but vivimus. Yes, 'magna vivimus'; we do not
make verbal ostentation of our grandeurs, we realise our grandeurs in act,
and the very experience of life." "The English Mail Coach," 283-84.

system tyrannises over my dreams by terror and terrific beauty, lay in the
awful political mission which at that time it fulfilled. The mail-coach
it was that distributed over the face of the land, like the opening of

from pp. 71-88 and shows the old man desperately seeking a vehicle
that will carry him at a tolerably slow speed, but to no avail. He begins
riding inside a stagecoach, the Comet, which he finds blindingly fast. He
then switches over to riding on the gammon board [the rear outdoor seat]
of The Regulator, a slower coach, but one he finds no less terrifying
now that he is fully exposed to the elements. Finally, he ends up on
the Quicksilver mail coach which a waiter had promised him was not "very
fast," but rather "it just keeps time, and that's all" . Under the
new regime of accelerated motion, however, "just keeping time" requires
the most harrowing speeds of all.
