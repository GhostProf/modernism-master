The publication of Otto Weininger's <I>Sex and Character (Geschlecht
und Charakter) </I>in May 1903 evolved within a few months into one of
those literary events that bring apparently disparate cultural trends
into striking focus, that gather the inchoate anxieties and obsessions
of an age (or its literate, self-styled spokespersons) into provocative,
synthesizing outline. The book quickly became an international bestseller
and a reference point for countless diary entries, journal articles,
and coffeehouse discussions, going through twenty-five editions in
twenty years.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 The short and unhappy life of its twenty-three year old author, who
 shot himself in melodramatic fashion in October, 1903, in the house in
 which Beethoven had died, added the celebrity of scandal as well as the
 seductions of a personal tragedy lived out in radical authenticity to the
 exemplary qualities of this mirror of the age. Reading Weininger's work
 in the 1990s, however, it is difficult to imagine how such a cartoonishly
 hyperbolic, pretentiously philosophical, maniacally simplifying book,
 throbbing with uncontrolled misogynist and anti-Semitic feelings, could
 become the focus of intense concern for a broad and sophisticated
 audience of artists, writers, and scholars. This audience included
 the Austrian modernists Arnold Schoenberg, Adolf Loos, Karl Kraus,
 Ludwig Wittgenstein, Oskar Kokoschka, Sigmund Freud, Georg Trakl, Franz
 Kafka, Heimito Von Doderer, Hermann Broch, and Robert Musil, as well
 as modernists outside of Austria and Germany,



<B></B>



like August Strindberg, D. H. Lawrence, and the Italian Futurists.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Wonder at the Weininger phenomenon spurs historical questions and
 invites us to reexamine the connections between the three issues that
 were welded together in his work's distorting and simplifying mirror:
 the production of masculine identity out of universal bisexuality;
 the definition of the boundaries of community or "home" through the
 projection of psychic division on to the relations between social and
 cultural groups, and the problematic resolution of the intractable
 polarities of historical existence in aesthetic or philosophical
 transcendence, in the translation of life into art, of impure material
 and historical existence into abstract, spiritual form.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P>
The most obvious and dominating of these three dimensions in Weininger's
text was his conceptualization of sexual/gender polarization. <I>Sex
and Character </I>was organized around the principled assertion
that the difference between masculine and feminine natures did not
arise as a generalization from observed attributes of male and female
individuals but constituted a polarity of ideal-typical modes of being (or
"characters") emerging from a duality of biological, "vital" substances
unevenly distributed across the whole spectrum of plant, animal, and
human life. "Living beings cannot be described bluntly as one sex or the
other," Weininger wrote. "The real world from the point of view of sex
may be regarded as wavering or oscillating <I>(schwanken) </I>between
two points. No empirical individual being actually exists at either
point, but somewhere between the two."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 What began in the first part of the book as a scientific theory
 of biological bisexuality in which the relative ratios of "M"
 (masculinity) and "W" (femininity) in any individual could be quantified
 in mathematical terms, was transformed in the second and major part
 of Weininger's study into a speculative, theoretical (philosophical)
 construction of a dynamic dualism of essences. "Masculinity" designated
 the pole of conscious subjective agency, rational control, ethical
 individuality, freedom and spiritual transcendence (all epitomized as
 "being") and "femininity" designated the pole of unconscious objective
 passivity, sexual determinism, amorality, and material de-individualized
 immanence (summarized as nonbeing or "nothing").

<P>
The logical rigor of this polarization (essentially a pseudo-scientific
stylization of conventional sexual stereotypes) was combined with an
ethical puritanism in which the feminine operated as that which needed
to be expunged in order for the self to attain the essential, human ideal
of pure masculinity. Conceptual femininity did not refer to actual women,
Weininger insisted, but was a projection of the negative other constructed
by the masculine within men as they struggled to overcome the effeminacy
of sexuality within themselves. "Woman" existed only as long as "man's"
guilt remained unexpiated, his sexuality unconquered (<I>GC,</I> 456;
<I>SC,</I> 344). Weininger denied that his theory was directed against
actual existing women; the average bisexual woman was also presented with
the existential possibility and moral task of vanquishing her femininity
and attaining the ideal of pure masculinity. But his allegedly scientific
theory of the relative bisexual ratios in men and women made his text
appear like an attack on women in the contemporary battle of the sexes
rather than a universalizable theory of ethical transcendence. The text
moves with breathtaking



<B></B>



 ease from the analysis of abstract types to the critique of existing
 individuals and groups.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Masculine identity within any particular individual, though supported
 by quantitative ratios of biological substance, emerged as primarily
 a human construct, an ethical and cultural achievement. Femininity was
 also a construct, but always and only in a negative sense; it was not a
 true identity, not a goal of human achievement or a potential product of
 a process of self-determination, but "something which can be transcended,
 which ought to be transcended" <I>(etwas, das aufgehoben werden kann, und
 aufgehoben werden soll </I>[<I>GC,</I> 456; <I>SC,</I> 344]). Masculinity
 was also contingent, but only in the sense that it's fulfillment was
 marked by its disappearance into the universal essence of humanity.

<P>
<I>Sex and Character </I>combined this radical polarization of
masculine and feminine with a racial/cultural theory built on a parallel
polarization of Aryan and Jewish types. Jewishness in Weininger's theory
was the collective form of femininity as it operated in the history
of Western culture. The historical goal of constructing a community of
autonomous, rational, self-legislating subjects (the Kantian Kingdom of
Ends) was tied to the attainment of Aryan masculinity and the repudiation
of Jewishness. Jewishness, as femininity's historical/cultural form, was
also not identical with a particular biological population or nation, but
presented as the ideal-type of a "psychological constitution, which is
a possibility for all humankind but which has found its most grandiose
actualization in historical Judaism" (<I>GC,</I> 406; <I>SC,</I> 303).
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
Anti-Semitism as a cultural and political movement was thus grounded
on a psychological displacement of the struggle against the Jewishness
in everyone on to a struggle against a specific group of individuals
whose relative quantity of Jewishness was particularly high; it emerged
as an expression of the general human struggle to attain the goal of
autonomous moral selfhood. To achieve the emancipated human identity
of autonomous individuality was to repudiate the woman and the Jew in
oneself. The true home for "Man" was, by definition, an Aryan fraternity
in which femininity and Jewishness had been repudiated and expunged. The
sexual, moral and political dimensions of this quest for autonomy were
difficult to disentangle: Jewishness "was saturated with femininity"
<I>(das Judentum durchtr&auml;nkt scheint von . . . Weiblichkeit
</I>[<I>GS,</I> 409; <I>SC,</I> 306]).

<P>
To achieve pure masculinity, to progress in the task of overcoming
mere existence and attaining a genuinely human essence, to be a
self-sufficient, autonomous human being--these goals were approached in
the historical, human activities of art and philosophy. In both art and
philosophy, at least as produced by the genius--the human exemplar who
approached most closely the translucent autonomous self-consciousness of
the purely masculine--attention was focused on the transcendent, on the
timeless forms from which all existence in time derived its meaning. In
Weininger's universe, the realm of high culture was a product of higher
beings who incarnated the highest in everyone, who educated their fellows
in the moral task of repudiating their sensual being (femininity and
Jewishness), and who interrupted the causal and functional networks
of material/historical existence with epiphanies of timeless spiritual
form. Such activities had been corrupted, become decadent, in



<B></B>



those fin-de-si&egrave;cle artistic and philosophical movements that
surrendered to the seductive pull of the sensually contingent. Drawing
heavily on artistic heroes such as Wagner and Ibsen, Weininger called for
a more purified and autonomous art, an art that mirrored, articulated,
and thus helped to achieve the redemptive goal of spiritual transcendence,
of purified masculinity.

<P>
For Weininger the achievement of identity was not tied to the incarnation
of meaning in time through narrative coherence, but through the
repudiation of time in the achievement of timeless truths. Yet inevitably
some of his contemporaries tended to see meaningful connections between
Weininger's theories and his suicide. They thus turned his repudiation
of existence in time into a story about a failed struggle for meaning in
time. It became either a pathological case of identity shipwreck, or an
exemplary story of a heroic and tragic struggle for masculine and national
identity within the apparently intractable contradictions of a fallen
world. In this paper I will analyze the texts of a number of Weininger's
Austrian contemporaries who were able to transform the polarities involved
in this modernist crisis of identity into stories of the refashioning
of masculine identity that were both diagnostic and exemplary, that
found a problematic meaning in processes of constructing personal
and cultural identity within the contingencies of embodied temporal
existence. Weininger was not viewed as a solution in these writings (as
he was at times in the works of August Strindberg or Karl Kraus), but
transformed into a case whose conditions of possibility required critical
analysis before its materials could be shaped into meaningful narrative
form. In texts published by Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), Arthur Schnitzler
(1862-1931), and Robert Musil (1880-1942) in the decade before World
War I, Weininger's drive to achieve masculine identity and his search
for a communal home were not in any way resolved through the discovery
of true masculinity or of a satisfactory homeland. Literary art and
systematic reflection on the conditions of experience were mobilized not
as instruments for resolution or transcendence but as a means to portray,
as the distinguishing core of the modernist identity itself, a conception
of the interminable, experimental, contingent, conflicted processes of
constructing gendered and communal identities. These exemplars of early
Austrian modernism were thus not marked so much by a consciousness of the
end of the story or the collapse of the narrative, the absence of meaning
in time, as by the reconstruction of narrative coherence and meaning in
time in a new, open, and self-reflexive form. Moreover, the construction
of narrative meaning was not perceived as an act of transcendence, but
placed in the service of a this-worldly ethical task, the practical yet
interminable work of constructing autonomy.

I. The Freudian Case History as a Story of Masculine Identity Formation
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
The emergence and development of psychoanalysis as a distinctive
theoretical perspective, therapeutic method, and scientific movement in
the first decade of the twentieth century was inextricably entangled
in the complex crisis of masculine identity so starkly portrayed in
Weininger's book and played out in his life. Such entanglements



<B></B>



 involved both the psychopathological material which was the
 object of psychoanalytic diagnosis and therapy and the motivating
 intentions and organizing categories of this theory and practice. The
 problematic construction of human subjectivity as a construction of
 either masculine or feminine subjectivity was at the very center of
 the unconscious psychosexual structures, mechanisms, and conflicts
 which Freud presented as the discovery of a new continent mapped by
 psychoanalytic knowledge. The five classic Freudian case studies which
 Freud investigated and prepared for publication in the decade before
 World War I were, among all of the founding psychoanalytic texts of
 the early twentieth century, the most revealing of the ways in which
 the Freudian theories of the dynamic structures of unconscious mental
 life and convoluted pathways of sexual desire merged in the subjective
 problematic of constructing masculine and feminine identities. In these
 cases Freud not only worked out the conditions for the constitution of
 a workable or livable gendered identity within the psychopathological
 conflicts of his patients, but wrote out and worked out his own struggle
 to establish a satisfactory masculine identity as well. An investigation
 of three issues within these stories seems particularly relevant for a
 historical reconstruction of the relations between the psychoanalytic
 science of gender construction and modernist fictions of masculinity in
 crisis--the connections between biological bisexuality and the cultural
 construction of individualized gendered identities, the repudiation of
 femininity in the construction of masculine identity, and the repression
 of passive homoeroticism in the production of masculine autonomy.

<P>
Freud's explicit encounter with the author and text of <I>Sex and
Character</I> actually occurred before its publication in 1903 and became
the center of a complicated controversy over scientific priority in the
discovery of bisexuality, a controversy in which differing conceptions
of the meaning of bisexuality played a prominent role.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 In July 1904, Wilhelm Fliess, the Berlin sexual biologist who
 had been Freud's closest friend and confidante in the late 1890s,
 accused Freud of breaking confidence and passing on Fliess's theory
 of organic bisexuality to a friend of Weininger's (Hermann Swoboda),
 an indiscretion which eventually produced its effect in <I>Sex and
 Character</I>, where Fliess's intellectual property was claimed by
 Weininger as his own. Although Freud acknowledged that he might have
 provided Weininger with the key used to rob Fliess's house, his exchange
 with Fliess revealed the extent to which Freud differed from both Fliess
 and Weininger in his understanding of the significance of bisexuality. On
 the one hand, Freud seemed to think that the general biological theory
 of a constitutional, organic bisexuality was both widespread in the
 scientific literature (Fliess's originality was thus reduced to details
 and implications that others might themselves have been able to deduce
 from the principle without stealing his ideas) and not particularly
 relevant for explaining the ways in which the body's energies were
 lived out in the psychosexual conflicts of gendered identity formation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
Already in 1901 Freud had felt insulted by Fliess's insinuation
that Freud's psychological analysis of the neurotic articulations of
psychosexual conflict constituted subjective projections of Freud's own
wishes and thoughts on to evidence that could be



<B></B>



explained quite adequately through knowledge of the bisexual nature of
vital processes, such as periodic biorhythms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Although Freud begun using the concept of bisexuality in his analyses
 as early as 1896, he persistently and increasingly relegated biological
 bisexuality to the category of an organic predisposition, a precondition
 of psychosexual conflict, but not in any way a principle that could
 explain the particularities of that conflict. When Weininger presented
 Freud with an early version of his text in 1901, in the hope of gaining
 his support in finding a publisher, Freud had criticized the work for
 the same kind of speculative and dogmatic reductionism he had discerned
 in Fliess.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 A decade later Freud would discern a similarly reductive tendency
 in Alfred Adler's claim that an inherent "masculine protest" against
 the threat of feminization was the key to understanding psychosexual
 conflict. Any such masculine protest, he insisted, would have to be
 explained as itself a product of the complex conflictual relations of
 psychosexual wishing, contextualized within the history of desire.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 In the claims of Fliess, Weininger, and Adler, Freud detected a
 reductivism which threatened to undermine the legitimacy of his own
 emerging science of unconscious psychic reality. At the core of these
 claims was a view of identity formation, a story of how humans came to
 be encultured men and woman, which submerged the historical contingency
 of the individual life story in the conflictual processes of vital
 substances or cultural essences. In each case, moreover, the theories had
 a tendency to become symptomatic, neurotically self-alienating, rather
 than analytical and reflexive, because they ignored the participation
 of the theorist in his theory.

<P>
Freud's own case histories can be construed as attempts to produce
convincing stories of the struggle to construct gendered individual
identities which would avoid the reductivism of his rivals. At the
same time they were the textual sites on which he established his own
identity as the knower of these psychic processes, an identity which
was itself entangled in his battle to achieve masculine self-control and
autonomy. The first properly psychoanalytic case study, "Fragment of an
Analysis of a Case of Hysteria" (commonly known as "Dora"), was written
during the first weeks of 1901, at the critical moment of Freud's decisive
break with Fliess and his assertion of the autonomy of psychoanalysis,
and it displays some of the distinctive components of the Freudian story
of gendered identity formation in exemplary form.

<P>
In "Dora" the achievement of gendered identity is described not as
an expression of biological nature, the fulfillment of a preordained
metaphysical essence, nor as a socially imposed role, but as an effect
constituted in a network of culturally conditioned relations. Although
Freud assumes an organic bisexuality as a starting point, his analysis
is focused on the ways in which Dora's conflicts are formed by her
unconscious desires for, and identifications with, an overlapping
multiplicity and confusion of relevant others of both genders. Dora's
psychological conflicts relate partly to her difficulty in conforming to
unconsciously assimilated cultural norms of femininity imposed through
these desires and identifications, partly to her hostility to repudiating
the masculine and homoerotic tendencies which prevented her from becoming
a normal woman.



<B></B>

<P>
Freud's account of Dora's struggle to achieve self-consciousness and
control of her unconscious conflicts concerning her gendered identity
is entangled in the often inadvertent telling of his own struggle to
impose his control (as a masculine, paternal, scientifically disciplined
subject) over her. The case history is a story of Freud's (failed) attempt
to assert his masculine identity by convincing Dora to take upon herself
the construction of a normative femininity as a self-conscious ethical
task. "Dora" is not just an account of Dora's illness, but also a story
of the therapeutic encounter, which is as much a story about Freud as
about her.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P>
In writing "Dora," Freud was acutely self-conscious of the problems
involved in constructing a convincing narrative account of the
psychological history of an individual subject. He differentiated the
psychoanalytic story, which reconstructs and examines the conditions
of narrative coherence in its own telling, from those kinds of stories
that simply assume an unproblematic coherence in the representations of
external biological or social realities. Such glib and smooth accounts,
unaware of the problematic nature of their own telling, were in fact
symptomatic. They displayed a disavowal of the unconscious psychic
conflicts which underlay the construction of coherence. Further, Freud
was intent on distinguishing his own construction of coherence from
the fictions of novelists. The imaginative writer's need to create a
coherent story, he insisted, involved censorship, simplification, and
abstraction. The complicated structural layering of psychic life and the
overdetermination of events within the realm of unconscious relations (the
synchronic rather than diachronic relations between pasts and presents)
could be represented only through the analytic hypothetical models of
the scientist. In the same way, the impersonal and dry language of the
scientist assserted its superiority over the concrete language of the
storyteller in the telling of stories that contained within themselves
an analytic perspective on the conditions of their own story-making.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>

<P>
The analytic perspective which Freud saw as providing the necessary
reflexive distance in constructing stories of identity formation,
however, was itself organized as a kind of meta-story of various oedipal
relations. By 1909 Freud had begun to define the aggregate of complexes
which came together at the moment of the infantile enculturation of
desire as the nuclear complex of psychosexual development. It was from
the perspective of the Oedipus complex that Freud, in 1909, was able
to view Weininger's <I>Sex and Character</I> as a symptomatic work of
a "sexually disturbed young philosopher" and "neurotic." Weininger's
uncontrolled hostility toward women and Jews, Freud stated, was a product
of his neurotic regression to the unconscious infantile relations of the
castration complex, in which circumcised Jews and penis-lacking women
both gave imaginary shape to the fear of castration. Weininger's text
made sense within the story of a little Oedipus who felt threatened with
the loss of his very existence if he did not renounce his sexual desires
and submit to the "spiritual" authority of the father's law.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<P>
In the decade after the publication of "Dora" there was one complex
in the constellation of infantile sexual conflicts that seemed to draw
Freud's particular attention



<B></B>



 and to arouse his narrative productivity--the unsuccessful working
 through of ambivalent relations to the father re. This father
 complex produced a tendency toward obsessional neuroses, regression to
 the libidinal stage of anal eroticism, and the assumption of a passive
 feminine or homosexual position toward patriarchal authority. Freud's
 fascination with resolving the puzzle of such cases was a continuation
 of his attempts to work through his relationship to Fliess, as well as
 an expression of his desire to understand the unconscious dimensions in
 his problematic relations to the intellectual sons who gathered around
 him in the psychoanalytic movement after 1905. To attain a satisfactory
 masculine identity as an autonomous, law-abiding son was to work through
 the homosexual libido involved in the son's relation to the father in
 ways that did not encourage regression to the anal-sadistic stage and
 the formation of obsessional neuroses, but mobilized homosexual libido
 through the sublimated form of intellectual creativity and devotion to
 the "general interests of humanity," or at least (within the context of
 the psychoanalytic movement) devotion to the "cause" of psychoanalysis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 As a form of narcissistic love for individuals like oneself, homosexual
 impulses produced within the oedipal constellation formed the basis
 for social bonding, both between generations of fathers and sons and
 between "brothers," that is, they became the starting point for a human
 community or "mankind" defined as a masculine cultural form.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

<P>
In 1910 Freud extended his investigation of the "effeminate," emasculating
seductions of homosexual libido, shifting his attention from the
therapeutic relations inside his consulting room to the construction of
masculine subjectivities outside, broadening his attempts to understand
the various experimental lives which could be constructed from a common
nuclear constellation of psychosexual conflicts structured by the
oedipal complex. In "Leonardo Da Vinci and a Memory of his Childhood,"
Freud produced a speculative reconstruction, a "psychoanalytic novel"
(<I>pyschoanalytischer Roman)</I> of the possible ways in which the
working through of homosexual libidinal impulses, formed in the particular
identifications and repressions that marked the transformation of the
infant "into a civilized human being" (<I>zum Kulturmenschen)</I>, could
lead to the self-consciously critical, investigative activities of the
scientific researcher or to the sublimated eroticism of the creative
artist, or, as in Leonardo's case, to a life-long oscillation between
the two.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Freud's Leonardo story was not simply the account of an obsessional
 neurosis or the transcendent power of genius to rise above the common
 fate, but a reconstructed story of the particular way in which the
 structures of a common fate could be lived. It was not a model to
 be emulated or rejected, but a story that could contribute to a
 self-understanding of the potentialities and limits of living one's
 life as a masculine subject.

<P>
Freud's extended commentary ("Psychoanalytic Notes") on the published
autobiography of a mental patient, the "Memoirs of my Nervous Illness"
written by the German judge Daniel Paul Schreber, would seem to lie
at the opposite end of the spectrum of possible masculine identity
formations from that portrayed in "Leonardo." But in this case as well
Freud thought that his oedipal key had provided a method for unriddling
the mystery of a particular life. And as in the case of



<B></B>



Leonardo, Freud was drawn to Schreber's text at least in part because
it exemplified for him one of the possible ways he might have lived out
his own masculine identity crisis. In letters written on the same day
(3 December 1910) to Carl Gustav Jung and Sandor Ferenczi, Freud noted
that, as he worked on his interpretation of Schreber's case in the late
evening hours, he experienced an almost total identification with his
subject. "I am Schreber, nothing but Schreber," he wrote to Ferenczi.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Earlier in the year he had described Schreber to Jung as "our dear and
 ingenious Friend" who "should have been made a professor of psychiatry
 and director of a mental hospital" (<I>F/J,</I> 368, 311).

<P>
Working through the Schreber case, Freud claimed, revived the
whole complex of issues which had come to a head in his break with
Fliess. Moreover his current difficulties with his ambivalent intellectual
sons, most notably the rebellious Alfred Adler and Wilhelm Stekel,
but also the apparently loyal Ferenczi and Jung, were seen by Freud as
repeating the tensions of the Fliess relationship. In psychopathological
terms Schreber's illness was a paranoia, a form of psychosis in which
normal psychoanalytic interaction between patient and therapist was
impossible, due to the patient's unconquerable resistance to free
association and transference. Paranoiacs, Freud urged, only revealed
what they wanted to reveal, remaining enclosed within their own private
worlds. To reconstruct the story of a paranoiac thus required an empathic
reconstruction of his world. Like a voice from a foreign culture, the
voice of the psychotic could only be construed from an understanding
of his own language. During the period when Freud was unraveling what
he saw as the riddle of Schreber's world he also referred to Fliess and
Adler as paranoiacs, as individuals who had constructed closed systems
of meaning for themselves which were not open to critical analysis or
communicative interaction. His own task was to show that he could grasp
the conditions of this paranoid stance, that he could write the story of
the paranoiac's story in a way that revealed the particular conditions
of its construction.

<P>
The starting point, the originating "core" (<I>Kern)</I> of Schreber's
pathological paranoia, Freud claimed, was a "feminine (passive homosexual)
wish fantasy" that could be traced to the "familiar" or commonly shared
father-complex and castration-complex of the oedipal constellation ("PB,"
180; "PN," 55). Schreber's story renacted the unconscious infantile wish
to be the love object of the revered and feared father, to be the mother
to the father. But the fulfillment of this wish implied an unmanning or
emasculation articulated as the threat and fear of castration. At stake
in the return of the infantile wish and its imagined consequences was the
adult male ego's masculine identity. A resurgence and reexperiencing of
the conflicting emotions of this infantile complex, Freud noted, was not
uncommon among middle-aged men (in their early fifties, like himself) in
whom the decline of heterosexual virility that characterized the male
version of menopause often produced a resurgence of homosexual libido
("PB," 171-2; "PN," 45-6). In severe cases of unmasterable homosexual
impulses, this crisis of sexual identity produced a regression to the
stage of libidinal development in which the process of ego-formation was
in its embryonic stages, the stage of childhood narcissism in which the
scattered libidinal urges of the autoerotic



<B></B>



stage were first integrated into a love of one's own embodied self, before
being directed toward external objects, and thus before a recognition
of the boundaries which defined the ego in relation to the world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 In Freud's story of Schreber's story, therefore, the beginnings of
 paranoia lay in a response to the threat of the collapse of masculine
 identity through a virtual dissolution of the bounded ego and a
 return to the moment prior to the differentiation of ego and external
 world. Schreber's crisis moved from the fantasy of being transformed
 into a woman to the catastrophic collapse of the distinction between
 self and world, and a return to the archaic, primal moment of self and
 world not yet differentiated. The familiar symptomology of paranoid
 delusion could be understood from the inside (from the "native's point
 of view," we might say) as a defensive response to this experience
 of threat and dissolution, whence regression to the self-sufficiency
 and megalomania of the narcissistic stage. The specific originating
 cause of paranoid psychopathology was a traumatizing disavowal of the
 homosexual fantasy-wish of becoming a feminine love-object of masculine
 desire. The defensive measures produced against this unconscious wish,
 however, were shaped by the particular stage of libidinal and ego
 development, infantile narcissism, within which they were originally
 constructed. The delusional world that the paranoid created was an
 alternative to the real world, a self-contained domain of imaginary
 (aesthetic?) objects that could be easily manipulated, a space in which
 the wish for feminization could be artificially or symbolically mastered
 and thus given coherence and meaning.

<P>
As recounted by Freud, Schreber's construction of a delusional solution
to the collapse of his masculine identity actually has two distinct
elements. At the most obvious paranoiac level, Schreber transforms
the threat from within (the fantasy of becoming a woman) into a threat
from without--the paranoid belief that he is the victim of a process of
unmanning by external powers. Eventually Schreber finds a satisfactory
meaning for this victimization. He transforms his humiliation and
hostility into at least partial honor and acceptance by identifying
his persecutor and castrator as God, by providing a cosmic theological
framework and thus higher meaning and purpose for his suffering. However,
in extreme psychotic forms of paranoiac delusion, which involve the
collapse of the external world and regression to infantile narcissism, a
further transformation is accomplished, one that recreates the suffering
victim as a messianic savior. The transformation into a woman who
can only find her identity as the love-object of a man is restaged as
identification with the mother, the primal origin of being who attracts
to herself all of the rays of divine libido and gives birth to a new race
of men and a new world. For Freud, the story of Schreber exemplifies
two interrelated forms of delusional defensive formation against the
threat to masculine autonomy: the story of the victim who defines himself
as the object of the male ego, and the story of messianic election in
which the dissolution of the individual ego becomes the condition for
a megalomaniac and apocalyptic fantasy, one in which a new world and a
new self are created out of the collapse into nothing. Both stories for
Freud are signs of failure--exemples of constructing identities that
ignore the real conditions of human finitude and the onerous tasks of
achieved autonomy and



<B></B>



identity. Demystification of these stories opens up the possibility
for a recreation of the struggle for self-mastery and autonomy as an
interminable labor of self construction, labor that must take place
in the context of a disabused knowledge of the limiting conditions of
biological and historical fate.

<P>
Freud's view of the Schreber story was a moral tale that allowed him
to reconstruct the story of his own identity as <I>not</I> paranoid and
<I>not</I> delusional. By working through and understanding the conditions
of such a response to the threat of feminization as emasculation, Freud
insisted, he had "succeeded where the paranoiac fails." By working through
the homosexual investment in his relationship to Fliess, he had succeeded
in utilizing and controlling his femininity for the enhancement of his
autonomy, for the "enlargement" of his ego.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Yet in the concluding paragraphs of his retelling of Schreber's
 story he wondered, in an ironical but telling fashion, whether his
 own self-conscious reconstruction of Schreber's narrative might not
 be as much a fictional and delusional construct as Schreber's. Was the
 explanatory history of desire into which he had incorporated Schreber's
 world-construction anything more than another delusional system, parallel
 to Schreber's own, and thus a parallel defense against his own fears
 of feminization?:

Schreber's "rays of God" which are made up of a condensation of the
sun's rays, of nerve fibres and of spermatazoa, are in reality nothing
else than a concrete representation and external projection of libidinal
cathexes <I>(Besetzungen); </I>and thus lend his delusions a striking
similarity with our theory. His belief that the world must come to an
end because his ego was attracting all the rays to itself, his anxious
concern at a later period, during the process of reconstruction, lest
God should sever his ray connection with him
--these and many other details of Schreber's delusional formation sound
almost like endopsychic perceptions of the processes whose existence I
have assumed in these pages as the basis of our explanation of paranoia. I
can nevertheless call a friend and a fellow specialist to witness that
I had developed my theory of paranoia before I became acquainted with
the contents of Schreber's book, It remains for the future to decide
whether there is more delusion in my theory than I like to admit, or
whether there is more truth in Schreber's delusion than other people
are as yet prepared to believe. ["PB," 199-200; "PN," 78-9]

<P>
Freud recognized that Schreber's delusional creation of a private
mythology and cosmology, in which gender identity was constructed and
provided with meaning by the framing theory of the operation of divine
invisible rays operating through nerves, sperm, and blood, was itself
a kind of inadvertent parody of his own psychoanalytical framing of
the process of gender differentiation through the transformations of
libido. For a number of years he and Jung exchanged "Schreberisms,"
phrases derived from the private language Schreber had constructed to
describe his delusional cosmos, in their private correspondence. This
jargon humorously paralleled their use of the psychoanalytical jargon
which had been created to gain a theoretical distance from, a scientific
control of, similar processes of gender differentiation and identity
construction.

<P>
Recent commentaries on Freud's retelling of the Schreber story indicate
that Freud's work, rather than translating delusions into controlled
conceptual structures,



<B></B>



may have offered something that more nearly resembles a competing fiction
or myth about the processes of masculine identification. In his reading
of Schreber, Freud chose to omit two elements that played a key role in
Schreber's account. First, Schreber's "theory" had clearly paralleled
Weininger's in drawing analogies between feminization and transformation
into the eternal Jew. But Freud, anxious to avoid the accusation that
psychoanalytic theory was less a universal science than a representation
of the conflicts of a specifically Jewish experience (especially now,
when he was grooming Jung as his Gentile crown prince), narrowed his
focus exclusively to the masculinity complex in the text. Second,
Schreber's self-constructed messianic myth clearly transformed the
negative definition of feminization as emasculation (threatening the
collapse of masculine "being") into a positive identification with woman
as mother and creator of being.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 For him, the transformation into a woman was interpreted as a gain
 rather than a loss. His unmanning was less a loss of being, more the
 assumption of a new form of being as the primal creative source of
 both masculine and feminine beings. Schreber's identification with the
 "feminine" was thus ambivalent: it was not just a taking of the passive
 feminine position vis-&agrave;-vis masculine agency, but a merging with
 the maternal, originating ground of a world divided by subject/object,
 passive/active distinctions. These critical elements in stories of
 the refashioning of masculine identity were not ignored in the more
 self-consciously fictional stories of masculine identity formation
 produced by Freud's Austrian contemporaries, Arthur Schnitzler and
 Robert Musil. Both Schnitzler and Musil were trained as scientists,
 specifically scientific psychologists; Schnitzler as a medical doctor
 and psychiatrist in the Vienna Medical School, Musil as an engineer
 and physicist in the Machian tradition. Unlike Freud, however, they
 eventually decided that it was fictional narrative and the metaphoric
 language of art, rather than the analytical case study and the
 conceptual language of science, which could best portray the kind of
 self-reflexive narrative of identity construction that Freud described
 as the distinctive achievement of psychoanalytic science. Inverting
 the hierarchical distinctions Freud had constructed between art and
 science in "Dora," they judged the perspective of science as confined
 to the limiting one-dimensionality of surface phenomena and prone to a
 conceptual dogmatism (and thus to a recapitulation self-alienating myth )
 which crudely fixated the fluid dynamics of lived experience. They turned
 to experimental, aesthetic, fictional construction as the appropriate
 form for unveiling the multi-dimensionality of conscious and unconscious
 mental life, of psychic event and psychic structure, of memory and the
 present, in stories of self-dissolution and self-formation.

II. Schnitzler: The Problematic Entanglement of Emancipation and
Masculinity in <I>The Road into the Open</I>
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Parallels in the cultural perspectives and the generational, ethnic,
social, professional, and educational experiences of Freud and Schnitzler
have often been noted, as have the mutual recognition and admiration
which prompted Freud to describe



<B></B>



Schnitzler as his double (<I>Doppelg&auml;nger</I>), and Schnitzler to
remark on the way he found himself attracted by Freud's "total being"
(<I>gesamtes Wesen</I>) and perceived himself psychologically as Freud's
"psychological twin brother."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 This acknowledged closeness, however, was matched by a mutual distancing
 and a marked attempt to avoid close social contact. Just as Freud
 separated his own work from the construction of narrative meaning by
 the fictional story teller in "Dora," so Schnitzler distanced himself
 from what he saw as the overly deterministic, schematic theorizing in
 much psychoanalytic writing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Both saw a tendency toward self-deceptive closure and evasion
 of self-conscious reflectivity in the work of the other. Yet the
 parallelism in such mutual critique, often directed more vaguely at a
 category and genre (the psychoanalyst, the writer or <I>Dichter</I>)
 than at the person, only seems to make the reputed closeness between
 Freud and Schnitzler more compelling.

<P>
Although Schnitzler's literary reputation in the early twentieth
century was built on his short stories and dramas, the full-length
novel he published in 1908, <I>The Road into the Open</I> (<I>Der Weg
ins Freie),</I> was considered by Schnitzler himself as the culminating
work of his literary career up to that moment. In early 1906, two years
before the novel's completion, he imagined it as a representative epic
of his age, a work that would take its place in the line of great German
novels from <I>Wilhelm Meister</I> to <I>Buddenbrooks.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 His emotional identifications with his characters and his involvement
 in the depicted situations often became so intense that he experienced
 great difficulty separating his own existence from his work. Reading
 parts of it in progress to his wife, he found himself choking back
 his tears, and when he was finished he noted not only his pride in
 accomplishment, but also his yearning to "return" to the novel, as if
 it was his only satisfactory home in a homeless world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 This identification with his subject, as in Freud's case studies,
 emerged from the attempt to work through and master his own
 experience. Schnitzler's autobiography and recently published diaries
 reveal remarkable personal analogies between the central plot of the
 novel and his own affair with Marie Reinhard in 1895-1897.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 The writing of the novel worked, again like Freud's case studies, as
 a process of both therapeutic self-understanding and self-construction.

<P>
Schnitzler's contemporaries, including close friends and admirers, like
Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Georg Brandes, often appeared less impressed
than Schnitzler by the alleged exemplary qualities of the novel, tending
to interpret the psychological, social, and philosophical or theoretical
dimensions of the novel as not fully integrated, as constituting separable
stories which should have remained separate. Schnitzler however, insisted
that the connection between the three dimensions was precisely the
impetus behind his work. Although <I>The Road into the Open</I> may
not be the great modern German, Austrian, or even Viennese novel that
Schnitzler had hoped it would be, it does provide an insight into the
inner connections between becoming a man, finding a home, and being an
artist in Schnitzler's particular version of early Viennese modernism.

<P>
The theme or problem of fashioning masculine identity is the most obvious
and dominant of the centers around which are constructed the consciousness
and existence



<B></B>



 of the novel's protagonist, the aristocratic, Gentile composer
 Baron Georg von Wergenthin; his alter ego, the middle-class Jewish
 writer Heinrich Bermann; and their overlapping circles of friends and
 acquaintances. Developed as a cyclically arranged series of moments
 in the narrative of one year of Wergenthin's life, the novel begins
 shortly after the death of his father and ends shortly after the death
 of his (illegitimate) son in childbirth. Fatherhood and a version of the
 father complex are clearly at the center of Schnitzler's conception of
 the narrative of masculine self-making, and the discovery of the path
 to masculine autonomy (one of the possible meanings of the novel's
 title). Virtually every male character is first introduced through a
 description of the father/son relationship. The generational formation of
 masculine identity, the passing on of the powers and duties of fatherhood
 is at issue. Examined through the lens of fatherhood, masculine autonomy
 is tied to the assumption of responsible freedom, the establishment of a
 character held in place by obligations and commitments as a reliable and
 stable center of order in time and space. Emancipation in this context
 means on the one hand emancipation from the determinations of unmastered
 desires, from passive surrender of the will to circumstance and the pull
 of the object of desire, and on the other hand, emancipation from the
 cul-de-sac of cynical, isolating egoism, in which self-consciousness of
 the constructed nature of personal identities leads only to directionless
 drift, to an inability to act out a program for the creation of any
 substantial identity.

<P>
In the opening scene, as Wergenthin muses about his recently deceased
father, a memory drifts into his consciousness. A few months before his
father's death, he had been involved in a non-committal, self-indulgent
love affair with an emancipated American woman (Grace) traveling in
Italy. Trying to give aesthetic form to the emotional impressions of
this love, he had composed an adagio, swelling with harmonic richness,
but ultimately unable to sustain itself for any length due to a lack
of systematic structure and clear over-arching melodic narrative. His
father had noted this failure of order and direction with a telling
question posed as Georg's improvisations on the piano drifted toward
aimless dissipation: "Where to? Where to?" (<I>Wohin?</I> <I>Wohin?</I>)
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 The inability to impose a satisfactory order on his experience, to
 make a commitment to a specific woman as the stable object shaping his
 sexual desire, to assume a tradition as his own past and to construct
 a program which would present beginnings and goals, pasts and future
 in clear narrative outline, the inability to take responsibility for
 the consequences of his actions and the effect of his self-defined
 personhood, define Georg's drift in a world where every definition and
 commitment appears open to constant renegotiation and only the moment
 and its immediate emotional content has recognizable value. Autonomy
 of the kind demanded by the father required a self-definition and
 substantial set of stable commitments which contradicted the open road
 of anchorless drift which Wergenthin would like to accept as his fate
 and the open road of infinite possibilities that he would like to avow
 as his chosen destiny.

<P>
In the novel, fathers represent the claims of independence achieved
through disciplined responsibility, sustained work, and self-defined
social obligation.



<B></B>



Wergenthin constantly finds himself counseled to take responsibility
for the social and moral consequences of his actions, to both affirm
his subjective agency and recognize that his autonomy is regulated and
affirmed under moral rules and social conventions. A series of fathers
and father res take on the position of enforcing the general law
of the father, and thus intrude a voice of conscience and a reminder of
transgression and guilt.

<P>
Wergenthin's inability to make himself into an adult person, a mature
man according to the moral ideal of his real and symbolic fathers, is
expressed in the vague guilt that always accompanies the recognition
of his transgressions (despite all rationalizations about generational
differences, historical change and relative cultural values), and the
insistent, repetitious assertiveness of a recent memory trace--the
self-indulgent love affair with Grace whose end was also marked by the
unexplained suicide of a young painter (Labinski) who had been traveling
with them in Italy. While the memory of Grace keeps reappearing as an
emotional sign of Wergenthin's faithless, self-indulgent, egoistic use
of women as provisional objects of momentary desire, Labinski returns
like a ghostly conscience revealing the dark underside (of transgression,
disavowed guilt, punishment and death) within his anchorless existence. In
a dream near the end of the book, Labinski emerges as the helmsman
of Georg's ship of life, the re of death and guilt who steers his
rudder. The persistent reappearance of Grace and Labinski in Wergenthin's
memories, fantasies, and dreams also reminds the reader that his current
affair is a repetitive acting out of an unmastered past which continues
to frame Wergenthin's intra-psychic relations in the present. His freedom
emerges as a repetitively enacted fate.

<P>
The failure of Wergenthin to achieve the kind of masculine identity
designated by the personal autonomy and social responsibilities of
fatherhood is most dramatically articulated in his relationship to the
child whose inception and birth mark the boundaries of the novel's
temporal narrative. Wergenthin is unable to commit himself to his
offspring, to remember his part in its creation, to prepare or even
imagine a home for its arrival, and it's death in childbirth is at
least partly recognized as an expression of these failures. The son,
Wergenthin allows himself to muse, refused to enter into a world where
it would not be loved and sustained, where it could not hope to find a
home (<I>WIF,</I> 956; <I>RIO,</I> 295). Wergenthin's transgression and
failure as a man lies in his unwillingness to work through his dependent
sonship and to assume fatherhood, to take responsibility for the future,
to define his identity in a way which would provide a moral framework
for the reproduction of future generations.

<P>
Schnitzler situates the father/son thematic in Wergenthin's self-formation
within a spectrum of analogous pairings in which similar tensions are
played out in slightly different ways. Wergenthin's alter ego, Heinrich
Bermann, suffers most dramatically under the burden of guilt and the
consciousness of having betrayed his father's claims on him. Bermann's
father is a former liberal lawyer and patriotic nationalist politician
who suffered mental and physical collapse under the pressure of the
crushing, disillusioning failure of all of his public hopes. His fall
into incurable psychosis occurs at the same time as Wergenthin's father's
death and he dies near the end of



<B></B>



the novel. Bermann projects his own creative work as a monument
to his father's dreams and ideals, but cannot go beyond imagining
this monument as a tragicomedy which parodies his father's hopes as
empty delusions, and which thus actually repudiates and kills him once
again, adding to his sense of guilt. In the more peripheral father/son
relationships of the Ehrenbergs, the Staubers, the Rosners, and the
Eisslers, the sons range in their responses from violent repudiation to
a resigned recognition of their failure to live up to paternal models
and paternal claims. But the fathers in Schnitzler's novel are not
simple representatives of a former world in which social conventions
and roles affirmed secure gender identities and public callings: they
already carry the seeds of their son's dilemmas within their own lives
and careers. All are marked by disappointments in the public sphere which
encourage withdrawal to scientific work, aesthetic enjoyment, domestic
relations, or even dreams of exile and new beginnings. The dilemmas
of the sons as the elder Dr. Stauber suggests, are only quantitatively
rather than qualitatively distinct from the conflicts which the older
generation had experienced. Historical change may have made the tasks
of achieving autonomous manhood more difficult, its conflicts more
extreme, but it cannot absolve the younger generation of the ethical
demand to achieve a responsible freedom within the conditions in which
they have been thrown by fate. The crises of sonship and fatherhood with
which Wergenthin is surrounded are more extreme than his own, both in
their repudiations and in their guilt-ridden anxieties, but they mirror
back to him in revealing (though often disavowed) forms the patterns of
transgression and guilt in his own consciousness and behavior. Only a
few sons (all minor characters), like Wergenthin's brother Felician, who
tends to assume his adult responsibilities almost as a natural role, or
the social radical Leo Golowski, who experiments with future identities
by simply ignoring a father who has descended into hopeless impotence,
attain even a semblance of resolution. But even they are marked by the
general tendency toward escape into ideological utopia, travel or art.

<P>
The achievement of masculine identity as an assumption of the role of the
father is tied to the disciplining and sublimating of sexual desire in
complex ways. In Schnitzler's account of Wergenthin's struggle with his
masculinity, the femininity in relation to which his masculinity jockies
for definition is tied to the image and role of motherhood. Wergenthin's
principle feminine other in the novel, his lover Anna Rosner, who bears
his child, emerges as a potential maternal feminine re that could mold
his desire toward a responsible, paternal masculinity. From the beginning
he experiences her not only as an object of sexual pleasure but as the
psychosexual guide that might help him attain a secure consciousness
of self within a stable sense of home; a woman who was "better suited
than anyone else to counteract his tendency toward frivolousness and
carelessness and to spur him on to purposeful and productive activities"
(<I>WIF,</I> 53; <I>RIO,</I> 44).
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 It is precisely her much noted tendency to peaceful self-containment and
 bourgeois domesticity which first attracts him and then occasionally
 repels him as a restriction on his freedom of self-expression. Her
 gentle reproaches act in combination with paternal admonitions to impose
 a feeling



<B></B>



of guilt for his failure to take responsibility for his own personal
actions and social roles. During a long vacation trip to Italy during the
late months of Anna's pregnancy, Wergenthin visits the site in Florence
where he had watched his mother die when he was a young boy. As he tries
to recreate the earlier bedside scene in his memory he suddenly realizes
to his amazement that the word "mother" no longer meant "the long buried
woman who had born him; the word meant that other woman who was not a
mother yet, but who would be in a few months . . . the mother of the
child of whom he was the father. And now the word suddenly sounded as
though it intoned something never heard before, never understood, as
if accompanied by mysteriously singing bells in the distant future"
(<I>WIF,</I> 166; <I>RIO,</I> 148).
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>

<P>
But the image of the mother also operates in a rather different way in
Wergenthin's psychosexual life. It serves as an image of transgressive,
irresponsible sexuality, of dangerous surrender to unfettered desire. Just
weeks before the birth of Anna's child, Wergenthin indulges in a
wild, reckless affair with a married woman. This mystery woman also
treats him like a mother, resting her hands on his head as he puts his
head in her lap, and listening to and accepting his confessions without
censure. However, she is also a maternal re "created for every madness
and ecstasy . . . the dark gaze of her eyes, the blue-black stream of
her undone hair, the smell of her pale and naked body" (<I>WIF,</I> 236;
<I>RIO,</I> 211).
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Wergenthin's passion also fills him with at least momentary
 self-confidence and a sense of power fueled by the vague forces of
 unconscious energies. Yet he returns to Anna and, crying in apparent
 contrition, lays his head in her lap, an experience that "seemed to him
 like a vague and sweet dream, as if he lay as a boy at the feet of his
 mother, and this moment was already a memory, remote and painful, as
 he was experiencing it" (<I>WIF,</I> 240; <I>RIO,</I> 215).
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>

<P>
Wergenthin's struggle to define his masculinity in relation to this
ambivalent maternal femininity is not offset by a correspondingly serious
encounter with the femininity of emancipated younger, non-maternal
women. His flirtations in these directions all lead to problematic and
unsatisfactory relations with persons who are caught in the same complex
problems of self-definition that he is experiencing. In its extreme
form, the fate of masculinity in relation to this new, emancipated woman
is represented by the tragic relations between Bermann and an unnamed
actress who eventually chooses to take her life rather than continue to
play the battle of identity as a battle of power and submission between
the sexes. This woman is constantly forced to submit to the identities
imposed upon her, to exist only as a projection of Bermann's fear of
feminization. Although Schnitzler continually reminds the reader that
the women in the novel are themselves historical agents struggling
with problems of gender and social identity that parallel those of the
male protagonists, the male characters never themselves appropriate this
understanding and continue to relate to individual women in terms of their
own psychological needs and projections. Like Anna, the emancipated young
Jewish women--Else Ehrenburg, Sissy Wyner, Therese Golowski--all find
themselves placed in positions in which it seems virtually impossible
to avoid eventual resignation to the roles and types constructed for
them by men. Neither Wergenthin nor Bermann are able to define their
own masculinity



<B></B>



 in relation to the feminine as anything but an other that must
 be possessed. Just as Bermann refuses to recognize his lover as a
 responsible agent in her own right, and not just an affirmation of, or
 threat to, his own identity, so Wergenthin only finds satisfaction with
 Anna when he can experience her as a refuge in which his wandering
 finally finds a home after a long journey, as "the only being who
 completely belonged to him" (<I>zu dem einzigen Wesen, das ihm ganz
 geh&ouml;rte)</I>, and as a kind of surrogate anchor for his own absent
 center (<I>WIF,</I> 102; <I>RIO,</I> 90). Neither Wergenthin nor Berman
 seem able to perceive the women in their lives as individuals caught
 in the same conflicts as their own, as projects of identity formation
 which demand both an emancipation from maternal attachments and paternal
 domination and a free reshaping of the relations between feminine and
 masculine in their adult identities.

<P>
The narrative of masculine self-formation in <I>The Road into the Open</I>
does not produce any clear resolution for the major characters. At
the novel's end, as Wergenthin abandons Anna to take on a temporary
position as a conductor's assistant in a provincial German town, he is
right back where he had begun a year earlier. He seeks the illusion of
a freedom defined by mobility and lack of commitment and escape from
the self-definition and responsibilities of fatherhood. The death
of Bermann's lover leaves him as bound to the bitter resentments of
being determined in his actions by the identities thrust upon him, and
stymied by his inability to forge relations of trust and intimacy, as
he had been at the beginning of the novel. But in the telling of this
unresolved cyclical story Schnitzler also told a story of its cultural
and social contexts, of the conditions which made the ambivalences and
apparent failures of his characters understandable.

<P>
The social dimension of <I>The Road into the Open</I> has often been
perceived as disjointed from the love plot because it seems so completely
focused on questions of Jewish identity, a problem which apparently
did not directly affect the non-Jewish principals, Georg von Wergenthin
and Anna Rosner. Yet it seems clear that Schnitzler situated his story
of personal identity adrift within the context of a world of Austrian
Jews in a crisis of cultural assimilation, acculturation and exclusion
because he perceived the particular issues of anti-Semitism and Jewish
self-identification as exemplary of a larger cultural process. This
process determined, even if in less extreme and self-conscious form,
the individual lives and the cultural worlds of Wergenthin and Anna as
well. Throughout the novel it is clear that the oscillating attraction
and repulsion that Wergenthin and Anna experience in their relations to
their Jewish friends and acquaintances is indicative of the larger meaning
that Schnitzler ascribes to Jewish experience and self-consciousness. The
Jewish crisis is both exemplary of a general cultural crisis and an
extreme form of that crisis. It can thus serve as an ideal-typical form
that clarifies and articulates the determining structures and essential
components of the larger cultural world. The particular experience of
the dilemmas of Jewish emancipation and cultural identification forces
an articulation and thinking through of a general cultural crisis of
subjective autonomy and communal identity. In the novel it is the Jews who
theorize, politically and philosophically, the meaning of fatherlessness
and homelessness, the breakdown of



<B></B>



responsible paternal masculinity, the inability to produce oneself
objectively in art or society as a solid, essential identity, and
the ambivalence of "freedom" in a world without anchors where all are
strangers within their own homeland.

<P>
At the center of this story of the universalization of Jewishness is the
friendship between Wergenthin and Bermann. From the beginning Wergenthin
is drawn toward Bermann in part because of a curiosity about the alien
and exotic, a desire to "peer into a world that until now had remained
foreign to him" (<I>in eine Welt hineinzuschauen, die ihm bisher ziemlich
fremd geblieben war</I> [<I>WIF,</I> 80; <I>RIO,</I> 148]). Similarly
Bermann seems drawn to Wergenthin in part because he views him as somehow
immune from the torturous conflicts of his own self-consciousness as a
Jew. Attraction is mixed on both sides with distancing and occasional
resentment at either the perceived smugness or hypersensitivity of the
other. But Wergenthin does have moments in which he also recognizes
himself in the other and envisions the tortured souls of Bermann and
his other Jewish acquaintances as the cultural site on which "the future
of humanity was preparing itself" (<I>in deren Seelen sich die Zukunft
der Menschheit vorbereitete</I> [<I>WIF,</I> 94; <I>RIO,</I> 82]). The
elective affinity and disaffinity between Wergenthin and Bermann is
given specific objectification in their attempted collaboration on an
opera in which Wergenthin was to provide the music to Bermann's story of
a hero/son who ultimately shatters in his attempt to take the father's
place, to possess the primal object of desire and to inherit the Kingdom,
because of his inability to work through the guilt embedded in his
fate and unwillingness to construct a life in the context of the death
which awaits him. Although Wergenthin and Bermann are both obsessively
absorbed with the son's situation, neither can imagine a completion or
Third Act for their story, just as their own mutual sympathies never find
a satisfactory resolution in a stable, intimate, and loyal friendship.

<P>
The relationship between Wergenthin and Bermann as a relationship
between insider and outsider, German and Jew, is mirrored from various
perspectives in the personal relationships which surround them. Schnitzler
follows up many possible ways in which Jewish experiments in identity
formation could work as mirrors for a more universal understanding. Anna
Rosner, for example, finds herself attracted to two Jewish suitors (prior
to the affair with Wergenthin) who appeal to her not only because of
their understanding of the problems of constructing a home and a temporal
identity (in generational continuity with parents and children) in a
world in which such homes and identities are no longer simply natural,
but also because the choices they make from within this understanding
recognize the need to discipline the autonomy of self-choice with social
responsibilities. Although completely apolitical herself, she is drawn
to men who define freedom as freedom in solidarity with others, and
take up public careers as political leaders. While Wergenthin often
runs away from the problematic self-consciousness of relations with
Bermann and other Jews to the apparently unproblematic home of Anna's
love and acceptance, Anna herself finds protection and consolation from
Wergenthin's self-indulgent freedom in the support of Jews who recognize
her unjust fate more readily than he does. In fact there is a sense in
which Schnitzler does portray a kind of inner sympathy between



<B></B>



women and Jews. Both are engaged in a battle for self-definition within
a situation in which they can never escape the identities that have
been thrust upon them by dominant masculine and/or Christian-German
perspectives. Although both Bermann and Stauber have moments in which
they assert their commitment to a Nietzschean ideology of self-sufficient
self-making, their brave words seem like a spitting into the wind. And
the women eventually end their brief experiments in self-making with
resigned submission to conventional feminine identities.

<P>
Schnitzler constructs his fictional world in such a way that the
Gentile and Jewish positions are not presented as binaries, as closure
and openness, rootedness and homelessness, etc., but as distorting
and illuminating mirrors of each other. Temporal discontinuity
and cultural exile envelops the whole society in which the Jews
are situated. Wergenthin himself, although a member of a family
in the service nobility whose aristocratic credentials reach back
four generations, emerges from a rootless "hotel and wandering life"
(<I>Hotel</I> <I>und</I> <I>Wandersleben</I> [<I>WIF,</I> 9; <I>RIO,</I>
5]) as a child to a recognition that "he had no intimate relationship
to any human being" despite his many acquaintances (<I>da&szlig; er zu
keinem menschlichen Wesen in engerer Beziehung stand</I> [<I>WIF,</I> 12;
<I>RIO,</I> 8]). His homelessness does not carry the intense feelings of
exclusion and involuntary identification experienced by the Jews--he
wears his clothes with apparent elegant ease and can fit in less
self-consciously than Bermann who is always somewhat embarrassingly
overdressed or underdressed. But Schnitzler does suggest that appearing
awkward and out of place in public is not a problem confined to
Jews--as indicated by the descriptions of Anna's brother's attempt to
somehow fit in with the Christian nationalist Right. In the dream which
Schnitzler uses to portray the conflicts within Wergenthin's psyche,
moreover, Wergenthin does appear to himself in the "Jewish" position
of being awkwardly underdressed in a formal social gathering. Even
among exemplars of a traditional privileged class whose public carriage
and sense of self seem most natural--like Felician Wergenthin, or the
Hungarian noble Demeter Stanzides--there are moments of social unease
and cultural alienation which make participation in the Jewish social
circles, exile, or a "hotel and wandering life" seem almost natural for
them as well. As outsiders within, as foreigners in their own country,
as experiments in self-construction whose emancipation has left them
bereft of all natural identities, the Jews articulate the fate of
the human. The illusory vision of a Palestinian fatherland parallels
the delusions of German nationalists, anti-Semites and socialists, in
which the split within the self experienced by all was projected into a
division between a homogeneous "us" and an external "them." The problem
of defining a homeland which would be neither an ancestral fatherland nor
an emotionally exclusive motherland, but a space for the development of
responsible freedom within the acceptance of realistic social obligation,
was common to all, men and women, Germans and Jews.

<P>
Art's task for Schnitzler was to provide concrete shape or
objectification, and thus ultimately self-conscious appropriation and
understanding, of this human condition of identity dissolution and
recreation. Wergenthin the musical composer and



<B></B>



Bermann the writer (<I>Dichter)</I> are artists who articulate
two critical dimensions of this task. Wergenthin's art lives from
the experience of the moment, expressing the experiential, only
partly conscious movement of desire freed from conventional social
discipline. His peak experiences emerge from moments of surrender to
a primordial, maternal sensuality in which conventional identities
dissolve and he feels himself as pure potentiality. His characteristic
compositions express rather than conquer the undisciplined drift of
desire. He is most successful in the genres of the romantic song and
in brief, usually improvised, fantasias or tone poems for piano. Even
in these genres, however, he is unable to "finish," to round off his
creations as completed compositions with an internal structure. Even
his most successful songs, Anna notes, tend to "drift" off at the end
(<I>verl&auml;uft es</I> [<I>WIF,</I> 34; <I>RIO,</I> 27]). The quintet
which represents his goal of accomplishing a fully formed and structured
work goes nowhere during the course of the novel and becomes a sign
of his failed promise, his incorrigible dilettantism, his inability to
sustain the kind of disciplined work which would marks the achievement
of an adult identity.

<P>
Wergenthin becomes self-confidently buoyant with creativity during the
moods in which his unconscious feelings suddenly rise to the surface
and find brief musical expression. During such moments Wergenthin feels
inspired by a mysterious inner necessity, something "incomprehensible"
which he simply needed to allow to "go its own way" and he dreams of
future projects and endless possibilities (<I>als m&uuml;&szlig;te er nur
ein Unbegreifliches ge&auml;hren lassen</I> [<I>WIF,</I> 56; <I>RIO,</I>
47]). When Wergenthin allows his daydreams, memories, and half-understood
desires free reign, he feels fully alive and is ready to turn back the
persistent echoes of the paternal conscience which demand that he find
a clear direction for his work, complete a fully formed composition,
and fulfill his youthful potential.

<P>
Bermann seems acutely aware of Wergenthin's strengths and weaknesses
as an artist. He recognizes with some envy that in his inspired moments
Wergenthin can live in an atmosphere of aesthetic perception and feeling
which does not demand the sense of creative accomplishment that comes
from a fully articulated work. Bermann himself cannot give himself over
to his feelings and moods; he is unable to allow himself the sense of
uncontrolled drift and surrender to memories, moods and images in which
Wergenthin indulges. Bermann's aesthetic tool is the word, his method,
incessant analysis. Everything must be articulated in consciousness,
brought to full understanding. His own self-confidence comes from the
conviction that he is "able to see into the human soul . . . deep inside,
in everyone, honest or dishonest, men, women or children, heathens,
Jews, Protestants, even Catholics, nobles and Germans" (<I>WIF,</I> 42;
<I>RIO,</I> 34).
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 The defensive and mistrustful position of the cultural outsider is for
 Bermann a position of superiority. But like Wergenthin's surrender to
 the unconscious, Bermann's confident analytic self-understanding also
 produces aesthetic failure.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 While Wergenthin can never find a systematic or teleological structure
 which will fully articulate his deeper feelings, Bermann finds that his
 words can never join together into a satisfying and coherent aesthetic
 whole. His creative conceptions dissolve into sentences, words, and
 finally isolated "letters on white paper" as if "a



<B></B>



death's hand had touched it all" (<I>Nein, Buchstaben auf weisem Papier
. . wie wenn eine Totenhand alles ber&uuml;hrt hatte</I> [<I>WIF,</I>
50; <I>RIO, </I>41]). When he tries to imagine a structure emerging
from his method of analytical, self-conscious dissection he envisions
a wildly spinning carousel moving upward to the top of a tower before
plunging into the abyss (<I>WIF,</I> 48-9, 261, 330; <I>RIO,</I> 40, 235,
296). Understanding does not produce a new meaning or create satisfactory
self-conscious identities, but either dissolves everything or, in resigned
irony and cynicism, leaves everything as it is. Even if all the lights
on the various stories of the inner life were turned on, and the soul
completely illuminated, Bermann laments, the self would remain a "mess,"
without coherence or continuity (<I>sieht's n&auml;mlich greulich aus</I>
[<I>WIF,</I> 330; <I>RIO,</I> 296]). Ironically it is precisely Bermann's
self-conscious, critical, diagnostic, analytical obsessiveness which
makes others dismiss his work as that of an outsider who doesn't really
understand the actual worlds of the people he is writing about. Bermann
himself recognizes that his analysis of half-understood moods, unconscious
desires, and secret motives is not therapeutic, and that he therefore
cannot really operate as Wergenthin's therapist:

My dear friend, understanding helps nothing. Understanding is a sport
like any other. Avery noble sport and a very expensive one.One can
squander one's whole soul on it and be left a beggar. But understanding
has nothing in the slightest to do with our feelings--almost as little
as with our actions. It won't save us from sadness, from disgust or
from annihilation. It leads to nothing. It's a blind alley, so to

<P>
At moments like these, Bermann loses his sense of superiority over
Wergenthin and wishes for a "capacity to perceive each experience as
new and individual," for the strength to "endure in each moment" as
if one stood in a "new world." The impulse to reduce all experience
to words, he suggests is just as cowardly, just as morally blind and
defensive as Wergenthin's refusal to face the full consequential logic
of his surrender to the drift of unconscious desire and to assume
self-conscious responsibility for his actions. The "diverse unity" of
"life" will only appear in its "wondrous" and "true" form if knowledge
can be turned back into feeling, the subjective aggression of analytical
understanding into a shared consciousness of participation in and with
the other (<I>WIF,</I> 262; <I>RIO,</I> 235-6).
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>

<P>
Although Schnitzler clearly imagines Wergenthin and Bermann as two
variations on modern art, he does not condemn or promote either. His
own art lies precisely in presenting the historical situation of
their implication in each other. Wergenthin does not finally achieve
self-understanding through his relationship to Bermann. After a brief
moment in which he recognizes that the death of his child is a consequence
of his moral failure in assuming the responsibilities of freedom, he
returns to his persistent self-deceiving belief that his only true
freedom lies in breaking all social ties and floating along freely on
the sea of his moods and desires. Their collaboration on the opera falls
apart as Bermann is unable to imagine a resolution of the son's quest



<B></B>



for autonomy under the burden of his guilt, and, as Bermann loses
the thread of his story, Wergenthin's musical inspirations cease as
well. Neither is able to face the reality of the third act in which the
freedom of self-construction in an anchorless world would be directly
confronted with the moral responsibilities of selfhood and social
obligation, in which the son would have to face the consequences of
his patricidal and incestuous wishes. The revelation of Wergenthin's
inner contradictions does not find its articulate shape in a libretto or
in a critical diagnostic case study by Bermann. It emerges through the
description of a dream which he cannot fully understand but whose keys are
presented to the audience of readers by associations to the contradictory
structures of the composer's world as created by the author. It is only
within Schnitzler's fictional construction of the structure of psychic
and social relations represented by the mutual entanglement of Wergenthin
and Bermann, that the differentiated "types" of the novel are seen as
internal to the self and to the culture. Bermann and Wergenthin are not
so much alternative models from which to choose, as modelings of the
mutual implicated polarities which define the cultural space in which
stories of identity formation are lived, understood and told.

<P>
Despite the many biographical parallels which have led critics to
tie Schnitzler's own position in the novel to either that presented by
Bermann or Wergenthin, Schnitzler did not simply mirror himself in these
characters but constructed himself in their mutual relationship. He
defined his modernism as a form of self-critical creativity in
which the struggle to produce a satisfactory identity, to create a
coherent narrative and a systematic, though provisional "work" from
the disjunctions of experience became the story itself. Like Freud,
Schnitzler might well have said that by articulating the conditions of
the problem he succeeded where his patients (characters) failed. Unlike
Wergenthin and Bermann, Schnitzler did complete a systematic work
which revealed the consciousness of the modern not as a resolution
of the struggle for identity in an essential masculinity, Germanness,
Jewishness, or in aesthetic transcendence, but in the recognition of
the open-ended processes of interminable identity construction and
self-understanding. For Schnitzler the recognition of the other in
oneself was the condition of a freedom which did not involve exclusion
and repudiation.

<P>
But for both Freud and Schnitzler, this critical understanding remains
a story of the male and his masculinity, a narrative of the struggle
to achieve self-definition which occurs in the force-field between the
desire for surrender to the mother and the assumption of responsible
fatherhood. From this perspective the construction of femininity as a
free act of self-creation remains a contradiction in terms. Schnitzler
does imagine both women and Jews as engaged in exemplary struggles to
construct new and experimental historical identities, rather than discover
essential or natural ones. In order to assume the mantle of responsible
autonomy, however, they must work their way through the stereotypical,
culturally imposed identities of femininity and Jewishness that have been
thrust upon them. The struggle to redefine a masculinity which will not
so much repudiate as recognize, accept and master its own femininity,



<B></B>



 thus becomes, in a sense the true exemplary human story of identity
 formation and reformation within Schnitzler's world. It is in the story
 of masculine identity formation that reflective self-understanding can
 become a generalized cultural critique.

III. Identity dissolution, Identity confusion, and the Processes of
Masculine Self-formation: Robert Musil's <I>Young T&ouml;rless</I>
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
The "confusions" of the teenage protagonist of Robert Musil's novella
<I>Confusions of Young T&ouml;rless </I>(<I>Verwirrungen des Z&ouml;glings
T&ouml;rle&szlig;)</I>, published in 1906 and written at about the same
time as <I>The</I> <I>Road into the Open</I>, are most obviously and
primarily confusions of self-definition or identity. From the "carriage"
of a story of adolescent psychosexual awakening, sado-masochistic
homosexual perversion, and boarding school politics, Musil tried to
provide a survey of the "landscape" which framed the "structuring
of psychic relationships" (<I>Gestaltung von</I> <I>seelischen
Zusammenhaengen)</I> in his culture. The particular materials Musil
chose for this story, which drew heavily on his own traumatic adolescent
experiences in an Austrian military academy during the 1890s, he claimed,
were simply a "trick" (<I>eine List</I>) which made it easier for him
to highlight, isolate, and simplify essential elements of the problem
of self-formation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 The narrator characterizes the core of the dilemma fueling T&ouml;rless's
 confusions and self-reflections as pertaining to "what is felt to be the
 character or soul, the outline or timbre [<I>Klangfarbe</I>] of a person,
 that is to say, that something against which thoughts, decisions and
 actions appear insignificant, contingent and interchangeable . . . this
 ultimate, immovable background . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

<P>
At the beginning of the novel Musil describes T&ouml;rless as having lost
this sense of a centered self, of subjective agency shaping perceptions
and action in a characteristically individual fashion. But the problem is
not that T&ouml;rless is simply without identity. Rather he experiences
himself as defined by an imposed, impersonal and increasingly alien,
oppressive identity, through which his way of being who he is seems
determined by forces beyond his control. Even in the sixteen-year-old
student, the experience of imposed identity is already fairly complex
and has at least three dimensions. There is first of all T&ouml;rless's
identity as a son defined within the "unthinking, animal-like tenderness"
(<I>mit einter . . . gedankenlosen, tierischen Z&auml;rtlichkeit</I>
[<I>VZT,</I> 10; "YT," 6]) of his parent's doting concern and the
comfortable orderliness and refined, elegant manners of the society of
middle class social elites within which the warm nest of the parental
home is situated, a society of "people whose lives moved in an orderly
way between the office and the family, as though in a transparent and
solid structure, a building all of glass and iron" (<I>Menschen, deren
Leben sich wie in ienem durchsichtigen und festen Bau von Glas and Eisen
geregelt zwischen Bureau und Familie bewegt</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 46; "YT,"
50]). Second, at the boarding school, T&ouml;rless has come under the sway
of a model of precocious, rebellious teenage masculinity purveyed by some
of his classmates and expressed in typical forms of expressive debauchery
and aggressive, though secret, hostility to the hypocritical moral



<B></B>



formulas of the "masters." Two of the senior class leaders, Beineberg
and Reiting, have become T&ouml;rless's mentors in the cultivation
of this youthful manliness. In the novel's opening scene, a parental
leave-taking at the railway station after a brief visit, T&ouml;rless's
father symbolically places his son under the protective care of these
upperclassman, surrendering to them the role of masculine role model, much
as he has surrendered T&ouml;rless more generally to the guidance of the
schoolmasters for socialization into the moral order of society. This more
general or universal discipline constructs the third, most pervasive and
oppressive of T&ouml;rless's borrowed or imposed identities. Returning
to the school after his parent's departure, T&ouml;rless places his
feet in the dusty prints of the boy in front of him with the feeling of
inexorable fate, of a "stony compulsion that captured his whole life and
compressed it into this movement--step by step--along this one line, along
this narrow band drawn out through the dust" (<I>VZT,</I> 16; "YT," 13).
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

<P>
Tensions among these imposed and passively absorbed identities provide
the first openings for T&ouml;rless's experience of the absence or loss
of that individualizing soul which might give shape to his personal
character. The move from home to school had resulted in a brief but
intense bout of homesickness in which feelings of abandonment, grief
and inner longing, feelings which expanded far beyond any attachment for
his parents or his actual parental home and became a treasured object in
themselves, emerged as the first revelation of a distinctive and personal
inner life. During his first years at school, moreover, T&ouml;rless had
developed a close attachment to a cultural outsider, a shy and sensitive
young Prince, whose fragile individuality and religious consciousness
were so entangled in his historically anachronistic "filigree habitation"
(<I>das filigrane Geb&auml;ude)</I> of ancient custom and religious faith
that they were unable to sustain themselves against the pressures of
"the wooden yardstick of rationality" which T&ouml;rless applied to them
(<I>dieser h&ouml;lzerne Zollstab des Verstandes</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 12;
"YT," 8]).

<P>
Memories of these moments, hinting at inner depths of experience
and alternative modes of being a self, re-emerge in T&ouml;rless's
consciousness because of the unsettling powers of his emerging adolescent
sexuality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 The structure of psychic relations which frame T&ouml;rless's existence
 are unveiled by the dissolving powers of sexual libido. For T&ouml;rless,
 the rough and precocious manliness of his schoolfriends does not
 provide a satisfactory shaping, control or disciplining of these
 vague, undefined feelings. Instead he is overwhelmed, as if he was
 falling through a trapdoor in the floor that held up the substantial
 and transparent relations of the everyday world defined by rational
 consciousness. While his friends display their teenage masculinity with
 lascivious comments about the peasant girls in the local village and
 in their puffed up bravado with the local prostitute, T&ouml;rless
 is overcome by fantasies of a shattering, blinding, ego-dissolving
 sensuality, by "some monstrous sight of which he could not form the
 slightest notion; something of a terrifying, beast-like sensuality;
 something that would seize him in its claws and rend him, starting with
 his eyes . . ." (<I>VZT,</I> 17-18; "YT," 15).
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 While his friends and student mentors use sexual transgression to
 prove their masculine identities and test the limits of their power
 and the boundaries



<B></B>



of their egos against the social conventions and moral rules of the adult
world, as a way of claiming their future place as holders of power in
that world, T&ouml;rless is caught in regressive fantasies which lead him
back to a primal childhood memory of total abandonment in an impersonal
world, to that moment prior to the formation of any of the subject
positions eventually imposed upon him in order to situate him within
the world. While his peers test and establish the boundaries of their
youthful selves in the world, the power of sensual urges and fantasies
exposes T&ouml;rless to the threatening and exciting experience of a
second dimension of existence. By undoing the weak, defenses provided by
his inherited identities, his libido leads him into a world of seething ,
boundary-effacing passion, of enigmatic darkness, of horizonless infinity.

<P>
Musil describes the collapse of T&ouml;rless's passively internalized
identities, the dissolution of his ego boundaries and descent into
the world of unconscious desire, in gendered terms. T&ouml;rless'
sensual passion seems relatively indifferent to the gender of its
object, sliding easily from Bozena, the village prostitute, to Basini, a
classmate. Both function as objectifications of desire more than objects
of desire. What seems important for T&ouml;rless is the identification
of the object of his lust with visions of degradation, shamelessness,
humiliation. What attracts and frightens T&ouml;rless is the experience
of falling through the trapdoor into the underworld where all the ego
boundaries of the official daytime world are dissolved. Musil tends
to describe the desire for, and identification with, the object of
desire in terms of a passive, masochistic femininity. T&ouml;rless's
hallucinations of nighttime abandonment to sensuality and absolute
loneliness appear to him as both "the temptation of a woman and of
something inhuman" (<I>sie hatte f&uuml;r ihn den Reiz eines Weibes
und einer Unmenschlichkeit)</I> and as something which he "experienced
as a woman" (<I>er f&uuml;hlte sie al eine Frau</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 25;
"YT," 24). His visits to the village prostitute are described as an
"awful rite of self-sacrifice" (<I>grausamer</I> <I>Kultus</I> <I>der
Selbstaufopferung</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 30; "YT," 31). His attraction to
Basini develops only after Basini falls into a humiliating, degrading
dependency on the sadistic whims of Beineberg and Reiting when he is
caught stealing money from a student locker. In both cases T&ouml;rless's
obsessions with "total humiliation" and shameless self-abandonment
are inextricably, but also at first inexplicably, connected to images
and memories of his mother. In his meetings with Bozena, T&ouml;rless
cannot prevent the mental associations with this woman, who for him was a
"tangle of all sexual lusts" (<I>ein Kn&auml;uel aller geschlechtlichen
Begehrlichkeiten)</I> and an exemplar of complete degradation, from
occupying the same space as images of his mother. This unconscious
association only increases his sense of the perversity of his actions,
of the transgressive dimension in his surrender to his sexual fantasies
(<I>VZT,</I> 32-3; "YT," 34). In one of the episodes with Basini, the
sudden emergence of the mother image is quickly repressed as if such
thoughts were a "sacrilege" (<I>L&auml;sterung</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 104;
"YT," 126]). Yet the holiness, the asexual purity of mothers cannot be
sustained. T&ouml;rless's fantasies and recreated memories persist in
revealing his own mother as sexual being, who has "betrayed" him with
her image of refined transparency.



<B></B>

<P>
At the same time, T&ouml;rless's desire for Basini, as his earlier
attraction to the Prince, is imagined in terms of an attraction to a
kind of prepubescent, feminine sensual beauty. Basini's facial features
are termed "effeminate" (<I>weibisch)</I>; his "soft, indolent" body
movements (<I>weiche, tr&auml;ge Bewegungen)</I> possess a "coquettish
agreeableness" (<I>eine art koketter Liebensw&uuml;rdigkeiet</I>
[<I>VZT,</I> 50; "YT," 98]); and his naked body appears to T&ouml;rless
as the "chaste slender leanness of a young girl" (<I>von einer keuschen,
schlanken Magerkeit, wie der eines jungen M&auml;dschens)</I>, a body
"lacking virtually any trace of male development" (<I>fehlte fast jede
Spur m&auml;nnlicher Formen</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 98; "YT," 119). The moment
of sensual abandonment to Basini arouses memories of T&ouml;rless's own
childhood longing to be a girl, a longing that "had tingled all over
his body and gone racing around on his skin" (<I>sie kitzelte im ganzen
K&ouml;rper und jagte rings unter der Haut umher</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 86;
"YT," 103]). For T&ouml;rless the feminine is not an image of what he
wants to overpower and possess as a masculine subject, but an image of
what he desires to be, or at least an image of a repressed and essential
part of himself to which he must surrender in order to understand what his
own individual character might be. T&ouml;rless's passion is described by
Musil as "a flight" (<I>eine Flucht)</I> from the feelings and thoughts
with which he had been "innoculated" in the everyday world and which
"gave him nothing and oppressed him" (<I>die man ihm einimpfte, all
das, was ihm nichts gab und ihn erdr&uuml;ckte</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 30;
"YT," 31]). This "flight" is clearly directed regressively toward the
mother, and it involves an identification with the feminine as the image
of self-dissolution, of shameless abandonment to the power of unconscious
desire, of degradation and humiliation. But T&ouml;rless's "love" for the
Prince and Basini also represents a recognition of the bisexual nature
of the "soul" which emerges from the maternal womb. The dissolving of
his ego defenses under the pressures of sensual desire brings to the
fore the repressed feminine "other" of the "stony compulsion" of imposed
masculine identities.

<P>
The confusions and contradictions in the psychic life of T&ouml;rless
become concrete, become "things" in the world, through his homoerotic
relationship to Basini. By transferring his enigmatic, incomprehensible
feelings on to Basini, T&ouml;rless allows his own unconscious desire to
emerge as a potential object of analysis and self-knowledge. His "affair"
is described as a psychic disorder, a hysterical or even psychotic episode
in which internal psychic conflicts are acted out and thus opened to the
possibility of conscious understanding. By working through his relation
to Basini, T&ouml;rless comes to understand the distinction between the
reality of Basini as a thing in the world and as a re of his desire
and sexual fantasy. He learns to control his psychic projections and
reappropriate them as elements of himself, distinct from the objective
realities of the external world.

<P>
During this process of seeking therapeutic understanding, T&ouml;rless
is placed in constant contrast to his two student mentors, Reiting and
Beineberg, who are also engaged in turning Basini into an experiment
for testing their present and future identities. Although Reiting and
Beineberg are "rebels" against the master's rule and trenchant critics
of the hypocrisy of conventional values in the adult world, both formulate



<B></B>



 their conceptions of masculine identity as a refashioning of the public
 roles of political domination and spiritual control over others. For
 them Basini represents a weak and contemptible object on which they
 can practice their method of controlling the irrational for personal
 power and egoic gain. Unlike T&ouml;rless they do not recognize
 themselves in Basini, they do not fall "in love" with him, or identify
 with his humiliation. They use him as a means to assert their own
 masculine superiority over his feminine weakness. Their experiments
 in manipulation and torture aim at refurbishing traditional models
 of masculinity autonomy as mastery over the feminine other, either as
 political domination or as spiritual purification.

<P>
Reiting and Beineberg are obsessed with their fathers and
forefathers. They define their own identities in terms of a fulfillment
of paternal claims and historical destinies, and their identities
are described by Musil as essentially "modernizations" of inherited
identities. T&ouml;rless in contrast, although he has a father, seems
virtually fatherless; or at least his weak and adaptive father appears to
make no claims on his future (other then giving him over to the control
of school masters and older peers) and thus allows him a relative freedom
to engage in the creative task of reformulating the relationship between
unconscious desire and individualized character without overpowering
historical baggage and guilt. Reiting and Beineberg are thus presented
as the primary alternatives of father-oriented masculine identities to
T&ouml;rless's innovative "confusions." Their strategies for dealing
with Basini illuminate the particularity of T&ouml;rless's therapeutic
refashioning of himself.

<P>
Reiting is the school demagogue who enters into the encounter with Basini
with pre-formed political ambitions. Modeling his future on that of a
Napoleon-like military officer with "daydreams of coups d'etat and high
politics" (<I>Er . . . rechnete mit Staatsstreichen und gro&szlig;er
politik</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 40; "YT," 43]), he sees Basini's femininity and
humiliating dependency from the standpoint of the manipulative strategies
of the ego, as signs of a pathological weakness on which he can build
the structures of his own power. Like Freud in his 1914 critique of
the ego-oriented heresy of Alfred Adler, Musil interprets this stance
as reductive, and, despite its revolutionary political posturings, as
ultimately conservative, and perhaps dangerously reactionary.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
Reiting provides the students who follow his leadership with an escape
from their loneliness by creating a group identity formed around the
objectification and projection of their inner demons on to the chosen
outsider, and an identification of their potent, purified selves with his
own person as their leader and father. This strategy not only disavows
the reality of the inner psychic conflict, but raises the specter of a
dangerous diversion and simplifying reduction of psychic confusion into
politically organized mass identity and persecutory purification. Musil's
Reiting and Freud's Adler disavow the feminine within themselves in their
"masculine protest" against feminization. They thus continue to confuse
internal and external conflicts, acting out their internal fantasies in
relation to others. In Freud's terminology they reject the reality of the
unconscious and build a world from the standpoint of the self-deceiving
power of the ego and on the denial of "love."



<B></B>

<P>
In 1914 Freud paired Carl Gustav Jung's defection from the critical
reflexive truth of psychoanalytic investigation with Adler's heresy,
as an equally reductive systematization of the signs of unconscious
mental life into a reconration of religious myth and a traditional
theological world-view. In Musil's novel Jung's position is played out by
Beineberg. Like Freud's Jung, Beineberg approaches the realm that lies
beyond the boundaries of rational knowledge with preconceived religious
conceptions. From his father he has imbibed a powerful belief in the
reality of transcendent spiritual forces infusing and controlling the
world of surface phenomena. T&ouml;rless is attracted to Beineberg because
of their common recognition of the two-dimensional nature of reality, but
he ultimately rejects Beineberg's claim that the mysterious irrational
powers he perceives are signs of a transcendent world of spiritual
forces which must be liberated from their corrupt bodily habitations and
mobilized to create a purified new world. Beineberg is in competition
with Reiting as a self-styled prophet of a new cultural order and leader
of youthful rebellion against the masters. He rejects T&ouml;rless's
hesitating and unresolved ruminations about the double nature of
psychic experience, rationalizes everything into a dogmatic system of
supernatural essences, and trains himself for the imminent cultural
collapse which will provide the opportunity for his prophetic religious
leadership. Like Freud, Musil regarded such therapies of supra-natural
meaning and spiritual integration as both delusional and conventional,
as a recycling of old religious intoxicants in new containers. In both
cases as well, this stance leads to an opposition to the politics of
identity as an appropriate model for human association. In fact, Freud,
Schnitzler, and Musil all reject a type of political mobilization which
involves a projection of the internal other on to a social group defined
as the external other of the communal self. Basini might be construed as
the symbolic "Jew" in the Boarding school. T&ouml;rless separates himself
from Beineberg and Reiting in recognizing Basini as the psychic projection
of the other in himself, and thus also in seeing the real Basini as a
victim of his peers' lack of self-knowledge and their consequent brutal
acting out of their own psychic conflicts.

<P>
Both Reiting and Beineberg pursue the fulfillment of their father's claims
and shore up conventional notions of masculine autonomy as mastery over
the feminine other in their rush to resolve identity "confusions" with
new therapies of meaning and commitment. By refusing to go along with
their leadership, by insisting on thinking through the contradictions
of his psychic life, T&ouml;rless, Musil suggests, is opening up a
more innovative path. As T&ouml;rless works his way out of the crisis
of self-dissolution with various experiments at self-understanding and
self-construction, he does accept the validity of the existing parental
order of law and convention, but only as a crude, contingent framework
within which he can find working space to concentrate on the complex
formation of his own soul (<I>Seele</I>) or spirit (<I>Geist</I>) as
an individual person. Although he can find no rational or empirical
grounds for constructing a general theory of "the nature of man" he
remains stubbornly convinced that the construction of his identity must
proceed from a disabused investigation of the immanent,



<B></B>



 natural origins of his enigmatic passions and internal confusions. This
 process of self-construction is guided, first of all, by a principled
 recognition and acceptance of the irresolvable difference between, on
 the one hand, the fantasies, dreams and psychic projections which emerge
 from the never fully comprehensible life of boundary-dissolving passion
 and desire, and, on the other hand, acts and objects in the "daylight"
 world of clear boundaries, definitions and individuated identities
 connected with each other through rationally comprehensible functional
 and causal relationships. Both worlds are recognized as "real," and any
 non-repressive, non-illusory sense of subjective individual identity
 would have to be based on a consciousness of the constantly changing,
 fluid and porous boundaries between them. This double vision, however,
 also produces an ironic and detached stance toward the given identities
 of the apparently substantial and transparent external world, a knowledge
 that "it could all be otherwise, that there were fine and easily-effaced
 boundary-lines around each human being" (<I>da&szlig; es anders sein
 kann, da&szlig; es feine, leicht verl&ouml;schbare Grenzen rings um
 den Menschen gibt</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 140; "YT," 174]).

<P>
T&ouml;rless must experience, accept, and come to understand the
reality of his own "femininity" in order to work out and live a
realistic, unrepressive and undogmatic masculine identity. Autonomy
based on possession or full mastery is illusory, thus no autonomy at
all. Responsibility is not tied to fatherhood, in Schnitzler's sense of
accepting the obligations of social interdependence and generational
authority, but to the clear, disabused and critical consciousness of
responsibility for the individual self. This self must be constructed
within the constant and irresolvable tensions between the powers of
irrational desire and the necessities of social life.

<P>
In <I>Young T&ouml;rless</I>, the interminable construction of
self-identity is tied to processes of self-narration, to the capacity
to tell the story of one's own self-formation, to the ability
to imagine one's own identity as one experimental, and contingent
possibility. Within the novel the attempts to attain clarity about the
relationship between conscious rationality and the world of irrational
desire and fantasy through philosophical comprehension are rejected as
futile. For T&ouml;rless, Kant is no help in understanding Basini. But
T&ouml;rless does reach a point at the end of the novel where he comes
close to articulating his experience in words. He does not construct
a synthesis which would make sense of his experience in some "total"
or final sense, but produces an account which clarifies and makes
intelligible, at least to himself, the dynamic structures which governed
the sequence of events that produced the particular person he had become,
or is in the process of becoming. T&ouml;rless's self-clarification
occurs as he is confronted with the necessity of explaining his own
actions to the schoolmasters. The attempts by the headmaster, chaplain,
and mathematics teacher to appropriate his experience within their
conventional discourses force T&ouml;rless to become more precise
about his own particular perspective and the appropriate terms needed
to describe it. For a brief moment T&ouml;rless is able to articulate
what had been so vague and tormenting within him, so that his thoughts
emerged like the extreme visible tip of his innermost being, rather
than a lifeless system of words, or a wordless feeling (<I>VZT,</I> 137;
"YT," 170). He describes the double quality



<B></B>



of his experience and connects it to the unconscious dimensions of his
own inner life. He recognizes that the deeper dimensions, the something
extra which allowed him to contextualize all of his experiences as
simply contingent possibilities playing out against a background of
unbounded chaos and infinite extension, emerged from within himself. In
the world, "things just happen" (<I>Alles geschieht</I> [<I>VZT,</I>
125; "YT," 153]), and "things are just things" (<I>die Dinge sind die
Dinge</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 138; "YT," 171]). The meanings we see in things,
the words which define the identities of self and other, come from us,
and are contingent, "could be otherwise." This consciousness has two
consequences. It allows him to see the other as simply another thing
(either object or subject) in the world. Bozena and his mother, in
the concluding scene, lose their terrorizing auras as embodiments of
his unconscious sexuality. Driving past Bozena's house on the way to
the railway station after deciding to leave the boarding school, he
perceived it as "utterly insignificant and harmless" (<I>so unbedeutend
und harmlos)</I> and turning toward his mother, who is sitting at his
side, he thoughtfully "considered" (<I>pr&uuml;fte</I>) the "faint scent
of perfume that arose from her bodice" (<I>den leise parf&uuml;mierten
Geruch, der aus der Taille seiner Mutter aufstieg</I> [<I>VZT,</I> 140;
"YT," 175]). At the same time, T&ouml;rless's own self has become more
like a project than an iron cage of imposed identities. Recognizing
the source of his fantasies in the never fully articulated power of his
unconscious sensual desire presents the possibility of a future in which
his own self will remain an always surprising and never closed story of
aesthetic and critical self-fashioning and refashioning.

<P>
The narrator of <I>Young T&ouml;rless</I> participates with his subject in
this process of self-fashioning and self-understanding. At the beginning
of the novel the narrative voice is intrusive, authoritatively informing
the reader of the later significance of particular events in his subject's
life, constantly pointing to the ways in which T&ouml;rless's confusions
will be absorbed into a life understood as fashioning it's own self. By
the end, the voice of the narrator and that of T&ouml;rless are in virtual
harmony as T&ouml;rless learns to articulate himself in the words of
the narrator. T&ouml;rless himself is described as developing in later
years into an "aesthetically inclined intellectual," who can tell the
story recounted in the novel in terms of its exemplary significance
as a story of the fashioning of a person who is able to take his own
life as an object for critical understanding and aesthetic stylization
(<I>VZT,</I> 111; "YT," 135). In this sense Musil's conception of the
construction of self-identity goes a step further than that portrayed
in the contemporaneous texts of Freud and Schnitzler. Unlike Dora or
Dr. Schreber, Bermann or Wergenthin, T&ouml;rless internalizes the
narrator's perspective as his own.

<P>
In a sense the achievement of masculine identity in Musil's novel, as in
Schnitzler's <I>The Road into the Open</I> and Freud's early case studies,
involves a mastery and disciplined control of femininity. T&ouml;rless's
confusions arise from the release of his repressed femininity, from his
surrender to the passive masochistic attraction of the ego-dissolving,
boundary-effacing power of unconscious desire. But T&ouml;rless's solution
is not to disavow this femininity and project it on to the other, as is
the case with Beineberg or Reiting. Instead he learns to accept it. It
is the deepest, ultimately never fully comprehensible source of his own
subjective power to make and remake



<B></B>



his self within the context of existing possibilities in a world in
which things "just happen." But it is also one pole of that bi-polar
self for which a purified masculine or feminine identity could only mean
a disavowal of the human project of making one's own self an object of
critical examination and aesthetic work. Assuming a homogeneous masculine
or feminine identity would entail a submission to the unrecognized and
thus unmastered "other" within oneself.

<P>
Robert Musil was not Jewish, not Viennese, and a generation, or at least
a half-generation younger than Freud and Schnitzler. His participation
in the cultural conflicts of pre-war Austria and central Europe was
certainly effected by the particular cultural perspectives and cultural
baggage that he did not fully share with his older contemporaries.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 Yet <I>T&ouml;rless</I> does display a focused concentration on a
 number of dilemmas and themes which are mirrored in and shared by the
 contemporaneous texts of Schnitzler and Freud, and could be construed
 as tentatively mapping out a particular dimension of the "mind" of
 early modernism.

<P>
All of these texts take the ethical problem of autonomy as their object
of diagnosis and experimental investigation, but construe and reformulate
it as a problem of the construction of subjective identity rather than
the emancipation of a natural or metaphysical essence. The generally
recognized disintegration of conventional affirmations of centered,
autonomous subjectivity--their unveiling as "illusions"--was interpreted
as an opening to that dimension of psychic experience, the unconscious
realm of psychosexual desire that precedes the formation of identities,
rather than as a liberation of already preformed identities. Autonomy
was first of all an ethical issue and defined as the task of achieving
self-identity and self-mastery. This task was a practical, worldly,
immanent task. For Freud, Schnitzler, and Musil, transendence did not
mean escape into a realm of abstractions, pure forms, or timeless truths,
but designated an inner-worldly process of the never-ending, open-ended
work of self-construction.

<P>
As a contingent product that emerged from the shaping of undifferentiated
or "bisexual" desire, the identity of the person, of "character",
"soul", or "subjectivity", was portrayed as inextricably entangled
in the processes of gender differentiation. From the standpoint of
the individual's experience, gender difference was reimagined as an
internal, psychic polarity. The articulation or enactment of masculine or
feminine identity thus became an historical and ethical task, a process
of self-fashioning within the limitations of natural and historical
constraints. The articulation or enactment of masculine or feminine
identity thus became a process of self-fashioning within the limitations
of natural and historical constrants. In Musil, Schnitzler, and Freud,
the ethical task of self-definition and self-mastery, despite all attempts
to disassociate it from an inherent basis in male and female natures, in
biological, metaphysical, or historical determinations of gender, remained
bound to an idea of masculinity for which femininity remained either the
enigmatic, preverbal, never fully graspable ground of all differentiated
identities (the maternal ground of being), or the negative other of the
universally human ideals of autonomy, self-mastery, and creative potency.



<B></B>

<P>
The conceptual language of science and its precise analytical
distinctions, the experimentally controlled playing out of particular
programs, hypotheses, and "ideal-typical" models were necessary tools
for reconstructing the conditions and consequences of specific empirical
determinations of identity within the real world in which the ethical task
of self-fashioning was played out. The work of Freud, Schnitzler, and
Musil evades any easy dichotomization of art and science. They achieved
this symbiosis, however, by reconstructing both art and science within
the terms of what I have defined as an essentially ethical task. Science
became the tool of diagnostic critique, laying bare the conditions
under which self-construction could occur. The psychologies of Musil,
Schnitzler, and Freud were not so much sciences of the subject, as
critical and self-reflexive accounts of the limits under which subjects
were made. They thus recaptured the Enlightenment notion of a secular
scientific perspective which did not provide a coherent representation
of the world, but instead fueled a critical understanding of the ways
in which representations of the world came into being. Art, in turn,
was defined less by the tasks of constructing alternative worlds or
identities than by the project of representing the processes through
which such worlds and identities were constructed. As Musil noted in an
interview with Oskar Fontana in 1926, his novels were to be interpreted
as "contributions to the intellectual mastery of the world" in which
"aesthetic qualities" were subordinate to the direction of the "will."
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

<P>
Finally, all three of these writers implicated the ethical tasks of
manufacturing identity and constructing an autonomous self in the
processes of writing coherent stories. In their works, narrative as a
representation of existence did not collapse but was recreated in a new
mode. The complex, reflexive process of narrative construction emerged
as itself a meaningful and coherent story. The unifying "subject" of
the narrative structure was reconstituted as the process of identity
dissolution and identity construction, a process which involved not only
the subjects in the text but the maker of the text as well. As stories
of story makng, as meaningful accounts of the struggle to construct
meaning, the texts of Freud, Schnitzler, and Musil appear as exemplary
representations of the "mind" of early modernism.

I use the word "home" here and throughout to designate a conception
of community in which individual identity is perceived as rooted in
and integrated into social being. In the German tradition the term
"Heimat" has developed strong connotations of nostalgic and utopian
longing, which are also clearly present in my usage. Among my three
authors only Schnitzler uses the term self-consciously.

Weininger dismissed the movement for women's emancipation as an

individual women to become "masculine" (<I>GC,</I> 79-93). Similarly,
Weininger despised as an excess of femininity in men what he perceived
as effeminate homosexuality, but praised a type of Greek homoeroticism
in which masculinity was attracted to masculinity in a process which
promoted sexual renunication and spiritualization.

The original reads: "Und wenn irgend eine, so war Anna dazu
geschaffen, seinem Hang zur Verspieltheit und zur Nachl&auml;ssigkeit
entgegenzuwirken, ihn zu zielbewu&szlig;ter und erwerbbringender
T&auml;tigitkeit anzuhalten."

The original reads: "'Mutter,' murmelte er, und noch einmal: 'Mutter:
. . . meinte aber zu seiner eigenen Verwunderung nicht mehr die
l&auml;ngst Begrabene, die ihn geboren; jener andern galt das Wort,
die noch nicht Mutter war and die es in weningen Monaten werden sollte
. . . eines Kindes Mutter, von dem er der Vater war. Und nun klang
das Wort pl&ouml;tzlich, als t&ouml;nte etwas nie Geh&ouml;rtes, nie
Verstandenes, als schw&auml;ngen geheimnisvoll singende Glocken in
Zukunftsferneit.'"

The original reads: "Und es war ihm, wie in s&uuml;&szlig;dumpfem Traum,

hineinschauen zu k&ouml;nnen . . . tief hinein, in alle, in die von
Schurken und ehrlichen Leuten, in die von Frauen und M&auml;nnern und
Kindern, in die von Heiden, Juden, Protestanten, ja selbst in die von
Katholiken, Adeligen und Deutschen."

One could see the fictional relationship between these two types
of artists as Schnitzler's attempt to work through the dichotomy of
modernist art constructed by his friend Hugo von Hoffmansthal in an essay
published in 1893: "Today two things seem to be modern; the analysis of
life and the flight from life. . . . One engages in the anatomy of one's
own psychic life or one dreams. Reflection or fantasy, mirror-image or
dream-image." (Hugo von Hoffmansthal, <I>Gesammelte Werke</I>, vol. 1
<I>Prosa</I> [Stockholm: Bermann-Fischer Verlag, 1956], 149).

The original reads: "'Aber lieber Freund, das Verstehn hilft ja
gar nichts. Das Verstehen ist ein Sport wie ein anderer. Ein sehr
vornehmer Sport und ein sehr kostspieliger. Man kann seine ganze Seele
darauf verschwenden und als ein armer Teufel dastehen. Aber mit undern
Gef&uuml;hlen hat das Verstehen nicht das allergeringste zu tun--beinahe
so wening wie mit unsern Handlungen. Es sch&uuml;tzt uns nicht vor
Leid, nicht vor Ekel, nicht vor Vernichtung. Es f&uuml;hrt gar nirgends
hin. Es ist eine Sackgasse gewisserma&szlig;en. Das Verstehen bedeutet
immer ein Ende.'"

<a NAME="FOOT36" HREF="#REF36">36</A>.
The original reads: "Wenigen, gar wenigen war die ungeheure, innere
Bereitschaft gegeben, jede Erfahurung als neu und einzig zu empfinden--die
Kraft es zu ertragen, da&szlig; in jedem Augenblick gleichsam in einer
neuen Welt st&uuml;nden. Und doch: nur dem, der den feigen Drang
&uuml;berwinde, alle Erlebnisse in Worte einzuengen, dem zeige das
Leben--das vielf&auml;ltig-eine, das wunderbare, sich in seiner wahren
Gestalt."

description of the biographical materials reworked in the novel can be

Robert Musil, <I>Die Verwirrungen des Z&ouml;glings T&ouml;rle&szlig;</I>

als Charakter oder Seele, Linie oder Klangfarbe eines Menschen f&uuml;hlt,
jedenfalls dasjenige, wogegen die Gedanken, Entschl&uuml;sse und
Handlungen wenig bezeichnend, zuf&auml;llig und auswechselbar erscheinen
. . . dieser letzte, unbewegliche Hintergrund." My translations, here
and subsequently, often depart from but are constructed in consultation
with the standard translation by Eithne Wilkens and Ernst Kaiser, "Young
T&ouml;rless," now most readily available in <I>Robert Musil: Selected
Writings,</I> ed. Burton Pike (New York: Continuum, 1995), 1-175; here 10.

The original reads: "als einen steinernen Zwang, der sein ganzes Leben

diesem einen schmalen Streifen, der sich durch den Staub zog, einfing
und zusammenpre&szlig;te."

Musil's description of unconscious and conscious dimensions of psychic
structure and the role of sexual desire in articulating this structure
has provoked an extensive literature on both the possible influence of
Freud on Musil and on analogies between Freudian theories and Musilian
constructs. My own focus on problems of identity formation involving the
relationship between masculinity, autonomy, and narration is not, as far
as I know, discussed in this literature. A summary of the debate and a
discussion of Musil's constructions of sexual desire from the Lacanian
perspective can be found in Andrew Webber, "Sense and Sensuality in
Musil's <I>Toerless</I>," <I>German Life and Letters</I> 41 :
106-30.

Freud's judgments on the heresies of Adler and Jung are contained in the
last section of his "Zur Geschichte der psychoanalytischen Bewegung",
84-123. Musil later saw his construction of cultural types of Beineberg
and Reiting as prophetic anticipations of the political mass leaders of
the 1920s and 1930s.

A masterful analysis of the historical conditions of Musil's intellectual
project can be found in David S. Luft, <I>Robert Musil and the Crisis
of European Culture, 1880-1942</I> (Berkeley: University of California
Press, 1980).
