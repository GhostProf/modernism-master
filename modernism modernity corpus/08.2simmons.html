In January 1914 Arthur Roe&szlig;ler's article "Women and Art" appeared
in the <I>Stickerei-Zeitung und Spitzen Revue,</I> a journal devoted
to textile art in Germany and Austria. While the embroidery of Emmy
Zweybr&uuml;ck (<A HREF="8.2simmons_1.html"> 1</A>), a leading
textile artist in Vienna, was ostensibly his subject, Roe&szlig;ler
used the opportunity to secure women's creative activities firmly
within <I>Nadelkunst</I> and the domestic sphere. He concluded that her
embroideries deserve more praise than any "square meter of painted canvas
that any woman aspiring to 'high' art places on view."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  Stating that the best women's painting could only be an inadequate
  reflection of a male model, he argued that female talents lay instead
  in decoration, creations that were part of women's being, only
  hinting at an unknowable mystery beneath the ornamented surface. This
  characterization of ornament's superficiality contrasts with those
  artistic values he praised in the work of young male expressionist
  painters who were "able to turn the interior of people inside out"
  during the same period.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  Artists such as Egon Schiele defined an approach to painting that
  surpassed nature and became the apex of human achievement. Roe&szlig;ler
  suggested that these artists recovered art's high calling, which
  had been lost through a recent preoccupation with applied art: "They
  want to move away from applied art, which Klimt approached happily and
  frequently, sometimes even at the cost of the psychological achievement
  of an aesthetic creation. All works for them are true works of new art,
  are storage batteries of psychological forces."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The contrast between ornament and psychological expression, between
surface and depth, used by art critics of the

<B></B>
<B>[Begin Page 247]</B>

period to characterize the stylistic shift from Gustav Klimt's
aestheticism to Schiele's expressionism, continues to be of use for
thinking about Viennese modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
  The discursive interplay between ornamentalism and asceticism yields
  insights about gender's role in the divide between these attitudes
  towards form.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  Studies of the writings of Karl Kraus and Adolf Loos show how their
  work contributed to a critique of ornament grounded, in part, in
  responses to women's changing roles in the public sphere.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  Fashion's expansion stimulated new perceptions about women's increasing
  participation in the modern world. These perceptions provoked male
  anxieties about fashion's impact on culture and the arts at the same
  time as female artists in Vienna began to organize and assert their
  presence in both the fine and applied arts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Roe&szlig;ler's celebrations of a new textile art and a new painting were
intertwined, both being part of an effort to draw gender distinctions
in a world where boundaries were becoming blurred. Too little critical
attention has been afforded the emergence of an artistic style,
linked to folk art and characterized by terms such as "primitive" and
"expressionist," within the Wiener Werkst&auml;tte between 1905 and
1908. Women artists played a role at least equal to that of men in the
development of this style, since its impetus came from textiles and it
was quickly applied to Vienna's emerging fashion industry. The discourse
surrounding that ornamental style infiltrated discussions about the art
produced by women. Young male artists, such as Kokoschka and Schiele,
had early ties to this initial "primitive" style and its application to
fashion, but distanced themselves during 1909 and 1910 by developing a
competing discourse about interiority that found expression primarily
in their treatment of skin.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ornament, the focus of many debates about historical styles during the
nineteenth century in Vienna, continued to be an important issue during
the years before World War I. Otto Wagner had questioned the suitability
of using historical architectural ornament to dress contemporary buildings
during the 1890s, calling for a "raiment of modernity" equally effective
in expressing both the structural and symbolic character of the new
architecture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  Similar desires for a modern style within painting and sculpture led
  to the formation of the Vienna Secession in 1897, whose frequent
  exhibitions gave the new artistic movement a significant public
  forum. Appointments of Secession members to teaching positions in the
  School of Applied Arts and the creation of the Wiener Werkst&auml;tte
  in 1903 signaled that the battle to replace historical ornament with a
  modern style in Vienna had been won and efforts to extend its influence
  and reap the financial rewards of international trade were well under
  way. Writing in <I>Die Flache,</I> a luxurious new journal devoted to
  ornament, Joseph August Lux claimed that "[t]he growing understanding of
  decorative form and color is the result of the Viennese School. People,
  who have been accustomed for decades to obtain their models from Paris,
  already today demand the 'Viennese Style.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  This style initially mixed a study of nature and artistic materials,
  typical of other currents of "art nouveau," with elements selected
  from the ancient cultures of Greece and Byzantium. Between 1905 and
  1908, however, decorative elements from the folk cultures within
  Austria-Hungary became decisive elements of the style. Exhibitions at
  the Museum of Art and Industry had

<B></B>

drawn attention to folk art during the 1880s, leading to the founding of
the Association of Austrian Folklore in 1894. The Association envisioned
the study of folk art as an important contribution to the creation of
an Austrian political identity based on cosmopolitan multiculturalism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  Built on ideas advanced by Crown Prince Rudolph in the 1880s, this
  political ideal hoped to demonstrate the benevolently unifying role that
  the state could play vis &agrave; vis the multitude of nationalities
  that made up the Empire.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Two events contributed significantly to folk art's impact on modern
Viennese ornamental style--the Exhibition of Austrian Domestic Crafts
and Folk Art of 1905 and the Imperial Jubilee Procession of 1908. The
Museum of Art and Industry spent ten years organizing the exhibition,
which ran from November 1905 to February 1906 and assembled over 4,000
examples of popular handicraft. An extensive catalogue contained essays
describing regional traditions of costume and art. Looking at the province
of Bukowina on the Empire's distant eastern border, the catalogue provided
a telling description of clothing decoration:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Nature, with its infinite riches of leaves, flowers and blooms, birds,
beetles, butterflies, and small animals, which we find more or less
stylized in embroideries or weavings, offers the subjects, some of them
copied from old embroideries that mother and grandmother completed
sometime before, however, others also newly created from individual
feelings. The seven or eight year old girl, who is already trusted with
the care of geese and sheep in the pasture, sits there, linen and needle
in hand, embroidering without model or pattern.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ludwig Hevesi, a supporter of the Secession, wrote that he found "dialects
of the pure language" in the exhibition catalogue and praised the colors
"at the disposal of these primitives: the peasant wives of Czechoslovakia,
Ruthenia, Rumania, Croatia. . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The exhibition's examples of folk costume and ornament were useful
in designing the Imperial Jubilee Procession. Held on 12 June 1908 to
mark the sixtieth anniversary of Emperor Franz Joseph I's reign, the
procession was witnessed by upwards of 500,000 citizens and tourists. It
was divided into one section composed of a series of groups, costumed by
prominent Viennese artists, representing historical periods of Hapsburg
rule, and another in which the Empire's diverse cultures, resplendent
in their traditional costumes, paraded before the public.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  The latter was a great hit with Lux, who contrasted it to the historical
  section by describing the costume parade as being

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
no longer history, no longer mere masquerade, but folk art, which still in
large part at least serves life. A peasant woman with her grand finery,
laces, embroideries, metal jewelry, stands there like an inimitable work
of art, in a colorfulness like a small peasant garden. . . . We must be
thankful for this experience. It was a beauty that one can experience
nowhere but in Austria.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like other supporters of the modern Viennese style, however, Lux took
particular pleasure in one group in the historical section. Bertold
L&ouml;ffler designed Group XIII to represent a harvest festival during
the reign of Joseph II (1765-1790). L&ouml;ffler, who

<B></B>

had been appointed to teach a master class for decorative painting and
graphic art at the School of Applied Arts in Fall 1907, involved his
students in the design of the costumes and paraphernalia. Although well
researched, the costumes were seen anew with modern eyes and commentaries
remarked on similarities to the Secession's aesthetic. L&ouml;ffler and
his students, many of whom acted the parts of eighteenth-century peasants
in the parade, created an idyllic vision of folk art under a benevolent
and enlightened monarch. Group XIII reified the ideological construct
of the Jubilee Procession--an optimistic vision of a multicultural
nation under the beneficent stewardship of Emperor Franz Joseph. Costume
designs done by L&ouml;ffler and his students for the procession were
later printed in the series of Wiener Werkst&auml;tte postcards.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Taken together, the exhibition and procession encouraged a shift of
style from "tectonic simplicity" to "elaborate, dense surface decoration"
within the Wiener Werkst&auml;tte.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
  Folk pottery certainly influenced Wiener Keramik, the ceramics firm
  that L&ouml;ffler and Michael Powolny formed in 1905 that produced
  the colorful tiles proclaiming the new stylistic direction at the
  Cabaret Fledermaus. Folk textiles, however, had the greatest impact
  on the Werkst&auml;tte's new decorative style, a point made by Paul
  Westheim in response to an exhibition of Hungarian textiles:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
These works of the people are the root for a good part of all the
textiles and graphics of the young artists in Vienna. The surface
patterns of Margold, Wimmer, Zainer, etc. can be traced back without
difficulty to such stimuli from Bosnia. Only this folk art was stripped
of its na&iuml;vet&eacute;, of the original liveliness, the entirety
pervaded by a shot of fashionable sensuality, cultivated perversity,
the unbroken colors sacrificed to a feminine, elegant, perfumed sense
of color and finished with that gracefulness that pleases the delicate
nerves of Europa.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The artists Westheim mentions are men, but he describes their style in
fully feminine terms. Emmanual Margold and Eduard Josef Wimmer-Wisgrill
did, in fact, work closely with the large numbers of women who sought
careers in the applied arts after the turn of the century. Graduates of
the School of Applied Arts, the Art School for Women and Girls, and the
Royal Art Embroidery Schools responded enthusiastically to folk art and
helped define the new ornamental style.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Zweybr&uuml;ck, who had studied with Joseph Hoffmann and Franz Cizek, was
only one of many who joined the Wiener Werkst&auml;tte, regularly showed
embroideries at the Museum of Art and Industry's exhibitions, formed
co-operatives to advance sales, and became known outside Austria-Hungary.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
  Using thread and cloth produced by modern industry, their artistic
  imaginations and highly-skilled hands sought to invest the objects
  they produced with older as well as newer values. While remaining
  within the modern fashion system, artists and consumers were drawn
  to the values of community and social reproduction that folk art
  embodied. The popularity of the printed silks, beaded bags, and
  embroidered blouses and shawls that they created contributed to the
  opening of the Wiener Werkst&auml;tte fashion department in March
  1911, headed by Wimmer-Wisgrill. Women were the majority of designers
  and assistants. Through the course of the century's second decade,
  it became the Werkst&auml;tte's most economically

<B></B>

successful and well-known unit; its products were celebrated at the 1914
Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne and in exhibitions devoted to Viennese
fashion in Berlin.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="2" HREF="8.2simmons_2.html">

Wimmer-Wisgrill designed the interior of the Werkst&auml;tte's room in
the Austrian pavilion at the exhibition in Cologne, covering an entire
lower wall with a grid of fashion illustrations. Over the next year,
a series of fashion illustrations was published in twelve porfolios of
twelve prints each as <I>Mode Wien 1914/15.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
  Female artists produced 111 of the 144 original prints, while the
  inclusion of seven prints by Dagobert Peche rendered him the best
  represented male artist.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
  His hand-colored linoleum cut (<A
  HREF="8.2simmons_2.html"> 2</A>), which appeared in the first
  portfolio, emphasized the block printed fabrics that had developed
  from folk textiles and become one of the Werkst&auml;tte's most popular
  products before World War I. The dress's fabric is covered with large
  clusters of flowers and leaves, a vegetative motif that extends to the
  re's frame which includes branches of laurel. Similar leaves sprout
  from the model's head, her fingers resemble tendrils, and branches
  grow from the dress's sleeves, motifs that recall the myth of Apollo
  and Daphne.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The mythic suggestion of Peche's image differs from representations of
fashionable women in the prints by other artists, such as by Maria Likarz
or Lotte Calm, which depict modern scenes of athletic competition and
shopping. Since Peche became the artist most closely associated with
the Werkst&auml;tte's ornamental style during the 1910s and 1920s,
his repeated use of Daphne's image bears investigation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
  His most likely source was Ovid's <I>Metamorphoses,</I> wherein Apollo,
  the heroic warrior-diety, is struck by Cupid's golden arrow and falls
  in love with Daphne, a beautiful daughter of the river god Peneus and
  Gaea, the Earth goddess.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
  His love rejected by the chaste nymph, Apollo turns into a hound
  inflamed by passion and chases after Daphne to rape her. She escapes by
  praying to her father, who causes her to metamorphose into a laurel
  tree: "Her hair was changed to leaves, her arms to branches. Her
  feet, but now so swift, grew fast into sluggish roots, and her
  head was now but a tree's top. Her gleaming beauty alone remained"
  (<I>MAD</I> 35). Embracing and kissing the laurel tree, Apollo then
  proclaims, "Since you cannot be my bride, you shall at least be my
  tree. . . . My hair, my lyre, my quiver shall always be entwined with
  you, O laurel. With you shall Roman generals wreathe their heads, when
  shouts of joy shall acclaim their triumph, and long processions climb
  the Capitol" (<I>MAD</I> 41). In designs, sculpture, drawings, and
  five letters written in 1915-6, Peche treated this metamorphosis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
  His repeated association of the female body with vegetative life unites
  women, nature, and ornament, in some cases even inscribing leaves and
  flowers on drawn female nudes as if they were tattooed on the skin.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
  Such images came to embody the Viennese culture of fashion and the
  discursive association of ornament and femininity during the 1910s.

Klimt's portraits of members of the Werkst&auml;tte's
clientele, as in his painting of Eugenie Primavesi (<A
HREF="8.2simmons_3.html"> 3</A>), captures well the culture
inspired by the Werkst&auml;tte's fashion department. Eugenie and her
husband Otto, who came from a prominent Moravian family of bankers
and industrialists, were among the most active customers and even
acquired a 30 percent interest in the company when it underwent economic
reorganization in 1914. In 1913 Josef Hoffmann began designing their
country villa near

<B></B>
<B>[Begin Page 252]</B>

Winkelsdorf in Czechoslovakia. Constructed of logs on a rubble stone
socle and capped by a thickly thatched roof, the villa utilized materials
of local vernacular architecture. Its plan and loggia with gigantic oak
columns, however, were Palladian; and the inclusion of a water turbine
to generate electricity, tennis courts, and swimming pool made the villa
an exemplary modern building in folk style.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
  The interiors were richly painted with Moravian folk motifs, while the
  wallpapers, curtains, and upholstery were hand-printed designs from the
  Wiener Werkst&auml;tte. Visiting guests were provided with loose gowns
  to wear during their stay, each selecting from a stock of garments
  sewn from variously patterned Werkst&auml;tte silk fabrics. Eugenie
  is clothed in such a gown in Klimt's portrait, its colorful pattern
  spilling into the painting's field. The villa and painting embody what
  the initial enthusiasm for folk art had become in the hands of Wiener
  Werkst&auml;tte artists and patrons by the 1910s.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The fashion department had an audience far beyond such wealthy
patrons. Over 70,000 visitors attended a fashion exhibition in Vienna
that opened on 16 December 1915 and focused primarily on the Wiener
Werkst&auml;tte.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
  Max Eisler believed that this exhibition confirmed fashion's special
  character in Vienna, its emphasis on unique artistry both in the
  dresses' forms and in details such as hand embroidery. These qualities
  linked it, he said, to the Werkst&auml;tte's previous applied art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
  The exhibition also prompted ten female artists within the fashion
  department to create a portfolio of twenty colored linoleum cuts
  entitled <I>Life of a Lady</I> which emphasized fashion's role in
  modern life by following a fashionable woman from hat shop to bath to
  the sales rooms of the Austrian Werkbund. Such images strengthened the
  perception, already expressed by Westheim, that Viennese ornament and
  applied arts were intensely feminine.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="4" HREF="8.2simmons_4.html">

This perception was so strong that when Johanna Meier-Michel
designed a poster to advertise "Art of the Woman" (<A
HREF="8.2simmons_4.html"> 4</A>) for the first exhibition of
paintings and sculptures organized by the Association of Austrian Female
Visual Artists, her image referred to the bright stylized flowers of
the new graphic design and embroidery rather than the "fine arts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
  The exhibition's 315 works constituted the first major survey of both
  past women artists and contemporary production in Europe. Visitors were
  numerous and sales strong at this and the group's second exhibition,
  indications of women's growing participation in the world of visual
  culture. Martha Hofrichter's cover for the second catalogue, an image
  of female wooden dolls with painted aprons simulating embroidery,
  added children to the exhibition's frame of reference.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
  Indeed, children's art was closely linked with folk art, a fact made
  clear by the following comment about the children's art room at the
  1908 Kunstschau--"Primitive folk art, lamented by many as lost, blooms
  here ever anew."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
  Contemporary embroideries, described as "expressionist orgies of color,"
  were seen as being equally primitive in feeling.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
  Helene Funke's painting <I>Hungarian Girl</I> (<A
  HREF="8.2simmons_5.html"> 5</A>), shown at the association's
  1911 exhibition, joined youth, femaleness, and folk embroidery in a
  single work which one critic termed "ghastly Van Goghism" connected
  with the new trends of Neoprimitivism and Expressionism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
  Roe&szlig;ler declared Funke to be one of the exhibition's stronger
  painters, but added that such painting by a woman was always second-hand
  creation. Young male artists, such as Kokoschka and Schiele, were in
  his estimation redefining painting as a creative

<B></B>
<B>[Begin Page 254]</B>

activity surpassing nature. But women were excluded from this level of
achievement, because, he concluded, "as long as art arises from stress
and compulsion, which are specific to a male spirit and disposition,"
fine art would remain "'a necessary product of male particularism,'
the effort for universal synthesis."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>

Roe&szlig;ler's comment about Kokoschka's and Schiele's efforts to
distance themselves from applied art was an observation about their
origins. Kokoschka first came to public attention as a student in
L&ouml;ffler's class at the School of Applied Arts where he participated
in graphic design projects for the Wiener Werkst&auml;tte. <I>Dancer in
a Meadow</I> (<A HREF="8.2simmons_6.html"> 6</A>), one of his
postcard designs from fall 1907 anticipated L&ouml;ffler's contributions
to the Jubilee Procession.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
  The girl's beflowered, wide-brimmed straw hat and her skirt trimmed
  with lace and embroidery are similar to the idyllic peasant world
  evoked by L&ouml;ffler's group's designs.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
  While other of Kokoschka's postcards represent aspects of the new
  textile arts, three large cartoons called <I>Bearers of Dreams</I>
  (one major project shown at the 1908 Kunstschau) were designed to be
  executed as textiles. Several sources suggest that he considered the
  cartoons to be studies toward six embroidered panels or tapestries
  for the Palais Stoclet's ladies' sitting room. In the end, however,
  these designs, described as "having the character of naive folk art,"
  were replaced by Carl Czeschka's wall decorations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While Kokoschka's early work was related to the new decorative style,
when his cartoons and children's book called <I>Dreaming Boys</I>--both
published by the Wiener Werkst&auml;tte--were shown at the 1908
Kunstschau, their highly personal psychological characters were quickly
remarked.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
  Unlike those whose books were based on existing fairy-tales and stories,
  illustrated by Secession members, and published by Martin Gerlach in
  a series for children, Kokoschka composed his own text and produced
  images better described as evocative than illustrative. Max Mell,
  whom Kokoschka consulted about the book, noted its chaotic quality
  and described it as a serious artistic probing of puberty. About the
  isolated adolescent girl and boy in the final plate, he wrote, "Between
  these poles of puberty, the holy lack of desire and the lust for life,
  lie anxiety, horrible secrecy, lust for adventure, the idyllic."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
  In his autobiography, Kokoschka refers to the book as his first love
  letter to Lilith, a young Swede who had already disappeared from his
  life when the book appeared.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
  But Li, the girl associated with "the bird-woods of the north" in the
  story, was, in fact, Lilith Lang, a sixteen-year-old Austrian student
  at the School of Applied Arts (<I>DjK</I> 260). She appears in the
  story after the narrator, growing aware of his sexuality and approaching
  adulthood, dreams of adventures in exotic worlds, of becoming a werewolf
  who invades the sites and bodies of conventional society. While the
  narrator dances "the desires of the sexes" in a garden, Li steps
  "from the festoons of vermilion flowers and sulfurous yellow stars."

After the relationship cools, the story ends with a reflection about
his changed state: "I was a stumbler / when I discovered my flesh /

Kokoschka's letters to Erwin Lang, Lilith's brother, express his
bitterness over the relationship's breakup during the winter of
1907-8 (<I>OKL</I> 16). Speculation about this breakup and its impact
is difficult, but it seems likely that a marriage proposal coupled with
intense possessiveness might have been resisted by a young woman with
close connections to the feminist movement in Austria.

  Li's association with embroidery and lace in the story is related to
  the narrator's ability to see her as no one else could, his revelation
  of her form and character understood as a demonstration of love
  and entitlement to her. This passage recalls Kokoschka's sketches
  of Lang's naked body in angular poses and in motion, drawings that
  contributed to the book's final plate and were probably shown at the
  1908 Kunstschau. These drawings are arguably his first works that
  focus on psychological expression, a direction that Mell encouraged,
  urging him to consider the "noble task" of portraiture, "to uncover
  the essence of a person's face" ("CK" 252).

During 1908 and 1909, after meeting Karl Kraus and Adolf Loos, Kokoschka
began to distance himself from the production of applied art. Loos,
impressed by his pieces in the 1908 Kunstschau, recalled that

This clarity formed as part of a development of ideas eventually expressed
in "Ornament and Crime," a lecture of 1910.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
  Ideas that originated in his writings at the turn of the century became
  publicity-seeking polemic as he condemned the Jubilee Procession for
  its display of ornament, calling its participants "tribes" of a pagan
  past who made manifest the Empire's backwardness. America and England,
  where efficient and economical functionalism dictated the abandonment
  of ornament, were his models of modernity, while Papuans with tattooed
  faces and elaborately ornamented articles of daily use represented
  modernism's Other. Drawing from the writings of Cesare Lombroso and
  various ethnographers, Loos rendered the tattoo a topos of everything
  uncivilized and backward, an embodiment of erotic and violent origins
  that modern society was compelled to suppress. In this, he revived
  a trope employed previously in an 1898 essay on women's fashion in
  which he declared, "The lower the culture, the more apparent the
  ornament. Ornament is something that must be overcome. The

<B></B>

Papuan and the criminal ornament their skin. . . . But the bicycle
and the steam engine are free of ornament. The march of civilization
systematically liberates object after object from ornamentation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
  The article decried fashion as outdated ornament that bore witness
  to women's subjugated condition. While men had largely abandoned
  ornamental dress in the nineteenth century, Loos asserted that women's
  fashion began to change rapidly as more novelty became necessary to
  arouse desire in men and draw them into the marriages that give women
  social status.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This article, as well as others by Loos, extolled the functionality
and quality of English men's clothing, opposing that restrained and
seemingly timeless style both to current Parisian fashion and efforts
by artists to reform fashion. Rather than dress becoming expressive
of individuality, he believed that modern individuals should adopt
a neutral mask to protect the self. He addressed his ideas to the
"aristocrats of the spirit" who would allow "the Slovak farmer's wife
who embroiders her lace" to continue to derive pleasure from her work,
for she knew no better culture. Yet judging from his own interiors, such
an aristocrat could nevertheless enjoy a quality Persian carpet in his
modern apartment. In light of this seeming contradiction Loos concludes
that "he who goes to listen to the Ninth Symphony and who then sits down
to draw up a wallpaper pattern, is either a rogue or a degenerate."

His use of ornament certainly changed with his increased contact with
Loos, as is demonstrated by an analysis of the mother and child motif
that he obsessively drew during 1908-9. While some fantastic scenes
do employ heavy gestural marks across the paper's surface deriving
from van Gogh's reed pen drawings, others are studies from models. The
res' embroidered garments in several drawings seem worn, like the
bodies of their wearers, peasants drawn away from their rural past and
proletarianized by the modern city. Simultaneously, however, another
type of ornament, the tattoo, began to fascinate Kokoschka.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
  Speaking of his initial preference for the Museum of Natural History
  over the Museum of Art History, he claimed he could grasp the import of
  "a Polynesian mask with its incised tattooing . . . at once, because
  I could feel my own facial nerves reacting to cold and hunger in the
  same way," but concludes that "For all my sympathy with primitive art,
  it would not have occurred to me to imitate it. I was not a savage. I
  would have had to live like them for my imitation to be genuine"
  (<I>ML</I> 19-20). Yet a connection of such material to his art
  was noted by several critics at the time, as when one described the sea
  and cliffs represented in <I>The Bearers of Dreams</I> as looking as if
  they were "tattooed with strange plants and animals" ("CK" 250). Another
  described <I>Warrior</I> (<A HREF="8.2simmons_7.html">6</A>,

Zealand fetish."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
  Indeed Kokoschka would have been familiar with the Museum of Natural
  History's rich collection of Oceanic art, including numerous Polynesian
  masks.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
  However, human skulls, overmodelled with clay to restore facial forms
  and then painted with decorative patterns, were also an important
  component of the collection. An extensive group of these had been
  collected by the Mission House St. Gabriel and Dr. Rudolf P&ouml;ch
  from the Sepik River area of Papua-New Guinea.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
  Dr. P&ouml;ch lectured about his expedition and the objects collected
  after they were given to the museum in 1907.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
  He stressed that Papuans believed that the head was rich in <I>mana</I>
  (spirit), and this was why skulls taken in warfare and those of
  important clan members were preserved. The taking of the first head
  was an important step in a boy's rise to manhood, for skulls were
  tokens of bravery and transmitted power to the victorious warrior.

Kokokschka's <I>Warrior</I> was likely inspired by such material. Its
unfired clay surface is heavily worked, with raised and incised lines
tinted blue and red suggesting the coursing of blood beneath the skin. The
eyes, with blue irises, framed by the socket's

<B></B>

reddish ochre surface, appear frozen in an eternal stare. The mouth
gapes like a wound below. Supported on a long neck and tilted slightly
upwards as if in awe or startled reaction, the head resembles a type
of overmodeled skull (<A HREF="8.2simmons_8.html"> 8</A>) often
mounted atop a woven basket mask, called the big-<I>Abwan.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
  These skulls, overmodeled to make the face long and thin with a
  huge nose, also rise as if on a long neck above the basket's body,
  which conceals the wearer's torso and head. Painted patterns swirl
  across the face's surface and help to emphasize the eyes, nostrils,
  and mouth. Kokoschka appears to have imitated the abstract patterns
  in indices of skin wrinkles, blood vessels, and nerves. While the form
  was converted to a more naturalistic Western idiom, he clearly hoped to
  retain a sense of ritual and myth. Many years later, in the context of
  a story about the horrors of World War I, he reacted with anger when
  a lover showed him the death mask of her former husband. "It may be
  that this," he wrote,

was why from very ancient times people have modeled the faces of their
dead--to keep death away. Perhaps it began with painting the chief's dead
face with red ochre, the color of life. Later they covered the skull
with gold leaf, which was more resistant to the passage of time. There
was the mask of Agamemnon from the tomb at Mycenae.

In the same story he also discusses his own fascination with prehistoric
skulls found in natural history museums. He attributed the holes that
are often bored in them to early man's practice of headhunting to gain
nourishment from the brain of his victim, explaining that the practice's
cessation was an important step in "man's evolution from a cannibal to
a paterfamilias" (<I>SR</I> 35). But for modern man, Kokoschka claims,
"the terror has crawled away down into our subconscious. It is in
the unconscious realm that we work off our bad conscience, like our
pussy-cat decently covering up her excrement in the sand-box provided"
(ibid.). With the title <I>Warrior,</I> Kokoschka sought to associate
his self-portrait with the terrors of combat and rituals that instilled
and maintained gendered power differences.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
  Through his effort to turn ancient ornament into blood vessels and
  nerves, he simultaneously declares his modernity and critiques fine
  art's emphasis on an intense interior life, a quality that many critics
  maintained was lacking in contemporary, woman-centered ornament and
  applied art.

The exhibition of <I>Warrior</I> under a glass cover at the Kunstschau
imbued it with an exotic otherness, leading critics to invoke the
ethnographic museum and Paul Gauguin in their responses to it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>

  Since European longing for escape had been constructed first by Daniel
  Defoe's <I>Robinson Crusoe</I> , it is perhaps not surprising
  that during 1908-9 Kokoschka undertook a set of illustrations
  for that novel. When they were exhibited at the 1909 Kunstschau,
  Ludwig Erik Tesar, an art critic who had previously published a German
  translation of the novel, responded enthusiastically,

it's real illustration, not the type that chatters tactlessly about the
story, but the type that picks out and emphasizes crucial sentences and
words, actions and feelings. The personal note of the illustrator lies
in the selection of significant passages, his greatness in the artistic
independence with which he strengthens the poetic through a corresponding
artistic symbolism.

Comparisons with previous illustrations for Crusoe confirm the originality
of Kokoschka's approach and suggest why Karl Kraus felt compelled to
advertise--without success--for publication funds in the pages of
<I>Die Fackel.</I> While a contemporary study of the novel's place
in the history of children's literature recommended its aesthetic and
pedagogical value as a counter to the sensationalism and sensuality of
pulp adventure stories, one doubts that the author would have found the
same values in Kokoschka's illustrations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
  Gratuitous violence, a quality that educational reformers decried
  in colportage literature and films of the period, seems to break
  out, for instance, in Kokoschka's <I>Man Running Amok</I> (<A
  HREF="8.2simmons_9.html"> 9</A>). The drawing depicts an
  episode in Madagascar after Crusoe was rescued from the Caribbean
  island where he had been marooned while sailing to Africa to buy slaves
  for his Brazilian plantation. After a sailor raped a native girl,
  the natives attacked the trading party, killing some and forcing the
  remainder back to ship. A group of sailors, against Crusoe's advice,
  then armed themselves for reprisal and proceeded to torch all the huts
  and slaughter over 150 inhabitants. Crusoe, however, recounts that he
  mastered his rage and refrained from

<B></B>

slaughter, and it is, perhaps, his silhouette at lower right, a passive
spectator before the blazing spectacle of something like a cinema
screen. Tattoos on his arm indicate the murderous sailor: amidst traces
of veins are an anchor, pierced heart, and the initials O. K. and L. L.,
which effectively insert Kokoschka's failed relationship with Lilith Lang
into the image. The motifs are typical of sailors' tattoos, while the
use of initials points to the practice's rebirth in European culture
when sailors on James Cook's voyages had their initials tattooed on
their arms in Polynesia.

Polynesian tattoos may have played some role in Kokoschka's thinking about
the costumes and drawings for his play <I>Murderer, Hope of Women.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
  The graphic marks demand attention in his image of "Man"
  subduing "Woman," whose "graphic spontaneity may be read

<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
  The marks originate in observation of anatomy and drapery, but clearly
  exceed that representational code to become signs in themselves. As
  seen in a drawing from Augustin Kr&auml;mer's

<B></B>

1902 study of Samoan culture (<A
HREF="8.2simmons_1.html"> 11</A>), tattoos often had a mimetic
relationship not only to surface anatomy, but revealed the interior on
the skin surface. But these relationships were exceeded by development
of meanings within the cultural system of marking. While Kokoschka's
marks do evoke "nerve lines, muscles and tendons," as he says, they are
also loaded with meanings related to the discourses about the tattoo
in 'primitive' cultures. The initials O. K. on the murderous sailor's
arm--like his shaved head--also secure an identification with European
sub-groups such as imprisoned criminals, an interest that is also briefly
visible in his drawings for <I>Der Sturm</I> during 1910 of circus and
variety performers, who are also tattooed.

Egon Schiele, although educated at the Academy of Fine Art rather than
the School of Applied Art, began his career with a close relationship
to the Wiener Werkst&auml;tte. A group of four early works, including
<I>Portrait of a Woman with Black Hat</I> (<I>Gertrude Schiele</I>)
(<A HREF="8.2simmons_2.html"> 12</A>), that he exhibited at the
1909 Kunstschau were strongly influenced by Klimt's decorative portraits
of women.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
  Klimt personally invited his participation in the 1909 Kunstschau
  and, at the end of the year, secured a position for him in the Wiener
  Werkst&auml;tte where he briefly designed men's and women's fashions
  as well as

<B></B>

postcards that treated the theme of fashion.
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
  Schiele's sister Melanie, who designed many of her own clothes, supplied
  the hat and ermine neck wrap worn by their sister Gertrude in the 1909
  portrait, along with the decorative coverlet that she holds in her
  hands. The portrait's background, like Schiele's other early works,
  was originally executed in metallic paint in an effort cheaply to
  emulate Klimt's application of gold and silver leaf to his paintings'
  surfaces. However, at some point he painted this background over with
  white paint, lending greater emphasis to the re's psychological
  presence. The image of a young woman fashionably dressed for the
  street, seeming to show a decoratively patterned fabric to the viewer,
  nevertheless remains strongly related to the Werkst&auml;tte--an
  observation reinforced by the fact that Schiele subsequently obtained
  a modeling job for Gertrude in the Werkst&auml;tte's fashion department.

SRC="button/8.2simmons_3b.gif"></A>

It was thus predominantly issues of fashion and clothing (rather than
ornamental pattern and Polynesian tattooing as with Kokoschka) that
helped to frame Schiele's preoccupation with issues of interiority during
1909-11. The sole exception from that period is found in a re
study of a dancer who partnered with Erwin Osen, a painter friend of
Schiele's. Why she assumed the stage name "Moa"--also the name of New
Zealand's large, extinct, flightless bird--is unknown, but her thick
mane of black hair certainly resembled that of Polynesian women in
photographs taken for anthropological and colonialist texts. A painting
on paper of Moa from 1911 (<A HREF="8.2simmons_3.html"> 13</A>)
demonstrates how Schiele's re studies revolve around the tension
between clothing and body. If a nude is defined as an idealized set of
artistic conventions--harmonious pose, adjusted proportions, excision of
body hair and imperfections, lack of clothes constructed as a "natural"
state--then Schiele's res are better described as naked. This was a
recognition on his part akin to J. C. Fl&uuml;gel's observation in 1930
that "Clothes, though seemingly mere extraneous appendages, have entered
into the very core of our existence

<B></B>

 as social beings," and further "of all the motives for the wearing
 of clothes, those connected with the sexual life have an altogether
 predominant position."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One of the most interesting aspects relating Schiele's work to fashion
is its role in increasing sexual allusion in fashion illustration. In
the initial Wiener Werkst&auml;tte fashion postcards of 1911 Mela
K&ouml;hler stylized fashion's forms, but the illustration remained
essentially functional, concerned with showing the dress well in an
environment that lent appropriate prestige.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
  Otto Lendecke had learned a similar approach through his work for Paul
  Poiret in Paris, but a drawing done in Vienna around 1912 evidences
  a new quality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
  The re strikes a pose of sexual solicitation against a void in
  order to highlight the slits in the blue overdress. It is difficult to
  explain other than as a response to Schiele's works, which were known
  in the fashion department since Wimmer-Wisgrill had become one of the
  artist's collectors.
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
  In many of Schiele's works similar poses are struck which also
  stretch to the field's edge. Raised elbow and revealed axillar hair in
  Lendecke's drawing suggest the exposed pubes in Schiele's explicitly
  erotic drawings, the trajectory of both images pointing to the future
  sexual dance of fashion photography that Michelangelo Antonioni staged
  so memorably in the English film <I>Blow Up</I> .

Clothing's role in social construction and its motivation in sexual
expression are seen not only in Schiele's studies of women and himself,
but also in those of the painter Max Oppenheimer. Between 1908 and 1911
Oppenheimer moved his work in a direction similar to that of Kokoschka
and Schiele; his anti-ornamental sentiment is reflected in a statement
made to Roe&szlig;ler that "The decorative is the most primitive form
of painterly expression. It will always be the hobby horse of those who
enjoy ordinary coarse sensations and are unable to have a feeling for
anything but the 'applied.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
  Roe&szlig;ler's description of Oppenheimer's appearance as making
  "him stand out at the first glance with his somewhat idiosyncratic
  but always distinguished clothing" could also be applied to other
  writers and artists--like Kokoschka and Schiele--who were turning from
  aestheticism to asceticism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
  Recognizing that their life and art needed to be on display in the
  contemporary art world, but striving to deny any relationship to that
  world's commerce, they cultivated an overall look of aristocratic
  elegance touched with subtly unique detail.
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
  The result is seen in a drawing by Schiele (<A
  HREF="8.2simmons_4.html"> 14</A>) in which Oppenheimer seems
  simultaneously to retreat and reveal himself through the cut of his
  black suit. The relationship of dress to the male subject's sexuality
  is suggested by the placement of his hands, an issue also raised by
  a drawing in <I>Die Muskete</I> that satirized a self-portrait shown
  by Oppenheimer in the 1908 Kunstschau. It represents him in a men's
  room and is captioned: "It is requested to arrange one's clothing
  before leaving."
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
  The drawing in the satire magazine likely pointed to his homosexuality
  through his clothing, an issue also raised by Schiele's drawings
  of him. These show him lying, both prone and supine, on a bed
  with his legs extending toward the viewer. In the first case,
  the foreshortening leads the eye to the buttocks, in the second
  (<A HREF="8.2simmons_5.html"> 15</A>) to the groin which is
  indicated by his hand, a gesture made telling by the model's languid
  face which returns the gaze.
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
  The hand and face attract the eye by their colors, because the
  chalk outlines of Oppenheimer's suit remain unfilled. The touches
  of watercolor run the spectrum from green to red and seem to reveal
  both the surface of the skin and a condition beneath it, an effect
  seen most vividly in the re's right hand where only the bones are
  picked out by the brush.

While Schiele's approach to re drawing undoubtedly derived in
large part from August Rodin, he challenged one convention of the
nude--inviolate skin--that Rodin had retained. Clothing would often
become the immaterial, unexamined surface that skin had once been,
as in a self-portrait (<A HREF="8.2simmons_6.html"> 16</A>)
once owned by Wimmer-Wisgrill where the paper is untouched within the
contours of the shirt's vest, while the arms are glimpsed through the
transparent sleeves. Short hairs growing from the neck's nape declare the
body's life and primacy over social conventions such as clothing. Oil's
viscosity adds to this quality in <I>Portrait of Dr. Erwin Graff</I> (<A
HREF="8.2simmons_7.html"> 17</A>), a gynecologist who permitted
Schiele to draw his patients at the Vienna Medical School. Graff's skin's
imperfect materiality, suggested particularly through the bandaged
finger, stands at odds with the antiseptic white of his scrubs. This
materiality in Schiele's and Kokoschka's works always gives access to
an interiority ultimately alone and moving towards death, as indicated
in the following lines written by Roe&szlig;ler about the skin of paint
in Kokoschka's portraits: "He smears it like ointment and lets it cake
into a scab and heal

<B></B>
<B>[Begin Page 269]</B>

into scar tissue. . . . He paints their mite infested skin, their
ulcerating flesh, which stews in inner heat, is worn down by debauchery,
eaten away by sickness."

Alfred Gell, in his study of Polynesian tattooing, considers skin's
cross-cultural role as symbolic form. While some societies, such as
those in Polynesia, have viewed the skin as an appropriate support and
vehicle for expression of social relations, others, including most in
modern Europe, have developed prohibitions on the skin's marking.
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
  Individuals in the New Guinean highlands may view body decoration as
  a means to display their true selves' links to ancestors and cultural

  self, the interior one, remained hidden from public view by the skin.

  In the final lines of "Ornament and Crime" Loos expressed that
  "Primitive men had to differentiate themselves by various colors,
  modern man needs his clothes as a mask. His individuality is so strong
  that it can no longer be expressed in terms of items of clothing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>
  This emphasis on a rich interior existence grew from an altered concept
  of childhood that had developed in Europe during the eighteenth century
  and coalesced in Freud's theory of the unconscious.
<SUP><a NAME="REF76" HREF="#FOOT76">76</a></SUP>
  Psychic identity came to be experienced as an inner space rooted in
  childhood's lost history. This conceptual framework helps to link
  the Viennese expressionists' extraordinary focus on children to their
  equally unusual effort to convey unseen psychic life. The depiction of
  skin's material condition, like the use of expressive dance movements
  and auratic emanations, provided a means to allude to a hidden condition
  that originated in the separations and conflicts of childhood.

Schiele's <I>The Birth of Genius</I> (<A
HREF="8.2simmons_8.html"> 18</A>), a painting of 1911 since
destroyed, imagined and reenacted an infant's severance from its initial
fused state with the mother's body. A startled face looks out from a
transparent womb, the infant's hand tests the space of culture that his
skin now meets without mediation. The motif, according to Roe&szlig;ler,
had its origin in December 1910 when he, in response to Schiele's
complaints about his own mother, suggested that the artist execute a
series on the theme of motherhood.
<SUP><a NAME="REF77" HREF="#FOOT77">77</a></SUP>
  Schiele was immediately drawn to the idea of a dead mother and painted
  an initial version that he presented as a gift to Roe&szlig;ler
  on Christmas Eve 1910. In the first version he clearly wanted to
  encourage contemplation of the painting's relationship to traditional
  representations of mother and child in genre and religious painting,
  for the heads incline toward each other, suggesting that the infant
  is enclosed by a blanket and both are asleep. Only the mother's
  ashen color challenges this interpretation and, upon reflection,
  forces the realization that this is a view into the womb, eliciting
  shock in response to the macabre transformation of the theme. In the
  second version, however, the mother's head and hand are more clearly
  cadaverous and the tender touching of heads was removed, changes that
  brutally call attention to the severings of parturition and the later
  individuation of consciousness.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Roe&szlig;ler located the work's impetus solely in Schiele's personal
history, never mentioning a possible relationship to the paintings on
view at the December 1910 <I>The Art of the Woman</I> exhibition. Julie
Johnson has shown how the exhibition's organizers deliberately "selected
works which would represent aspects of domestic femininity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF78" HREF="#FOOT78">78</a></SUP>

<B></B>

Images of motives and children were plentiful, perhaps to reaffirm
traditional female roles to a public who could have been disturbed by
the exhibition's bold assertion of women's presence in the history and
current practice of visual arts. In his review of that exhibition,
Roe&szlig;ler stressed that woman's natural role was that of mother
rather than of painter or sculptor.
<SUP><a NAME="REF79" HREF="#FOOT79">79</a></SUP>
  He continued to espouse this view in his article about Zweybr&uuml;ck,
  arguing that women were more suited to those arts that allowed them
  to remain a riddle, singing, dancing, and decorating. This was woman's
  natural role, because, as he explained,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Each man was only wholly inside woman's being once, as an unborn child;
but in his later life he retains only an uncertain, dream-like memory
about that internalized existence. And precisely because of that, because
woman by her mere existence alone already has a strong impact, man values
her as an artist only if it is a matter of a particularly feminine art.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Roe&szlig;ler valued Zweybr&uuml;ck principally as a craftswoman,
for embroidery had been construed as a highly gendered art since the
nineteenth century. This conformed to textile's gendered status in
European folk cultures where cloth was an important means of social
reproduction. Celebratory gifts of textiles bound groups together and
the transmission of techniques connected women to both their ancestors
and progeny, encouraging the analogizing of textile production with
human reproduction.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It was exactly such feminized ties that Schiele denied in his painting. In
a letter written to his mother two years after <I>The Birth of Genius,</I>
he made an extraordinary claim that says much about his understanding
of the artist's imagination and psychological state. "This is the great
separation," he told her:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Without doubt I will be the greatest, the most beautiful, the most
valuable, the purest, and the most precious fruit--through my independent
will all beautiful and noble results are united in me--this also, no
doubt, because of the man. I will be the fruit which after its decay
will still leave behind eternal life: therefore how great must be your
joy--to have borne me?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This imagined separation involved much more than personal psychological
history. It was, in effect, one of expressionism's myths of origin,
a fantasy about the relative values of fine and applied art, about
painting's eternal life as opposed to textile's decay. Through such
myths, male expressionist artists struggled to separate themselves from
the growing presence of women in the Viennese art world as well as the
discourse about ornament and fashion that accompanied women's expanding
roles in the public sphere.

Kokoschka's design for the Jubilee's poster also shows an imaginative
dimension quite different from other artists involved with the
festival. The flag bearer's beard and the waving of palm fronds recall
images from the ancient Near East, such as the reliefs of captured
nationalities bearing tribute to Assyrian kings at Nimrud and Nippur. The
trance-like poses and references to ancient despotism are at odds with
L&ouml;ffler's medieval pageantry in his poster and eighteenth-century
idyllicism in his costume designs.
