Introduction: Eliot, Modernism, and the Nineties
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
One of the ongoing concerns of Eliot studies, at least since the 1980s, has been to explore the increasingly apparent "disparity," to quote Colleen Lamos, between the literary progenitors that Eliot acknowledged and the res in Decadent England and America (principally Walter Pater, Charles Swinburne, Oscar Wilde, and Walt Whitman) whose influence he passively or actively "suppressed."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Nearly a hundred years after Eliot's emergence as a poet, we are only beginning to reconstitute his temperamental and intellectual connections with the generation that shaped his earliest verse. 
</p>

<p>
Readers have turned most recently to examining the sexual politics underlying Eliot's reluctance to speak about his Decadent heritage, but not always in a way that does justice to the complex relations between life and art. Take the striking story of Eliot's secondary residence starting in 1923 in Burleigh Mansions on Charing Cross Road. According to Virgina Woolf, Clive Bell, and the Sitwells, Eliot took to wearing green face powder during private parties in the rooms&#x02014;according to Osbert Sitwell, face powder "the colour of forced lily-of-the-valley."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Since the color green was a common emblem of the aesthetic movement&#x02014;as for instance in Oscar Wilde's subtitle ("A Study in Green") to his sketch of the Pater-like author Wainewright in the essay "Pen, Pencil and Poison"&#x02014;Eliot's makeup would seem to signify some kind of willful effort to identify himself with the culture of the nineties.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  But must we conclude with Carole Seymour-Jones in her recent biography of Vivien Eliot that the powder was in fact 

<b></b>

a statement of Eliot's sexual preference and that the Burleigh House pied-&#x000E0;-terre was a venue for homosexual assignations&#x02014;"the hub of [Eliot's] secret life"?<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Seymour-Jones, after all, offers no evidence beyond the face powder, and Peter Ackroyd, who first discovered Sitwell's memoir, argues that the powder was merely a gesture of solidarity with Eliot's artist friends. ("It is significant that the only people who noticed his make-up, and probably the only ones in whose company he wore it, were writers and artists . . . wearing face powder made him look more modern, more interesting, a poet rather than a bank official."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> ) 
</p>

<p>
The public/private valence of Eliot's gesture, furthermore, is as unclear as its symbolism. Did Eliot intend the face powder as a public statement? Or, given the short-lived and private nature of the evenings, did it represent a half-censored rebellion against his own social reserve? The latter is more likely, as is the possibility that Eliot's relations to the 1890s were less a matter of conscious strategy&#x02014;a willingness to "traffic in . . . homoerotic rhetoric in a private context [but] not a public forum"&#x02014;than the expression of a genuine and unresolved personal conflict.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Since the 1980s, though, literary and cultural historians have glossed Eliot's relation to the 1890s by explicating his elaborately constructed prose style, with its plainspoken display of rational control, as the calculated censorship of a foresworn emotional expressivity. First Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar in 1988 explained Eliot's exaggerated rationality as a way of resisting the growing influence of literary women at the turn of the twentieth century. More recently, Cassandra Laity, Colleen Lamos, Ann Ardis, and others have contextualized it as a response to what Richard Dellamora has called the "crisis of sexual identity and male privilege" that started in the generation of Pater.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Most of this criticism assumes, in Ann Ardis's words, that Eliot evaded identification with the 1890s by a "deliberate erasure" , and Ardis herself specifies that Eliot's criticism deliberately transformed gendered discussions of self and poetry into a "highly abstract ration" of literary genealogy .
</p>

<p>
This promising work, I think, needs to be qualified in several respects. As I have argued elsewhere, while it seems reasonable to argue that modernist poetics represents a gendered reaction to post-symbolism's emphasis on the poetry of the body, one should recognize that the definitive move in that reaction took the form not, as Ardis suggests, of a public turn against Decadent softness in art and life, but of the echoing consequences of imagism's instinctive and fundamental redefinition of rhythm and image as expressions of thought.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  More pertinently here I would add that by overemphasizing Eliot's deliberate suppression of the 1890s, we blur not only the complexity of his response but the way the prose of the English Decadents also deployed masculine markers to hedge the issue of gender, and thus we further exaggerate the break between the Decadent and the modernist generations. In this perspective, Eliot's style only sustains his predecessor's ambivalence. In his own criticism, Wilde frequently employs the rhetoric of manliness to criticize literary Decadence, as he does in "The Rise of Historical Criticism," an essay steeped in the authority of reason and science. There Wilde dissociates himself specifically from "that refined effeminacy, that overstrained gracefulness of attitude" that infects "the sphere of history" in Euripides and 

<b></b>

Swinburne<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  and praises Polybius by noting that "perhaps there is no passage in the whole of ancient and modern history which breathes such a manly and splendid spirit of rationalism" as Polybius's remarks on the decay of population (<i>CW,</i> 1226). 
</p>

<p>
Is it possible that by overstating and then discounting the modernists' conscious dissociation from their predecessors, we may now in a strange way actually be replicating the modernist myth of a break from the 1890s rather than clarifying their genuinely conflicted relations with aestheticism? Eliot's residual emotional ties to the 1890s, I argue in part four of this essay, continued to be a source of discomfort and distress well into the years of his fame and maturity, and his account of the chasm between himself and Wilde's generation was a central instance of that distress.
</p>

Eliot and Wilde?
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
I begin by reexamining Eliot's relation to Oscar Wilde, whom Eliot specifically acknowledged as the leading re of English Decadence. Without diminishing the temperamental differences between Eliot and Wilde or disregarding the differences between their attitudes toward nature, morality, and religion, I want to call attention to ways in which Eliot derived some of his most famous pronouncements from Wilde. I then wish to explore several insufficiently interrogated accounts in which Eliot fixed the origins of his own literary genealogy in the moment of Wilde's disappearance from the literary scene.
</p>

<p>
How much did Oscar Wilde mean to the young Eliot? Wilde was not, we may safely say, one of those "dead authors" with whom Eliot openly acknowledged a "profound kinship, or rather . . . a peculiar personal intimacy." ("The usefulness of such a passion is various. . . . We may not be great lovers; but if we had a genuine affair with a real poet of any degree we have acquired a monitor to avert us when we are not in love. . . . We do not imitate, we are changed; and our work is the work of the changed man; we have not borrowed, we have been quickened, and we become bearers of a tradition."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup> ) Nor was he the kind of technical innovator who answers to Eliot's comment that besides the debts of "capital importance one has other debts, innumerable debts, to poets, of another kind. There are poets who have been at the back of one's mind, or perhaps consciously there, when one has had some particular problem to settle, for which something they have written suggests the method."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Or are these things so very clear after all? It now seems difficult to read Eliot's just quoted remarks about art, love, and even "tradition" without noticing their Wildean erotics and their equally Wildean delight in paradox. Nor, as the work of Christopher Ricks, Ronald Schuchard, and Richard Shusterman has shown, can one completely dismiss the likelihood that, before his life-changing encounter with Jules Laforgue, Wilde and the 1890s had already impressed an indelible mark on the shaping of Eliot's early poetic self. 
</p>

<p>
Certainly, Eliot as a young man was familiar with Wilde's work. A letter from his mother lists Wilde's "[The Ballad of] Reading Gaol" as one of the books he carefully stored away when he left St. Louis, and his own letter to Scofield Thayer recalls their 

<b></b>

time at Oxford together, when Thayer lived in Magdalen (Wilde's college) and affected Wilde's manners.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  The latter reminds us of how recently  Wilde had left Oxford and how strong his shadow yet remained. Eliot, on his part, reminds Thayer of the latter's reputation as a "connoisseur of puberty and lilies" and recalls the bond between them by quoting by heart from Wilde's <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>: "'To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul!'"<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Nor, though Eliot once described <i>Dorian Gray</i> as perhaps "perfect rubbish," was his ability to produce a passage of the book from memory out of character.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Annotating Eliot's poetic notebook, "Inventions of the March Hare," Christopher Ricks points to more than a dozen recollections of Wilde in Eliot's early verse, including five to the "Ballad of Reading Gaol" and eight to <i>Dorian Gray,</i> with many of the latter falling in crucial moments either in the excised "Pervigilium" section of "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" or in the equally important early poem "The Love Song of St. Sebastian."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  The most striking resemblance may be to this passage from chapter seven of <i>Dorian Gray,</i> which resonates through a half-dozen of Eliot's major early poems, above all in "Prufrock" and "Prufrock's Pervigilium": 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

He remembered wandering through dimly-lit streets, past gaunt black-shadowed archways and evil-looking houses. Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after him. Drunkards had reeled by cursing, and chattering to themselves like monstrous apes. He had seen grotesque children huddled upon doorsteps, and heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The sum of these poetic recollections point to Wilde as an important source for the strain of psycho-sexual-spiritual distress in Eliot's published and unpublished early verse. Referring to the 1890s more generally, Ronald Schuchard goes farther and contends that the 1890s' "admixture of religious and sexual emotion" represents Eliot's real <i>point de depart</i> and that Eliot later covered his links with the 1890s by stressing affinities with Baudelaire rather than with the English followers of Baudelaire he read as a young man. The impact of Wilde and his circle on Eliot, Schuchard holds, was therefore "more substantive than aesthetic;" his "deepest emotional affinity was with the English poets" and he shared their "morbid fascination with the conflicts of desire and beatitude, body and soul, flesh and Absolute." Little wonder, he continues, that Eliot later affirmed that the poets of the 1890s are "'nearer to us than the intervening generation . . . the fact that they were interested in Baudelaire indicates [our genuine] community.'"<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> 
</p>

Wilde and Eliot's Poetics
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
It is true, of course, that Eliot's poetic recollections of the 1890s do not always concern Wilde, and that in his poetry he may have turned more frequently to other English Decadents, especially Swinburne and Lionel Johnson. When we examine to Eliot's critical prose though, Wilde's significance seems preeminent. Eliot's borrowings here extend well beyond his early aestheticist stress on poetry "as poetry and not 

<b></b>

another thing" and crucially include an emphasis on the poet's self-conscious modernity; a deliberate and provocative turn away from emotional sincerity and its allied notions of the natural and the real; the championing of impersonality and poetic artifice; and a notion of tradition that while apparently highlighting literary continuity in fact strongly stresses poetic revolution.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Eliot read Wilde's essays carefully and expressed his admiration on a number of occasions. In the course of lectures he gave on Victorian literature for the London County Council for the fall of 1917 he devoted a full lecture to the aestheticism of Pater and Wilde and during that year he conducted tutorials for the same authority on "Modern English Literature" that included a major section on "The 'Nineties.'" The latter featured Wilde as the first among equals, required that the students read his critical essays in <i>Intentions</i> as well as <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i> and <i>The Ballad of Reading Gaol</i>, and recommended for supplementary reading Arthur Ransome's intelligent <i>Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study,</i> which had been published just five years before.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Then, in a 1922 essay discussed at length below, Eliot went as far as to write that the "best of Wilde" was to be found in the critical volume <i>Intentions.</i><sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Still later, in his teaching notes for English 26 ("Contemporary English Literature, 1890 to the Present Time"), which Eliot taught to undergraduates at Harvard in the Spring of 1933 (and for which he likely elaborated his 1917 lecture notes), Eliot made recurrent (though not always complimentary) reference to Wilde, calling him in the first lecture the "<i>chef d'&#x000E9;cole</i>" of the 1890s, and in lecture 4 praising the "Wilde group" for reacting against Victorian association of art with social causes and moral teaching. (Intriguingly, Eliot either suppressed or never produced the notes for a scheduled lecture that would have covered the aesthetic movement. His Harvard notes indicate but do not include a lecture 3 between lecture 2's discussion of Kipling and lecture 4's treatment of the Fabians in the generation that followed Wilde.)<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Given Eliot's well-documented attentions to Wilde though, it is still startling to be reminded of how many of the fundamental formulations of Eliot's poetics can be traced to <i>Intentions</i>' central essays&#x02014;"The Decay of Lying" and "The Critic as Artist." Consider the assertion so often advanced by Eliot and also Pound, that the poet first must identify what the modern age lacks and then supply it from the style of a different time or place&#x02014;the famous "historical sense," which "involves a perception, not only of the pastness of the past, but of its presence" and which "makes a writer most acutely conscious of his place in time, of his own contemporaneity" (<i>SW,</i> 49). It was the historical sense, Eliot had written the year before, that not only allows Pound's work to get "the spirit of Proven&#x000E7;al, or of Chinese, or of Anglo-Saxon, as the case may be," but to have perceived "what <i>they</i> have that <i>we</i> want;" such a sense is only obtainable by "an organised view of the whole course of European poetry from Homer."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Behind Eliot's idea ultimately stands Baudelaire's "The Painter of Modern Life," which holds that the ideal of timeless beauty has been exploded and that the artist now understands that every age must recreate beauty in a new "historical envelope." It is the first duty of the modern artist, Baudelaire contends, to identify those formal conventions that are no longer tenable and to invent new ones suitable to the age. But 

<b></b>

since this requires understanding the histories of style, it also means that art belongs not to the amateur but to the connoisseur-practitioner who can understand the "form[s] of modernity."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  In 1918 and 1919 though, Eliot did not derive these ideas directly from Baudelaire, but from Wilde, whose "The Rise of Historical Criticism" traces the rise of our "historical sense" (<i>CW,</i> 1227), and whose "The Critic as Artist" concurs with Baudelaire that the first duty of the modern artist is the critical task of defining for his own generation the form of modern beauty (the "highest criticism . . . criticises not merely the individual work of art, but Beauty itself") (<i>CW,</i> 1127). 
</p>

<p>
Eliot's praise of the poet's "historical sense" has two parts. The first involves an assertion that the artist is a critic before he is a creator. This idea forms the core of Wilde's "The Critic as Artist," which, as Lawrence Danson notes, develops it by reversing Matthew Arnold's "The Function of Criticism at the Present Time" , which had praised the critical character of his age but also lamented that modern criticism has stifled artistic creation (<i>WI,</i> 128-9). Wilde signposted his reversal when he first published the essay in the July and September 1890 issues of the <i>Nineteenth Century</i> under the pseudo-Arnoldian title, "The True Function and Value of Criticism." In the words of Wilde's mouthpiece, Gilbert, the essay argues that "Creation is always behind the age. It is Criticism that leads us." (<i>CW,</i> 1154). Gilbert then explains that "Without the critical faculty, there is no artistic creation at all worthy of the name" (<i>CW,</i> 1118) and that "the work that seems to us to be the most natural and simple . . . is always the result of the most self-consciousness" (<i>CW,</i> 1118). It is these last passages that Eliot echoes in 1924 in a pseudo-Arnoldian essay of his own, "The Function of Criticism," which replicates Wilde's argument: "Matthew Arnold . . . overlooks the capital importance of criticism in the work of creation itself;" "[no] great artist is an unconscious artist."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
The second part of Eliot's account of the artist's "historical sense" also comes from Wilde, this time from "The Rise of Historical Criticism." Wilde explains that historical discourse goes beyond underlining our differences with the past and emphasizes the method of "comparison" (<i>CW,</i> 1240) that identifies the past's contemporaneity. Wilde's essay, drawing on Hegel and resisting the tendency of nineteenth-century historicism to emphasize the past's singularity&#x02014;what Eliot calls the "pastness" of the past&#x02014;holds that the historical sense is in fact part of "that complex working towards freedom" which may be described as part of our own "revolt against authority" (<i>CW,</i> 1198). It was based on such assertions that Pound and Eliot placed historical perception at the heart of the contemporary poet's critical modernity. 
</p>

<p>
Wilde's anticipation of Eliot's modernism, moreover, runs deeper still. In Wilde's wake, Eliot challenges the two most important premises common to both Romanticism and realism&#x02014;that art must grow out of spontaneous, "natural" feeling, and that art should imitate the truth of nature around us. Tellingly, both writers in their moments of greatest seriousness engage with reality within discussions of realist literature. Regarding Wilde, Lawrence Danson usefully identifies the debate about literary realism&#x02014;and especially about the naturalist Zola&#x02014;as "the contemporary polemical context in which ["The Decay of Lying"] is to be understood," and quotes Linda Nochlin 

<b></b>

to remind us that "although the Realist refrained from moral comment in his work, his whole attitude towards art implied a moral commitment, to the values of truth, honesty, and sincerity"(<i>WI,</i> 47). Against this, Wilde's "The Decay of Lying" holds that realist art is stifling, because it bases its portraits on the Victorian's sham, outdated, and potentially suffocating notions of that "dreadful universal thing called human nature" (<i>CW,</i> 1076). Wilde's alternative to this "unimaginative realism" is an "imaginative reality" of the kind Swinburne found in Balzac's novels, which "reduces our living friends to shadows and our acquaintances to the shadows of shades"(<i>WI,</i> 55).
</p>

<p>
Wilde's comments lead inescapeably to Eliot's jazz play, <i>Sweeney Agonistes</i>, and spur Eliot's unfaltering attempts to discredit realist drama. Hence Eliot insists in his 1919 essay, "Ben Jonson," that Jonson's drama succeeds because it grows out of a poetry "of the surface"(<i>SW,</i> 105). It is "not human life" Eliot tells us, that informs Jonson's characters, "but it is energy of which human life is only another variety"(<i>SW,</i> 109). His "art of caricature" involves, therefore, "a brutality, a lack of sentiment, a polished surface, a handling of large bold designs in brilliant colours" (SW 120-1). Eliot's animus against "sentiment" here reprises Wilde's dislike of "human nature." Abhorring the lies we accept as "reality," it opposes to the realist theatre's presentation of those lies Jonson's purely imaginative and "titanic show" (<i>SW,</i> 121).
</p>

<p>
The family resemblance between Eliot and Wilde can also be discovered in their responses to the realist assumption that art imitates the truth of a nature that is to be found all around us. In the other major essay in <i>Intentions</i>, "The Decay of Lying," Wilde devotes himself to disproving this "truth" by exposing the artificiality of everything we assume to be natural. In the dialogue, Vivian famously holds that far from art imitating nature, nature imitates art. He argues, as Danson notes, that 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
What we call 'nature' is not natural, not (that is) an inescapable given of existence. Society made what society now worships as the thing which made it: Nature is no great mother who has borne us. She is our creation . . . [Therefore, when] so-called nature poses as nature&#x02014;that is, inevitable rather than imitative or social&#x02014;[it] traps us into imitating it. In quest of the natural we spend our lives imitating an imitation . . . Not only 'All bad art' but, by implication, all bad social conditions, come 'from returning to Life and Nature, and elevating them into ideals.' The liar heroically refuses to accept the inevitability of conditions that pose as natural facts: the 'beautiful untrue things' he tells are the things that have not entered our repertoire of repetitive, imitative, gestures.

<p>
This line of reasoning, starting with the apparent paradox that art is more natural than nature, would lead Eliot repeatedly to lament the death-like grip of the clich&#x000E9; of the real in contemporary letters. In one case Eliot even adopts Wilde's characteristic form, the philosophical dialogue. In a sketch entitled "Eeldrop and Appleplex" , Appleplex (modelled after Ezra Pound) explains that "the majority of mankind live on paper currency: they use terms which are merely good for so much reality, they never see actual coinage." To this Eliot, in the voice of Eeldrop, replies: "'I should go even further than that . . . The majority not only have no language to express anything save generalized man; they are for the most part unaware of themselves as anything but 

<b></b>

generalized men. They are first of all government officials, or pillars of the church, or trade unionists, or poets, or unemployed; this cataloguing is not only satisfactory to other people for practical purposes, it is sufficient to themselves for their 'life of the spirit.' Many are not quite real at any moment.'"<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Although this last citation signals that Eliot could sometimes alter Wilde's premises in fundamental ways, it suggests no irreconcilable break. Wilde's animus against the humanist mystification of uplifting sentiment is grounded in the conviction that "the only thing that one really knows about human nature is that it changes" ("The Soul of Man Under Socialism," <i>CW,</i> 1194). Less radical than Wilde, Eliot ultimately redefines the "death" and "unreality" that Wilde discovers in the Victorian's repetition of outdated imitations of life in specifically Christian terms, connecting them to a divorce from spiritual life. Nevertheless, Eliot's influential early criticism, insistently focussed on aesthetic issues, seamlessly continues Wilde's deconstruction of humanist clich&#x000E9;s. Also, albeit at lower volume, Eliot continues to appropriate the energies of paradox&#x02014;the motor of Wilde's deconstruction of the "natural" in art and life&#x02014;to erect the teasing reversals at the heart of his poetry and prose: Not only, we remember, do Eliot's core paradoxes include "creation" and "criticism" and "the present" and "the past," but also "life" and "death," "personality and impersonality," "tradition" and the "individual talent," "theft" and "originality," and so on. As in Wilde, all these oppositions target a delusion about "nature" and "reality" that distorts contemporary society and contemporary art.
</p>

<p>
This focus is perhaps easiest to see in relation to Eliot's observation on "impersonality." It is but a short step from Gilbert's denunciation in "The Critic as Artist" of "genuine feeling," from which "all bad poetry springs" (<i>CW,</i> 1148), to Eliot's more famous insistence in "Tradition and the Individual Talent" that "poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality, but an escape from personality" (<i>SW,</i> 58). In Wilde no less than in Eliot, artifice becomes a tool for discrediting the clich&#x000E9;d sentiment that society regards as "genuine" so that the form of art may recreate feeling in a more intense form. And so in his discussion of poetic theft, Eliot says that "the good poet welds his theft into a whole of feeling which is unique, utterly different from that from which it was torn" (<i>SW,</i> 125). Wilde and then Eliot emphasize stylization in poetry and drama because, apparently more artificial than "natural" speech, it is in fact less tainted by cant and more useful for strong expression. This idea founds the theory of masks propounded by poets from Wilde to W.B. Yeats to Pound to Eliot: speaking through the artifice of a mask, whether simply a second self or a voice distant in space, culture, and time, the poet cleanses himself of those clich&#x000E9;s that masquerade as true emotions and takes on a language that is strange enough to require that it be charged by its aesthetic context to mean anything at all.
</p>

<p>
A more pointed example of the same principle involves poetic theft. Eliot's provocative proclamation that "Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal" (<i>SW,</i> 125) reminds us that no less than Wilde he flaunted the way he pieced his writing together from material drawn from others. Wilde too, we remember, was notorious for his so-called

<b></b>

plagiarism. In fact, as Josephine M. Guy has shown, Wilde's most radical originality can be discovered in the way he appropriated other poets' work, especially in individual sections of <i>Intentions</i> and <i>Dorian Gray</i> and even in what appears to be his most innovative creation, <i>Salome</i>.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Working in a culture that would not countenance radical cultural or literary innovation, Guy argues, Wilde's solution was to invoke and then appropriate traditions so flagrantly that his appropriations became marks of his own originality (<i>BA,</i> 142-3). Hence, his apparently outrageous assertion that "it is only the unimaginative who ever invent . . . the true artist is known by the use he makes of what he annexes, and he annexes everything"(<i>BA,</i> 142).<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Eliot's "Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal" shocks us in the same way and for the same reasons&#x02014;because we associate poetry with a false ideal of originality, we assume that nothing that is not "original" can be poetic.

Finally, Eliot's equally paradoxical but more consequential invocation of "tradition" stems from Wildean premises and reveals itself as no less individualistic.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  To assert one's originality by arguing that innovation flows from the voices of one's predecessors has deep roots in Wilde, whose practice explains both the historical context of the assertion and the reaches of its iconoclasm. To again invoke Josephine Guy:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Pater and Morris invoked a tradition in order to disguise or deny the innovative aspects of their thinking; in this sense traditions lent authority to Pater's and Morris's idiosyncratic (and subversive) views about the nature and function of art and literature by appearing to invoke historical precedents for those views. Wilde, on the other hand, uses exactly the same stategy, but he does so in order to <i>exhibit</i> his originality: what Pater and Morris had disguised, he holds up for general inspection. Wilde claimed that in the hands of the 'true' artist all traditions were transformed into something new, and that they had authority only in so far as they 'bore the signature' of the artist who interpreted them. . . . Far from possessing a normative function, for Wilde, traditions were merely the 'suggestion' for an entirely new creation . . . traditions were nothing more than the artist's 'raw materials'; and it was the artist's unique handling of them&#x02014;the extent to which he transformed them through the exercise of his personality and therefore his style&#x02014;which was of primary interest.

The preceding brief account, constructed to bring out Eliot's Wildean foundations, serves I hope at least to suggest the point of the "Wilde" in my title. What remains is to think about how and why "the Possum," while retaining the force of Wilde's core paradoxes, replaced Wilde's provocations with a more Arnoldian style of apparently disinterested prose and obscured Wilde's part in the formation of his modernist vision. 
</p>

<p>
Richard Shusterman would have it that Eliot turned his back on Wilde for reasons of decorum and highmindedness&#x02014;that he "learned from Wilde's bitter experience that even the artist who is alienated and critical of society must make some sort of peace with society," and that he resolved not to "belie the seriousness and importance 

<b></b>

of his thought . . . by too frivolous expression" ("WE," 141). Like most of Eliot's critics, that is, Shusterman assumes that driving both was the kind of serious moral "thought" that caused Eliot to substitute moral life for sexual identity as the principal field on which he opposed nature. On the other hand, the line of what Ann Ardis identifies as the "new modernist studies" suggests that the converse may be true, and that Eliot's "thought" was the product of his policy rather than its cause. Both, however, speak of deliberate strategy and a clear generational change.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  What I have intimated above, and would now like to entertain more seriously, is the possibility that Eliot's apparent social and literary conformity with the discourse of his time marks not a break but a continuity with Wilde's own literary practice of subverting while appearing to conform to the temper of Victorian and post-Victorian Britain, in a context in which the openness of a Francophile cultural avant-garde was simply not permitted.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  I would also like to raise the question of whether Eliot's style might have been, rather than a calculated effort to efface Wildean sexual expression, a not always successful act of self-censorship.
</p>

<p>
To address these issues fully would require a nuanced psychological reading of Eliot's career based on information about his private life that is not currently available. But the beginning of a response may be deduced from three fugitive essays in which Eliot, more candidly than was his usual custom, reconsidered the significance of his own work. All three of these essays rehearse an inside history of modern literature, and all three were triggered by Eliot's uncomfortable intuition that he was, in ways that he had not yet acknowledged, connected to the other great English poet of his moment, William Butler Yeats and therefore also to the Wilde circle from which Yeats had emerged.
</p>

<p>
In 1922, soon after Yeats had published <i>The Trembling of the Veil</i>&#x02014;that section of his <i>Autobiographies</i> that concerns the 1890s&#x02014;Eliot published two short pieces that acknowledge the essential importance of Wilde and his circle to Eliot and to American modernism. Eliot's "Lettre D'Angleterre," first published in French in <i>La Nouvelle Revue Fran&#x000E7;aise</i> for March 1922 and then in English in the November 1923 <i>Vanity Fair</i> as "A Preface to Modern Literature," goes as far as to assert that "English Literature at the present time"&#x02014;a state of affairs that includes "a very small number of writers who will represent this time fifty years hence, but who are, at the moment, rather a part of the future"&#x02014;begins "about the date of the trial of Oscar Wilde" ("PML," 44). 
</p>

<p>
Eliot comments, 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The effect of [the Wilde] trial upon English literary society was fatal. Here was a small group of English people, who had succeeded in the midst of Victorian society, in acquiring a high degree of emancipation from the worst English vices; which was neither insular, nor puritanical, nor cautious; a public scandal disposed of its social leader for ever; the broken group lost all influence upon English civilization. Wilde and his circle stood for something much more important than any of the individual members: they stood for the end of a type of culture. In general, they represented urbanity, Oxford education, the tradition of good writing, cosmopolitanism; they were in contact with the continent, and some of their most important members were Irish.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup> 

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
First note here that, far from casting aspersions on the frivolity of the 1890s, Eliot associates it with some of his own highest values &#x02014; "urbanity," "culture," "civilization," "cosmopolitanism," and freedom from English "insularity" and "puritanism." Nor it seems is he damning with faint praise, holding back still grander accolades having to do with high moral seriousness, for he adds to his tribute the further comment that "the greatest merit of this group of people is, to my mind . . . a moral quality apparent in the group as a whole"&#x02014;a moral quality that Eliot defines in perhaps surprising terms ("PML," 44). The Wilde group, Eliot insists, ("serious writers" possessing "intellectual dignity") "had a curiosity, an audacity, a <i>recklessness</i> which are in violent contrast with that part of the present which I denominate as the already dead" ("PML," 44). 
</p>

<p>
Eliot's adversion to the "already dead" here is, I think, telling. Along with the phrases "intellectual dignity" and "cosmopolitanism," it attributes to Wilde and his group a critical temperament capable of dissociating the great cultural shibboleths of "Victorian society" associated with a false understanding of life in human nature and in art. Because of the loss of that critical temperament, Eliot goes on, the inevitable course of early twentieth-century cultural history, "after the collapse of the society in which Wilde was the most prominent member," was to produce a situation where "English literature is in a state of disintegration into at least three varieties of provincialism"&#x02014; English, Irish, and American &#x02014; with dire consequences for all three and for the whole of which they had once formed a part ("PML," 118). The Wilde trial, Eliot says, produced a "chasm," with the result that "the long tradition from Ben Jonson" was broken ("PML," 118). Consequently, Eliot argues, English provincial literature has collapsed into journalism, and Irish provincial literature, no longer having London as a safe "exile," has turned in on itself in the manner of Synge ("PML," 44). (Wilde's fall, Eliot says, may have in this way been momentous enough to have "led to the constitution of the Irish Free State" ("PML," 118) Meanwhile, Eliot and the live members of his generation who wish to continue the line for which "Walter Pater, in an earlier epoch, was an heir of Arnold and Ruskin, and Wilde the heir of Pater," find themselves "very much alone" ("PML" 118). 
</p>

<p>
Yet Eliot concludes that this situation, on its face utterly discouraging, has had its compensations. American literature, for example, in "the absence of any new creative effort in England," has been able to burst forth with provincial energy even though it retains a "commonplace" quality that derives from its lack of historical sense ("PML," 118). And, he implies, he, James Joyce, and Pound (the heirs because of their critical acumen and "audacity" of the lost generation of the 1890s and also the beneficiaries of the new opportunities opened to American writing by the sudden gap in live literature) have already managed to repair the break in a way that no critic in the interim generation of George Bernard Shaw and H.G. Wells could have foreseen.
</p>

<p>
Eliot extends his ruminations about the "chasm" caused by the fall of Wilde in an essay entitled "The Three Provincialities" which appeared in the Spring 1922 number of <i>Tyro.</i> "The Three Provincialities" most significantly develops Eliot's thoughts about the current place of American literature.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Still insisting on the provinciality of contemporary

<b></b>

American literature, and still holding a place for Joyce, Pound, and himself as the true heirs of Wilde's cosmopolitan exploitation of the English language, Eliot nevertheless stresses that "the advance of 'American literature' has been accelerated by the complete collapse of literary effort in England" and that, given the model of one of the "greatest and least local" American writers, "Edgar Poe," there exists at least the possibility that America may "in time develop a superior language" upon which might be elaborated "a separate American literature&#x02014;contingent, probably, upon the disappearance or sufficient degeneration of the English language in England."
</p>

<p>
Together, then, "A Preface to Modern Literature" and "The Three Provincialities" provide testimony to Eliot's sense of his own origins that is I think nowhere else available in Eliot's prose. Not only are they unequivocal about the importance of Wilde's cosmopolitan and anti-puritan "audacity" (and about the significance of his loss), they also clearly state the extent to which Eliot holds himself the descendant of Wilde's combination of seriousness and "<i>recklessness.</i>" As such, the articles serve to support the evidence supplied by Eliot's critical prose that he maintained both the substance and the subversive stance of Wilde's aesthetics, as for example in the slyly antiauthoritarian slant of his remarks on tradition. 
</p>

<p>
It is true that Eliot acknowledges in these essays in no uncertain terms the fact that the end of the Wilde group was caused by an act of social repression. Unlike Yeats, who in <i>The Trembling of the Veil</i> traces the demise of Wilde and his group primarily to the individuals themselves (sometimes suggesting moral flaws and elsewhere that they were tragically born at the wrong place in the wrong time), Eliot places the blame squarely on the "public scandal" of "the trial of Oscar Wilde." Nor are the implications of this conclusion unclear, though Eliot does not spell them out. If the task of his own generation is both to restore Wilde's cosmopolitan culture and to resist the obviously potent forces of English insularity, cautiousness, and puritanism, then the "very small number of writers" destined to accomplish this task must somehow both maintain Wilde's "recklessness" and consciously defend themselves against the powers that so recently created the "chasm" of modern literature. No less that Joyce's Stephen Daedalus in <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>, they must, Eliot implies, practice "silence, exile, and cunning."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Eliot, that is to say, by 1922 had long since imagined his career as a conscious and calculated negotiation through a "vicious," "provincial" "insular," "puritanical," and "cautious" English milieu from which genuine "emancipation" was not a real possibility. To a considerable degree, there is justice in assuming that the distance Eliot put between the 1890s and his modernist colleagues was a "deliberate" strategy. Nevertheless and most curiously, however, Eliot in the same argument expresses a continuing need to practice Wilde's audacity rather than&#x02014;as both Shusterman and Ardis would have it&#x02014;refining it out of existence. Note also the odd exaggeration in Eliot's remark that Wilde had faltered while attempting to "emancipate" himself, and compare this to Josephine Guy's revisionary insistence that Wilde did not try to escape from Victorian conventions so much as he strove to subvert them quietly from within. Wilde fell, that 

<b></b>

is, not because he had defied Victorian Britain but because his protective coloration let him down. Eliot's retrospective account, though, needs to make Wilde's rebellion even more extreme than it was. Partly, this is to distinguish it from his own. Partly, however, Eliot's exaggeration of the heroic nature of Wilde's generation seems to express a genuine longing to have been part of an "emancipated" culture that never existed&#x02014;a longing that strangely matches the survivor's guilt voiced in both essays when Eliot speaks of the opportunities opened up to American literature.
</p>

<p>
Whatever calculation there was in Eliot's response to Wilde's tragedy then, also was complicated by psychic tension. It is therefore fascinating to see Eliot elaborate this strong but ambivalent identification with Wilde and his circle in another personal testimony later in his career. I refer to a passage which calls attention to itself precisely because of an urgency that vastly exceeds its argument. It is something that Eliot wrote fourteen years after "A Preface to Modern Literature," at a time when he was already forty-three years old and was convinced the best part of his career was behind him. The occasion for his remarks was Eliot's first visit to Dublin in January 1936, in the course of which he listened to an address by the Reverend Burke-Savage on "Literature at the Irish Crossroads" and then twice addressed the English Literary Society of University College, Dublin.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Eliot's second response, entitled "Tradition and the Practice of Poetry" and only published in the 1980s, shows Eliot again attempting to formulate his place in English letters and again lingering over his relation to Yeats. In it Eliot continues to propound a notion of genuinely "modern" art based on Hegel and Baudelaire in which the "revolutionary" or "reactionary" terms of the truly modern writer are dictated by the "need of [the artist's own] time and place" ("TPP," 11). In this view, Eliot explains, though the artist as poet is not always conscious of it, "the perpetual task of poetry is to <i>make all things new.</i> Not necessarily to make new things" ("TPP," 11), and the principal means of that renewal are to be found in a literature's "new contact with an older period of itself" ("remote enough to be of use") or "by contact with a foreign literature" ("TPP," 13). It is at this point that Eliot, invoking his "own experience," adverts to his contact with the 1890s. 
</p>

<p>
Eliot's history, more than usually suave, when read carefully turns out also to be exceedingly odd. For one thing, he begins, returning to the idiom of the remarks with which I began this essay, by telescoping poetic influence with the erotics of personal intimacy. Literary history, he says, is a matter of "fertilization" by the languages of different cultures, and: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Eliot at the same time begins to describe his own encounter with the literature of another language (French Symbolist poetry) not in terms of his reading of that literature, but by a narrative of his relations with the English poets of the 1890s, who never really absorbed the French and yet somehow are allowed to remain the center of Eliot's attention: 

<b></b>

</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
I am neither a scholar nor a philosopher, and I can perhaps be most useful in these matters in sticking to my own experience. I cannot help wondering how my own verse would have developed, or whether it would have been written at all, supposing that the poets [i.e., the Irish poets] of the generation of the 'nineties had survived to my own time and had gone on developing and increasing in power. Perhaps they were men who could not have developed further, but I am making that assumption. I certainly had much more in common with them than with the English poets who survived to my own day&#x02014;there were no American poets at all. Had they survived, they might have spoken in an idiom sufficiently like my own to have made anything I had to say superfluous. They were in contact with France, and they might have exhausted the possibilities of cross-fertilization from Symbolist Poetry (as they called it) before I had a chance. What happened was that they made it possible for me to discover those poets. . . . When one reviews one's own writing, as when one reviews one's own life, how much there is that bears the appearance of mere chance! One has been dependent upon one's predecessors for what they did not do, as much as for what they did! The one poet of that period, the youngest and the greatest, who survived, was of course Yeats; and it happened that in my own formative period Yeats was in his most superficially local phase, in which I failed to appreciate him.

<p>
Especially interesting here is the personal horror that Eliot's summoning up of the 1890s arouses ("I cannot help wondering . . . whether [my own verse] <i>would have been written at all</i>"; "They might have spoken in an idiom sufficiently like my own <i>to have made anything I had to say superfluous</i>"). This is a reaction almost as pronounced as Virginia Woolf's when she reflected in 1928 that her father might have lived long enough to stifle her work: "Father's birthday. He would have been 96. 96, yes, today; &amp; could have been 96, like other people one has known; but mercifully was not. His life would have entirely ended mine. What would have happened? No writing, no books;&#x02014;inconceivable."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Eliot's remarks, though, shed light not on parental relations, but on amorous ones. And though he fixes in a similar way on the possibility of being closed down and closed off, his account enlarges Woolf's terror that "anything I had to say" might have been stifled before the fact by associating it with a very different kind of anxiety, a fear that he would have been denied a great intimacy&#x02014;the experience "of cross-fertilization"&#x02014; the way a lover is denied access to his beloved, by an older and potentially threatening suitor. (In this case the suitor is imagined as one who might have gone on "increasing in power.") 
</p>

<p>
But why attribute this menacing power, even in the past, to the poets of the 1890s and to them alone? And why weight with such a heavy charge a deprivation that had never occurred? Eliot, after all, by 1936 had carried on twenty-five years of unimpeded interchange with French verse. Surely by then he felt no real fear of a broken connection? 
</p>

<p>
Contemplating this intense and complex anxiety (mocked, to be sure&#x02014;but also confirmed&#x02014;by the comedy in Eliot's comment about "mere chance"), one has to wonder about the lurking and unnamed relation that Eliot implies had NOT been allowed&#x02014;a relation that seems to have been closed down by Eliot himself. If Eliot, that is, focuses on the 1890s when the occasion required a serious glance not at England 

<b></b>

but at France, he does so because his real deprivation seems to have been not from France (access to which he was never deprived) but from "the generation of the [English] 'nineties,'" whose presence Eliot calls up as if in a s&#x000E9;ance and then fails to substantively address.
</p>

<p>
Eliot's strongly felt but unspoken anxiety here, inherent in his strange mention of the potentially increasing power of the 1890s and in the strong inhibition that keeps him from addressing the poets of the 1890s in a concrete way, testifies to the deep and uncomfortable roots of his relations with Wilde and his circle. Such roots sink deep enough to color Eliot's argument, I would suggest, more definitively than any conscious career strategy. Though Eliot's efforts to distance himself from the 1890s are undeniable, they seem less to have stemmed from a steady resolution than to have enacted a vacillating ambivalence, for which the language of deliberation does not fully account. Part of that ambivalence undoubtedly involved a sexual component&#x02014;else why Eliot's recourse to the erotics of influence?&#x02014;but there is no need to assume that the impulse amounts to a cover-up of real-life sexual experience. If we read Eliot's desire for and guilt about his identification with the English Decadents as overdetermined and unconscious, the continuing force of that identification becomes much more interesting.

See Guy, <i>The British Avant-Garde</i>, 139, which comments on the obviously "derivative" quality of even Wilde's most innovative work, and traces, for example, Wilde's <i>Salom&#x000E9;</i> to Joris-Karl Huysman's <i>&#x000C0; Rebours</i> and Laforgue's <i>Moralit&#x000E9;s L&#x000E9;gendaires</i>, St&#x000E9;phane Mallarm&#x000E9;'s <i>H&#x000E9;rodiade</i>, Gustave Flaubert's <i>H&#x000E9;rodias</i> and Jules-&#x000C9;mile-Fr&#x000E9;d&#x000E9;ric Massenet's <i>H&#x000E9;rodiade</i>, Maeterlinck's <i>La Princesse Maleine,</i> and Victor-Marie Moreau's painting, <i>The Apparition</i>.

For a reading that argues that Eliot's invocation of tradition though inconsistent more "objective" than Wilde's, see Shusterman, 138-41.

As Josephine Guy points out in <i>The British Avant-Garde</i>, "the rejection of <i>Salom&#x000E9;</i> in Britain and its enthusiastic reception in France and Germany" testifies to "the uniqueness of the intellectual conditions for avant-garde activitity in Britain; what was an 'appropriate' form of opposition in France, was simply unacceptable in Britain." .

("PML," 44) See above, note 14. (The French version of "PML" was published as "Lettre D'Angleterre" in <i>La Nouvelle Revue Fran&#x000E7;aise</i> for March 1922, 617-24.) Shusterman ("Wilde and Eliot," 144) and Ardis (<i>Modernism and Cultural Conflict</i>, 46) make brief reference to the English version, but, neither does justice to its richness.

"Tradition and the Practice of Poetry" [hereafter abbreviated "TPP"] was only belatedly published in 1985. See A. W. Litz's transcription and annotation of the essay, first in the 1985 Southern Review and then in <i>T.S. Eliot: Essays from the Southern Review</i>, ed. James Olney (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988), 7-25. Schuchard ("The Dark Angel," 8-9) takes Eliot's remarks on the nineties in the essay at face value.
