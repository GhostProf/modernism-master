First a disclaimer of my title, itself a disclaimer. My title should have proposed&#x02014;"This is not a <i>Hollywood</i> movie." The distinction will later prove to be more important than it might initially appear. For now, it may be sufficient to state the rather obvious case that <i>Ulysses </i>possesses none of the indispensable elements of a Hollywood feature film. Its narrative captures no idiosyncratic, star-making gesture like James Cagney's shrug or Jack Nicholson's smirk, no signature trait like Bette Davis's eyes or Marilyn Monroe's shimmying walk, in which an entire screen personality seems radiantly condensed. The most <i>Ulysses</i> might offer us in the way of a quasi-cinematic moment in which character is illuminated through gesture would be Buck Mulligan's stately plump gait or Stephen Dedalus's lordly way with his ashplant. Nor does <i>Ulysses</i> abound in scenes depicting graphic, impulsive, overmastering and dauntingly athletic sex, except perhaps that which takes place off stage.
</p>

<p>
In fact I could risk an excruciating, but not facile pun and pronounce that by established conventions of Hollywood moviemaking <i>Ulysses</i> is a "reel" disappointment.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Admittedly, such standards are the least pertinent measures for gauging the extent to which <i>Ulysses</i> approximates, either in its style or form, a "cinematic" work. Still, the homonymic identity between reel and real may help us sort out the ways in which <i>Ulysses</i>'s modernism has been creditably compared to the modernism of (non-Hollywood) film. Born with the advent of modernity and its new technologies of vision, this pun on "real" recalls the points of contact and similarity between film and literature particularly in their representations of the physical world. That text is a cognate for textile and derives from the Latin <i>texere</i>, to weave, 

<b></b>

is an etymology long familiar and often invoked by literary critics. Less attention has been paid to the verbal origins of "reel" in the Greek <i>krekein</i>,to weave. Text and reel, then, formally resemble each other as <i>woven </i>artifacts<i>, </i>interlacing the real into a fabric of illusion, a ribbon of dreams<i>. </i>How much, then, does it matter that the text is woven of words, the reel of celluloid strips? Do the author and the auteur, both master weavers, have equal standing or do they wield separate authority in fashioning simulacra of reality? These questions have been asked before, but they seem to me worth returning to, especially since they have never been definitely answered. They linger as agents of unrest in the disputed territory of "the real," over which many of the fiercest aesthetic and ideological battles of modernity have been and continue to be waged.
</p>

<p>
Two pronouncements&#x02014;one dogmatic, the other legalistic&#x02014;on <i>Ulysses'</i>s artistic status illustrate the cultural reach and ideological stakes of these battles. Both link their judgment of <i>Ulysses</i> to its technological and aesthetic kinship with the visual regime of cinema. The first is Karl Radek's indictment of <i>Ulysses</i> at the 1934 Congress of Soviet Writers. Summing up the contentious debate on Joyce's "decadent" and individualist formalism, Radek called <i>Ulysses</i> "a heap of dung, teeming with worms and photographed by a motion picture camera through a microscope."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Ulysses is alleged to be the work of a myopic and fetid naturalism. Its narrative distorts reality and mishandles technologies of vision by moving, like a movie camera, from one magnified and putrid image of verminous life to another. Eisenstein defended <i>Ulysses</i> against Radek's condemnation with this brilliant, but at the time unavailing retort:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Radek's critique of Joyce was based essentially on one point. He said that we don't need things in such microscopic detail. We don't see that way, such phenomena don't exist. But that criticism is as if a person at some first-aid station saw an enlargement of something seen under the microscope on the wall and said: "Why is this necessary? After all, microbes aren't that big. After all, you don't see all that in real life." Do you understand the mistake here? The thing is that you have to study those charts in order to be able to know those invisible bacteria, those invisible elements, in order to possess them.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Eisenstein not only saw Radek's mistake, one common to fervid advocates of socialist realism, he corrected it by personally consulting&#x02014;and inducing his students to study&#x02014;the Joycean charts recording the invisible life of the capitalist West.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  We shall see in a moment how he profited from his researches into Joyce's method of making the invisible elements of our human world conspicuously visible.
</p>

<p>
For now, let us turn to another campaign mounted against <i>Ulysses&#x02014;</i>the legal action broughtagainst it in the U.S. for its alleged obscenity. The Honorable John M. Woolsey is rightly celebrated for his decision of 6 December 1933, determining that <i>Ulysses</i> could not be deemed obscene. But Woolsey should also be honored as one of the first, and certainly the shrewdest of <i>Ulysses</i>'s early readers, to note how the very technique that signaled the novel's radical modernity&#x02014;the stream of consciousness in which the inner lives of characters was rendered with a startling and often scandalous precision&#x02014;found its companionable double not in the lyric or the prose poem, where the re and impressions of the perceiving and experiencing "I" conventionally dominate, 

<b></b>

but in the art of film, the art of surfaces devoted to picturing external reality. As Woolsey reads&#x02014;or sees&#x02014;<i>Ulysses</i>:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Joyce has attempted&#x02014;it seems to me, with astonishing success&#x02014;to show how the screen of consciousness with its ever-shifting kaleidoscopic impressions carries, as it were on a plastic palimpsest, not only what is in the focus of each man's observation of the actual things about him, but also in a penumbra zone residua of past impressions, some recent and some drawn up by association from the domain of the subconscious. He shows how each of these impressions affects the life and behavior of the character which he is describing. 
<p class="blockquote">
	What he seeks is not unlike the result of a double or, if that is possible, a multiple exposure on a cinema film which would give a clear foreground with a background visible but somewhat blurred and out of focus in varying degrees.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Woolsey is writing before the invention of deep focus which will eliminate that background blur and bring the foreground and background into reciprocal focus (hence relation to each other). Nevertheless, Woolsey apprehends the way film's ability to render multiple exposures might serve as an analogue for the way impressions and thoughts are projected through the palimpsest of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
Now while these were and perhaps still are in some quarters serious issues of dispute, I am not at all interested in adjudicating whether <i>Ulysses</i> represents modern life as a verminous dung heap or as a plastic palimpsest in which dreams, memories and present impressions flit in and out of focus in a dazzling kaleidoscopic display. I am more intrigued by how the radical experimentalism of the modern novel found itself so quickly identified with the newest of the human arts. To what extent does the power of the motion picture camera to make the cinematic image appear or disappear, reduce or enlarge, approach or withdraw, resemble the multiple perspectives, the sometimes conflicting but related points of view of novelistic narration? Is montage, the cinematic succession of images, a visual analogue for the discontinuous and scrambled chronologies, typical of modern narrative, that want to dispense with the realist codes of storytelling? How far can we take the resemblance between literature's many-layered representations of human consciousness and cinema's depth of field, its power, singled out by Judge Woolsey, to superimpose, overexpose, successively repeat and abruptly erase images on a celluloid ribbon?
</p>

<p>
These questions should vex us more than they currently do. "Cinematographic form" has joined Joseph Frank's "spatial form" in the critic's lexicon for describing the narrative formations unique to modernist fiction, where it continues to rest, relatively unchallenged, on its laurels.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Occasionally a voice is raised in emphatic objection to the perceived resemblances between cinematic and literary expression. One of the most forceful and authoritative objectors was Italo Calvino, who in terse but pointed answers to questions posed by <i>Cahiers du Cinema </i>for an issue on the relation of film to the novel<i>, </i>insisted that film has closer ties to the oral tradition than to written narratives.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Calvino went on to enumerate the radical differences in the fundamental techniques of film and narrative. One defining difference for Calvino was in their use of detail: literature "ignores all the techniques that the camera uses to enlarge a detail or a face to 

<b></b>

underscore a feeling or to indicate its relation to the whole" ("FER," 1532). Moreover, film has a superior power to vary the proportions of objects and our distance to them, but primarily as syntactic means to indicate their privileged place in the succession of images. It is a syntax poor in the "affective connotations" (<i>connotations affectives</i>) in which literature, with its power to create mystery and pathos, excels. On the basis of these comparisons, Calvino's verdict is confident and uncompromising: the techniques of a genuinely "cinematic" cinema, he concludes, are not at all comparable to those of literature. In fact, the cinema and the novel "have nothing to teach and nothing to learn from each other" (<i>entre cinema et roman, il n'ya rien &#x000E0; enseigner et rien &#x000E0; apprendre</i>) ("FER," 1533).
</p>

<p>
Calvino's views are not now commonly held nor, as far as I can tell, are they especially well known. They can be faulted for ignoring the possibility that modern writers not only went to the movies, but may have been inspired by cinema to devise new techniques of visual description or narrative ordering. As critics with as different critical outlooks and methods as P. Adams Sitney, Keith Cohen and, more recently, Susan McCabe have shown, modern writers artistically responded in various and imaginatively compelling ways to the new compositional possibilities the movies offered.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Keith Williams, who has studied the relation of Joyce's literary techniques to early cinema, including his brief stint as manager of Dublin's first movie theater, the Volta, calls our attention to many of the ways in which <i>Ulysses</i> in particular reflected the emerging grammar of film. In <i>Ulysses</i>, he writes, "objects are increasingly seen to have a life of their own, from the automatic printing press Bloom watches in 'Aeolus,' to fully animated objects in 'Circe,' like the soap which rises into the sky, singing. The 'morphing' devices and space-time conjuring of <i>Ulysses'</i>s mocalyptic climax move beyond the M&#x000E9;li&#x000E8;sque possibilities of stop-motion trickery into parallels with graphic animators. Arguably, as in the case of Bloom's bodily deformations, they even anticipate today's computer-generated digital imaging."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Still, while <i>Ulysses</i> may indeed offer parallels with, and anticipations of, modern technologies of vision, it also offers evidence of the limitations of the relationship between film and novel as companionable, if not exactly sister arts. I wish, then, to take Calvino's objections to heart and snipe at the boldness with which we rhetorically cross the generic borders between film and novel like bounty hunters after quarry living openly in neighboring territory. My own rhetoric may sound somewhat hostile, but my intent is actually diplomatic: to negotiate a truce between literature and film that recognizes the rights and limits of their respective domains. Such diplomatic intent motivates Lessing when he proposed in <i>Laoco&#x000F6;n</i>, his classic treatise on the respective limits of the visual and verbal arts, that painting and poetry "should be like two just and friendly neighbors, neither of whom indeed is allowed to take unseemly liberties in the heart of the other's domain, but who exercise mutual forbearance on the borders, and effect a peaceful settlement for all the petty encroachments which circumstances may compel either to make in haste on the rights of the other."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup> 
</p>

<br /><br />

<p class="noIndent">
The temptation to encroach on neighboring territory is heightened by the historical and aesthetic fact that both modern novels and modern cinema, whether high or 

<b></b>

low, avant-garde or mainstream, aim at conditioning, or rather reconditioning, our perceptual apparatus according to the new requirements of modernity itself. Of particular importance for modern visuality in both its cinematic and literary expressions was the accelerated pace of modern life. The sheer speed with which things happen in modern society often means that visual phenomena can disappear before they can be fully registered by the eye or remarked and interpreted by our consciousness. Visually, modernism has been fascinated by the spontaneity, but also the disorienting randomness of the image, incident or event as it unfolds before an eye not yet accustomed to selecting, focusing and interpreting what it so flittingly sees. Nothing exemplifies this fascination quite like cinema, nor so opportunistically exploits it. In <i>Prater Violet</i> , Christopher Isherwood's narrator, a novelist recruited to write a scenario, discovers that it is the pace rather than the content or "look" of film that accounts for its singular beauty&#x02014;and diabolic allure:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The whole <i>beauty</i> of the film . . . is that it has a certain fixed speed. The way you see it is mechanically conditioned I mean, take a painting&#x02014;you can just glance at it, or you can stare at the left-hand top corner for half an hour. Same thing with a book. The author can't stop you from skimming it, or starting at the last chapter and reading backwards. The point is, you choose your approach. When you go into a cinema, it's different. There's the film and you have to look at it as the director wants you to look at it. He makes his points, one after another, and he allows you a certain number of seconds or minutes to grasp each one. If you miss anything, he won't repeat himself, and won't stop to explain. He can't. He's started something, and he has to go through with it . . . You see, the film is really like a sort of infernal machine.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
This experience of visual compulsion is new to modernity. However pleasurable it may be to "watch" a film, the fact that we are forced to look in a way predetermined by another is what prompted and justifies Isherwood's image of the film as an infernal machine. That a machine <i>could</i> be infernal is a romantic idea given a new application and urgency by the new technologies of vision. Film may appear uncanny in its power to compel us to look at certain things in a certain way at a predetermined speed. Watching a film unrolling at its own pace leaves us powerless to do anything but watch, close our eyes, or look or walk away&#x02014;the last three forlorn options at best. Even the director, insists Isherwood, feels compelled to go "through with" something whose motions, once the film has begun, he can no longer suspend, alter or in any way control.
</p>

<p>
Not so the novel, as Isherwood cagily suggests by italicizing the word <i>beauty</i>, thus visually calling attention to the different ways print works to catch our eye. However baleful the images depicted in or circulating through a novel, however possible, even probable it is that a lubricious narrative can succeed in corrupting its readers, the novel cannot exercise the same infernal control over consciousness that a movie can. According to this logic, a reader, unlike the moviegoer, never loses the freedom to regulate and monitor his own responses, to stop, pause, go forward or backwards across the expanse of words. The abstract "beauty" of narrative, unlike that of film, is partly an organic one; no mechanism determines the speed at which its attractions are made available to us. A reader may read at his own pace, at her own will&#x02014;she may skim or 

<b></b>

linger over passages; he may go forwards, skip ahead, go backwards, leave off in mid-sentence and resume at a time of his own liking or convenience. The advent of video and dvd recording has now made it possible to "read" a film in the same way we read a book, but this freedom is gained at the expense of enchantment.
</p>

<p>
This difference between our experience of reading a book and seeing a film may strike us as too obvious to be worth remarking, but those moderns who worked in both media thought and knew better. Director Josef von Sternberg, who acknowledged the camera as "the pen of our craft," noted that "not many . . . are able to read what is written; for the story must be read at once, unlike a book, which can be reread and studied until it is understood." Even if we modify von Sternberg's absolutism to allow that the film may be reviewed and studied, we cannot dispute his memorable aphorism for the film's refusal to heed any call to prolong or arrest the flow of its images: "The legend on the screen does not tarry."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
It is odder, then, than is often admitted that Joyce, who along with Proust and Woolf was the modern novelist most intent on creating a new narrative syntax through his experimentations with language and time, entertained the idea of making a movie out of <i>Ulysses.</i><sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> Despite his reservations about whether <i>Ulysses</i> could be filmed at all, he did not discourage Stuart Gilbert from attempting a scenario and, more seriously, talked to Sergei Eisenstein about the prospects of translating <i>Ulysses </i>into film.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> Eisenstein, whose own copy of <i>Ulysses</i> was heavily annotated and marked in the manner of a shooting script, was especially interested in the potential of the interior monologue to make cinema the first fully expressive and synesthetic art.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  This project could only be actualized, Eisenstein understood, after the advent of sound, since only sound could naturalistically extend the repertoire of filmic effects to interior monologue.
</p>

<p>
Eisenstein had initially hoped to realize his dream of translating Joycean stream of consciousness to the screen while making a Hollywood film. This is the story, for those who are not acquainted with it. When Paramount assigned Eisenstein to direct a film version of Dreiser's <i>American Tragedy</i>, Eisenstein, who had been thinking about how to translate Joyce's "inner monologue" into filmic language, saw his chance. He was particularly concerned to get "inside" the consciousness of his protagonist Clyde at the climactic moment when he is about to consummate the murder he has planned so carefully but, at the last moment, cannot execute. Rather than rely on the actor's ability to convey indecision, Eisenstein, fervent advocate of montage as both dynamic and conflictual, envisaged a treatment that would penetrate "inside" Clyde while never losing sight of the "outside" of the drama, that twisted skein of erotic and social longings that has brought Clyde to this desperate pass. Having settled on "an outer presentation" of what was passing through Clyde's mind before the fatal "accident," Eisenstein dispenses with "the whole arsenal of knitted vows, rolling eyes, hard breathing contorted postures, stony faces, or close-ups of convulsively working hands" as "inadequate for the expression of those subtleties of the inner struggle in all its nuances." This is how he broadly conceived of such a treatment: "Aurally and visually must be set down the feverish <i>race of thoughts</i>, intermittently with the outer actuality&#x02014;the boat, the girl sitting opposite him, his own actions." So it was, he explains, that "[t]he form of the 

<b></b>

inner monologue was born" ("CIT," 103). Eisenstein, of course, is aware that he is celebrating a somewhat belated birth, since he acknowledges that Joyce among others had preceded him in "abolishing the distinction between subject and object in stating the hero's re-experience in a crystallized form" ("CIT," 104). Still he maintains, with an appreciation that Lessing might applaud for the unique expressiveness of his medium, that "Even literature is powerless in this domain" ("CIT," 103).
</p>

<p>
Eisenstein then proceeds to elaborate his newborn vision of how film might render consciousness at a point of highest excitation, a point where it is most fully active in perceiving and responding to stimuli coming from both within and without. However much he admired Joyce's ability to achieve an "almost physiological palpability," he nevertheless concludes that "Even Joyce is not up to the task." Eisenstein regarded Joyce's achievement as belonging to the realm of the ultra lyrical. The ultra lyrical, according to Eisenstein, was a mode that allowed Joyce to reconstruct the most intimate passage of the inner logic of feeling. But according to Eisenstein, Joyce's physiological organization of the emotions comes at a price&#x02014;"the entire dissolution of the foundation of literary diction, the entire decomposition of the literary method itself."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  And if Eisenstein was made for anything, he was made for method. For cinematic method, for montage. Hence the creative excitement he felt in devising the montage lists for <i>An American Tragedy</i>. This is how Eisenstein describes the thought-images&#x02014;the montage lists&#x02014;he had envisaged with something like wonder:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Like thought, they would sometimes proceed with visual images. With sound. Synchronized or non-synchronized. Then as sounds. Formless. Or with sound-images: with objectively representational sounds . . .  
<p class="blockquote">
	Then suddenly, definite intellectually formulated words&#x02014;as intellectual and dispassionate as pronounced words. With a black screen, a rushing imageless visuality. 
<p class="blockquote">
	Then a passionate disconnected speech, nothing but nouns. Or nothing but verbs. Then interjections. With zigzags of aimless shapes, whirling along with these in synchronization. 
<p class="blockquote">
	Then racing visual images over complete silence. 
<p class="blockquote">
	Then linked with polyphonic sounds. Then polyphonic images, then both at once. 
<p class="blockquote">
	Then interpolated into the outer course of action, then interpolating elements of the outer action into the inner monologue.  
<p class="blockquote">
	As if presenting inside the characters the inner play, the conflict of doubts, the explosions of passion, the voice of reason, rapidly or in slow-motion, marking the differing rhythms of one and the other and, at the same time, contrasting with the almost complete absence of outer action: a feverish inner debate behind the stony mask of the face.

<p>
Eisenstein envisages here a new cinematic syntax based on the same disintegrating force he ascribes to Joyce's novelistic language of fragments: the associational, sentenceless flow of words, the private shorthand of the mind speaking to itself in a language adapted to personal use; scraps of dialogue, jingles, phrases from ads, even itinerant syllables separated from their stem-words with little hope of regaining their verbal home. But however faithfully this modern syntax is translated to the screen, it appears to us as a completely different language. Speed is the catalytic agent that 

<b></b>

transforms Joyce's stream of language into a feverish synesthetic rush in which various sounds&#x02014;audible but varying in intelligibility and articulateness&#x02014;yield to a silence scored over by images, in which a screen teeming with both representational and abstract images is suddenly overrun by the "imageless visuality" of blackness. Nothing can at once register and withstand this phantasmagoria of sound and image but the human face that, petrified by the inner sensations that threaten to disre and betray it, is converted to a stony mask.
</p>

<p>
The face as mask, reified in a close-up, is a specialty shot of cinema that approaches the iconic power of sculpture or the portrait-bust.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Eisenstein's treatment seems to call upon this resemblance in shooting the face as an immobile screen across which might flicker "all the traces of inward thought and emotion." This was the reality of human face Eisenstein sought to capture through the creative combination and juxtaposition of shots he called montage:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
How fascinating it is to listen to one's own train of thought, particularly in an excited state, in order to catch yourself looking at and listening to your mind. How you talk "to yourself" as distinct from "out of yourself." The syntax of inner speech as distinct from outer speech. The quivering inner words that correspond with the visual images. Contrasts with outer circumstances, how they work reciprocally.

<p class="noIndent">
In Eisenstein's attempt to translate the syntax of inner speech we can immediately appreciate how he differs from Dreiser in his representation of what thinking <i>is. </i>Dreiser the naturalist and Eisenstein the modernist each devised different though equally difficult ways to show people thinking&#x02014;or, more accurately, people trying to resist certain thoughts. This is how Dreiser describes Clyde as he contemplates executing his carefully considered plan to kill the pregnant girl who threatens the fulfillment of his American dream:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
He could not do a thing like that&#x02014;hit any one&#x02014;a girl&#x02014;Roberta&#x02014;and when drowning or struggling. Oh, no, no&#x02014;no such thing as that! Impossible. 
<p class="blockquote">
	He took his straw hat and went out, almost before any one heard him <i>think</i>, as who would have phrased it to himself, such horrible, terrible thoughts. He could not and would not think them from now on. He was no such person. And yet&#x02014;and yet&#x02014;these thoughts.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Dreiser's naturalism takes a sudden surreal turn when he describes Clyde's peculiar mental terror at having thoughts that he fears might actually be <i>heard</i>, as if such horrible thoughts were so potent they could dispense with speech altogether and make themselves audible to any passerby. It is almost as if Clyde is horrified that he might find himself at this "moment of action&#x02014;of crisis!" actually to be in a film by Eisenstein, his thoughts audible, their malignity visible to all.
</p>

<p>
Despite his exultation over his creative invention, Eisenstein must have known, as Siegfried Kracauer wryly noted, that the montage lists, however wonderful, "clearly exceeds the framework of the story, however generous the allowance made for it; it 

<b></b>

even exceeds Clyde's own being; what it tends to convey instead is the endless series of circumstances and sensations which close in on Clyde at this particular moment."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Such excesses did not elude the eye of the producers at Paramount, who were understandably alarmed at the treatment and referred the project to Josef von Sternberg. The latter had recently brought Heinrich Mann's <i>Blue Angel</i> to the screen and had launched the career of one of the great screen icons, Marlene Dietrich. When Dreiser sued the studio for its desecrating treatment, a sympathetic von Sternberg wished he had been called to testify on Dreiser's behalf. In his amusing and literate autobiography, <i>Fun in a Chinese Laundry</i>, he offered that "[l]iterature cannot be transferred to the screen without a loss to its values. The visual elements completely revalue the written word" (<i>FCL</i>, 259). Perhaps if he had been called as a witness, Dreiser might have won.
</p>

<p>
Von Sternberg's thoughts on translation and transvaluation brusquely but sensibly recall the difference between literary and cinematic language that Eisenstein thought might be obliterated or transcended. As we might anticipate from his defense of the outraged Dreiser, von Sternberg is a director-auteur with few illusions and very little respect for the intrinsic diction and syntax of his chosen medium as an artist:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The vocabulary of its language was explicit and fluid, but it could express only that which was given it to absorb. From the beginning, the film camera proved to be a vicious instrument, not easy to manage. It sifted ideas and converted them into moving images. Great ideas were fed into it, were filtered out avidly. The lens of the camera cannot deal with them easily and therefore disdains them. The glass eye accepted the most common and worthless ideas readily and without blinking a shutter. The motion picture camera is not easily controlled; to master it requires a thorough knowledge of its caprice, constant vigilance and disrespect for its normal appetite.

If film is an infernal machine, as Isherwood believed, then the camera is its vicious instrument.
</p>

<p>
D. H. Lawrence, so disdainful of what modern civilization regarded as "normal" appetites, was even more suspicious of the caprice of the camera and its avidity for images. In <i>A Lost Girl</i>, in which a movie theater res prominently, a keen filmgoer praises the power of film to reproduce life so instantaneously that "you <i>know</i> everything at a glance. . . . It's instruction, you take it all in at a glance, all you need to know, and it lasts you for a week. You can get to know everything about people's actual lives from the cinema."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  The camera is so efficient in ingesting life that Lawrence likens it to an "utilitarian drain" (<i>LG</i>, 151). A few pages later he continues his disconcerting critique of film, this time through the leader of a theatrical troupe, who seems reconciled to the impending extinction of her own live representations. "The pictures are cheap, and they are easy, and they cost the audience nothing, no feeling of the heart, no appreciation of the spirit, cost them nothing of these. And so they like them, and they don't like us, because they must feel the things we do from the heart, and appreciate them from the spirit. <i>They want it all through the eye, and finished&#x02014;so!</i> Just curiosity, impatient curiosity" (<i>LG</i>, 151, emphasis added). The cheapness of films is, finally, less economic than spiritual. Lawrence's objection to experiencing life "all through the eye" is that it 

<b></b>

finishes life rather than reveals it. In its exclusive appeal to the eye, film empties life of real mystery and so makes no claims on the heart or demands on the spirit.
</p>

<p>
Eisenstein had valiantly fought to subdue the "normal" appetite of the eye for startling images through the artistic and ideological discipline of montage, which he traced to the literary methods of Flaubert. He singled out the "love scene" between Emma and Rodolphe in <i>Madame Bovary</i>, which interlaces the lovers' dialogue with the banal oratory issuing from the square below their balcony, as an instance of the "cross-cutting and word-play" that constitute "montage-thought."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Joyce was one of Flaubert's heirs in the creative use of the juxtapositions and word-plays habitual to "montage-thought," nowhere more exultantly than in <i>Ulysses</i>'s introductory, blatantly parodic key&#x02014;"Stately, plump. . . ." The antinomies of classical and contemporary reality, characters, myths and diction (to name only a few of the elements) are invoked at the novel's beginning, sounding the note of contrast but also of notable, perhaps perilous juxtaposition of opposing or incompatible forms. We should also note that "Stately, plump" thoughts, like stately, plump narratives, may stroll, but never race (a favorite sight in cinema).
</p>

<p>
But to observe and appreciate the limits of this analogy between cinematic and literary uses of juxtaposition, let me isolate only one of many situations that Joyce represents by cross-cutting in and out of a character's mind&#x02014;Bloom in the streets. The streets, as Kracauer was the first to note, are a quintessential cinematic locale. Tracing a genealogy back to Baudelaire, Kracauer shows how the streets are a continuing and obsessive visual domain for cinema. They maintain, he writes, their "interest as a region where the accidental prevails over the providential and happenings in the nature of unexpected incidents are all but the rule" (<i>TF</i>, 62). The street is then the quintessential if not ideal mise-en-scene that promises to disclose the mutual fascination modern film and narrative entertain for the fortuitous, for the random, and for what Kracauer calls the "unstaged" (<i>TF</i>, 60).<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
With this is mind, let us revisit Bloom at the point early in the day when he makes one of his forays into the bustling, enticing, but also unwelcoming, often hostile streets of Dublin. I want to catch up with Bloom when he finds himself in the domain of "Lotus Eaters," trafficking in errant images that threaten to obliterate all memory of home. This is a moment, one of many during <i>Ulysses'</i>s long day, when Bloom is recalled from his inner fantasy to the real conditions of Dublin life. The culprit this time is M'Coy, a companion he will soon ditch to keep company with his own vagrant thoughts.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  While amiably conversing with M'Coy about, among other things, Dignam's funeral, Bloom's eye, and the narrative&#x02014;suddenly switches into a highly ocular mode: "Mr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door of the Grosvenor. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She stood still, waiting, until the man, husband, brother, like her, searched his pockets for change" (<i>U</i>, 60).
</p>

<p>
So far narrative indications assume the form of a shot or of narrative anecdote, one that might eventually find its way into the documentary footage of the day or into Bloom's private archive of fetishistic snapshots taken by his mind's eye in the course of a day, indeed throughout his lifetime. The nameless woman is isolated, as if within a visual 

<b></b>

frame, before the door of the hotel, flanked by a man. Is it the narrator or Bloom who poses their possible relationship as a mystery to be solved? Certainly it is a mystery, one that seems narratively to activate Bloom's voice. The "like her" is a phrase that prepares for the transfer from the featureless third person narrator to interior monologue. The ensuing proto-cinematic shot then unrolls in Bloom's distinctive voice: "Stylish kind of coat with that roll collar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth" (ibid).
</p>

<p>
Stylish is a trigger word that activates the transfer from outer picture to inner commentary. It is as if the third person narrator or sound stage manager had lapsed into a more casual prose, but the word "stylish" introduces and introjects us into Bloom's musing mind: "Careless stand of her with her hands in those patch pockets. Like that haughty creature at the polo match. Women all for caste till you touch the spot. Handsome is and handsome does. Reserved about to yield. The honorable Mrs and Brutus is an honorable man. Possess her once, take the starch out of her" (ibid). At the very point when the handsome lady seems very much about to yield, at least in the fantasy film Bloom, the rough and ready auteur, is directing in his mind, M'Coy yanks the narrative back into the domain of dear dirty Dublin, reporting to Bloom on his latest bender: "&#x02014;I was with Bob Doran in Conway's, he's on one of his periodical bends, and what do you call him Bantam Lyons. Just down there in Conways we went" (ibid). Bloom, hardly caring where M'Coy was or whom he was drinking with, immediately conflates or confuses the identities and names of M'Coy's chatty anecdote.
</p>

<p>
For a minute the narrative reels&#x02014;pun very much intended&#x02014;to reorient itself so that it may coordinate the simultaneous occurrences of Bloom's interior musing, the external verbal exchange with M'Coy and the scene he is observing. An impersonal narrative voice temporarily takes over for the distracted Bloom to report what is actually happening across the street: "She raised a gloved hand to her hair" (ibid). Then we switch immediately to M'Coy's maddening chatter, which breaks up on the threshold of Bloom's consciousness, entering the narrative in broken fragments: "In came Hoppy. Having a wet" (ibid). M'Coy apparently is still going on with his story, but what happens when Hoppy comes in to join Bob Doran and Bantam Lyons in Conways is of no real interest to Bloom, who with a fierce determination, concentrates on attending to the scene unfolding across the street.
</p>

<p>
As Bloom draws back from M'Coy to get a better view of the lady, so the narrator draws back from Bloom, in a kind of long shot, to align the narrative perspective behind and upon Bloom's rapt gaze, a gaze here maintained at the expenses of his hearing: "Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath his veiled eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the braided drums" (ibid). Having withdrawn into an ideal spectatorial space where the sun's glare highlights rather than obscures the object of visual desire, Bloom, ever the phenomenologist, notes how propitious are the atmospheric conditions for the street scene being recorded before his veiled and fascinated eyes: "Clearly I see today. Moisture about gives long sight perhaps" (ibid). This is equivalent to a zoom shot, the long sight of the camera eye, and Bloom accordingly redirects his&#x02014;and our&#x02014;attention from what is transpiring in front of him (he has established some distance from M'Coy, who apparently is standing so close to 

<b></b>

Bloom that he is later remembered only as a talking head rather than a fully embodied human form). "Talking of one thing or another. Lady's hand. Which side will she get up" (ibid). This close-up of the lady's hand generates the kind of suspense in which cinema excels&#x02014;the suspense associated with things about to happen, with the promise of impending physical motion. Bloom soon weaves a narrative out of the imminent act of the lady's departure: "Off to the country: Broadstone probably. High brown boots with laces dangling. Wellturned foot. What is he foostering over that change for? Sees me looking. Eye out for the other fellow always. Good fallback. Two strings to her bow" (ibid). Scopophilic Bloom isolates and imaginatively transres the handsome woman into a proto-cinematic icon. There is an uncanny moment when she steps out of cinematic immunity and somehow signals that she notices his gaze upon her. This is a privileged moment in cinema, when the actor returns the gaze of the camera, seems indeed to look into and through the camera to confront the eyes of the viewer himself. Something like that direct counter-gaze happens here. Here the effect is less uncanny than encouraging. Bloom seems gratified that the lady in his sights has noticed him, since it allows him to indulge the fantasy that for once he might be "the other fellow"&#x02014;that is, that he might take the part of the adulterous interloper rather than that of cuckold. Casting himself in such an emotionally compensatory role, he elaborates a novelette featuring this haughty creature in an entertaining, morally instructive drama of sexual betrayal and class revenge. "Proud rich: silk stockings" (ibid).
</p>

<p>
At this critical moment, when the film developing in Bloom's mind mutates into fetishistic cinematic spectacle, M'Coy again intrudes with remarks that yank Bloom&#x02014;and us&#x02014;back into the narrative of "outer reality." Bloom, preferring his cinematic Lotus Land, responds half-heartedly to M'Coy's outer call.
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

&#x02014;Yes, Mr Bloom said.  

<p class="blockquote">

</div>

<p class="noIndent">
But as the next line alerts us, Bloom is less preoccupied with the passing of poor Dignam than with the thought that a delectable woman will soon pass out of view: "Watch! Watch! silk flash rich stockings white Watch! A heavy tram car honking its gong slewed between" (<i>U</i>, 61).
</p>

<p>
I would like to suggest that Bloom's triple self-directive&#x02014;Watch! Watch! Watch!&#x02014; is <i>Ulysses's</i> formal invocation of the muse of cinema. The first two times it is uttered, "watch" takes the imperative form of an injunction and an invitation. Bloom is directing himself to attend to the visual spectacle displayed before his mind's eye. The third "watch" not only intensifies, but transforms the directive to look. It converts injunction and invitation into interpellation: Bloom and the reader, responding to the invitation and the command to watch, become watchers summoned into the voyeuristic regime of cinema itself. "Watch" is the cinematic imperative, summoning us to attend, bidding us to heed, inducting us into the cinematic regime of looks, gazes, and sights.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
A cinematic regime, indeed, but not yet, perhaps never to be, cinema. It is an invocation, after all, that fails to triumph over M'Coy's talking head. Moreover, the narrative seems to forewarn us of this impending disappointment. The moment Bloom instructs himself to watch, a tram car passes across his line of vision, obstructing his view: "Lost it. Curse your noisy pugnose" (ibid). As so often, Bloom tickets this ocular adventure with its mythic signature and price tag: "Paradise and the peri" (ibid). What is lost is the chance to follow this woman in a story that will unfold, if at all, off stage, off the page, off screen. What is banished is silent cinema&#x02014;those wordless pantomimes&#x02014;from the precincts of the literary real.
</p>

<p>
Still, as she drives away, Bloom's thoughts evoke the paradise of silent film as he watches the woman fade from view: "The tram passed. They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich gloved hand on the steel grip. Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her hat in the sun. Flicker, flick" (ibid). The light flickering over her "laceflare" hat in the sun recalls the flickering lights of the movie image. If Joyce does not anticipate the slang term for movies, flicks, he encapsulates the essence of the cinema as a paradise lost in that intermittence of light and vision that tantalizes us with a vision of a world familiar but barred to us. It is in this sense that cinema enacts for us the experience of being banished from paradise. As spectators we are the peri, the screen the paradise of heightened life.
</p>

<p>
In literary terms, however, this proves a salutary frustration. This is one of the many incidents recounted in <i>Ulysses</i> in which Bloom is saved from errancy, from losing himself in those fantasy projections so identified with cinema. The errancy here that concerns me is conflating or equating the literary with the cinematic, confusing the image as it takes on definition, color and life in two different mediums. Lessing insisted that the ancients understood the connection between painting and poetry, and did not draw the two arts more closely together than the good of both would warrant.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Joyce here demonstrates the intrinsic discipline of his classicism by drawing as close as he can to the limit where novel encroaches upon cinema's spectacle of attractions, without overstepping the proper bounds of his own literary domain. If the discipline is classical, the poignancy of this moment is Biblical. Through the Joycean logic of metempsychosis, Moses returns as Bloom, the voyeur who may glimpse, but never enter, the promised land of cinema, where life dances tantalizingly before us in dazzling flickers of light.
</p>

<p>
Stephen Dedalus will later claim that "banishment from the heart, from home" (<i>U</i>, 174) is the note that sounds uninterruptedly from the first of Shakespeare's plays to the last. Through Bloom, Joyce may be insinuating a more formal banishment, the peculiar penalty visited upon the author, himself half-blind, for living in the age of film. It is banishment from the realm of the full and resplendent visuality of cinema, the paradise of his mock-heroic voyeur, Bloom. Joyce's honoring of the terms by which literature may approach, but never overstep the boundary separating it from the visual paradise of cinema, may account for what Alan Spiegel memorably called the "ocular loneliness" of <i>Ulysses's</i> primary seers, Stephen and Bloom.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  But perhaps that loneliness is not the product of Joyce's aesthetic detachment, but an unavoidable consequence of his writing about the world in his (imaginary) sights.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
For literature, banishment from a paradise of images is compensated for by depth, by access to an interior where the fateful, not the fortuitous, dwells. This Proust understood, although it took him a lifetime and many thousands of pages to arrive at this recognition. At the outset of <i>Le Recherche</i>, the young narrator, struggling between states of dreaming and waking, flooded by memories and thoughts much like Eisenstein's montage lists, is overcome by "these shifting and confused gusts of memory [that] never lasted for more than a few seconds. It often happened that, in my brief spell of uncertainty as to where I was, I did not distinguish the various suppositions of which it was composed any more than, when we watch a horse running, we isolate the successive positions of its body as they appear on a bioscope (kin&#x000E9;toscope)."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Memory first comes to the narrator in the absorbing, but confusing spectacle of cinema, with all the persistence of vision that gives the enrapt eye the illusion of the physical continuity of life. When we watch a horse running or a woman standing alluringly before a doorway, we can never, by unassisted eye, isolate their successive movements. But whatever the beauty or the vision that is glimpsed, the artist's duty is to transfix as well as be transfixed by reality.
</p>

<p>
That is why Proust will later come to renounce this correspondence between memory and external vision as a false analogy and to reject any suggestion that reality is to be found in the domain of appearances. This rejection entails a rejection of cinema as a sister art. Thus in the last volume of <i>Remembrance of Things Past, The Past Recaptured,</i> he insists that what he understands as reality is not to be found in the dynamic interchange between inside (say, literature) and outside (say, the regime of cinema) but in the successive excavations that lead from surface to depth:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
A writer reasons, that is to say, he goes astray, only when he has not the strength to force himself to make impression pass through all the states which will culminate in its fixation, its expression. The reality he has to express resides, as I now began to understand, not in the superficial appearance of his subject but at a depth at which that appearance matters little, this truth being symbolized for me by that clink of a spoon against a plate, that starched stiffness of a napkin, which had been more of value to me for my spiritual renewal than innumerable conversations of a humanitarian or patriotic or internationalist or metaphysical kind. "Enough of style," had been the cry, enough of literature, let us have life!" . . . For plenty of people who lack the artistic sense, who lack, that is to say, the faculty of submitting to the reality within themselves, may yet possess the ability to expatiate upon the theory of art until the crack of doom. . . . (Some critics now like to regard the novel as a sort of procession of things upon the screen of a cinematograph. This comparison was absurd. Nothing is further from what we have really perceived than the vision that the cinematograph presents.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
"Enough of style!" may be the retort of the cinephiles who attribute to the world of appearances the abiding reality. But the retort should not be taken as the last word on the differences between what literature discloses and the vision of reality the cinema presents.
</p>

<p>
Since I began with a disclaimer about Joyce's relation to film, let me end with an anecdote that puts him right in the middle of one. In Carol Reed's <i>The Third Man</i>, 

<b></b>

the American pulp fiction writer Holly Martins is in Vienna after the war, trying to track down his old friend Harry Lime. He finds himself comically waylaid into a lecture hall where he is introduced as a literary celebrity "from the other side" who can speak authoritatively on modern post-war writing. "Do you believe in the stream of consciousness," a frighteningly earnest reader demands to know. Harry, being both a writer of pulp fiction and a re in a movie, has no idea how to answer. He fidgets, visibly sweating, awaiting his moment of deliverance. His demon interrogator persists, determined to get his money's worth of cultural enlightenment: "What is your opinion of James Joyce? Where would you put Mr Joyce? In what category would you put him in?"<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Harry is no better on Joyce than he is on stream of consciousness, so let us oblige him and answer that brutally insistent interrogator: If you must put Joyce in a category, let it be author, not auteur.

In her review of Compton Mackenzie's<i> Sylvia Scarlett</i>, which was later made into a movie starring Katherine Hepburn as Sylvia, Woolf specifically compared the differences between the characters who appear in a novel and those who appear before us on screen. Novelistic characters, she writes, "are a slow-moving race&#x02014;awkward, ungainly and simple-minded. But consider how many things we 

<b></b>

know about them, how much we guess, what scenes of beauty and romance we see them in, how much of England is their background&#x02014;without a word of description perhaps, but merely because they are themselves. We can think about them when we are no longer reading the book. But we cannot do this with Mr Mackenzie's characters; and the reason is, we fancy, that though Mr Mackenzie can see them once he can never see them twice, and, as in a cinema, one picture must follow another without stopping, for if it stopped and we had to look at it we should be bored."

Even Warner Brothers, a studio specializing in proletarian tales of urban, often gangster life, was interested in the movie rights to <i>Ulysses</i>. Joyce dismissed the suggestion that Charles Laughton play Bloom on the grounds that he was "too Aryan" and suggested George Arliss&#x02014;probably, Richard Ellmann speculates, "because he had played the Jew, Disraeli."

But I would note especially the poignant return and transration of Radek's likening of Joyce's narrative visuality to the microscope in Eisenstein's remembrance of his visit to the now nearly blind writer. He recalls hearing Joyce's own recording of "Anna Livia Plurabelle" and following "the articulated text on a giant meter-wide sheet of paper, filled with gigantic lines of gigantic letters." He then exclaims in admiration: "How in character that is with the author! How in tune with that magnifying glass with which he scans the miscroscopic convolutions of the mysteries of literary language. How symbolic of his romaning along the winding inner movement of emotion and the inner structure of internal speech!" (Eisenstein, <i>Immortal Memories</i>, 215).
