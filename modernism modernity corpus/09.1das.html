<p>
January 12, 1916 saw a very peculiar drama enacted in the trenches--two
men, who had left their girlfriends back in England, were exchanging a
ritual of kisses:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
As we arrived at the barn-door he said, "Just a moment, Frank, before we
go in I've something else to give you,--put that light out." I put the
lamp out and into my pocket, wondering what was coming. Then I felt an
arm round my neck, and the dear lad kissed me once--"that's from Evelyn"
[Cocker's fianc&eacute;e] he said; then he kissed me again and said,
"that's from your Mother." I returned his tender salute and said,
"that's from me." There we were, two men, like a couple of girls,--but
then, there was no one about, and the matter was a sacred one between
us,--<i>andyou</i>.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This is Lieutenant Frank Cocker's letter to his fianc&eacute;e Evelyn
written from the trenches. The exchange of this "tender salute" is an
almost climactic episode in the charged friendship between Cocker and
his "dear Charlie," a relationship that can be pieced together from the
letters he wrote to Evelyn and to his sister, Minnie. What is astonishing
is not so much the nascent homoeroticism but how this kiss between two
men is snugly contained within a heterosexual framework through the trope
of the girlfriend and the mother. With its detailed stage management,
the narrative transmits some of the excitement of the actual moment,
as does Cocker's ready reciprocity with the frank acknowledgment,
"that's from me." Physical demonstrations of such ardor could perhaps
just be contained within the parameters of the

<b></b>

"romantic friendship" that characterized late Victorian culture and
intensified during wartime.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
  Anxieties about sexuality--or, at least awareness of the surreptitious
  nature of the act ("there was no one about")--are filtered through a
  mock violation of gender categories and their tactile norms with the
  slightly pejorative simile ("two men, like a couple of girls") intended
  to point up silliness rather than deviance. Yet the moment cannot so
  easily be dismissed. If, following the logic of the sentence, "sacred"
  is taken to be a Freudian slip for "secret" the moment hovers curiously
  between the sacrosanct and the furtive. On the other hand, if "sacred"
  is a deliberately chosen word, it might betray an understandably
  overzealous attempt to ward off "profanity," while at the same time,
  maybe unconsciously, echoing the marriage vow. Situated between a
  radical innocence and a transgressive thrill, the exchange mirrors
  a moment of epistemological crisis in the interlocked histories of
  sexuality, gender, and gesture at a crucial moment in modernist history
  and culture. The kiss had just started to be theorized in the realm
  of sexology, which in turn was beginning to be conceptualized by men
  such as Havelock Ellis and Sigmund Freud. Both would write pioneering
  essays on homosexuality, resulting in the epoch-making conclusion that
  "the sexual object and the sexual aim are merely soldered together."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
  It was also the time of the cultural construction of the homosexual,
  or what Alan Sinfield calls "the consolidation of the queer image"
  through a nexus of effeminacy, aestheticism, and decadence.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
  The war hero, andwartime bonding, informed by manly sentiments and
  noble ends, were honorably exempt from such base charges and yet,
  as Cocker's letter demonstrates, not without a trace of anxiety. In
  so far as historical constructions shape desire, this epistemological
  uncertainty might well have engendered a greater emotional fluidity:
  maternal empathy, heterosexual romance, and homoerotic frisson merge
  in the kiss. These emotions are complexlyinterrelated and equally
  resonant, defying the strict categories of gender and sexuality.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
In the trenches of World War I, the norms of tactile contact between men
changed profoundly. Mutilation and mortality, loneliness and boredom,
the strain of constant bombardment, the breakdown of language, and
the sense of alienation from home led to a new level of intimacy and
intensity under which the carefully constructed mores of civilian society
broke down. As historian Joanna Bourke has documented, men nursed and
fed their friends when ill, held each other as they danced, and wrapped
blankets around each other, their bodies "spooned" together in sleep.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
  In his unpublished memoirs W. A. Quinton recalls how one night, as
  he lay shivering, "old Petch put his overcoat in addition to my own
  over me, taking care to tuck me in as a mother would a child."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 A writer identified only as A. F. B. notes, in <i>The Third Battalion
 Magazine,</i> that Smalley was the great favorite of the Third
 Battalion, AIF for "his heart was as big as his body--his strength
 like a lion's--his touch to the wounded as a woman's."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
  Another soldier, Jack, must close his letter to Miss Williams as "my
  <i>wife</i> is in bed &amp; wants me to keep her warm but it is only
  a Palestine wife. another Sussex boy . . . it is very chilly at night
  right now. &amp; it is nice to have someone to keep each other warm."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
  A new world of largely nongenital tactile tenderness was opening
  up in which pity, thrill, affection, and eroticism are fused and
  confused depending on the circumstances, degrees of knowledge,
  normative practices, and sexual orientations, as well as the available

<b></b>

models of male-male relationships. Erich Maria Remarque, in <i>All Quiet
on the Western Front,</i> would distill all the intensity and poignancy of
"freundschaft" into this single, silent gesture: "Kat's hands are warm,
I pass my hand under his shoulders in order to rub his temples with some
tea. I feel my fingers becoming moist."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
  Robert Cedric Sherriff's <i>Journey's End,</i> perhaps the most
  popular war play, culminates in a similarly intense scene of tactile
  tenderness: <i>"Stanhope . . . lightly runs his fingers over Raleigh's
  tousled hair."</i>
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
  Similarly, the sense of touch haunts war lyrics, from Rupert Brooke's
  "linked beauty of bodies" to the "full-nerved, still-warm" limbs of
  Wilfred Owen's dying boy and from Siegfried Sassoon's "my fingers
  touch his face" to Robert Nichols's more sentimental "My comrade,
  that you could rest / Your tired body on mine."
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>

<p>
English literary modernism, as marked by the Anglo-American high modernist
canon (T. E. Hulme, Ezra Pound, Wyndham Lewis), is often said to be
fiercely gendered, characterized by a combination of "misogyny and
triumphal masculinism."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
  However, the war writings (of Owen, Sassoon, Frederic Manning, Herbert
  Read, David Jones) that appeared in the 1920s and 1930s alongside
  these pieces of more self-consciously avant-garde art provide a more
  complex conception of masculinity. At the center of modernism lies
  the trauma of the Great War.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
  If shell shock had been the body language of masculine complaint,
  the poetic efflorescence of the 1920s was the celebration of what
  the Lawrentian hero Mellors famously describes as the "courage of
  physical tenderness" forged among men in the trenches: "I knew it
  with the men. I had to be in touch with them, physically and not go
  back on it. I had to be bodily aware of them and a bit tender to them."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
  Bodily intimacy in times of physical extremity led to a state
  of nakedness--in the sense of vulnerability, exposure, and
  dependence--that continued to haunt the returned soldier: "I clasp
  his hand," "he dies in your arms," "I have held strong arms that
  palter," and "I shake you by the shoulder" are recurring phrases in
  war literature. Whether or not there is any conscious or unconscious
  erotic investment in these moments, they indicate a new level of
  intensity and intimacy in male-male relationships. I focus on these
  moments of charged physical contact because they raise questions
  about the relation between the experiential reality of the body
  under physical extremity and the social constructions of gender and
  sexuality. These moments highlight the continuity and overlap between
  different emotions and impulses in the response of men to other men
  during wartime, and show how history--an indistinguishable blend of the
  social and the personal--radically informs and shapes desire. Above
  all, these moments of physical bonding and tactile tenderness during
  trench warfare require us to reconceptualize masculinity, conventional
  gender roles, and notions of same-sex intimacy in postwar England
  in far more significant and subtle ways than have been acknowledged
  in the criticism of war culture, studies of gender and sexuality,
  or the more general histories of the body, intimacy, and gesture.

<p>
Homoeroticism in the Great War is a necessarily gray area, but one that
is intimately associated with issues of gender.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
  Magnus Hirschfeld, in his chapter on the

<b></b>

subject in <i>The Sexual History of the First World War,</i> alerts us to
that ambiguous zone between male bonding, war camaraderie, and eroticism:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The comradeship which developed between the soldiers who shared all
the trials and dangers of war, this splendid fruit of the war so much
praised by Remarque, must have been especially pleasing to the homosexuals
for obvious reasons. . . . Very frequently, even among normal people,
it penetrated beyond the outer limits of the homoerotic and was thus,
to speak the language of psychoanalysis, characterized by libidinous
components. [<i>SH</i>, 116-7]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Discussion of World War I homoeroticism largely centers on the latter
category of "normal," or rather straight-identified, men who formed
intense and intimate bonds, often with a romantic slant--relationships
that Hirschfeld regards as "unconsciously erotic." By the time of
the Great War, Ellis and Freud had already written their essays on
homosexuality, John Addington Symonds and Hirschfeld were advocating
reforms, and Walt Whitman and Edward Carpenter had introduced a language
of masculine desire into English poetry.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
  But older cultural models prevailed over the scientific and literary
  discourses: people had yet to recover from the Oscar Wilde trials,
  and in the public's perception homosexuality was associated with
  the effeminate dandy. In a culture that demonized homosexuality,
  wartime relationships were often honorably exempt, as in the following
  loud disclaimer by Richard Aldington: "Let me at once disabuse the
  eager-eyed Sodomites among my readers by stating emphatically once
  and for all that there was nothing sodomitical in these friendships."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
  But other men were more sensitive to the finer shades of
  eroticism. Thus, J. R. Ackerley reminiscences that "my personal
  runners and servants were usually chosen for their looks,"
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
  while a character in Robert Graves's play asks, "Do you know how
  a platoon of men will absolutely worship a good-looking gallant
  officer? Of course, they don't realise exactly what's happening,
  neither does he; but it's a very, very strong romantic link."
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  Discussion of wartime homoeroticism must take into consideration such
  "very, very strong romantic links," although most of them were perhaps
  as "sentimental" and "chaste" as Graves's Charterhouse friendships.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
  "Romantic friendship" (or even "love") is the term used by many
  critics in their discussions of such same-sex intimacy where the
  erotic element is either confused, unknown, or unconscious.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

<p>
In so far as World War I has become a literary-historical phenomenon, it
is perhaps possible to "queer" it. Its three major poets, Brooke, Owen,
and Sassoon, had homoerotic encounters, inclinations, or relationships.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
  Three of its major prose works, <i>Goodbye to All That,The Middle
  Parts of Fortune,</i> and <i>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i>, were written
  by men who had similar experiences. And three of its major plays,
  <i>Journey's End,Prisoners of War,</i> and <i>But It Still Goes On,</i>
  have homoerotic themes. But any hasty claim for queer politics will
  encounter problems, both circumstantial and epistemological. Though it
  is important to create a dialogue between past experience and present
  awareness, it is important to remember that experiences shared in
  the trenches for three years had almost no parallel in previous wars,
  and that any discussion of gender and sexuality must accord with this
  unique situation.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
Central to the construction of sexuality is the idea of the
male-as-subject-of-desire, a tenet that led Michel Foucault to reformulate
his inquiry at the beginning of his second volume of <i>The History
of Sexuality</i>:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
In order to understand how the modern individual could experience himself
as the subject of a "sexuality", it was essential first to determine how,
for centuries, Western man had been brought to recognise himself as a
subject of desire.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
While this model of subjectivity has been enormously influential
in the discussion of same-sex eroticism from classical Greece to
nineteenth-century England, the fundamental problem with its application
to the war scenario is that the male body in the trenches becomes an
instrument of pain rather than of desire. World War I lasted over four
years and claimed nine million lives; an average of 6,046 men were
killed every day. From the British army alone, 41,000 servicemen had
their limbs amputated and 65,000 were invalided by shell shock.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
  Given this context, homoeroticism has to be understood within new
  conceptual parameters and a different economy of emotions. In the
  military, bodily contact is often one of the primary means of fostering
  loyalty, trust, and unity within an army unit. In the trenches of the
  western front, where life expectancy could be as short as a couple of
  weeks, same sex ardor, bodily contact, and (in some cases) eroticism
  should not be understood solely in contrast to heterosexuality, nor
  viewed only through the lenses of gender and sexuality. Such intimacy
  must also be understood to exist <i>as a triumph over death;</i> it
  must be seen as a celebration of life, of young men huddled against
  long winter nights, rotting corpses, and falling shells. Physical
  contact was a transmission of the wonderful assurance of being alive,
  and more sex-specific eroticism, though concomitant, was subsidiary. In
  a world of visual squalor, little gestures--closing a dead comrades'
  eyes, wiping his brow, or holding him in one's arms--were felt as acts
  of supreme beauty that made life worth living. Although these acts
  may overlap with eroticism, such experiences must not be conflated
  with it--nor, for that matter, with the repression or sublimation of
  sexual drives.

<p>
While discussing homosexual writers such as Sassoon, Ackerley, or
Manning, it is important to remember that they were a minority writing
within a masculinist, heterosexual field. Their conception of same-sex
"love" and its relation to sexual identity was very different from ours,
hovering precariously between the Victorian cult of "manly love" and the
"unspeakable bestiality" of the Greeks.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
  Moreover, they were mostly young men in extreme circumstances whose
  sexuality was not yet strongly formed, either in relation to erotic
  experiences or to an intellectual tradition of sexual dissidence,
  as was the case for Wilde, Symonds, or Carpenter. Above all,
  sexual orientation, though a very important factor, should not
  always be highlighted at the cost of other nuances of feeling, as
  Paul Fussell does with the following passage from Sassoon's memoirs:
  "As I stepped over one of the Germans an impulse made me lift him up
  from the miserable ditch. Propped against the bank, his blond face
  was undisred, except by mud which I wiped from his eyes and mouth
  with my coat sleeve."
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
  While discussing the special erotic appeal of blond good looks among
  the (predominantly) homosexual

<b></b>

writers of the period, Fussell suddenly quotes the above passage, noting
that "A dead blond equally fascinates Sassoon" (<i>GW</i>, 276). As Freud
had noted just a year before Sassoon wrote this entry, the aesthetic and
the erotic are closely allied, and (as marked by Edna St Vincent Millay)
might have had a definite relation to Sassoon's pacifist stance.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
  But it is reductive to interpret the incident solely, as in
  Fussell's account, in terms of Sassoon's fascination with young
  blond Germans. The moment of tactile tenderness is equally informed
  by recognition of human dignity and waste, a deep feeling of
  <i>caritas</i> and a sudden rush of empathy for the enemy. In a
  poem written on the following day (6 July 1916), Sassoon recounts
  the episode: "Wiped mud from mouth and eyes, and beardless cheek,
  . . . / Till he looked tidy for a hostile corpse!"
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
  The mud is an affront to the boy's dignity, rather than his beauty,
  making death "ugly"--"a shameless thing."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
  Wiping it off becomes a pitiful attempt to save the human form from
  what Martin Jay has called the "recalcitrant meaninglessness of the
  material universe," especially in a world where men were constantly
  becoming "things."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
  Even when both parties are alive and there are more consciously erotic
  (though nongenital) experiences, they must not be understood simply as
  "the correlation between fields of knowledge, types of normativity,
  and forms of subjectivity in a particular culture" but rather aligned
  with a whole range of emotional needs such as succour, sympathy,
  assurance and security as well as states of bodily extremity.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
  Consequently, to discuss intense same-sex relations during war, we
  must introduce a different and less distinctly sexualized array of
  emotional intensities and bodily sensations, a continuum of nongenital
  tactile tenderness that goes beyond strict gender divisions, sexual
  binaries, or identity politics.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
  We will explore this terrain through the representation of a particular
  kind of tactile contact: the dying kiss.

The Dying Kiss
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
An extremely unstable signifier, forever in danger of slipping from
a sign to a sensation, the kiss was increasingly discussed in fin de
si&egrave;cle culture: "The Curiosities of Kissing" in <i>Galaxy,</i>
xvi (Jul.-Dec. 1873), "The History of Kissing" in <i>Belgravia: An
Illustrated London Magazine,</i> xlvii (Jul.-Oct. 1882), "An Epidemic of
Kisses in America" in <i>Pall Mall Magazine,</i> xviii (May-Aug. 1899),
"The Kiss Poetical" in <i>The Fortnightly Review,</i> lxxxii (Aug. 1904),
"Kiss" in <i>Catholic Encyclopaedia</i> (New York, 1910), and finally
Ellis's "The Origins of the Kiss," in the fourth volume of his monumental
<i>Studies in the Psychology of Sex</i> .
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
  But how would the specifically same-sex kiss be perceived at a moment
  when English culture was precariously poised between the Victorian
  cult of "manly love" and the "sodomical" deeds of Oscar Wilde? In
  one of the earliest full-length books on the subject, <i>The Kiss
  and Its History</i> , Christopher Nyrop mentions "the kiss of
  friendship," remembering the "former times" when "the friendly kiss
  was very common with us between man and man," but notes that in recent
  times "the friendly kiss usually occurs only between ladies."
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
  But wartime extremity suspends normal tactile codes, and the
  male-to-male kiss had been doing its round in the trenches, mostly
  in close proximity to danger and death. "Kissing was

<b></b>

never out of favour" in the trenches, Evelyn muses in Lawrence's
<i>England, My England,</i> as he realizes how he seems "to have one
physical body with the other men," while a world-weary Stanhope in
Sheriff's <i>Journey's End</i>  pleads with Osborne: "Kiss me,
Uncle."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
  In Ernest Hemingway's <i>A Farewell to Arms</i> , Rinaldi's
  interactions with Frederic largely revolve around Frederic agreeing
  to a kiss which is denied throughout the novel.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
  But the <i>dying</i> kiss had very different connotations. The most
  obvious association would perhaps have been with the kiss by which
  grace is bestowed, varying from the New Testament kiss of peace and
  brotherhood (1 Cor. 16:20., 2 Cor. 12-3) to the transmission of the
  Holy Spirit (Song of Sol. 28:6-7). However, it is important to note
  that in 1924, when most of the war lyrics were appearing in print,
  a young scholar named Stephen Gaselee published an article entitled
  "The Soul in the Kiss" in <i>The Criterion</i> that painstakingly
  traced the classical concept of a mingling and migration of souls
  through the kiss, especially at the point of death.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
  For an Englishman the religious and classical connotations of the kiss
  would be overshadowed, perhaps, by a more flesh-and-blood incident
  from national history: Admiral Nelson's famous dying words: "Kiss me,
  Hardy," an image of heroic martyrdom and war camaraderie.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
  But what do the trench letters tell us?

<p>
The Reverend Okeden writes to his wife: "I've got a little
secret. . . . One dear lad very badly wounded saw me in the drawing
station and said, 'Hello Padre old sport' and then 'Come and kiss me
Padre' and he put his arms round me and kissed me."
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
  The Reverend Connor, whose diary reads like a Whitmanesque journal
  in his deep caring and suffering for "dear, dear lads," writes
  on 22 December 1914: "I prayed to God for the dear lad--I said,
  'I'll give you your mother's kiss'--'Let me do it to you,' &amp;
  the dear lad kissed me."
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
  Similarly, when his close friend Jim dies, a grief-stricken
  Lance-Corporal D. H. Fenton writes to his mother, Mrs Noone:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I suddenly saw Jim reel to the left and fall with a choking sob. I did
what I could for him, but his stout heart had already almost ceased to
beat and death must have been mercifully instantaneous. I held him in my
arms to the end, and when his soul had departed I kissed him twice where
I knew you would have kissed him--on the brow--once for his mother and
once for myself.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The recurring, almost ritualistic phrase "mother's kiss" suggests a
powerful reconceptualization of both masculinity and male-male bonds
through an assumed maternal impulse of security and tenderness, a moment
of "perilous intimacy" to borrow a phrase from Lawrence. The phrase "I
held him in my arms," with the subsequent connection to maternity, is
almost an unconscious reworking of the <i>Pieta,</i> showing how subtly
and how deeply Christian imagery makes up the repertoire of experiential
reality in shared Western culture. If a grieving Saint Veronica had
wiped Christ's brows, Fenton in his moment of loss would go a step
further, planting the kiss of life. And yet there is also a slight,
ever so fleeting hesitancy to specify the bodily part, as if deflecting
it to a maternal prerogative were a subconscious avoidance of the merest
hint of misinterpretation. Yet, it is anachronistic to mark in the kiss
an actively transgressive eros: it is a response based on the perception
of the male body as a seat of pain, frailty,

<b></b>

and transience rather than of desire. Sublimated eroticism, if present,
does not exist at the level of deliberate personal intention, but
results from a deep structural overlap with sentimentalism, tenderness,
and aestheticism that centers on the death of a youth, as in the various
representations of the Deposition of Christ.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
  But how does literature describe such moments of intimate emotion? Can
  imaginative reconstructions by soldier-writers help us to understand
  the emotional history of the Great War? I shall examine the motif of
  the dying kiss in fiction, poetry, and the short story in order to show
  the interaction between gender, genre, and psychosexual complexities.

War Camaraderie and the Public School Romance
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
The dying kiss appears in war literature perhaps for the first time in
<i>Wooden Crosses</i>  by Roland Dorgel&egrave;s.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
  This kiss was followed by one in Herman Hesse's <i>Demian</i> .
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
  But few war novels dwell on the dying kiss as lengthily or as
  passionately as Arthur Newberry Choyce's <i>Lips at the Brim</i>
  .
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
  Peter Greshwin and Raymond Dronkel, close friends at school, enlisted
  in the war as officer and soldier respectively; Choyce represents
  school friendship as flowering and fusing into officer-soldier romance
  at the moment of death:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
"Lift me higher, Peter--higher up . . . thank God! . . . you're back! I
want . . . to look at you . . . old man." Dumbly Peter raised his head
higher, holding him against his rough tunic, and wiping his lips with
his own numbed fingers.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Raymond looked into his eyes, and though Peter was half-dazed with the
tragedy of these last hours, his heart was stirred by the adoration of
friendship that he saw. It was the reallest thing he had known in his
life. "Passing the love of women.". . .
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Five minutes, ten minutes, the officer held him there, staring hard at
the half-closed eyes, without thinking, without moving.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He lowered Raymond to the ground. He felt round his own neck underneath
his shirt for the little silver crucifix which Joyce had sent, and
finding it, he hung it round Ray's neck.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Afterwards he drew a deep sobbing breath and bent lower and lower,
pressing his fevered mouth against the damp hair, and the cold, hard
forehead, and the pitiful blood-flecked lips.

<p>
The maternal empathy that one notes in the letters of Fenton or Reverend
Connor is here supplanted by a language of desire--fevered mouth,
half-closed eyes, blood-flecked lips--that breaks through the rhetoric
of Christianity, patriotism, or war camaraderie. The theatricality
of the scene is permeated with sentimentalism and sensationalism but
the driving force is a physical frisson that extends well beyond the
limits of school friendship or official duty. The blood-smeared kiss is
the climactic episode in this narrative, in which plot and character
developments are structured around a series of abortive heterosexual
kisses. The relationships between religion, heterosexual romance, and
friendship in the novel are mediated through a series of kisses.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
  While sexual innocence on the part of Peter and Raymond, both
  straight-identified males, does not prevent the kiss from being
  distinctly homoerotic, eroticism is understood in

<b></b>

terms of idealization, affection, and ardor rather than as a
straightforward case of repression or sublimation of the sexual drives.

<p>
Parker, speaking of the Victorian creed of Romantic friendship,
notes that "the lush unfolding of a chaste romance between two boys
was clearly considered charming," having "all the agreeable elements
of a clandestine yet carefree affair without the complication of sex"
(<i>OL</i>, 114). Contemporary forms of knowledge, types of normativity,
and ideological pressures play a part not only in the interpretation of
sexual experience, but often underlie the very constitutive structure
of desire.
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
  Phrases such as "self-appointed task of devotion," "adoration of
  friendship," "a straight young god with a clean young body," or
  the biblical echo, "Passing the love of women" show that, instead
  of being a simple conflict between physical passion and homophobic
  structures, eroticism is paradoxically a function of ideological
  investments in contemporary discourses: the Victorian cult of manly
  love, the Christian rhetoric of service, the wartime duty of a young
  officer. Love, respect, grief for a friend, a soldier, a martyr:
  all contribute to that mood of extravagant emotionalism of which the
  kiss is the token. The dominant Victorian ideology of religiosity,
  purity, and manliness, which interlocks with each of these discourses
  and claims a moral high ground over heterosexual conjugality, fosters
  the classic "homosocial bond" Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick speaks of in her
  analysis of nineteenth-century male friendships. Joyce becomes the
  mediating agent in this triangulated desire, epitomized in Peter's
  penultimate gesture of taking off Joyce's lovetoken and hanging
  it round Raymond's neck. Given the physicality and sentimentalism
  inherent in the theatre of war and death, the kiss indeed serves
  as a faultline in the contemporary construction of both masculinity
  and male bonding. While in the aggrieved letter of Fenton the kiss is
  more of an act of spontaneity and beauty, in Choyce's highly conscious
  fictional treatment it becomes the fine point where homosociability and
  homoeroticism--the polarities in the Victorian ideological spectrum
  of male relationships--intersect both at the level of experiential
  reality and at that of hermeneutic interpretation.

<p>
Yet the "blood-flecked" kiss may also characterize the genre of public
school romance on which Choyce draws. The public school novels are marked
by a tortured dialectic between earnest homoeroticism and homophobic
paranoia. The founders of the genre, Thomas Hughes and Frederic W. Farrar,
celebrated intense friendships but were always acutely aware of their
physical possibilities: "O Holy Friendship, how awfully a schoolboy can
sometimes desecrate thy name."
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
  Friendship is celebrated through a language of high romance in novels
  such as J. E. C. Welldon's <i>Gerald Eversley's Friendship</i>
  , H. A. Vachell's <i>The Hill</i> , E. F. Benson's
  <i>David Blaize</i> , or (as in the following passage) Sturgis's
  <i>Tim</i> :



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Tim, listening to the history of these two friends long ago, felt his
love for his friend almost a religion to him . . . "What woman could ever
love him as I do?" thought Tim, as he looked to the seat where Carol
sat. At that moment a sunbeam from some hole high in the roof fell on
the golden curly head which seemed transred; and as Tim's hungry
eyes rested on the face of his friend, he turned towards him and smiled.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
<b></b>

</blockquote>

<p>



When asked about such fraught relationships, G. H. Rendall, Headmaster of
Charterhouse from 1897 to 1911, said, "My boys are amorous but seldom
erotic" (<i>OL</i>, 106). Affections could be extravagant but were
never allowed to stray into the world of touch. The sheer fragility of
the distinction is revealed through the fierce homophobia this genre
exhibits. In many of the novels, such as Welldon's <i>Gerald Eversley's
Friendship</i>  or Raymond's <i>Tell England</i> , there
is either an episode of "attempted beastliness" or a re of the
"degenerate," as if the sanctity of the central relationship could be
defined only in relationship to such tropes.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
  Even more important was a strict policing of the ambiguous world of
  tactile contact; in the pre-Wildean England of Farrar's <i>Eric</i>
  (1857-8), a scene in which Eric, "stooping down kissed fondly the
  pale white forehead of his friend," drew a negative critical response.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
  The <i>Saturday Review</i> complained, "to the infinite indignation
  of all English readers, [the boys] occasionally kiss each other,
  exchanging moreover such endearments as 'dear fellow' and the like."
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
  The objection here is in fact to effeminacy rather than eroticism,
  but sexual anxiety does lurk in the background. In Hughes's <i>Tom
  Brown at Oxford</i> , after Tom gives up the barmaid and is
  reconciled with Hardy, "Tom rushed across to his friend, dearer to
  him now, and threw his arm round his neck; and if the un-English
  truth must out, had three parts of a mind to kiss the rough face."
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
  The male-to-male kiss is "un-English" but, in 1889, just four years
  after the Labouch&egrave;re Amendment, the exact source of anxiety is
  not difficult to guess. Tacked on to the Criminal Law Amendment Act
  , this amendment criminalized homosexuality--or, as it termed it,
  gross indecency between males--with a penalty of up to three years'
  imprisonment. The climactic kiss in Choyce's narrative needs to be
  considered in this context of paranoia. Choyce exploited a contemporary
  historical catastrophe not merely to relegitimize the kiss but to
  display it proudly as the centerpiece of his narrative framework. He
  did not merely suffuse it with all the suppressed romance of the genre,
  skillfully transposing the "hunger" from Tim's eyes to Peter's lips,
  but gave it a decadent slant as well. The physical intimacy between
  Peter and Raymond no doubt collapsed the fine distinction between
  the amorous and the erotic. But such ardor was contained within the
  theatre of war and death, and Choyce knew that a postwar public would
  translate it into a sentimental rhetoric of sacrifice and comradeship.

<p>
Amorousness was perhaps permissible among boys but not between men
in Victorian England. The love and grief Lord Alfred Tennyson felt at
the death of Arthur Henry Hallam (A. H. H.) would find expression in
the image of a dying kiss at the center of "In Memoriam" : "I,
falling on his faithful heart, / Would breathing thro' his lips impart /
The life that almost dies in me," only to be attacked by the <i>Times</i>
for a tone of "amatory tenderness."
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
  Tennyson's violation of Victorian gender norms was what the Victorian
  public must have found peculiarly disturbing and ultimately
  threatening. In his frequent and fluid shift of registers from
  classical models of "manly love" to those of heterosexual romance,
  he compares Arthur to an absent fianc&eacute;e, a

<b></b>

deceased wife, and a bride leaving her parent's house. Whitman, in the
first edition of <i>Leaves of Grass</i> , would employ a far more
overtly erotic vocabulary to describe same-sex affection--"comrade's
long dwelling kiss"--but would carefully harness the image in a virile
and working class identity or a rhetoric of sacrifice, as in "The Wound
Dresser": "Many a soldier's kiss dwells on these bearded lips."
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>

<p>
Herbert Read turns to this literary tradition in "My Company," one of
the most frequently anthologized war poems, first published in <i>Naked
Warriors</i> . In Read's poem the dying kiss is set exactly in the
central section: "It is not thus I would have him kiss'd / but with the
warm passionate lips / of his comrade here."
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
  In Read's modernist poetics, Whitman is invoked both for sexual
  and political reasons: erotic charge is made the basis of political
  bonding. Military relationships are here reconceptualized as personal
  romance; killing machines are seen as units of love so that the end
  of the war is like the end of an affair: "O beautiful men, O men I
  loved / O whither are you gone, my company?" Fussell notes that the
  above stanza "seems to recover the world of Whitman's <i>Calamus</i>
  and Drumtaps" (<i>GW,</i> 280). But there is an essential difference
  between the Whitmanesque model the central section posits and the
  rest of the poem:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
You became
<br />
in many acts and quiet observances
<br />
a body and a soul, entire . . .
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
I cannot tell
<br />
what time your life became mine:
<br />
perhaps when one summer night
<br />
we halted on the roadside
<br />
in the starlight only
<br />
and you sang your sad home-songs
<br />
dirges which I standing outside you
<br />
coldly condemned.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
Perhaps, one night, descending cold
<br />
when rum was mighty acceptable,
<br />
and my doling gave birth to sensual gratitude.

<blockquote>

And then our ts: we've fought together
<br />
compact, unanimous
<br />
and I have felt the pride of leadership.
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This is the language of the amorous subject, but it draws on the rhetorics
of heterosexual romance, laddish indulgences, and officer-soldier
camaraderie. The shifts in register suggest that these realms,
kept separate in ordinary life through varying discourses of desire,
friendship, and duty have come together. While in "The Wound-dresser"
or in his war journals Whitman is a marginal re, sublimating his
eroticism into little remembered acts of kindness and love, here the
catalyst is clearly not physical charge but rather constant companionship,
growth, and development, as well as

<b></b>

mutual dependence and support. It is a complete fusion of private
and public affections. Manning, in <i>The Middle Parts of Fortune</i>
, speaks of war comradeship as having "an intensity of feeling
which friendship never touches," remembering how "When Evans heard the
Colonel had been left on the wire, he ran back into hell to do what he
could for him."
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
  Perhaps Read tries to recapture "this intensity of feeling" and
  physical immediacy by returning to Whitman's world, where physical
  passion is the basis of communality. However, the eroticization
  of the kiss does not suggest an actively transgressive politics of
  sexual difference as it does in Whitman, but rather two different,
  although related concepts. First, eroticism is primarily on the
  side of life, meaning, and beauty; it stands in opposition to the
  Baudelairian grotesquery of rotting lips, and subsequent categories
  of homo/hetero are strictly secondary. Secondly, Read's poem asks,
  for a sensitive heterosexual male can emotional intensity accommodate
  the physical? Or, conversely, is heterosexual desire the necessary
  structuring principle of social units?

<p>
If a questioning of heterosexual norms is implicit in Read's model,
Nichols openly employed the motif of the dying kiss in order to challenge
civilian domestic structures. His <i>Ardours and Endurances</i>  was
perhaps the most popular war anthology, rapturously and lengthily reviewed
in the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> (12 July 1917)."The Secret,"
although appearing in his second anthology, <i>Aurelia</i> , sums up
the main thrust of <i>Ardours and Endurances</i>: before the war the poet
had been implicated in both "love" and "passion," but in a postwar life he
could find solace in romantically mourning two friends: Richard Pinsent,
an Oxford friend killed at Loos in 1915, and Harold Stuart Gough, killed
at Ypres in 1916. At first glance "The Secret" seems to reproduce the
age-old asymmetrical opposition between male camaraderie and heterosexual
romance, mapping it onto fiercely gendered binaries of strength/weakness,
pain/pleasure, service/comfort, chastity/sex, and mind/body. But in the
last stanza a subtle shift occurs: the difference between male-male and
male-female relationship is predicated not on an absence/presence of the
body but on a <i>distinction</i> between processes of touching. Different
kinds of physicalities and masculinities vie for attention in the poem:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
I, that have held strong hands which palter,
<br />
Borne the full weight of limbs that falter,
<br />
Bound live flesh on the surgeon's altar,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
What need have I of woman's hand?
<br />
I, that have felt the dead's embrace;
<br />
I, whose arms were his resting-place;
<br />
I, that have kissed a dead man's face;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ah, but how should you understand
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Now I can only turn away.</i>
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Heterosexual erotic investment is contrasted with noble, altruistic
love of comrades but most astonishing is the process of remembrance and
representation. The gruesome process of bandaging wounds and mutilated
limbs is here fondly cherished, nightmarish experiences are transformed
through language into a fantasy of romance. The

<b></b>

overarching framework of suffering and service (understood in terms of
morality and Christianity, as implied in the phrase "surgeon's altar")
comes up against an almost desirable relish heard in the wording,
sound-pattern, rhythm, and rhyme. This effect is produced not merely
through the liquids and sibilants ("live flesh," "limbs," "strong hands"),
but in the way the falling cadence of the feminine rhyme ("palter" /
"falter" / "altar") is gathered up by a strong masculine subjectivity
grounded in the anaphoric "I" and the alliterative beat of the stressed
syllables of the trochee and the spondee: "Bound" and "Borne." In this
romance of language between two kinds of masculinity, sympathy flows
into empathy, and the "woman's hand," receiving the trochaic stress
at the wrong end of the line, no doubt grates harshly. The kiss is
the climactic point in the poem: if the rhetorical dismissal of the
"woman's hand" is a repudiation of marriage, is kissing the comrade
meant to show that the symbol of heterosexual romance has also lost its
meaning in postwar England?

<p>
The aestheticization of the male body and eroticization of male experience
one notes in Read and Nichols--poets who, unlike Sassoon or Ackerley,
were not overtly concerned with homosexuality--might result from the
effort to find a suitable poetic language with which to articulate the
specificity of war experiences. In journals, diaries, and letters that
are not self-consciously literary or written by public school officers,
one finds a slightly different expression of experience, as in the
unpublished memoirs of W. A. Quinton:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Sharing everything, down to the last cigarette end, the last army biscuit,
the last bit of cover under an enemy bombardment, can you wonder when
I say we almost loved each other. Facing hardships &amp; death together
day after day, brings out that something in a man that lies dormant in
the monotonous round of everyday civilian life. I well remember on one
occasion when I was sickly, how old Petch tried to nurse me. . . . How
at night when I lay shivering, he put his overcoat in addition to my
own over me, taking care to tuck me in as a mother would a child.
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Tactile tenderness, red through the maternal embrace, defines the
final moment in Quinton's reconceptualization of male-male bonds premised
on a language of mutual dependence under extreme circumstances. The
bodily intimacy ("stuck together") he suggests is of a different order
from desire. The physical continuum--touching, nursing, reassuring--was
central to these relationships, which did not fit either the classical
or the Christian models of "manly love," both of which largely ignored
the body. Without a language to describe this physicality, most poets
fell back on a model of Whitmanesque passion or Georgian aestheticism,
while at the same time developing a troubled relationship to these
modes. This is evident in the conflict that lies at the heart of Read's
and Nichols's poems: the central disjunction between an experiential
reality and ideology of "greater love" and an inherited poetic language
of exquisite sensations. Having challenged the centrality of desire as
the structuring principle of heterosexual civilian society, most poets
would nonetheless draw on a rhetoric of desire--yet the constant effort
to evoke another experience is perceptible in their language and suggests
a different kind of relationship.

<b></b>

<p>
Perhaps retreat into older poetic modes was the inevitable result of
a conjunction of class politics, literary history, and the culture of
mourning. Jon Silkin's Penguin anthology  shows that what has come
to be regarded as the World War I literary canon was largely built on the
works of public school officer-poets. Many of them had "sentimental and
chaste" but distinctly "homosexual" crushes, as Graves says, at school;
for many of them, the army, with its network of male relationships,
was basically an extension of the public school, and they transposed
the language of school romance with a rhetoric of mourning.
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
  Morever, from the aestheticism of Walter Pater to the pastoral
  poignancy of A. E. Housman's <i>A Shropshire Lad</i> to the Uranian
  poetry of William Johnson Cory, English poetry was suffused with
  what Fussell calls a tradition of "warm homoeroticism" through which
  the youthful male body was endlessly aestheticized, idealized,
  and eulogized. Sensuousness mixed with pathos as the wistfulness
  of <i>l'amour impossible</i> was deflected into the early death of
  the boy.
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
  Most of the war poets eagerly tapped into this tradition, reinstating
  it, through historical contingency, at the heart of English literature
  and culture. If in 1869 a slightly perturbed father of Arthur Hallam,
  after reading Shakespeare's <i>Sonnets,</i> had detected "weakness
  and folly in all excessive and mis-placed affection," in the case of
  war poetry they were "redeemed by the touches of nobler sentiments."
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
  If effeminacy had been attached to the profession of the writer in
  Victorian England, the nation now had a group of soldier-poets who
  refuted any such perception.
<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>
  As Aldington says in <i>Death of a Hero,</i> "They were men. There
  was something intensely masculine about them. . . . They had been
  where no woman and no half-man had ever been, could endure to be."
<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>
  However, his rather shrill foregrounding of the war as an exclusively
  male experience cloaks a deep anxiety about gender and sexuality that
  forms the tortured dialectic of his book.
<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
  Above all, at a time when nearly a whole generation has been destroyed
  by unimaginable forms of violence, homophobia was checked through the
  sheer intensity of grief. The threat of homoeroticism was arrested by
  the absence of the desired object and the conception of the body as a
  seat of pain. This explains the appeal of the dying kiss: the strength
  and sweetness of a whole tradition of "warm homoeroticism" could be
  gathered into the "warm, passionate" kiss, any direct homoerotic threat
  halted by the image of a dead body. It would always be a one-sided
  narrative, the life-death boundary overpowering transgressive eros,
  such that it could be written into a language of greater love.

<p>
And yet for many homosexuals, it was the source of much anxiety. Sassoon,
tormented by his homosexuality (although he may not have been active at
the time), could not celebrate the "warm, passionate" kiss of comrades
with the ease or fluency of Read or Nichols. Sassoon mentions the dying
kiss only once, but it has a tortured history. By August 1915 Sassoon was
deeply in love with David Cuthbert Thomas, the young Sandhurst subaltern,
whom he calls "Dick Tiltwood" in <i>Memoirs of a Fox Hunting Man.</i>
<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
  By 18 March 1916 David was dead, hit by a stray bullet in the throat;
  as his biographer, Jean Moorcroft Wilson says, "Without exaggeration,
  Sassoon found the loss almost unbearable."
<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>
  The entry in Sassoon's diary for the following day reads:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
But they came afterwards and told me that my little Tommy had been hit
by a stray bullet and died last night. When last I saw him, two nights
ago, he had his notebook in his hand, reading my last poem. And I said
good night to him, in the moonlit trenches. Had I but known!--the old,
human-weak cry. Now he comes back to me in memories, like an angel,
with the light in his yellow hair, and I think of him at Cambridge late
August when we lived together four weeks in Pembroke College in rooms
where the previous occupant's name, Paradise, was written above the door.
<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In May 1916 Sassoon wrote "The Last Meeting," a pastoral elegy mourning
David's death. In a poem where the male body is consistently woven into
a fantasy of space, purity, and disembodiedness, Sassoon concludes with a
surprisingly intimate detail of personal history: "And lips that touched
me once in Paradise."
<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
  By framing the kiss, happy with warmly personal details, at the
  climactic point of the pastoral elegy, the poet places his love on
  a continuum of intense male love and loss. If the church, the state,
  and modern sexology had reduced homosexuality to a sin, a crime, or
  an aberration, he falls back on an "honourable" genre that not only
  has the weight of classical antiquity but is incorporated within the
  tradition of "Englishness" from Milton to Shelley to Arnold. But in a
  stunning example of how gay history is erased through homosexual panic,
  either personal or institutional, these lines are found only in the
  original draft sent to Edward Dent. The 1919 collection of <i>War
  Poems</i> (and all subsequent editions) changes the paradisal kiss
  into a dying one: "And youth, that dying, touched my lips to song."
<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>

<p>
The kiss--or rather its absence--becomes even more fascinating in the
work of Wilfred Owen. Male beauty, often with an erotic charge, is one
of the mainsprings of his poetry.
<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>
  But there are essential differences between Owen's deep homoerotic
  inclination and the more conscious homosexuality of Sassoon. First,
  unlike Sassoon, there is no documented evidence of any homosexual
  relationship or encounter on the part of Owen. For him, in contrast to
  Sassoon and Read, amorous investment impedes rather than facilitates
  political bonding. The noble principle of greater love is forever
  in the danger of being tainted by the "unspeakable vice of the
  Greeks." Still, he is obsessed by lips; a rigorous Protestant ethic
  mingled with feelings of guilty eroticism and a hatred of warfare
  produce tortured sadomasochistic images: "Red lips are not so red /
  As the stained stones kissed by the English dead," or "I saw his
  round mouth's crimson deepen as it fell."
<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>
  The lips that cannot be touched, morally or legally, can only be
  mutilated in Owen's poetry. Pain and frustration produce a diatribe
  against innocent heterosexual kissing:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
For love is not the binding of fair lips
<br />
With the soft silk of eyes that look and long,
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
By Joy, whose ribbon slips,--
<br />
But wound with war's hard wire whose stakes are strong;

<p>
Bound with the bandage of the arm that drips;
<br />
Knit in the webbing of the rifle-thong.
<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>

<b></b>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The concluding images might strike one as a piece of grim war realism,
but in light of his early work, the metaphor is replete with strong
symbolic overtones. Regarding eroticism as "a thorn in the flesh,"
(male) hands had been a perpetual site of intense pleasure and anxiety
for Owen. In "Impromptu," he writes, "Now let me feel the feeling of
this hand / For it is softer than the breasts of girls." Looking back
on what Hibberd calls his "love affair" with Vivian Rampton, however,
he agonizes, "Be better if I had not touched his hand" (<i>OP</i>,
22). These contradictions are gathered up into a moment of terrible
guilt in the rough draft of the "Perseus" fragment: "Unhand me / For I
have touched the god, touch me not."
<sup><a name="REF79" href="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>
  Consequently, as he sets out to sing the hymn of sacrificial love,
  the beautiful hands of Rampton and the de la Touch boys, the "groping
  hand" and "beautiful fingers" of "To Eros" or "Impromptu" get savagely
  mutilated. Homoerotic anxieties are thus deflected and displaced,
  painful sacrifice is lauded above pleasurable self-expression. Owen
  redefines love through a sadomasochistic image of mutilation,
  just as the innocuous "ribbon," a seemingly casual reminder of
  heterosexuality, resurfaces with a macabre twist in the image of
  reddened, bruised flesh implicit in the phrase "Knit in the webbing
  of the rifle-thong." Greater love is redefined not through the dying
  kiss but as a bond made by mutilated hands.

<p>
But is homosexuality and the related anxieties about gender that
seem to hover around the dying kiss ever directly addressed by World
War I writers? A unique example is Ludwig T&uuml;gel's short story,
"Over the Top," originally written in German and translated in the
popular anthology, <i>Great War Short Stories</i> , introduced by
Edmund Blunden. The story is set in a tiny dugout on the eve of a fatal
offensive. The first-person narrator reads a letter written by his close
friend Paul to his girlfriend, while Paul lies asleep. When a barrage
starts outside the dugout Paul wakes up in absolute terror:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
"You've been reading it, haven't you? You've been reading it?"
<br />
"Yes," I managed to gasp, and I saw him pull the trigger.The bullet
flew past my ear; we struggled and rolled over together. Chest to chest,
head to head, we were lying locked against each other.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I don't know what happened. We were trying to bite each other's throats
like savage beasts, and our lips met harshly, then relaxed and remained
together. We murmured brokenly, incomprehensibly, as we wept and kissed
and clung. Outside in the front of the dugout they were shouting:
"Take cover! Take cover!"

<p>
The scene begins as one of male hysteria: the hour of need involves
tortured masculinity, homosocial rivalry, self-loathing, and
sadomasochistic fury. A moment of silence marks the slide into eroticism
in the otherwise detailed narrative: "I don't know what happened,"
as T&uuml;gel shows aggression flowering into desire without a break
or mediating pause. The adjective "harshly" is a curious one. While,
through the logic of the narrative, it follows from the language of
physical aggression ("savage beasts"), it also

suggests something very masculine, with a hint of stubble. Ironically,
in the literary theatre of World War I, Rupert Brooke's vision of "the
rough male blanket of kisses" reaches its apotheosis on the other side
of no man's land.

<p>
The kiss is the pivot on which the story turns, the site of complex
psychosexual mediation. In T&uuml;gel's narrative, the kiss is situated
between two other kisses. The first is the romantic kiss of Paul's
girlfriend--"the lips which you have kissed and which have kissed
you"--and as he prepares to go over the top they are his "dearest
memory." But for the first-person narrator, the kiss takes him much
further back, to the "earliest memory" of his mother: "I remember
you, my own earthly mother. I threw myself on the bed and kissed you,
understanding nothing, but perhaps realising unconsciously that life gives
love and only love can give life" ("OT," 298-9). In <i>Three Essays on the
Theory of Sexuality</i> , Freud says that for the child, "sucking
at his mother's breast has become the prototype of every relation of
love"; initially, "the satisfaction of the erotogenic zone is associated
. . . with the satisfaction of the need for nourishment," but with the
growth of the child, his "oral education" is connected with an emerging
capacity for genital sexuality (<i>CPW,</i> 7:181-2). In a sentence added
in 1915, Freud suggests that the instinct of self-preservation lingers on,
and that sexual activity "does not become independent of them until later"
("OT," 182). The kiss in T&uuml;gel's narrative, exchanged before imminent
death, is almost a regression to the childhood world of "love" and "life"
contained in the infantile <i>Lutscherli.</i> If, as Adam Philips does,
we take Freud's ideas to their extreme, interpreting the kiss to harbor
a "narcissistic intent" (the child unsatisfactorily substituting the
"corresponding part of another's body"), then the dying kiss suggests
an important link between narcissism and homoeroticism. "It's a pity I
can't kiss myself," Freud's child parenthetically exclaims (ibid.). If
this disappointment is the grudge at the root of sexuality, making the
kiss the mouth's elegy to itself, T&uuml;gel presents us with a grim
literalization as the two men go over the top, the kiss being their
last--and lasting--memory.
<sup><a name="REF81" href="#FOOT81">81</a></sup>
  While it transports the narrator to the maternal world of comfort
  and security, he also plays the maternal role. However, the framing
  vocabulary oscillates between heterosexual romance and homosocial
  camaraderie: "Paul pressed closely against me, and I sheltered him
  in my arms as once I might have sheltered a woman whom I loved. 'All
  right, old man. All right.' We said no more." ("OT," 297) Refusing to
  be put into any particular category of self-preservation, maternity,
  romance, friendship, or eroticism, different emotions and instincts
  slip through "lips at the brim" in this narrative universe.

<p>
The revolutionary potential of T&uuml;gel's story can be fully appreciated
when placed in the context of contemporary debates about homosexuality,
especially in Germany. The earliest theories of sexual inversion
came from German sexologists--Karl Heinrich Ulrichs and Richard von
Krafft-Ebing--all of whom were seeking a medical explanation, thus
starting the debate about congenital versus acquired sexuality. Having
universally acknowledged homosexuality to be an abnormality, yet having
failed to establish any specific "abnormal" link that could be universally
acknowledged, these highly scrupulous and enlightened thinkers raided
the diverse fields of gender, genetics, and neurology, inadvertently
infecting homosexuality with the terror of each. Ulrichs advanced

<b></b>

the theory of <i>anima muliebris virile corpore inclusa,</i> a female soul
in a male body; Krafft-Ebing, in the twelfth edition of <i>Psychopathia
Sexualis</i> , attributed same-sex desire to neurasthenia induced
by masturbation, abstinence, and other activities; Lombroso associated
the trait with tainted heredity.
<sup><a name="REF82" href="#FOOT82">82</a></sup>
  In this context the publication of Ellis's <i>Sexual Inversion</i>
   was a landmark. Although his account is profoundly sympathetic,
  the contemporary sexological conviction almost forces him to conclude
  that "Sexual inversion . . . remains a congenital abnormality, to be
  classed with the other congenital abnormalities which have psychic
  concomitants."
<sup><a name="REF83" href="#FOOT83">83</a></sup>
  Freud broke new ground in 1903 by separating the sexual object
  and the sexual aim, thus separating gender from sexuality and
  claiming the polymorphous perversity of human desire. But it is
  often forgotten that Freud became popular only after World War II,
  and it was Ellis's model that was very much in vogue during the
  Great War years. T&uuml;gel's story clears up the tendency to read
  sexual difference through a trope of gender transgression, one of
  the most long-standing confusions in Victorian ideology. By placing
  the kiss in the overtly masculine atmosphere evoked by wrestling
  and death on the battlefield, he subtly discredits both Ulrichs's
  model of a female soul in a male body and the social construction of
  the effeminate dandy associated with Wilde. While the whole debate
  concerning congenital or acquired homosexuality had revolved around
  the concept of intentionality with pleasure as the aim, T&uuml;gel
  does away with this, largely through the selection of a genre that
  focuses only on contingent moments. In his narrative these moments
  are located in the arbitrary and accidental processes of touch. He
  moves beyond the issue of sexual difference to explore the fluidity of
  desire; his story is suggestive of Freud's argument that the sexual
  object and sexual aim are merely soldered together. More importantly,
  he places sexuality in a continuum of emotions such as vulnerability,
  helplessness, fear, and the universal need to be loved and cared
  for. Rather than celebrating T&uuml;gel's story as a gay love song
  of the trenches, it should be read in the context of mutilation and
  mortality. As one of the most commonly accepted modes of intimate
  adult communication, sex also becomes the most available language. In
  the meeting of "lips" the erotics of greed are overwhelmed by the
  reassurances of affection. Words and phrases such as "pressed,"
  "wept," "hand in hand," or the twice-repeated "clung" and "sheltered"
  show the overpowering need of bodily reassurance rather than erotic
  gratification. The kiss--or as Freud defined it, "the particular
  contact . . . between the mucous membrane of the lips of the two
  people concerned," held in "high sexual esteem"--becomes a language
  of support, succor, and solace (<i>CPW</i>, 7:150).

<p>
Of modern subjectivity, Roland Barthes writes:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
for us the "subject" (since Christianity) <i>is the one who suffers</i>:
where there is a wound, there is a subject: <i>die Wunde! die Wunde!</i>
says Parsifal, thereby becoming "himself"; and the deeper the wound,
at the body's center (at the "heart"), the more the subject becomes a
subject: for the subject is <i>intimacy</i> ("The wound . . . is of a
frightful intimacy").
<sup><a name="REF84" href="#FOOT84">84</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Subjectivity and intimacy return when the body is understood as a seat
of pain rather than pleasure. At stake is the issue of nakedness that
also underlies the relations between

<b></b>

gender, gesture, and intimacy in World War I. The word "nakedness"
suggests how a sense of physical danger can lead to a bodily intimacy and
immediacy that is perhaps inimical to linguistic representation. In the
letter to his girlfriend in T&uuml;gel's story, Paul mentions a curious
episode: "Yesterday Frohlich the bombardier had an attack of madness,
and my friend had to tie him down in the dugout. He called me up to show
me . . . and said, quite calmly: "I'm just telling you in case you've
to do it to me" ("OT," 294). It is one of the greatest ironies that the
world's first industrial war, which brutalized the male body on such an
unprecedented scale, also nurtured the most intensely intimate of male
bonds. The myth of strong, invincible masculinity fostered in the works of
Rudyard Kipling and Rider Haggard, and which was later advocated by men
like Hulme, Lewis, and Pound, and finally embodied in the stolid re
of General Haig exploded in the mud and blood of the western front. A
very different order of male experience, one that accommodated fear,
vulnerability, support, succor, and physical tenderness, sprang up in
its place. The experiences shared in the trenches were undoubtedly one
of the deciding events in the history of twentieth-century gender. They
led to a radical reconceptualization of masculinity and male intimacy
that profoundly affected both the men and women in postwar England.
<sup><a name="REF85" href="#FOOT85">85</a></sup>
  For a whole generation of war survivors--including Sassoon,
  Edmund Blunden, Graves, and Eric Maria Remarque--the most
  important relationships in their lives were those forged in the
  trenches. Heterosexuality in postwar England was challenged not by
  sexual dissidence but memories of such relationships. They were not
  composed of romantic love or friendly affection or homoerotic frisson:
  with each of these elements there is a distinct overlap, and yet
  always a distinct difference. Eroticism may or may not have played
  a part, but it was not the founding impulse. Sexuality had not yet
  hijacked an intimate history of human emotions. "Frightful intimacy"
  is perhaps as far as language can go, and the dying kiss was perhaps
  its true sign, the mouth filling the gap left by language.

Lieutenant Frank Cocker to Evelyn, 16 January 1916, 82/11/1, Imperial War
Museum Archives, London. In the letters, Charlie is often the object of
a loving gaze: "I have watched Charlie's face intently under all manner
of circumstances"; "I gazed at him and loved him"; "We suddenly caught
each other's glance and both his eyes and mine were hot with tears." But
the letters also express the most tender feelings towards Evelyn, as
well as elation at Charlie's engagement to a "dear Christian girl in
Doncaster." After the war, Cocker married Evelyn.

In light of the current interest in and celebration of bisexuality as
"sexually postmodern," and given the fluidity of Cocker's gesture, one
might read the kiss as being "a re of subversion and disruption" in
the construction of the homo/hetero dyad in wartime England. However, the
kiss in Cocker's narrative wavers not merely between sexual categories
but also between nuanced emotional registers that are historically
contingent; furthermore, placing the kiss on a "bisexual continuum"
requires a shrill identity politics that compromises the complexity and
quirkiness of the act. See Clare Hemmings, "Resituating the Bisexual

Important contemporary information can be obtained from the reports of
the Scientific Humanitarian Committee (Wissenschaftlich-humanitarian
Komitee), a group that began under the auspices of Magnus Hirschfeld to
assist in the legal protection and social defence of homosexuals. Its
quarterly reports appeared under the title "Aus der Kriegszeit,"
during wartime. See Hirschfeld, "Homosexuality and Transvestism in the
Trenches," in <i>The Sexual History of the World War</i> (New York:
Cadillac, 1946); hereafter abbreviated <i>SH.</i> For more recent
treatments of the homoerotic element in war literature, see Paul Fussell,
<i>The Great War and Modern Memory</i> (New York: Oxford University
Press, 1975), 270-309; hereafter abbreviated <i>GW</i>; Martin Taylor,
<i>Lads: Love Poetry of the Trenches</i> (London: Duckworth, 1998), 1-58;
hereafter abbreviated <i>LLP</i>; and Simon Featherstone, <i>War Poetry:
An Introductory Reader</i> (London: Routledge, 1995), 104-15. Weeks,
in <i>Between the Acts: Lives of Homosexual Men, 1885-1967</i> (London:
Routledge, 1991) interviews a World War I soldier who met his partner
in the trenches . Hirschfeld documents similar cases, but agrees
that such examples are few (<i>SH</i>, 115). As Taylor notes, "Given
the physical conditions of the front line, the filth, the lice and the
lack of privacy, and the probable sexual orientation of most soldiers,
it is unlikely that any sexual contact was possible or even desirable"
(<i>LLP,</i> 27). The only reference to a court martial related to
homosexuality I have found appears in a letter from Raymond Asquith
to Lady Diana Manners in September 1916: "I had two terribly strenuous
days--10 hours each before a court martial defending a fellow officer
upon 5 charges of 'homosexualism'-- unsuccessfully. It was terribly
tiring but not entirely unenjoyable as it was easy to make fools of most
of the witnesses (though not unfortunately as to the facts to which they
testified)." (<i>Raymond Asquith, Life and Letters,</i> ed. John Joliffe

While in Brooke's case there is documented evidence of at least one
encounter, Sassoon was a self-confessed homosexual. Owen's letters and

actual encounter or relationship. See John Lehmann, <i>Rupert Brooke: His

Similarly complex is the response of the German infantryman who, as
Hirschfeld noted with astonishment, held "a water bottle to the lips of
the delirious dying (English) boy who kept on crying, 'Mother, are you

acts cannot be explained only in terms of "sensitive urning" souls

This sounds similar to the fluid, indeterminate, and contingent
sexualities and identities that are celebrated in the work of Butler,
Garber, and Sedgwick. But while most contemporary theorists reach their
conclusions by applying various post-structuralist models to gender
studies, I base my findings on an analysis of literary and historical
texts. Due to the peculiarity of war circumstances, the continuum of
nongenital tactile tenderness seems to combine Sedgwick's "homosocial
desire" with certain features of Rich's paradigm of the lesbian continuum
of "resignation, despair, effacement, self-denial." (Adrienne Rich,
"Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence," in <i>Blood, Bread
and Poetry: Selected Prose, 1979-1985</i> [London: Virago, 1986], 53-4)
The bonds I examine are not based on triangulated desire, are far more
physical than in Sedgwick, and need not be consciously erotic, nor
associated with power. See Sedgwick, <i>Between Men: English Literature
and Male Homosocial Desire</i> (New York: Columbia University Press,
1985) and Richard Dellamora, <i>Masculine Desire: The Sexual Politics
of Victorian Aestheticism</i> (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina
Press, 1990). "Because of the prevalence of the heterosexual-homosexual
dichotomy, however, straight-identified men today have nearly lost the
possibility of speaking of such relations, and yet there is a continuing
need to do so" (Dellamora, <i>Masculine Desire,</i> 5).

In the first flush of adolescent passion, as Peter tries to follow "the
impulse of his lips," Tess throws some forget-me-nots at his face and
runs away. At the end of the narrative, when he is about to kiss Claire,
she says, "God help me! I am Claude Paler's wife" (Choyce, <i>Lips at the
Brim</i>, 197). Similarly, the battle between religious ardor and sexual
passion is fought at a moment when Peter is going to kiss the chalice:
Tess pretends to faint, Peter gets distracted, and the chalice drops to
the floor.

As Dollimore notes, "What is less often conceded or, if conceded,
considered--Bersani being a significant exception--is that if gender
is socially constituted, <i>so too is desire.</i> Desire is informed
by the same oppressive constructions of gender that we would willingly
dispense with. Desire is of its "nature" saturated by the social." See
<i>Sexual Dissidence,</i> 325.

LVI : 13. Even if one rejects Graves's claim that Owen was a

Moncrieff's dark hints about "shame" ("Sonnet" by "C. K. S. M.," <i>New
Witness,</i> 7 [June 1918]) as the wish-fulfillment of a rejected lover,
his poetry and letters clearly reveal his strong homoerotic bent.
