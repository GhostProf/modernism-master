By 1934 Gertrude Stein retrospectively claimed that her writing had been
"doing what the cinema was doing," and she acknowledged film as key to
her historical moment:

Kenneth Macpherson, editor of the premiere film journal <I>Close Up</I>
(1927-33), recognized the cinematic quality of Stein's writing and
widely recruited "anything [she] might send," stressing that "the kind
of thing [she] write[s] is so exactly the kind of thing that could be
translated to the screen."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  Stein appeared in three issues of the journal, and in 1927, published
  her portrait, "Mrs. Emerson," which was placed next to a piece by Man
  Ray about his first full-length experimental film, <I>Emak Bakia.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  That these texts appear side by side is no accident.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While the importance of modern painting to the development of Stein's
art has been amply demonstrated, her specific connections to film have
been, for the most part, unexplored. I contend that avant-garde cinema
newly illuminates her strategies of representation and embodiment;
the adjacency of Man Ray's article to "Mrs. Emerson" foregrounds the
complicity of the apparently distinct aesthetic discourses of modern
poetry and cinema. Film embodies Stein's notion of "a <I>groping</I> for
a continuous present" and "an inevitable beginning of beginning

<B></B>

again and again and again,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 what she earlier designates as "all living as repeating."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  Maya Deren refers to this kind of film measure as a "telescoping of
  time," "a continuous act of recognition," that becomes "like a strip
  of memory unrolling beneath the images of the film itself, to form
  the invisible underlayer of an implicit double exposure."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  With the relentlessly mechanical moving picture, memory becomes a
  form of erasure, and Stein, obsessed by the processes of forgetting,
  compared her written portraits to the cinema in which "one second
  was never the same as the second before or after" ("PR," 195). Stein
  praised the cinema's ability to render the temporal displacement of
  "existing" in which "the emphasis is different [with each repeated
  moment] just as the cinema has each time a slightly different thing
  to make it all be moving. And each one of us has to do that, otherwise
  there is no existing" ("PR," 179). With its elements of succession and
  variation, amnesia and movement, film seemed to solve the apparent
  conflict between inanimate mechanical reproduction and "existing,"
  and formed Stein's prototypic medium for embodying the vital flux and
  crisis of a "continuous present."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The modernist crisis of representation became, for many artists, a
crisis of embodiment; and experimental film made visible a body never
visible before--one at once whole and in pieces. Like other modernists,
Stein had to negotiate the literal, posttraumatic, bodily disrements
caused by World War I.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
  Further, although prevailing modernist paradigms sequestered the mind
  from the body, the corporeal became metonymic with film's materiality
  and haunted the literary works of this period. Stein's confessed
  attraction to film, however, contrasted with the more dismissive
  stance taken by other "high" modernists (among them T. S. Eliot,
  Ezra Pound, and Wallace Stevens) who associated film with the reviled,
  ephemeral body. Stein, by contrast, rejected the resources of the past,
  simultaneously insisting upon a willed forgetfulness--as if the shock
  of the present obliterates the capacity or desire to remember--and an
  expansion of bodily, sensory pleasures which Peter Nicholls has called
  the "bodily allure" of her words.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  Yet Stein's recuperations of viscerality did not assert bodily
  wholeness; rather, Stein's alternate modernism depended upon the
  incarnated, "existing," and, dismembered body materialized by
  avant-garde film.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here I explore specifically how the fragmented, repetitive bodies and
techniques of modernist experimental film (represented largely by Man
Ray's <I>Emak Bakia</I>) impact upon the decentered plots and bodily
disjunction of Stein's poems, and particularly of "Mrs. Emerson." Stein's
cinematic modernism relies upon the mechanical, circumambulatory bodily
depictions of both hysteria--the Freudian disease of modernity--and modern
comedy, iconicized for the avant-garde by Charlie Chaplin's trademark
gestural slapstick. I hope to show that the considerable attention
Stein devoted to the often interchangeable, cultural representations
of the hysteric and the comic originated from, respectively, her
early fascination with experimental psychology at Radcliffe in the
1890s (which culminated in a coauthored article, "Cultivated Motor
Automatism: A Study of the Character in its Relation to Attention"),
and her abiding fascination with Chaplin whose comedic semiotics of the
body she associated with the practice of her poetry. I further argue
that the modernist crisis of embodiment pervading the discourses of
psychology and the comedic connect the techniques of experimental film
with those of modern poetry.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Before exploring the relationship between these diverse res (Stein,
Man Ray, and Chaplin), however, it would be useful to establish how
modern poetry converged with the aesthetics of film montage, linking the
dislocated, automaton body of modernity with the avant-garde subordination
of plot to somatic, disjunctive rhythms. Sergei Eisenstein theorized
the connection between poetry and film by drawing, as Pound had done,
upon haiku and ideographic language, invoking rhythm and the "concept
of intervals," for instance, to explain montage.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  "The whole charm of poetry" emerges, his theory explicitly states,
  from the "reconstruction of the event in montage fragments" where "the
  plot is no more than a device" ("DA," 60-1). Evoking Flaubert's
  ideal of a book "about nothing," charged by the "force of its style,"
  Eisenstein emphasized that dramatic tension revolves around "the
  methodology of form--not content or plot!" ("DA," 49). These aesthetic
  criterion resonate with the antimimetic imperative in avant-garde film
  and Stein's poetic credo.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The kinship between modern poetry and film that I examine in this
essay hinges upon the subordination of plot to rhythm, but also upon a
montage aesthetics that privileges the fragment and its abrasion of other
fragments. Film "pieces," as Eisenstein defines montage, orchestrate in
a "rhythm" produced through the "collision of independent shots" ("DA,"
49). He emphatically asserts that artistic dynamism emerges out of the
"<I>irregularity of the part</I> in relation to the laws of the system as
a whole" ("DA," 47; emphasis added). Similarly, the dislocated bodies of
modernity, as we will see, depend upon the part as detachable from the
whole. Like Stein and Man Ray, Eisenstein foregrounds the fragmentary
moment--"[t]he shot is a montage cell"-- while giving it corporeal,
relational consequence ("DA," 53). Film art, like poetry, insists upon the
body in flux, not as transcendental signifier; Eisenstein consistently
construes montage as embodied poesis, even as that body composes itself
through the collision of fragments.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
However, while modern poetry and film intersected through the dislocated
body, the very somatic traumas of modernity made, as Walter Benjamin
writes in his famous essay on Baudelaire, the "possibility of lyric
poetry questionable."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  Film threatened to supplant poetry as a medium more suited to the
  immediacy and eviscerated attention of modernity: "There came a day
  when a new and urgent need for stimuli was met by the film. In a film,
  perception in the form of shocks was established as a formal principle"
  ("SM," 175). Baudelaire's capacity to place "shock experience at
  the very center of his artistic work," Benjamin claims, enabled his
  unique success, but raised the stakes for the body of the modern poem
  in competition with an emergent film medium ("SM," 163). Cinema more
  capably induces an automatic "reaction to shocks," Benjamin elaborates,
  since the "rhythm of production on a conveyer belt is the basis of
  the rhythm of reception in film" ("SM," 175).
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
  I hope to demonstrate, however, that Stein's poetry rendered this
  characteristic automatism issuing from overwhelming shock experience
  the "kinaesthetic" ground of her modernism. Like Benjamin's cinematic
  "conveyer belt," which relies on mechanical repetition, Stein's writing
  strove to reproduce dislocated experience where "one second was never
  the same as the second before or after" ("PR," 195).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Finally, Stein embodies Benjamin's model of modernity's accelerated
shock experience as it impinges upon "remembrance"--the crystallizing
of experience through reflection. According to Benjamin, reflex takes
over as modern consciousness strives for "protection against stimuli"
("SM," 161). Modern consciousness, in this way, approximates the
fragmenting shutter mechanism in film, and attention is held at the
expense of contiguity. Visceral shock jolts the body into grasping an
experience and simultaneously threatens to blot its memory. By contrast,
Proustian memory (in Benjamin's essay) commits itself to disinterring
what is uncovered by the "m&eacute;moire involuntaire," that which has
"not been experienced explicitly and consciously, what has not happened
to the subject as an experience" ("SM," 160). If, as Benjamin claims,
it is necessary for Proust to chance upon an object that will unfold
unconscious memories, Stein makes an art out of such stumbling for its
own sake. Her writing forgets itself as it perambulates. Lacking the
high modernist desire to monumentalize the past as interior or collective
memory, Stein enacts a consciousness embodied through automatic gesture
and immersed in the porous breakdown of continuity. Her writing--a kind of
shock absorber--resists remembering: "We in this period have not lived in
remembering, we have living in moving being necessarily so intense that
existing is indeed something, is indeed that thing that we are doing"
("PR," 182).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><A NAME="1" HREF="8.3mccabe_1.html">

ALIGN="LEFT"
SRC="button/8.3mccabe_1b.gif"></A>

Thus, the "series production" of Stein's modernism mechanizes and
fragments corporeality, creating a cinema of vivisection in which the
reflexive body does not quite hold together or congeal. Similarly, Man
Ray describes <I>Emak Bakia</I> in <I>Close Up</I> as adamantly serial
and partial, a "series of fragments, a cinepoem with a certain optical
sequence [that] make up a whole that still remains a fragment."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
  A still of repeating frames from the film accompanying
  Man Ray's article illustrates this emphasis on the part (<A
  HREF="8.3mccabe_1.html"> 1</A>). Precluding ultimate cohesion,
  Stein similarly articulates: "A whole is inside a part" in "Salad
  Dressing and an Artichoke."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  The "period of the cinema" consequently became for Stein the period
  of the fragment. "[I]t is not possible," she writes of her era,
  "to choose a completed sentence a completed thing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
  (Oddly, Stein responded with terror the first time she saw her "speaking
  body on screen" in a 1930s newsreel.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
  I propose that Stein's terror emerged from seeing herself as a whole,
  animate body in a reproduction that did not match her sense of
  dislocated corporeality.) Stein's emphasis on the fragment suggests
  Kaja Silverman's observation that "a unified bodily ego comes into
  existence only as the result of a laborious stitching together of
  disparate parts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
  While film allows for a continuous motion or present, the spliced
  pieces perpetuate its seeming smoothness.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first part of this essay develops the theme of Stein's (and to a
lesser extent, Man Ray's) debt to cinematic bodily representations
of plotlessness and the fragmented continuous present. It focuses
particularly on Charlie Chaplin's aimless, "jerky" gait as iconic for
the avant-garde in general and for Stein and Man Ray's art practices
in particular. The second section explores Stein's early experiments
in behavioral psychology and her understanding of the hysterical body
(or approximations of it) which culminated in her first publication
"Motor Automatism." While these experiments

<B></B>

remain largely unexamined, regarded as irrelevant to Stein's poetic
experiments, they dramatically prere her cinematic embodiment of
distracted and forgetful attention. The third portion of this essay
examines how modernist representations of the hysterical and comedic
body (already hinted at in "Motor Automatism") overlap, becoming
interchangeable through Henri Bergson's definitions of comedy and
Jean-Martin Charcot's formulations of hysteria. The essay concludes with
a detailed delineation of Stein's incorporation of these cultural tropes
of bodily dislocation in "Mrs. Emerson" through juxtaposition with Man
Ray's <I>Emak Bakia.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While many other texts might serve to demonstrate Stein's cinematic
writing (as Macpherson suggests), "Mrs. Emerson" forms an exemplary
"collection of repeated references," filmicly scored (<I>CM,</I>
25). Margaret Dickie suggests that Stein's "willingness to detach words
from referential meaning" and to arrange them in abstract designs often
overshadows her anatomizing of the body.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
  Yet "Mrs. Emerson" is at once both abstract, and explicitly sensory
  and physical: "I do not share unless you are coming unless you are
  coming to caress country."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
  Similarly, Man Ray's films are abstract and plotless (particularly
  <I>Emak Bakia</I>), and as Inez Hedges observes of Man Ray's <I>L'Etoile
  de Mer,</I> place the "human body on equal footing with objects."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
  Neither Stein nor Man Ray in their apparently "pure" antinarrativity
  forsakes embodiment, but instead focuses upon the body in segments
  and gestures. As popular icon, Charlie Chaplin haunts these texts,
  linking the gestural body, modernist comedy, and experimental

<B></B>

representation. Like Chaplin and Man Ray, Stein abandons the illusionist
ambitions of theater, and instead shows the piecemeal body engaged in
nonpurposive gestures. By triangulating these res, I hope to reveal
how Stein bridges an embodied slapstick with an abstract film aesthetic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein, as I have said, devises an aesthetic indebted to film's capacity to
track and splinter the shock of a "continuous present." Man Ray's films,
in turn, pivot upon a "series of fragments" that develop in several
instances out of his contact with avant-garde poets similarly invested
in the fragmentary and serial. The surrealist, trance-inspired poet,
Robert Desnos, for example, inspires Man Ray's second full-length film,
<I>L'Etoile de Mer</I> , and Mallarm&eacute;'s "A Throw of the
Dice Can Never Do Away with Chance" ignites his <I>Myst&egrave;re du
Chateau</I> . <I>Emak Bakia</I> begins with shots of a brightly lit
revolving merry-go-round to emphasize the inscriptive capacity of film,
"its status," Inez Hedges elaborates, as "'writing motion in lights'
(<I>kinematographein</I> and <I>photo-graphein</I>)" ("CV," 99). And
just as Man Ray is "adamant that there be no script," no progress in
<I>Emak Bakia,</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
  Stein's writing foregrounds its break from linear plot in a repeating
  and circular "communication":

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
If heating is beside the meal and the selection of masterpieces makes
communication, communication is ardently rechosen, communication is
suddenly respected, communication is suddenly resumed, communication is
suddenly rested, communication is suddenly respected, communication is
suddenly chosen communication is suddenly chosen. ("ME," 25)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The passage "selects" its parallel abstract strips and measured "beats,"
yet dramatizes the passive or involuntary; what "is suddenly chosen"
knits together words buried in other words by linguistic dislocation,
as with "rested" in "respected."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Further, neither "Mrs. Emerson" nor <I>Emak Bakia,</I> despite their
titles, follows a single character. In Stein's piece, an "I" shifts
to a "she" or "he"; pronouns are merely instrumental. Nowhere does
"Mrs. Emerson" (only a ghostly transcendental re) materialize, and
"characters" appear and quickly evaporate. "Mrs. Evangeline Henderson
came in" only to vanish immediately ("ME," 23). Like Stein's writing,
Man Ray's film denies a stable subjectivity. <I>Emak Bakia,</I> he tells
us, is the name of his patron's estate and comes from a Basque saying
that means "leave me alone." Both "Mrs. Emerson" and <I>Emak Bakia</I>
resist propriety and continuity, and yet grapple with embodiment as
self-consciously aware of its filmable, evanescent and fragmentary
character. Hedges points out in her essay on Man Ray's <I>L'Etoile de
Mer,</I> that "pellicule"--Latin for "little skin"--designates "the idea
of celluloid as skin," a fact that becomes resonant with Man Ray who
"would typically write on his film"; in this context, each shot denotes
a temporal marking and shedding of skin or bodily surface ("CV," 99).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Man Ray's actual relationship with Stein ended abruptly, but further
reveals their interart cross-hatchings. P. Adams Sitney observes that
Man Ray's photograph, used for the frontispiece of the successful <I>The
Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas,</I> featured Alice in a doorway and
eclipsed Stein "deep in shadows as she sits writing at a table."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
  And Man Ray recollected in his <I>Self Portrait</I> that his "portraits
  of Gertrude Stein were the first to appear in print, to give her small
  circle of readers at the time an idea of how she looked."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
  At this time he exchanged some prints for Stein's "portrait of [him]
  in prose" (<I>SP,</I> 260). With the subsequent publication of <I>The
  Autobiography,</I> she required publicity photographs, but when Man
  Ray sent a "modest bill," Stein refused payment on the grounds that
  "we were all struggling artists" (<I>SP,</I> 260). Their exchange of
  portraits led paradoxically to their estrangement from one another.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein's meeting with Chaplin, by contrast, points towards an imagined
identification. She viewed her art as a necessary precursor to his, or
at least as a simultaneous mirror of it,acknowledging Chaplin's iconic
importance for the Parisian avant-garde crowd in <I>The Autobiography</I>:
"The clowns had commenced dressing up in misfit clothes instead of the
old classic costume and these clothes later so well known on Charlie
Chaplin were the delight of Picasso and all her friends."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
  Chaplin himself summed up Stein's admiring perception of his work as
  avant-garde plotlessness when they met in the 1930s, "She would like
  to see me in a movie just walking up the street and turning a corner,
  then another corner, and another" (<I>MM,</I> 159). And Stein extolled
  Chaplin's early gestural films during and before World War I rather
  than his later plot-driven ones. For her, the poet and the comedian vie
  for an inaugural role: "he wanted the sentiment of movement invented by
  himself and I wanted the sentiment of doing nothing invented by myself"
  (<I>MM,</I> 160); implicitly, she saw herself as initiator of both.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

When Chaplin screened in Paris, " 'the little tramp,'" or "Charlot,"
as he was called, emerged as "the new hero of the literary avant-garde,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
  the very "embodiment of modernity" in his "resistance to meaning"
  ("CR," 92). Walter Benjamin observed that the surrealist poet Philippe

his example) to construct a film with a theme and variations--in short,

French film critic Robert Aaron specifically paired Chaplin with Man Ray
in their "delight in dislocation" whereby "they create peculiar breaks in

  And for Louis Aragon, such narrative and somatic dislocations reflected

This small compendium of Chaplin as iconic re adumbrates a dislocative
body that animated and haunted the antimimetic work of avant-gardists
like Stein and Man

<B></B>

Ray. Accordingly, Fernand L&eacute;ger memorialized the cubist
Chaplin as living machine in <I>Ballet M&eacute;canique</I> (<A
HREF="8.3mccabe_2.html"> 2</A>). One shot in <I>Emak
Bakia</I> used a diagram of a jumping man from Jules-Etienne Marey's
scientific motion studies, a borrowing that accents automatic dissolutive
locomotion. Importing his own collage-sculpture <I>Dancer/Danger</I>
made of cogs and wheels for another image, Man Ray rendered it kinetic
with a spiral of smoke, its ambivalent sign <I>Dancer/Danger</I>
perhaps suggesting L&eacute;ger's earlier mechanical and endangered
(about to fall apart) body. This mechanistic trope owed precedence to
Chaplin himself who, Benjamin observed, is "his own walking trademark"
with his spasmodic, nonpurposive gait.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
  It seems that Chaplin "cannot walk. He cannot put one foot in front of
  the other. He cannot move forward," Willy Hass remarked in 1923 ("CR,"
  106). Gilles Deleuze further describes this trajectory as a function
  of time: "Charlie caught in the instant, moving from one instant to
  the next, each requiring his full powers of improvisation; finally,
  the line of the universe which he describes in this way, the broken
  stroke which makes itself felt even in the angular swerves of his walk."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Chaplin's gait as both a continuous present and a "broken swerve"
is symptomatic of the modernist obsession with nonteleological
movement. Pound found an early form of such kinesthetic gesture in
Noh theatre that rendered an "art of splendid posture, of dancing and
chanting and of acting that is not mimetic."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
  Elizabeth Grosz accurately summarizes Nietzsche's notion of an embodied
  practice of knowledge: "Philosophy

<B></B>

itself was to be written walking--or, preferably, dancing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
  Such embodiment, she adds, roots itself in the corporeal "incapacity to
  grasp all": "There is nothing beyond the multiplicity of perspectives,
  positions, bodily forces" (<I>VB,</I> 128). Yet both Pound and
  Nietzsche's delight in dance miss the nuance introduced through
  mechanical reproduction in its ability to expose the body's loss of
  control, dislocation, and propensity to automatism. This aspect of
  modernity's nonmimetic art crystallizes in Chaplin who may assume the
  sudden ability to skate with acrobatic grace in <I>The Rink</I> ,
  but whose elastic body is never rendered entirely volitional. In the
  opening of <I>The Tramp</I> , for example, Chaplin is successively
  knocked down by a motor car; no sooner does he dust himself off than
  he is once more struck down, as if aware only of the discrete moment
  and the purely reflexive. Each repeated motion undoes itself so that
  it appears both that Chaplin will never progress across the road and
  that he must "pull himself together" with each tumble.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>

Significantly, Stein's circumlocutory comic mode, her "broken stroke,"
is intertwined with her cinematic impulses. As with avant-garde film,
"what matters" in silent film comedy "is that the units follow each
other uninterruptedly, not that their succession implements a plot."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
  Similarly, in his book on silent comedians, Walter Kerr cites Chaplin's

<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
  constituting a "reflexivity" that foregrounds the comic
  "interchangeability of things" and the instability in metaphor itself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
  Chaplin becomes paradigmatic of the successive slippages Stein performs
  in her modernist experiments. Chaplin's "awareness of instability,"
  Kerr further proposes, taught him to dance, a practice which acts like a
  "crowbar to detach him from the action" (<I>SC,</I> 92). And Benjamin's
  characterization of Baudelaire's "jerky gait," his very physical "art
  of being off center" likewise anticipates this modernist method of
  detachment from plot, and the way Stein manages to "keep centre well
  half full" ("SM," 176, "ME," 23). Indeed, locomotion, intentionally of
  a mistaken or circular kind, is a recurrent motif in Stein. These comic
  one-liners exemplify her balancing act and rejection of continuity:
  "Call me semblances. / I call you a cab, sir" (<I>LB,</I> 32). "What
  do you do to stop. / What do you do to go on. / I do the same," she
  writes in <I>Lifting Belly,</I> followed a few lines later with "what
  do you do to turn a corner" (ibid.). Such lines, indicating propulsion
  along with relapsing, reverberate with her sense of Chaplin's endless
  circumnavigation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These kinds of bodily dislocations also point towards the modern trope
of the evasive hysteric, culminating in Freud's frustrated attempt to
master Dora's body by pinning down her symptomatic acts in a coherent
narrative. Before Freud, Jean-Martin Charcot's "theater of living
pathology" at the Salpetri&egrave;re Hospital in the 1870s and 1880s
preres the cinematic reproduction of bodily movement, his photographs
of hysterical gestures here suggestive of the dislocated bodies of Stein,
Chaplin, and Man Ray.

Motor Automatism and Hysteria
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein studied with both William James and Hugo M&uuml;nsterberg, author of
the seminal <I>Photoplay</I> , at Radcliffe in the early 1890s and
became acutely interested in psychophysiological models of human behavior.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
  After conducting experiments in automatic writing under the
  supervision of M&uuml;nsterberg, Stein's 1896 debut in publishing,
  "Motor Automatism" (in the <I>Harvard Psychological Review</I>),
  tellingly belonged to the emergent field of experimental psychology. She
  published this piece with Leon Solomons along with an addendum,
  "Cultivated Motor Automatism: A Study of Character in its Relation to
  Attention," written solely by herself. These articles reveal Stein's
  early obsession with the relationship between bodily sensation,
  attention and memory. Ultimately, Stein's comic and filmic sensibility
  relied upon acts of willed automatism that heighten the fragmentariness
  and dislocations within reiterative gesture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In order to understand Stein's rendering of bodily gesture--and her link
to both Chaplin and Man Ray--I will look in some detail at these first
publications. Linda Wagner-Martin describes them as an early discounting
of "automatic writing," a point corroborated by Stein's disavowal
in <I>The Autobiography</I>: "Gertrude Stein never had subconscious
reactions, nor was she a successful subject for automatic writing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
  However, while "Motor Automatism" examines the "limits of normal
  automatism" and the acts of so-called normal people as opposed to
  those of hysterical subjects, the article determines that automatism
  permeates the everyday activities of the nonhysterical subject.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
  (Stein and Solomons, I should note, are the only "normal" subjects of
  the experiment in the first article.) At the same time, they consider
  hysteria as linked to automatism especially in terms of the phenomenon
  of "double personality," the experience of dissociation often red by
  the detachment of a bodily organ from consciousness, or rather as the
  detachment of motor impulse from consciousness of it as proprioceptive
  ("MA," 9).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The enmeshment of the psychical with the kinesthetic as well as the
dislocation between these domains constitute the basis for Stein's comedy
and her cinematic modernism. Significantly, Stein and Solomons anchor
"the feeling of personality" in an "expectation represented by the group
of feelings we have called, for convenience, the motor impulse" ("MA,"
26). They assert that the "writing of a word at dictation" involves
"the formation of a motor impulse" that "consists of a melange of visual
and kinesthetic material--whatever ordinarily innervates our writing--as
well as other elements not easily described" ("MA," 14). The absenting
of consciousness from motor impulses leads then, as they formulate it,
to automatism, or in more severe cases, to hysteria.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In their first experiment, they instructed their subject to "get himself
as deeply interested in a novel as possible" and at the same time to ready
himself to take dictation ("MA," 10). They conclude that "although the
arm does not really move spontaneously, yet any movement once started
up tends to continue of itself" unless "deliberately checked by the
will of the subject" ("MA," 11). Induced automatic writing leads to an
experience of the "extra personal" or put more bluntly: "It is not he
but his arm that is doing it" (ibid.). The subject, when sufficiently
distracted, loses a sense "of intention or desire," producing the
"tendency to <I>movement from purely sensory stimuli,</I> independent of
any conscious motor impulse or volition" ("MA," 12; emphasis added). This
dissociation between "personality" and attention forms an early example of
the automatism issuing from the sensory bombardment of modernity Benjamin
will describe, and preres Chaplin's comedic body, his automaton,
jerky reception of shocks.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Furthermore, the experiment implies not only that bodily movement
or reflexive sensation can become dislocated from consciousness, but
also questions the efficacy of memory or its coincidence with motor
impulses in the act of writing. Knowledge emerges "by sensations from
the arm." The subject

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
was conscious that he just had written a word, not that he was about
to do so. While mere scribbling went on the subject would scarcely be
conscious that he was doing anything. . . . Small words would usually
be completely written before the subject knew about it. ["MA," 12-3]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These observations denote ruptures or "lapses in consciousness"; only
belatedly does the subject remember the activity of his arm. Thus memory
does not function to bolster identity, but contributes to a feeling of
dislocation. Knowledge comes late, after the fact, in the "memory after
image" ("MA," 15). Similarly, simultaneous action--reading and taking
dictation at once as in Stein's experimental study--further fractures
the experience of the body which is paradoxically both attentive and
distracted in its dispersal among activities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
  Chaplin in <I>Sunnyside</I> , for example, embodies this kind

While the article is written collaboratively, "Motor Automatism" is
prescient of Stein's writing processes, particularly her penchant for
repetition and its somatic impetus.

For instance, one paragraph of the essay delineating the characteristics
of "unconscious memory and invention" reads:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
<I>A marked tendency to repetition.</I>--A phrase would seem to get into
the head and keep repeating itself at every opportunity, and hang over
from day to day even. The stuff written was grammatical, and the words
and phrases fitted together all right, but there was not much connected
thought. The unconsciousness was broken into every six or seven words
by flashes of consciousness, so that one cannot be sure but what the
slight element of connected thought which occasionally appeared was due
to these flashes of consciousness. But the ability to write stuff that
sounds all right, without consciousness, was fairly well demonstrated
by the experiments. ["MA," 21]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this passage, repetition is not connective, but rather functions much
like a reflexive motor impulse. Anticipating Eisenstein's delineation of a
montage style that exceeds plot and the dislocated body accompanying it,
the passage also suggests that grammatical writing which "fits together"
is not necessarily "connected thought."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
  The interruptive "flashes of consciousness" produce only dilatory
  coherence.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The language of "Motor Automatism" uncannily both resembles Man
Ray's <I>kinematographein</I> and echoes William James's "Stream of
Consciousness"  where he describes consciousness as "a kaleidoscope
revolving," with the flight between repeating images taking precedence
over the resting upon a final or static assemblage of images.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
  As if referring to Man Ray's experimental film and the avant-gardist's
  use of the camera, James depicts a mobile consciousness engaged in
  continual rearrangement, governed by shifts between "magical rapidity"
  and "relatively stable forms" ("SC," 180-1). Stein and Solomons
  import this sense of fractured and contingent subjectivity and link
  it more fully than James to kinesthetic experience. A shifting in
  tempo and rhythm become a visceral fluctuation between distraction and
  belated attention, demonstrated by this semi-confessional observation:
  "Miss Stein found it sufficient distraction often to simply read what
  her arm wrote, but following three or four words behind her pencil"
  ("MA," 21).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Stein's follow-up article, "Cultivated Motor Automatism," she included
more subjects. This investigation of automatic writing delineates two
personality types (foreshadowing her classification of human character in
<I>The Making of Americans</I>): Type II, as she calls this personality,
is more prone to automatism and "is much nearer the common one described
in books on hysteria" than Type I.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
  Assuming a kind of Charcotian role, Stein oscillates between guiding
  the hands of her Type II subjects and releasing them to their own
  impulses. She choreographs or "cultivates" the "decidedly rhythmic
  character" of motility:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

At first there was a continued return to the old movement or to no
movement, but gradually came an <I>aimless indefinite movement,</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another of her Type II, protohysteric subjects verges on slapstick,
dynamized by mechanical automatism: "He had a spontaneous movement of
a circle made with the swing of the whole arm. He began these circles,
gradually increasing in speed, not breaking into any other movement,
just a continued rush of circles" ("CMA," 32).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Real automatism," Stein and Solomons assert, occurs "<I>whenever
the attention is sufficientlydistracted</I>" ("CMA," 14). Hysteria
becomes thereby truly the disease of a modernity characterized by the
onslaught of shock experience. Furthermore, if hysteria, as Stein and
Solomons reiterate, is a "<I>disease of attention</I>" ("MA," 26),
then film becomes an aesthetic equivalent by its paradoxical capacity
to hypnotize and to diffuse sensory experience, to hold and to divert
attention. Accordingly, Stein and Solomons summarize their findings:
"Our problem was to get sufficient control of the attention to effect this
removal of attention. In hysteria this removal of attention is effected
by the anesthesia of the subject. We <I>would</I> not, the histerique
<I>can</I> not, attend to these sensations" ("MA," 25). In its distinction
between willed and involuntary loss of attention or anesthesia, the
article points towards the avant-garde's purposeful oscillation between
"derangement of the senses" (to invoke Rimbaud's influential aesthetic)
and control. As "operator," Stein and Solomons will their own distraction,
yet suggest that "habits of attention" often partake of the unconscious
or appear involuntary, a dialectic that will underpin <I>Emak Bakia</I>
and "Mrs. Emerson."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
  These experiments afforded Stein an early opportunity to visualize
  and construct the dislocated body that will animate her poetics.

Comic/Hysteric Bodies: Charlot/Charcot
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Jean-Martin Charcot's Tuesday lecture/performances of hysterical
bodies suffering the "disease of attention" at the Salpetri&egrave;re
Hospital deflect narrative, and revolve around the nonpurposive gesture
characteristic of what I am calling modernist comedy. Elisabeth Bronfen
summarizes Charcot's reading of hysteria as "somatic performance of traces
of a psychically traumatic shock" that reveal the "hysterical" body as
disruptive of coherent plot: "It articulates through an unjust image,
speaking deceptively, obliquely" (<I>KS,</I> 175). The body abstracts
itself as it articulates "the radical nothing that experiences of loss
entail" (<I>KS,</I> 188). It is this "radical nothing" that converges
with the comic mode typified for avant-gardists by Chaplin in his
"resistance to meaning." Suggestively, the second phase of the hysterical
attack, as mapped by Charcot, is the "period of grands movements, of
contortions and body dislocations," what he "came to call the clown
phase [<I>p&eacute;riode clonique</I>]" (<I>KS,</I> 180). (Stein's
experimental subject, detached from purpose, rapidly swinging his arms,
comes to mind.) The hysteric body, formalized and framed by Charcot and
his followers, becomes interchangeable with the comic body in modernist
cultural discourse.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Henri Bergson's extended essay, "Laughter: An Essay on the Meaning of
the Comic" , confines itself to the theater for its exempla, but
nevertheless reveals how these two bodies, the comic and the hysteric,
overlap in the cinematic aesthetic of

<B></B>

Stein, Chaplin, and Man Ray.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
  (Bergson, incidentally, had been among the attendees at a Charcot
  performance.) As if echoing Stein's essay with Solomons, he considers
  the comedic body's capacity for repetition and automatism as signifying
  the loss of an otherwise necessarily "constant alert attention" to
  the needs of the moment, as a slip into absentmindedness (<I>L,</I>
  22). In such a state, the body abjures its "tension and elasticity"
  and so partakes of the unwilled mechanical. Bergson elaborates, "The
  attitudes, gestures and movements of the human body are laughable in
  exact proportion as that body reminds us of a mere machine" (<I>L,</I>
  32). (Chaplin in <I>The Rink</I> turns his cane into a crank,
  a prosthetic extension of his body, using it to wind up his rival
  as if both bodies are mechanical.) Comedy, he contends, "consist[s]
  in looking upon life as a repeating mechanism, with reversible action
  and interchangeable parts" and persists only as life "forgets itself"
  (<I>L,</I> 94).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As I have already noted, Stein often poses as an amnesiac, using
repetition to foreground dissociation: "Let me recite what history
teaches. History teaches," she writes in "If I Told Him: A Completed
Portrait of Picasso."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
  The joke here relies on the way her repetition undermines itself as
  the sentence jerkily springs back to its initial iteration. In the
  same piece, she refers to a camera's attentive "selection" of images:
  "Shutters shut and open so do queens. Shutters shut and shutters and so
  shutters shut and shutters and so and so shutters and so shutters shut
  and so shutters shut and shutters and so" ( "CPP," 21-2). The
  shutters "shut and open" just as the film shot both reveals and
  covers in the crisis of a continuous present. Experimental film--and
  Stein's writing--foregrounds this activity, otherwise unnoticeable
  in conventional narrative film, which as Garrett Stewart (<I>Between
  Film and Screen: Modernism's Photo Synthesis</I>) puts it in another
  context, represses the material joining of images in a "successive
  overlapping flow."
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
  The present urgency of "[n]ot to-day" ("Mrs. Emerson") as well as the
  phrasing of "[s]hutters shut and so and so" ("A Completed Portrait
  of Picasso") accommodates the "[c]lick, clack, lack--in that double
  absentation of the forgone and the just gone past."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With the bodily pun of "shudders," Stein's portrait of Picasso emerges in
autonomic flickers: "He he he he and he and he and and he and he and he
and he and and as and as he and as he and he" ("CPP," 23). Incremental
repetition of this kind calls for supreme attention by the reader
and threatens a comic forgetfulness, the consequence of slipping up by
covering the same ground. Yet in repeating, Stein mimics the infinitesimal
recuperations necessary for slapstick. (Think of Chaplin's classic clown
fall, legs over the head, followed by his springing upright in opening
road shots in <I>The Tramp.</I>) Bergson sums up how such useless activity
turns comic, albeit abyssal, if still pivoting on a "radical nothing" of
hysteria: "To cover a good deal of ground only to come back unwittingly
to the starting-point, is to make a great effort for a result that is nil"
(<I>L,</I> 80).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Similarly, the opening of "Mrs. Emerson," both abstract and irregular,
requires our "distracted attention" in its reiteration of "the regular
way" or the hazardous twists and turns of the moment:

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

The regular way of instituting clerical resemblances and neglecting
 hazards and bespeaking combinations and heroically and heroically

 celebrations, the certainty, because centre well half full whether it has

 23]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In "celebrating instances" and "neglecting hazards," the unanchored
subject in this prose poem paragraph "has forgotten." The repetitions
compel attention to "suffer" and "submit" to "extra changes"; the
wayward circle closes just when the "way" has been forgotten.As with
Stein's rhythmic discontinuities in the above passage, Chaplin's seeming
forgetful body is strategic miscoordination; "neglecting hazards," he
ignores the ever present possibility of falling apart or stumbling into
an unexpected abyss.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such deliberate aimlessness expresses itself in the partiality of gesture,
which Bergson defines as that which expresses "without aim or profit"
and which "slips out unawares, automatic . . . [as] an isolated part of
the person is expressed, unknown to, or at least apart from the whole
of the personality" (<I>L,</I> 129-30). Stein's teacher, William
James, likewise emphasizes "parts" in his delineation of empiricism:
"[It] starts from the parts, and makes of the whole a collection" ("SC,"
10). Perhaps more illuminating to Stein's poetics is James's protofilmic
foreshadowing of Eisenstein's notion of disproportionate intervals: "When
we take a general view of the wonderful stream of our consciousness, what
strikes us first is the different paces of its parts" ("SC," 178). The
interest lies between shots, within the gaps between "paces" and "parts"
that disrupt the illusion of spectatorial wholeness; narrative coherence
relies on concealing the transitive acts of connection. A close-up of
these stepping-stones in "semi-grammatical" structure (to use DeKoven's
sense of Stein's experimental writing) short-circuits linear narrative.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
  By repeating articles and divesting a sentence of a subject in,
  for instance, "And also and so and so and also," Stein enacts a
  comic rhythm that suspends resolution; there is perhaps no surprise
  in finding "so" in "also" but in sequencing and parsing these phrases
  she makes deliberately unexpected re-turns. <I>Emak Bakia,</I> as does
  "Mrs. Emerson," similarly interprets "the sentiment of movement" as
  serial and fractured in a turn away from mimetic expectations. While
  not overtly comic, the avant- garde film diverts itself in the fragment,
  "turning a corner, then another, and another."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Finally, in the bodily syntax of hysteria, like that of the comic gesture,
the part becomes detachable and reiterable as, according to Grosz,
"[t]he intensity of one zone is displaced onto another bodily zone"
(<I>VB,</I> 77). For her, "[t]his implies that there is a lability of
meaning for the various bodily organs, zones, and processes. Any one zone
of the body can, under certain circumstances, take on the meaning of any
other zone" (<I>VB,</I> 78). Such transposition between bodily regions
suggests forgetfulness, or a kind of anesthesia, that acts as the bodily
equivalent to aesthetic dislocations, or "the coming together of disparate
surfaces," made possible by experimental montage (<I>VB,</I> 198).

In the same issue of <I>Close Up</I> which features Stein's

serial and partial, a "series of fragments, a cinepoem with a certain
optical sequence [that] make up a whole that still remains a fragment"
("EB<I>,"</I> 40). In language reminiscent of the shutter action of
the camera, he explains "its reasons for being are in its inventions of
light-forms and movements, while the more objective parts interrupt the
monotony of abstract inventions or serve as punctuation" (ibid.). Body
pieces will punctuate, as it were, other defamiliarized images. One
sequence features a close-up of a series of walking women's legs,
seen only partially; as if to disembody their movement, we then see a
quick ghost image of the same legs. Man Ray visceralizes the fragment in
another instance in which Kiki's poised lips punctuate less recognizable
shapes. Immediacy is invoked and then undercut to foreground the mechanism
of repetition and sequencing.

After its swirling title shot, <I>Emak Bakia</I> begins with
a side-view of a man looking through a camera, one with several
lenses that rotate and which are here superimposed on the front of
the image along with the cameraman's physical eye directed at us
(<A HREF="8.3mccabe_3.html"> 3</A>). Immediately, Man Ray
calls attention to the fact, as Sitney observes, that "films are shot
through lenses," the world seen "through layers of glass"; multiple
lenses and filters intervene between eye and object (<I>MM</I>, 29). The
camera does not <I>see</I> or attend, but <I>disassembles.</I> The film
"invents" almost every cinematic device possible to degrade the mimetic
image and to underscore its mechanical materiality, its moment-to-moment
piecing through superimposition, out-of-focus, animation, film reversal,
double-exposure, and rayograms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
  Throughout, "revolving kaleidoscopic" movement (to reuse James's
  descriptive phrase) decenters the camera eye as it hypnotizes the
  viewer to the point of dizziness or anesthesia and each film rhythm
  correlates as gestural fragment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The rapid motion of the camera, sometimes spun or shaken, denotes
a body both willing its convulsivity and "neglecting hazards." Man
Ray turns the ocean upside down, showing Kiki apparently dead, eyes
painted on her eyelids (replicating the camera's multiple lenses); as
she wakes and her head spins upside down in the last shot of the film,
Man Ray scripts <I>Emak Bakia</I> as "dreamed" rather than willed. As
she opens her eyes, he raises Kiki ratively from the dead. She has
been an unconscious automaton, now upsetting our expectations of bodily
inertness, she partakes of a doubling of the self that Stein refers to in
cases of hysteria. And, as Benjamin suggests, <I>we</I> become implicitly
such automatons when viewing a film and are subject to a "disease of
attention." <I>Emak Bakia,</I> like other experimental films, thus both
"cultivates" and resists psychical displacement by underscoring the very
motor impulses that make the viewing of a film possible. Paradoxically,
the film distracts while it hones our attention.

consciousness. What can the body do without full

This quick overview seeks to demonstrate the way <I>Emak Bakia</I>

her insistence upon nonpurposive circularity. Rejecting transparency
for the opacity of a screen, she writes, "I will repeat I will not

experimental filmmaker piecing together the film, Stein counterpoints
what she "means" and "believes" and "wills" (words repeated throughout)
with disjunctive "shock" images, as with the gender subversive, "I mean to
believe that soldiers order pearls" ("ME," 28). Delighting in dislocation
and multiple lenses, she breaks up attention: "They remembered mentioning,
they saw eight angles, they meant to do mending" ("ME," 29). "Mending"
is willed stitching that offers only intermittent remembering; the
fragment thrives. Stein's physical engagement involves "mounting"
a series of inconclusive resembling shots, as in this telling passage:

I thought that I would state that I knew certainly that she was so seen
that if her eyes were so placed not violently not verbally so placed. She
is not agreeable. She is not so agreeable. I think it is what I said
what I recognized in mounting her. I mounted her there. Deliberate. She
has a son not a son he was a thicker one. I go on. Begun. Bessie is like
Bertha. ["ME," 24, 25]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Where is the <I>there</I> or body being mounted? The passage will "go
on." Stein retracts, modifies and then returns to a deliberate groove of
sonic (and comic) gesture--"son" "son" "one" "begun." Carolyn Burke has
pointed out the sexual overtones of "splice" in relation to Mina Loy,
Stein, and Marianne Moore in its "modalities of joining and separation,
union and disunion." Here, similarly, the embodied, erotic act of
"mounting" suggests the positioning of a camera on a tripod and the
deliberate work of editing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What is "placed," as Stein puts it, displaces Ralph Waldo Emerson's
"transparent eyeball" (alluded to by her title), initiating one in
a series of mis-recognitions or slippages in attention. Rather than
mounting a singular subject, "Mrs. Emerson" introduces a number of
resembling and reassembling shapes (as does <I>Emak Bakia,</I> even in its
semianagrammatic title): "Mrs. Evangeline Henderson went in. She said that
the morning. She said that in listening. No I will not be funny" ("ME,"
23). Such comic sentences pivot upon language as mechanistic and serial:
"Please copy this. Others able to copy this. Others able to copy this
after" ("ME," 26). Stein deflects the purposive so that she can combine
"the sentiment of movement" with the "sentiment of getting nowhere."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"I cannot see I cannot see I cannot see. I cannot see" ("ME," 24), she
reiterates. The "I/eye" founders so that she returns to unilluminating
fractured refrain--as in the celebrated scene in <I>The Circus</I> when
Chaplin is lost in a fun house of multiplying mirrors. One of Stein's fun
house mirror sentences reads, "I say I do know Bessie. Bessie resembles
Bertha. Paula resembles Bessie. Bessie resembles Bertha Bessie resembles
Bertha. I do not offer to determine whether Paula and Bertha and Bessie
are distinctly separate" ("ME," 28).
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
  The spring in this genealogy loses its tension and elasticity in willed
  autonomic gesture and retraction. (When Chaplin exits the fun house to
  evade the police, he camouflages as a mechanical adornment.) Continuity,
  red through disavowed kinship, flickers forth in hysteric jerks:
  "My sister she is not my sister she is my sister" ("ME," 24).

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein mounts a skewed "family photo" animated by a paternal crisis:
"Will you give this to your fathers. It is natural without children
natural. They didn't expect that Hannah would be in it. They didn't
expect that he would seem to be sat upon a single piece of cardboard
box" ("ME," 27). Is this the Emersonian father as tramp who "would seem
to be sat upon"? The piece accelerates in this centrifugal revolving:
"One of his brothers the man was descending by his brother. They thought
nothing of it naturally one would have objected. They seemed searchful. It
gives you some arrangement you see" (ibid.). Which brother is which? A
typical comic scenario of doubling and searching abandons plot to
mechanistically give us "some kind of arrangement," "fathers" that are
"brothers," words refracting in resemblance and deflating the paternal,
"I do not care to remember what I do not feather. I do not remember
whether a flavour is farther" (ibid.). The text recalls itself in its
father-feather-flavour-farther rotation (producing something akin to the
rotating prisms in <I>Emak Bakia</I>). By not building towards resolution,
"Mrs. Emerson" wills forgetfulness rather than temporal legacy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like Man Ray's manipulations of "light forms and movements," as he calls
them, Stein yokes incohesive bodily parts and sensory experience through
synesthesia. She crosses, for instance, erotogenic zone with color: "I do
not say that green is believed to be that color. I do not say that green
makes lips." Or, alternately, she compactly registers the ephemera of
movement, the contiguous scraps within "d&eacute;cor": "Water is coloured
by the sudden departure of all the interested readers of a newspaper."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
  In another passage that mimics automatic writing, Stein's roving
  subject displaces the visual and confesses, "I can't help it. I can't
  help hearing carrots. I do help it, I do help it fastening chocolate. A
  secret time in spinning."
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
  The humor of what can't be helped emphasizes the automatic, the way
  sensory experience (and the chocolate "fix") provokes and can unravel
  bodily reflex even as the mind desires control: "I hope that I select
  that I retain" ("ME," 25).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While "Mrs. Emerson" dramatizes the effort of consciousness to will
selection, Stein insists upon wandering within kinaesthetic mapping,
"I do not select to have similar sounds. Bertha can be surrounded. Bertha
can be surrounded by so much saliva" ("ME," 26). The unexpected jump to
"saliva," to a sign of autonomic, Pavlovian process that "surrounds,"
counterpoints Stein's willed, "selective" arrangement. Mechanical
gesture or utterance here draws into the forefront the choreography of
"kin-aesthetic" experience, its lapses and recoveries. What Stewart calls
"continual splicing on the run," or "cinema's intrinsic dismemberment,"
becomes realized as the body simultaneously forgets and recalls its
temporal viscerality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The last lines of "Mrs. Emerson" provide what could be the scenario
for a short abstract film with its "delight in dislocation," its comic,
nonpurposive, shot-by-shot measure:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein makes physical motion, serial and suspended, stand out against
"exceptional white." Desire ("I wish") and volition ("to go and get her")
constantly resume. It is as if she is thinking of the dislocated body,
red here as a Pavlovian dog, responding to "a climbing bell," its
response beginning again and again "all over it." In <I>The Fireman</I>
, a bell similarly automates Chaplin's mechanical body usually
to no avail; his body remembers its reflexes even as he forgets their
purpose. And, again and again, Man Ray's camera animates a detached
motion--Kiki's eyes opening and shutting, for instance--only to join it
with another gestural fragment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Finally, what Bergson found comic in the theater--the use of the
mechanically repeated fragment or monomaniacal trait--takes on
new valence in Stein's cinematic enactment of the modern crisis of
embodiment. Apparently disavowing "the voice" of theater in favor of
the silent film's dislocative body, she declares in "Mrs. Emerson,"
"I do not see why a voice is necessary." She also refers to "silent
rugs" and "late carpet," evoking the tactility of a film screen and
the mounting of fabric ("ME," 26). These references resonate with her
favoring silent film over theater (in the context of Chaplin); the former
"could change the rhythm but if you had a voice accompanying naturally
after that you could never change the rhythm you were always held by the
rhythm the voice gave them" (<I>MM,</I> 160). Stein's allusion to "voice"
here suggests that it inhibits the rhythmic discontinuity of experience,
attempting to provide the hysteric body with a coherent plot.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Stein and her generation were, therefore, not only "bound by the period
of cinema and series production," but by the fluctuating body of a
continuous present. Stein consciously perceived herself as writing a
form of divagatory cinema with the body as comic/hysteric "repeating
mechanism," her crisis of embodiment bridging the experimental aesthetics
of Man Ray with the popular icon of Chaplin's dislocated body. Film's
spasmodic dance away from causal plot thus reverberates in Stein,
unhinged from destination, a gestural body of malleable mechanics that
interrogates its volition and processes of attention.

While beyond the specific focus of this essay, Stein's negotiation of
trauma and memory manifests itself in her "war poetry." Stein and Alice
B. Toklas volunteered for the American Fund for the French Wounded in
1916; transporting the wounded, they were face-to-face with the physical
effects of war, yet Stein renders eyewitness events from a dissociated,
disjointed perspective. Stein and Toklas spent 1915 to 1916 in Majorca
in retreat from the war, but it remains in view: "Sometimes we look at
boats. When we read about a boat we know that it has been sunk." Gertrude

Benjamin's "conveyer belt" manifests itself vividly in <I>Modern
Times</I> , where Chaplin's body becomes coextensive with the
factory machine. Stein alludes to the potentially anaesthetic effects
of repetition without variation in <I>Making of Americans</I> :
"If they get deadened by the steady pounding of repeating they will not
learn from each one even though each one always is repeating the whole
of them they will not learn the completed history of them, they will
not know the being really in them" (<I>MA,</I> 61). At this juncture,
Stein still aims towards "completion" rather than the fragmentary which,
under the shadow of her "failure" to produce "a complete history of every
one who was or is or will be living," becomes one of her keynotes. She
begins her portrait writing in 1908 when she starts to doubt the idea
of producing the "complete history."

Stein's early years in Paris brought her into the circles of prominent
avant-gardists, among them Apollinaire, Max Jacob, and Picasso, and
under their influence, she "moved increasingly toward the surreal." Linda
Wagner-Martin, <I>Favored Strangers: Gertrude Stein and Her Family</I>
(New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press, 1995), 112; hereafter

of surrealism, and in fact, espouses notably nonsurrealist tactics, such
as sobriety: "I must be sober. It is so much more exciting to be sober,
to be exact and concentrated and sober" ("PR," 198). Furthermore, even
as she invokes the re of the hysteric, Stein never acknowledges
the psychoanalytic model of the unconscious and the primacy of
dreams so pivotal to Andr&eacute; Breton's "Manifesto of Surrealism"
. Contrastingly, Man Ray is much more closely affiliated with
the surrealist version of the unconscious; his work, nevertheless,
draws upon the mechanistic vision of the body I trace in Stein.

attention" or "habits of attention" in order to cope with undifferentiated
and overwhelming sensory impressions find a counterexample in the
character of Melanctha. Ruddick writes, "James uses the term <I>mind-wandering,</I> or <I>wandering attention</I> to describe such a
receptiveness to sensation--and <I>wandering</I> is also Stein's word for
her heroine" (<I>RGS,</I> 18), and as such "Melanctha's pathological
forgetfulness is of a piece with her mind-wandering" (<I>RGS,</I>

enacting the rhythmic divagations of the body moving in space.

The model of the body as impossible machine (a kind of film apparatus),
freakishly capable of engaging in multiple tasks appears in one
of Marianne Moore's delightful footnotes; her Eve "able to write
simultaneously" is inspired by an article that could have been authored by
Stein for all its quirkiness, entitled "Multiple Consciousness or Reflex
Action of Unaccustomed Range" from <I>Scientific American</I> (Jan. 1922):

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Miss A--will write simultaneously in three languages, English, German, and
French, talking in the meantime. [She] takes advantage of her abilities
in everyday life, writing her letters simultaneously with both hands;
names, the first, third, and fifth words with her left and the second,
fourth, and sixth with her right hand. While generally writing outward,
she is able as well to write inward with both hands. [<I>The Complete

and habituation: "The distracted person, too, can form habits" and
further that "[r]eception in a state of distraction . . . finds in
the film its true means of exercise." "The Work of Art in the Age of
Mechanical Reproduction," in <I>Illuminations</I>, 240.

The interest in "parts" over the whole corresponds to the simultaneous
focusing of attention and break within narrative coherence made possible
by a film close-up. Using the narrative example "of the hero clutching
the revolver with which he is to commit his crime," Hugo M&uuml;nsterberg
points to the power of the close-up: "[o]ur attention is entirely given
up to the passionate play of his hand" where "[i]t is as if this one hand
were during the pulse beat of events the whole scene, and everything else
had faded away." Hugo M&uuml;nsterberg, <I>The Photoplay: A Psychological
Study</I> (New York: Appleton and Company, 1916), 86; on the stage
"nothing can really fade away" (ibid.).

Rayograms are Man Ray's apparently accidental (read automatic) process
of developing images. He was able to create striking defamiliarized

Bertha is the name of Stein's older sister, and with the death of their
mother, Bertha took on the traditional female role of caretaker. As
Wagner-Martin indicates, "[w]atching Bertha taught her that she would
rather not lead a woman's life" (<I>FS,</I> 23). Bertha in this piece
becomes a cipher, or sign of the hysteric.

"ME," 25. As Aragon writes in his review of Chaplin's <I>The Vagabond,</I>
"Film extends the art of Picasso, Georges Braque, and Juan Gris in the
use of 'scraps' of everyday material: Today these courageous precursors,
painters or poets, witness their own triumph, they who knew how to be
moved by a newspaper or a packet of cigarettes" ("On D&eacute;cor," 165).

"ME," 29. "[S]pinning" and "fastening" suggest the spinning of film on
the projector's wheels and the manual fastening required by editing as
well as the "rotoreliefs, " the turning discs used by Duchamp and Man
Ray in their pun-filled film, <I>Anemic Cinema</I> (1924-6).
