<p>Tolerance is a defining value of liberalism, but it is also a nagging vulnerability and an embarrassment, as critics and defenders of liberalism both recognize. Liberals call tolerance "elusive," "difficult," "unstable," "contradictory," and even "impossible," but they nevertheless regard toleration as an indispensable practice not only for believers in the values of self-creation and pluralism but also for citizens of whatever persuasion in a world of cultural, moral, and ideological variety.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Many of its advocates acknowledge its flaws—for example, that tolerance can be condescending, hypocritical, and insufficiently ambitious in pursuit of justice and equality—but the only thing worse, they agree, is intolerance. As John Horton observes, "Generally, to be the object of tolerance is a welcome improvement on being the object of intolerance, but typically people do not wish themselves or their actions to be the object of either."<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> Tolerance involves acceptance, sometimes grudging, of beliefs, values, and practices with which one disagrees or of which one disapproves, and that may understandably be felt as something less than the full recognition and equal treatment that dignity and respect require. David Heyd notes that tolerance is "'compressed' between two spheres: phenomena that by no means should be tolerated (like cruelty and murder) and phenomena that should not be objected to in the first place (like gender or racial identity)."<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Both poles here are variable and contestable, however. What counts as intolerable "cruelty" is historically and culturally contingent, as are the practices and identities to which a liberal society thinks it unjust and unfair to deny full, equal recognition. Part of the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  difficulty here, as Michael Walzer points out, is that "justice is a human construction, and it is doubtful that it can be made in only one way."<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> As what Judith Shklar calls "the sense of injustice" is contested and a liberal society changes its understanding of the claims of justice, so too will it redefine where tolerance is called for and where mere toleration is not tolerable.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>A deeper problem, however, as many liberals acknowledge, is that tolerance may pretend to a neutrality that it does not have. Horton notes that "tolerance is not a virtue that stands altogether outside the moral and political conflicts it often seeks to mediate."<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> The values that guide it—for example, respect for individual self-direction, appreciation of variety, or skepticism about absolutes—may not be shared (and probably aren't) by the groups one may decide to tolerate (or not, if its values are sufficiently illiberal). Building on the criticism that tolerance is not neutral, foes of liberalism argue that tolerance is not benign, benevolent, and apolitical but is a ruse of power. Wendy Brown argues, for example, that "tolerance as a political practice is always conferred by the dominant" and is a way of containing and regulating those it marginalizes.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> By adopting a posture of open-minded acceptance of different viewpoints, according to this line of criticism, democratic tolerance seeks to disguise that it is an ideology allied to particular interests. Taking the position that it is beyond political disagreements is a strategy for protecting the prevailing order of things. Hence Herbert Marcuse's call to "t against an ideology of tolerance which, in reality, favors and fortifies the conservation of the status quo of inequality and discrimination."<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> According to this critique, the seeming neutrality of tolerance, by attempting to defuse conflict and deflect challenges to the dominant order, thereby blocks changes needed to remedy injustices and to bring about conditions of greater equality and more fulfilling community.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite all of these problems and contradictions, tolerance still has defenders because it seems at the very least a practical necessity for living side by side. As Isaiah Berlin observes: "In a world in which human rights were never trampled on, and men [and women] did not persecute each other for what they believed or what they were, the cause of toleration would not need to be defended. This, however, is not our world."<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Brown herself acknowledges that "to remove the scales from our eyes about the innocence of tolerance in relation to power is not thereby to reject tolerance as useless or worse."<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> What Brown and other critics of tolerance want, no less than its liberal defenders, is a way of practicing toleration that avoids its self-defeating difficulties and advances ideals of justice, fairness, and equality instead of thwarting them.</p>
<p>It is not enough to concede that tolerance is an imperfect virtue in an imperfect world and simply get on with it. The contradictions of tolerance suggest that practicing it unthinkingly runs the risk of undermining the aims of egalitarian democracy and inadvertently veering into intolerance, and so the reservations of its critics, whether friendly or hostile, must not simply be acknowledged and then ignored. Their criticisms point out serious problems which, if unaddressed, will subvert the claim of toleration to be a practice that supports justice and fairness.</p>
<p>The perhaps unlikely re of E. M. Forster can provide assistance in constructing a practice of toleration that is mindful of its potentially self-defeating contradictions. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Although Forster has long been regarded as an emblematic re in the liberal tradition, his name has been oddly absent from recent liberal analyses of tolerance.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> This is especially curious and unfortunate because a renewed interest among political theorists in the values and vulnerabilities of tolerance has been spurred by the debates about multiculturalism, globalization, and cosmopolitanism. The author of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Passage to India</span> has much to say about these matters.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Forster's experiences in Egypt during World War I and later in India as a secretary to the Maharaja of Dewas gave him an acute sense of the uses and potential abuses of such liberal values as individual autonomy, self-creation, and respect for the dignity and worth of different ways of being as a response to a world of permeable boundaries and shifting affiliations.</p>
<p>Forster's sexual identity also made him aware of and wary about the contradictions of tolerance. His position as a closeted homosexual whose sexual preferences were widely known among his friends but could still have landed him in prison if publicly disclosed gave him a revealing double-perspective not only on the need for tolerance but also on its shortcomings as an attitude short of full equality, dignity, and respect. Although he was widely regarded as the leading English novelist of his day, Forster felt himself an outsider to dominant institutions and attitudes, a contradictory position that expressed itself in his persistent, unremitting, if often coyly ironic challenges to prevailing views, especially when they seemed to solidify into ideologies that threatened the private sphere, the realm of individual self-direction and personal relations where he felt most himself. His liberalism and his cosmopolitanism flow from a deep sense of the primacy of the person given his understanding of himself as someone out of place in his society whose possibilities for self-creation and intimacy depended on protecting and enhancing room for difference. Forster's abiding doubleness, feeling proudly and defiantly but also defensively other, despite (or all the more because of) his prominence as a cultural authority, is at least part of why he famously declares that "if I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend, I hope I should have the guts to betray my country."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> His position as an "insider-outsider" gave Forster a unique appreciation of the power-dynamics of tolerance—how the condescending acceptance of the marginalized by the dominant may reinforce norms that are the problem in the first place—but also of its usefulness nevertheless because of the suffering he and his fellow outsiders endured from intolerance.</p>
<p>The twin foundations of Forster's liberalism are a pluralistic appreciation of the variety of defensible versions of the true and the good that might guide rewarding lives and an abiding suspicion of power and the powerful as threats to vulnerable individuals and their relations with one another. Forster's belief in the value of difference and his consequent skepticism about the incompleteness and inadequacy of any culture's defining norms are evident in his 1926 essay "Notes on the English Character," which offers a cross-cultural analysis of the necessary provincialism of national types. "No national character is complete," he writes; "We have to look for some qualities in one part of the world and others in another."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Long before Anthony Appiah and James Clifford, Forster saw and personally experienced how those with the means and mobility to cross cultural boundaries might enjoy increased possibilities for self-creation, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  even as he worried that more frequent and closer contact between people who looked, thought, and acted differently from one another would increase the likelihood of conflicts, misunderstanding, demonization, and various forms of intolerance and oppression. As he observes in this same essay, if the incompleteness of national types is an invitation to cosmopolitan self-creation, it can also be an incitement to violence: "The nations <span style="font-style:italic;">must</span> understand one another, and quickly; and without the interposition of their governments, for the shrinkage of the globe is throwing them into one another's arms" . The need to re out how to get along in a world without the self-protective comforts of homogeneity and with fewer barriers to prevent collisions between potentially disruptive differences is a concern to which he returns repeatedly in the 1930s and 40s. As he explains in his preface to <span style="font-style:italic;">Two Cheers for Democracy</span>, his collected essays from these difficult decades, "We cannot expect to love one another," but "we must learn to put up with one another. Otherwise we shall all of us perish."<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Forster's advocacy of tolerance is based on a pragmatic recognition that it is a necessary but less than ideal response to the volatile contingencies of difference.</p>
<p>His pragmatism does not let liberalism off the hook, however. Forster saw the shrinking globe as a challenge to liberal complacency about injustices its values should condemn: "I know very well how limited, and how open to criticism, English freedom is," he told a Paris "Congress of Intellectuals in Defence of Culture" in his address "Liberty in England" in 1935. While Gide, Malraux, and other French intellectuals were vying for the limelight and Stalin's agents were trying to steer the Congress behind the scenes, Forster, perhaps naïvely but with disarming candor and humility, defended English liberty by calling on it to admit and address its flaws: "It is race-bound and it's class-bound. It means freedom for the Englishman, but not for the subject-races of his Empire . . . Freedom in England is only enjoyed by people who are fairly well off . . . The hungry and the homeless don't care about liberty any more than they care about cultural heritage. To pretend that they do is cant."<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> As he wrote ten years later, just as the Second World War had ended, "The poor have kicked. The backward races are kicking—and more power to their boots."<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Forster's appreciation of difference made him aware that justice is a contestable value, and his suspicion of power and his identification with the vulnerability of the marginalized allowed him to recognize, with a skeptical clarity equal to any of liberalism's critics, that a defense of liberty could stand in the way of necessary social change unless it recognized that it was not a universal ideal but a contingent social practice and an ideology that could be exclusionary and oppressive.</p>
<p>Forster's resistance to bullying of various kinds goes hand in hand with his pluralism because both oppose the dominance of majority attitudes and prevailing norms, even when these may seem benevolent and benign. "I have no mystic faith in the people," he writes; "I have in the individual. He seems to me a divine achievement and I mistrust any view which belittles him" ("Believe" 57). Forster's liberalism is based on a fundamental faith in the value of difference (the contingent variability of the "individual" versus the oppressive homogeneity of "the people") and on the consequent need to t for the little person against the power of the great, whether the bully is a leader <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  or an institution or an authoritative way of thinking. As he wrote in his great essay, "What I Believe," composed in the difficult, anxiety-ridden summer before Munich: "I distrust Great Men. They produce a desert of uniformity around them and often a pool of blood too, and I always feel a little man's pleasure when they come a cropper" . The violence of the powerful, the vulnerability of little people, and the threat of uniformity are profoundly linked in Forster's political imagination.</p>
<p>Forster traces the variety and the vulnerability of difference to the contingencies of our mortality, as evidenced in birth and death: "The dictator-hero can grind down his citizens till they are all alike, but he cannot melt them into a single man . . . they are obliged to be born separately, and to die separately, and, owing to these unavoidable termini, will always be running off the totalitarian rails. The memory of birth and the expectation of death always lurk within the human being, making him separate from his fellows and consequently capable of intercourse with them" ("Believe" 76). It is perhaps understandable wishful thinking on Forster's part to regard our mortality as an all-powerful reminder of our differences that will always escape totalitarian control.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> The opposite is also almost self-evidently the case. Forster is elsewhere painfully aware that the contingent existence of individuals who are all too easily stamped out is proof of their weakness and evidence of their need for vigilant protection. This vulnerability is a reason for advocating tolerance in order to protect the "little person" even while recognizing that toleration is insufficient to provide the dignity and respect to which different lives are entitled.</p>
<p>Ironically self-critical but assertive toleration is an inherently contradictory practice, and guidance about how to act in a coherently self-contradictory manner is perhaps best conveyed indirectly, through the form of one's arguments and not merely their content. The lessons of Forster's ironic liberalism are most effectively communicated through his characteristically oblique style. Forster's coy, elusive manner as an essayist stages the contradictions of liberalism in order to educate the reader through its twists and turns not only about the pragmatic necessity of liberal values like tolerance but also about how these values can go wrong, fall short, and undermine themselves. Forster's indirection is also a way of acknowledging that his discourse is necessarily entangled in the workings of power it criticizes. The very precariousness of the little person who takes on the great and powerful is a reason for using oblique, ironic means rather than a frontal attack. Catching the reader off-guard and disarming defenses in advance is a kind of rhetorical guerilla warfare. Ironic indirection is David's best hope for beating Goliath even if, despite Forster's wishful optimism, David does not always win.</p>
<p>For Forster, the moral and political significance of art is linked to the vulnerability of contingent individuals that liberalism should protect and nourish. "To make us feel small in the right way," he writes, "is a function of art."<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Forster wants people to "feel small" so that they might acknowledge and appreciate their contingency, with all the splendor and vulnerability that their capacity for difference entails. This is not only a psychological strategy but also a political tactic for ting power with rhetorical power. Part of what is at stake here is suggested by Isaiah Berlin's point that "It is terrible and dangerous arrogance to believe that you alone are right."<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> For Forster as for Berlin, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  epistemological certainty is dangerous because of its will-to-power and its refusal to give difference its due. Making readers "feel small" opposes epistemological arrogance and attempts to inculcate humility about the contestability of their views. Shaming them out of their certainties may then make readers feel the contingency they share with their fellow mortals, and this in turn might be a first step toward reconsidering firmly entrenched habits and beliefs that would otherwise be resistant to dislodging by logical arguments.</p>
<p>One of the best examples of Forster's provocative indirectness is his essay "Jew Consciousness," published in January 1939, two months after the destruction of synagogues and Jewish property by Hitler's goons during "Kristallnacht." Forster characteristically takes up the topic of anti-Semitism not by directly condemning the atrocities in Germany but by examining an English institution that had been a source of national pride. If English patriots anxious about impending war in the months after Munich might like to remember that the playing fields of Eton had produced heroic victories in the past, Forster recalls his school-days differently:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Long, long ago, while Queen Victoria reigned, I attended two preparatory schools. At the first of these, it was held to be a disgrace to have a sister. Any little boy who possessed one was liable to get teased . . . Public opinion was not bitter on the point, but it was quite definite. Sisters were disgraceful. I got through all right myself, because my conscience was clear, and though charges were brought against me from time to time they always fell through.</p>
<p>It was a very different story at my second school. Here, sisters were negligible, but it was a disgrace to have a mother. Crabbe's mother, Gob's mother, eeugh! No words were too strong, no sounds too shrill. And since mothers at that time of life are commoner than sisters, and also less biddable, the atmosphere of this school was less pleasant, and the sense of guilt stronger. Nearly every little boy had a mother in a cupboard, and dreadful revelations occurred.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The point of the analogy between these instances of seemingly trivial adolescent stupidity and the ugliness and brutality of the Nazi persecution of Jews is not only to unsettle his reader's complacency that only the barbaric Germans could be guilty of such nonsense; it is also to induce humility in the reader about the contingency of the differential positions that racial prejudice naturalizes:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Those preparatory schools prepared me for life better than I realised, for having passed through two imbecile societies, a sister-conscious and a mother-conscious, I am now invited to enter a third. I am asked to consider whether the people I meet and talk about are or are not Jews, and to form no opinion on them until this fundamental point has been settled. What revolting tosh! . . . Jew-consciousness is in the air, and it remains to be seen how far it will succeed in poisoning it . . . Today, the average man suspects the people he dislikes of being Jews, and is surprised when the people he likes are Jews. Having been a Gentile at my first preparatory school and a Jew at my second, I know what I am talking about. I know how the poison works, and I know too that if the average man is anyone in particular he is a preparatory school boy.</p>
<div class="attrib"> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Instead of appealing to universal moral values to condemn the cruelty and inhumanity of anti-Semitism, Forster takes the more indirect route of dramatizing for his readers their own vulnerability to shifting categories of social exclusion. Tolerance is not an apolitical ethical attitude but a pragmatic response to contingencies of classification that define the powerful and the powerless—and that can change, so that today's Gentile may become tomorrow's Jew (the obvious but unspoken analogy here is the variable contingency of Forster's own doubleness as a cultural authority and a sexual outlaw).<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Forster's anecdote implicates the reader uncomfortably in mechanisms of social solidification that cannot simply be dismissed as a foreign aberration because they represent a society's use of the contingencies of classification for political purposes that threaten the vulnerable (i.e., potentially everyone, or at least anyone with a mother).</p>
<p>The surprise of the analogy and the obliqueness of the approach are typical of Forster's style. The rationale for this indirectness, he explains, is that "the only effective check to silliness is silliness of a cleverer type" . W. H. Auden made a similar point more directly: "The best reason I have for opposing Fascism is that at school I lived in a Fascist state."<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Forster would agree, but he prefers to say so obliquely and ironically. As he explains elsewhere, "I have the sort of mind that likes to be taken unawares. The frontal full-dress presentation of an opinion often repels me, but if it be insidiously slipped in sidewise I may receive it" ("Book" 222). If the surprise induced by a "sidewise" approach may feel "insidious," Forster's mischievousness suggests that deviousness may be necessary to t power with rhetorical power. Although he stopped writing novels after <span style="font-style:italic;">A Passage to India</span> appeared in 1924, his manner as an essayist is that of a ruminative narrator whose seeming casualness sets the reader up for the rhetorical turn that will take us off guard, disorienting in order to reorient.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Rather than come at the reader straight-on in a way that might prompt objections or resistance, Forster welcomes our confidence in order to prepare us to accept a point about the pervasiveness of the behavior he derides that is more sweeping and unsettling than Auden's indictment of public school tyranny and that the reader might have dismissed without the set-up. Not merely the civility of a liberal British gentleman, these are the tactics of a David who takes on Goliath by pretending not to be combative while preparing a blow that is all the more effective because it is unexpected.</p>
<p>Forster is not saying that all Englishmen are Nazis at heart, but he is calling for candor, humility, and self-criticism in a hostile environment where the anxieties of the time were a temptation to defensive oversimplification and a rejection of the uncomfortable contradictions of a vulnerable, contingent existence. He realizes that he is writing in what he called in another essay of the period a "post-Munich world," where the general relief about the peace Chamberlain seemed to have achieved by his concessions to Hitler the previous September was as great as the anxiety that it wouldn't last and that a war for which Britain was ill-prepared was inevitable very soon. "The state of being half-frightened and half-thinking about something else at the same time is the state of many English people today," Forster writes, and such "worry is terribly insidious; besides taking the joy out of life, it prevents the victim from being detached and from observing the human experiment. It tempts him to simplify, since through simplification he may <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  find peace." For Forster, however, "the only satisfactory release is to be found in the direction of complexity."<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Rhetorical strategies emphasizing complexity and resisting simplification—reminding readers of the contingency and contestability of their beliefs and exposing the contradictions bedevilling seemingly self-evident positions—are for him ways of using power to resist and oppose epistemological power.</p>
<p>Combating the temptations of simplicity and holding one's mind open to the contradictions of contingency are necessary for the defense of freedom, self-creation, and difference at a time when those are under threat, not just from the Fascists in Germany, Italy, and Spain, but from the patriots and the authorities and the psychological pressures at home. "All is lost if the totalitarians destroy us. But all is equally lost if we have nothing left to lose," he writes; the dilemma, he feels, is "that if Fascism wins we are done for, and that we must become Fascist to win" ("Post-Munich" 23). His strategy of ironic indirection is not only a way of resisting the simplifications of accepted ideas and authoritative opinion. It is also a strategy for using power, as one must to t the bully at home or abroad, without replicating the tyranny and intolerance one is resisting. This is a necessarily contradictory practice, and the indirections of style are an attempt to enact it coherently and self-critically, without lapsing into paralysis or becoming a bully oneself.</p>
<p>Forster's essay "Jew-Consciousness" reflects his concern about the temptations of simplification and his belief that ironic indirection is the best way to defend and teach critical, coherently self-contradictory complexity: "I don't think we shall ever reintroduce ghettos into England; I wouldn't say for certain, since no one knows what wickedness may not develop in his country or in himself if circumstances change. I don't think we shall go savage. But I do think we shall go silly. Many people have done so already" . Anti-Semitism is an example of such silliness, and that makes it all the more dangerous because easier to fall into than blatantly brutal savagery. If prejudices that build community by demonizing others are a defense against anxieties, whether those of adolescence or of a nation facing the threat of war, then this shows how weak reason is as an antidote to superstition, violence, and the vulnerabilities of contingency: "To me, anti-Semitism is now the most shocking of all things. It is destroying much more than the Jews; it is assailing the human mind at its source, and inviting it to create false categories before exercising judgment" . The weakness of reason is, however, why Forster tries to sneak up on the reader through ironic indirectness rather than delivering a straightforward, step-by-step argument. "Cool reasonableness would be best of all, of course, but it does not work in the world of today any better than in my preparatory schools" . Making people ashamed of themselves is more effective: "The best way of confuting it is to say sneeringly, 'That's propaganda.' When 'That's propaganda' has been repeated several times, the sniggering stops, for no goose likes to think that he has been got at" .</p>
<p>ting fire with fire, if the susceptibility to prejudice shows how vulnerable people are to blindly accepting what others think, then embarrassing them into behaving reasonably (lest others think them foolish) may be more effective than providing logical arguments for doing so. If Forster imagines that reasons might nevertheless work, it is not because of a Habermasian faith in the unforced force of the better argument <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  but because their rhetorical power may compel rethinking by catching the reader off-guard: "There is another reply which is more intellectual but which requires more courage. It is to say, 'Are you sure you're not a Jew yourself? Do you know who your eight great-grandparents were? Can you swear that all the eight are Aryan?'" . Are you sure you don't have a sister or, horror of horrors, a mother?</p>
<p>Forster follows his own advice about ting silliness with strategic counter-silliness in "Racial Exercise," first published in March 1939, two months after his essay on anti-Semitism. He begins disarmingly and ironically: "Let us do some easy exercises in Racial Purity. And let me offer myself for dissection-purposes."<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> Taking up his question about the necessary ambiguities of genealogy, he asks again: "Can you give the names of your eight great-grandparents? The betting is eight to one that you cannot" . In his own case, he says, "If I go the right way about it, I come of an old English family"—"right back to a certain Richard of Sykes Dyke who flourished somewhere about the year 1400"—"and am proud of it" :</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Unfortunately in other directions the prospect is less extensive. If I take a wrong turning and miss the Sykes', darkness descends on my origins almost at once. Mrs. James is a case in point, and a very mortifying one. Mrs. James was a widow who not so very long ago married one of my great-grandfathers. I am directly descended from her, know nothing whatever about her, and should like at all events to discover her maiden name. Vain quest. She disappears in the mists of ambiguity . . . She might be anyone, she may not even have been Aryan. When her shadow crosses my mind, I do not feel to belong to an old family at all.</p>
<div class="attrib">(17–18)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Silent sympathy with Hitler's assertions of Nordic pride certainly existed in England, and not only among Sir Oswald Mosley's Black Shirts. The point of this little "exercise" is not just to combat the stupid arrogance of racial superiority, however; it is also to question the whole idea of "purity" and the purposes it serves.</p>
<p>Forster is not trying to knock down a straw man but, rather, to dislodge through irony and indirectness—combating "silliness" with "silliness of a cleverer type"—a powerful habit of mind that he understands full well because it is a defense against the human, all too human sense of vulnerability and contingency:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Community of race is an illusion. Yet belief in race is a growing psychological force, and we must reckon with it. People like to feel that they are all of a piece, and one of the ways of inducing that feeling is to tell them that they come of pure stock. That explains the ease with which the dictators are putting their pseudo-science across. No doubt they are not cynical about it, and take themselves in by what they say. But they have very cleverly hit on a weak spot in the human equipment—the desire to feel a hundred per cent, no matter what the percentage is in.</p>

<p class="continued">If our mortality is evidence of our precious individuality, this littleness can also make us feel anxious, weak, and alone, and feeling at one with something larger and more complete than oneself can seem to provide a refuge against contingency. The temptations of purity—the desire to feel homogeneous, whole, and harmonious rather than <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  different, deficient, and incomplete—are especially troublesome to Forster because they are integral to the psychological landscape of individualism and to the political challenges of contingency. Forster's belief in the value of the individual is not a naïvely self-confident ontological universal but is deeply informed by a sense of how precarious and uncomfortable difference can be because it is historical, variable, and contingent through and through.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to make cosmopolitan heterogeneity seem chic or exotic, Forster calls it a "mongrel" condition, a deliberately unattractive metaphor that turns racial thinking against itself in order to provoke reflection about the dangerous, all-too-easy temptations of purity. "Whether there ever was such an entity as a 'pure race' is debatable," he writes, "but there certainly is not one in Europe today—the internationalisms of the Roman Empire and of the Middle Ages have seen to that. Consequently there never can be a pure race in the future. Europe is mongrel forever, and so is America" . Earlier cosmopolitanisms of imperial conquest have made mixture and difference inescapable. Against simplistic biological essentialism, impurity is a stubborn historical fact. Although Forster understands heterogeneity as an opportunity for personal self-creation, he warns against underestimating the cruelty and barbarity that mixed breeds are capable of: "We only know that we are all of us mongrels, dark haired and light haired, who must learn not to bite one another" . As incomplete, deficient, and vulnerable individuals, we are prone to violence and susceptible to temptations that seem to offer an escape from contingency. Recognizing and coming to terms with the psychological appeal of homogeneity in a "mongrel" world is, for Forster, politically necessary to preserve the possibility that differential self-creation and non-conforming personal relations might stand a chance.</p>
<p>Typically turning the rhetorical weapons of his opponents against themselves, Forster uses a biological analogy to counter racial essentialism. At a time before eugenics had been discredited by the atrocities of the Holocaust and other forms of ethnic cleansing, Forster finds in evolutionary thinking not an invitation to genetic engineering in pursuit of racial purity but a resource for liberal individualism and a defense of the value of aberration. He makes this turn by offering for contemplation what he calls "the civilising re of Mendel":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>He embodies a salutary principle, and even when we are superficial about him, he helps to impress it in our minds. He suggests that no stock is pure, and that it may at any moment throw up forms which are unexpected, and which it inherits from the past. His best-known experiments were with the seeds of the pea. It is impossible that human beings can be studied as precisely as peas—too many factors are involved. But they too keep throwing up recessive characteristics, and cause us to question the creed of racial purity.</p>
<div class="attrib"></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Instead of refusing biological thinking as a temptation to essentialism, Forster uses Mendel to turn the race-based genetic argument upside down and, in the process, suggests a more accurate interpretation of the political implications of the mechanisms of Darwinian evolution.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> The example of Mendel recalls that for Darwin the production of variants is a crucial driving force in evolution by providing ever-new possibilities <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of adaptation for species to test in their struggle for survival. It turns out to be a good thing for evolution and the survival of species that they are impure, that DNA does not replicate itself perfectly, but that the ever-changing heterogeneity of a species provides a variety of adaptations that can respond to environmental conditions that also do not stand still. For Forster, of course, it is less the scientific accuracy of the analogy that matters than its rhetorical force: "Thanks to Mendel and to a few simple exercises we can see comparatively clearly into the problem of race, if we choose to look, and can do a little to combat the pompous and pernicious rubbish that is at present being prescribed in the high places of the earth" . Toppling the high and mighty by the power of the recessive pea exemplifies Forster's strategy of taking the great by surprise and demonstrating the unexpected resources of the small.</p>
<p>The case Forster makes for the core liberal value of "tolerance" is based on an ironic recognition of the dangers of purity. In his essay "Tolerance," which was first delivered as a BBC broadcast in early July 1941 and then published a few weeks later, Forster imagines what will be needed to rebuild civilization after the war. His contrarian thinking not only opposes the Nazi dream of "a new order in Europe" but also questions the patriotic visions of "reconstructing London beautifully" proposed by English politicians who were trying to lift spirits shaken by the long winter of the Blitz and pessimism about the war's outcome (a few months earlier Forster had broadcast a talk entitled "What Would Germany Do to Us?" if she won, which was not an idle question at the time). Concerned to counter what he calls a "perilous and vague sentimentalism" that was in the air, Forster writes: "Most people, when asked what spiritual quality is needed to rebuild civilisation, will reply 'Love.' . . . Respectfully but firmly, I disagree. Love is a great force in private life; it is indeed the greatest of all things: but love in public affairs does not work."<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Part of his argument is tough-minded pragmatism: "The fact is we can only love what we know personally. And we cannot know much" . But his deeper concern is that simple-minded talk about how "Love is what is needed" not only ignores hard truths about the imperfections of social relations but would itself be a dangerous force for purification and homogeneity:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>The world is very full of people—appallingly full; it has never been so full before, and they are all tumbling over each other. Most of these people one doesn't know and some of them one doesn't like; doesn't like the colour of their skins, say, or the shapes of their noses, or the way they blow them or don't blow them, or the way they talk, or their smell, or their clothes, or their fondness for jazz or their dislike of jazz, and so on. Well, what is one to do? There are two solutions. One of them is the Nazi solution. If you don't like people, kill them, banish them, segregate them, and then strut up and down proclaiming that you are the salt of the earth. The other way is much less thrilling, but it is on the whole the way of the democracies, and I prefer it. If you don't like people, put up with them as well as you can. Don't try to love them: you can't, you'll only strain yourself. But try to tolerate them. On the basis of that tolerance a civilised future may be built.</p>
<div class="attrib">(45–46)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Although Forster does not say so directly, the uncomfortable implication is that "Love" has more in common with "the Nazi solution" than with the tolerance he prefers. Forster <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  worries that "Love" is not simply a sentimental illusion but potentially a fascistic force in public life because it would run roughshod over differences. In Forster's view, human relations are rife with negativity—full of deficiencies, unpleasantness, disagreements large and small—and the homogenizing force of "Love" is not only dangerously unrealistic but also potentially oppressive in its embrace.</p>
<p>Ever vigilant to preserve and protect the sphere of personal self-creation and the possibility of individual differences, Forster is not only more modest in his demands and expectations but is also deeply suspicious of the will-to-power of idealism: "I have lost all faith in positive militant ideals; they can so seldom be carried out without thousands of human beings getting maimed or imprisoned" . Forster consequently rejects the idealism of "Love." Instead of the "three cheers" that he says "Love the Beloved Republic" would deserve, he offers only "Two Cheers for Democracy," and, he says, "Two cheers are quite enough" ("Believe" 70). The contingencies and contradictions of social relations call instead for "tolerance" which, he concedes, "is a very dull virtue. It is boring. Unlike love, it has always had a bad press. It is negative. It merely means putting up with people, being able to stand things" ("Tolerance" 45). But the very "negativity" of tolerance is what he values because it leaves room for difference and resists homogenizing forces of various kinds.</p>
<p>Although Forster describes tolerance as essentially "negative" (it includes "not being huffy, touchy, irritable, revengeful" [46]), it is not for him a weak or easy virtue. For one thing, "it entails imagination. For you have all the time to be putting yourself in someone else's place. Which is a desirable spiritual exercise" . If a liability of individualism is its potential for apolitical, asocial isolation, then the practice of toleration that Forster urges counters the self-centeredness of the private sphere with an imagination for how others are feeling, whether (to cite Forster's ever-widening circle of examples) in a queue or the Tube, "in the street, in the office, at the factory," or even "between classes, races, and nations" . Nor is tolerance, as Forster envisions it, an invitation to indifference and disengagement. Forster's notion of tolerance is informed by a deep skepticism about the easy arrogance of self-righteousness and a vigilant appreciation for injustice. For example, as he writes with characteristically disarming self-criticism: "it is very easy to see fanaticism in other people, but difficult to spot in oneself. Take the evil of racial prejudice. We can easily detect it in the Nazis . . . But we ourselves—are we guiltless? We are far less guilty than they are. Yet is there no racial prejudice in the British Empire? Is there no colour question?" (47–48). Ever wary of smugness and complacency, Forster recognizes that the refusal to ask hard questions and to confront unpleasant contradictions and complexities is not benign. His conception of tolerance is consequently not a way of turning a blind eye to prejudice and injustice but a call to turn the spotlight on them. Not simply passive and accepting, it necessitates a tough-minded suspicion of prevailing ideologies and institutions. Requiring both imagination and criticism, "tolerance" as Forster conceives it is anything but the easy way of deflecting opposition and suppressing difference its critics rightly worry it can be. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Forster's suspicion of "militant ideals" and "fanaticism" also responds to two other frequent criticisms of liberalism—that it is too weak to t for itself against illiberal opponents or that, if it does, it reveals its fundamental hypocrisy because it is not all-accepting and value-free. "Tolerance is not the same as weakness," he writes; "Putting up with people does not mean giving in to them" . Forster unabashedly admits, for example, that he is intolerant of intolerance, and necessarily so. Militantly anti-militant, he would have no difficulty joining contemporary liberals who accept all modes of self-creation except for "authoritarian identities" that do not accept the rule of mutual toleration (the Taliban is an often cited example). Forster would also agree on the need to set limits on the demands of so-called "greedy communities" that seek to impose their values and beliefs not only on their own members (refusing them the right of exit) but also on others in the community of communities that a liberal democracy aims to foster.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>When Forster states his articles of faith, he famously declares: "I do not believe in Belief" ("Believe" 67). This negative formulation recognizes the need to oppose the will-to-power of illiberal creeds with an equal and opposite force—not only the power of skeptical criticism but also the values this negative creed is intent on preserving, including individual self-creation, the privacy of personal relations, and the possibility of non-normative ways of being. Forster did not agree with fellow Bloomsbury-ite Clive Bell, who took the pacifism of many 30s liberal intellectuals to its logical extreme in a 1938 pamphlet entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">War Mongers</span>: "A Nazi Europe would be, to my mind, heaven on earth compared with Europe at war . . . the worst tyranny is better than the best war . . . War is the worst of all evils."<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Forster can imagine worse evils than war, even if he understands the Tolstoyan argument that one resists evil only by becoming what one opposes. Hence his worry about becoming fascist as one ts fascism but his recognition that this is a risk one must take.</p>
<p>Forster acknowledges that his liberal values constitute a "faith," worth ting and dying for, and he states his reasons with typical irony that deflects and disarms the criticisms to which it is open by acknowledging their validity in advance. He notes, first of all, that he is in the same contradictory position as all believers: "Since to ignore evidence is one of the characteristics of faith, I certainly can proclaim that I believe in personal relationships" ("Believe" 68), not only because they fail more often than not to justify one's confidence in them, but also because they can only succeed if one continues to believe despite the abundance of contrary indicators. Secondly, he notes that</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>there lies at the back of every creed something terrible and hard for which the worshipper may one day be required to suffer, and there is even a terror and a hardness in this creed of personal relationships, urbane and mild though it sounds. Love and loyalty to an individual can run counter to the claims of the State. When they do—down with the State, say I, which means that the State would down me.</p>
<div class="attrib">("Believe" 69)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Given his awareness of the pervasiveness of bullying even in a democracy, coupled with his wariness of how democratic institutions may become instruments of oppression, Forster is not as sanguine as some contemporary liberal philosophers that conflicts can <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  be mediated, resolved, or defused when the interests of a democratic society clash with the variety of projects of self-creation its pluralism should foster.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Forster can imagine an irreconcilable conflict between the political demands of a well-ordered democratic society and the defining moral values of his liberalism, and his belief in those beliefs, despite their small "b," trumps his duties as a citizen, with consequences he acknowledges and accepts. Forster's allegiance to democracy as a political conception is secondary to his belief in individual differences and the entitlement of the little person to his or her own view of a good life. The possibilities of self-creation and non-normative personal relations that pluralism should enable are more fundamental to Forster than the democratic institutions whose purpose, in his view, is to preserve and protect them. His allegiance to those political structures is consequently conditional on their effectiveness in doing so.</p>
<p>These concerns inform the "two cheers" that Forster thinks democracy deserves: "one because it admits variety and two because it permits criticism" ("Believe" 70). As these "two cheers" suggest, the value of democracy in Forster's view is that it allows practices ("criticism") and states of affairs ("variety") that counteract the tendency of the political conception to become coercive. The usefulness of criticism for Forster is that it resists the state's imposition of control and conformity. The value of "variety" is that it encourages a flourishing of differences against the tendency of political consensus to uniformity and homogeneity.</p>
<p>Militant in its anti-militancy even where his own values are concerned, Forster's faith in self-creation and relations between individuals is a deliberately self-contradictory creed that calls for suspicion even as he continues to believe. The fact that "there is a terror and even a hardness" in his creed is something that he is proud of but also troubled by because of his suspicion of fanaticism and militancy of all kinds. As an ideology skeptical of self-righteous, intolerant ideologies, Forster's liberalism is also mindful of the liability of its own constitutive beliefs to fall into the rigidity, absolutism, and sentimental oversimplification he criticizes. Recognizing these contradictions without allowing them to become paralyzing is a difficult trick, and this is another reason why irony and indirectness are Forster's preferred modes. The fragility of Forster's contradictory stance is, however, also a reason why the bully oblivious to irony and indirectness is in a stronger position and can all too easily prevail. (This is not something Forster was always clear about. After the war, he wrote in defense of his liberalism's "softness": "I have seen plenty of hardness" and "I know it does not even pay," citing as proof Mussolini "hanging upside-down like a turkey, with his dead mistress swinging beside him" ["Challenge" 56]. Well, the Mussolinis don't always lose, and often it's the "soft" who hang.)</p>
<p>Forster shares the concern of liberalism's critics that it itself may become a coercive regime. As he writes in his reflections on "Liberty in England" in 1935: "Our danger from Fascism—unless a war starts when anything may happen—is negligible. We're menaced by something much more insidious—by what I call 'Fabio-Fascism,' by the dictator-spirit working quietly away behind the facade of constitutional forms" (65–66). Administrative regulation and efficiency worry Forster not only because even socially <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  progressive bureaucrats can be domineering and condescending (the expert's claim to know best what a citizen needs is a particularly noxious version of epistemological arrogance). More fundamentally, Forster fears that bureaucracy as such is defined by a "dictator-spirit" because of the oppressive force of administrative rationality. If bureaucracy is tyrannical, that is because its insistence on conformity and regulation can become yet another form of bullying that threatens individual differences and non-normative behavior. Worse, the coercive tendencies of administrative rule may be less visible in a liberal regime than they might be in an actual dictatorship because they are disguised by the defensive coloration of democratic consensus. The machine of administrative instrumentalism may itself endanger individual liberty, he fears, and the justification of "constitutional forms" may make this all the harder to recognize and resist.</p>
<p>Forster finds it a merit of democracy that "it permits criticism" because dissent, disagreement, and even quiet questioning can be used to t back against the bully. Hence his praise for the back-bencher in Parliament, "the Private Member who makes himself a nuisance. He gets snubbed and is told that he is cranky or ill-informed, but he does expose abuses which would otherwise never have been mentioned, and very often an abuse gets put right just by being mentioned" ("Believe" 69, 70). The back-bencher who evades the controlling structures of government or party and makes his voice heard even (or especially) when this is not welcome is an example of the little person whom Forster cheers on against the dominance of the great and mighty. Forster is not naïve, however, about the capacity of bureaucrats and politicians to deflect resistance and stifle dissent. His 1939 essay "Our Deputation" is an amusing if sobering depiction of how a government official defuses a protest: "Was the interview going to be an unfriendly one? No, no, nothing as definite as that. Civilities were re-exchanged, time was up, we thanked and were counter-thanked, our opinions were to be given their full weight, and performing a final can-can, the Minister slipped from the room. He had performed his duty, and we ours"—and presumably nothing will change.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Nevertheless, democracy does have the advantage in Forster's view of allowing the little person room to maneuver by making possible strategies of evasion, protest, and resistance.</p>
<p>As Forster notes, "the fact that our rulers have to <span style="font-style:italic;">pretend</span> to like freedom is an advantage" ("Liberty" 65; original emphasis). The cynicism of this comment acknowledges that democracy is a regime of power, like all political structures. What the little person consequently needs is not ideal sentiments but tactics and strategies that will be effective in defending and advancing his or her interests. Canny use of the rhetorical powers that democratic values make available is a non-idealistic way of defending the ideal. Shaming leaders to do the right thing even if for the wrong reasons—to avoid embarrassment rather than because they recognize the logical and moral force of an argument—is a way for the small to turn the tables on the great in the never-ending battle against the bully. The fact that shaming tactics rather than rational argument may be necessary acknowledges the vulnerability of democratic values to abuse and hypocrisy, but the fact that liberal values can be used as political instruments to preserve and enhance liberty is for Forster a reason for preferring democracy to more coercive regimes where such strategies would not work. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Forster's suspicion of administrative rationality and his willingness to t back are evident in an entertaining BBC broadcast on "The Police versus the Public" that he did in 1932 with his lifelong intimate friend, the unfortunately named policeman Bob Buckingham. Meeting in a train, Forster thinks Buckingham's suitcase belongs to someone else and (bizarrely) attempts to heave it out a window. Buckingham rescues his case, and the two strangers strike up a conversation, in which Bob complains about various popular prejudices toward the police and brags about the training they receive. Forster asks: "This excellent education they give you, . . . does it make you human?" Buckingham replies: "I should hope not . . . The public doesn't want us to be human beings, with human faults. It wants us to be a machine on which it can rely . . . If I may say so, isn't it rather a pity to keep on grumbling against the Police and everything the way you do?" Bob is then taken aback by sharpness of Forster's reply:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>It is not a pity and I shall continue to grumble. And I'll tell you why. This bickering ungenerous attitude of the general public whom I represent; this endless uninformed ungracious criticism of the Police and their ways; I suggest to you it's much more valuable than you think. It keeps you up to the mark [Buckingham interjects: "Well I'm blessed," but Forster continues]. . . Our mark, not yours. It counteracts your officialism. It helps you to be human beings and at the bottom of your hearts you should be grateful for it.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The vehemence of Forster's riposte is yet further evidence that his liberalism is not quietistic. This soft, mild-mannered intellectual could be tough and forceful, and appearances to the contrary only work to his advantage because they allow him to catch his interlocutor off guard, as he does here with poor Bob.</p>
<p>Reflecting his concern with the "dictator-spirit" lurking behind administrative rationality, Forster worries in this exchange that "officialism" is a danger to the individual human being and needs to be held in check. A bureaucrat, even an educated one, may easily forget that he or she is human rather than an instrument in a well-regulated, smoothly functioning machine (Bob's ideal impersonal police force). Reminding administrators that they too are mortal is an important form of resistance to the bullying tendencies of bureaucratic anonymity. A democracy is not necessarily a police-state, however, as long as "grumbling" of the sort Forster defends and enacts can counter the "dictator-spirit" of "officialism." Once again the point is not that liberal democracy is a regime outside of force and power (Forster knows it isn't) but, rather, that it provides the small with weapons and tactical resources with which to defend their differences.</p>
<p>As a public intellectual, Forster sees his role as teaching readers how to t the bully wherever they may find him, including in themselves. Forster's answer to the question of why anyone should pay attention to the thoughts of a novelist and a literary critic about contemporary political developments has less to do with his authority as a commentator on the events of the day than with his capacity as a writer to use the resources of a novelist to give rise to thought. His essays are memorable not because he seeks to compete with his Bloomsbury friends Leonard Woolf or John Maynard Keynes in analyzing specific political questions or economic issues in order to make statements about social policy. The content of his essays taken as a guide to policy-makers <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  is thin to non-existent, and Forster would not have been taken seriously if he had pretended to an expertise he did not have. The value of his political writings comes not only from the moral authority of a novelist who is attuned to the personal implications of social problems but also, and perhaps even more, from their narrative style. It is the surprises, the ironic twists and turns, and the tonic challenges to smugness, self-certainty, and oversimplification that make his essays effective as criticism and as social commentary. Forster the public intellectual is a writer whose power comes not from his expertise as a social scientist but from his narrative skill as a teacher of the art of ironic criticism in his very manner as an essayist.</p>
<p>The strengths and weaknesses of Forster's posture as a public intellectual are a reflection of the powers and vulnerabilities of his ironic style. Like all styles, his indirectness has its advantages and disadvantages. It is arguably less effective than a direct approach, although it is not clear that a Malraux or an Orwell (say) accomplished more. To his credit, Forster never succumbed to the intellectual's illusion that he could change the world by the power of his thought and writing alone. The strength of Forster's style is its combination of clarity and complexity. Unswerving in his advocacy of a creed that he simultaneously questions, Forster straightforwardly asserts a simple set of values even as he does so with a wry indirectness that encourages contrary thinking and an all-encompassing skepticism. He delights in bold gestures of provocation even as he is ever humbly alert to the dangers of oversimplification and the temptations of self-certainty. Forster describes his political writings as "the reflections of an individualist and a liberal who has found liberalism crumbling beneath him and at first felt ashamed. Then, looking around, he decided there was no special reason for shame, since other people, whatever they felt, were equally insecure" ("Challenge" 76). What they need to address these insecurities, he thinks, is not reassurance but the courage of ironic self-examination that a novelist can teach by example and (most of all) by the contradictions of his indirect style.</p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f12" href="#f12-text">12. </a>Forster's name is missing from Heyd's volume, for example, and he is not mentioned by any of the other political theorists I cite in this essay. This oversight is not accidental but is evidence of the unfortunate disconnection between Anglo-American political philosophy and contemporary literary theory, despite the invocation of literature and literary concepts by Kwame Anthony Appiah, Martha Nussbaum, Richard Rorty, and others (often without an adequate understanding of the issues at stake; for example, see my critique of Rorty's notions of irony and reading in <span style="font-style:italic;">Play and the Politics of Reading: The Social Uses of Modernist Form</span> [Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 2005], 10-15).Politically minded literary critics have contributed to this disconnection by tending to over-simplify liberalism, routinely dismissing it as epistemologically naïve and politically reactionary. As my summary of the debate about "tolerance" should suggest, liberal political theorists tend to be acutely aware of dilemmas about which literary critics think them clueless. A recent example of this animus toward liberalism is Lauren M. E. Goodland's revealingly titled essay about Forster's advocacy of the value of "care," a liberal value she wrongly but understandably (given the current climate) feels she can defend only by distancing him from liberal politics and caricaturing liberals as lacking intellectual courage (see "Where Liberals Fear to Tread: E. M. Forster's Queer Internationalism and the Ethics of Care," <span style="font-style:italic;">Novel</span> 39, no. 3 [Summer 2006]: 307-36). Important studies of Forster's liberalism by literary critics begin with Lionel Trilling, <span style="font-style:italic;">E. M. Forster</span> (New York: New Directions, 1943) and include Frederick Crews, <span style="font-style:italic;">E. M. Forster: The Perils of Humanism</span> (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1962); Michael Levenson, <span style="font-style:italic;">Modernism and the Fate of Individuality: Character and Novelistic Form from Conrad to Woolf</span> (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1990), 78-93; and Brian May, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Modernist as Pragmatist: E. M. Forster and the Fate of Liberalism</span> (Columbia: U of Missouri P, 1997). My essay tries to connect literary and philosophical concerns by reading Forster's political essays through the lens of contemporary liberal political theory—but with an attention to the workings of style that it typically overlooks.</p></div>

Appiah ignores Forster while making his point in a less pithy way: "No liberal should say, 'My country, right or wrong,' because liberalism involves a set of political principles that a state can fail to realize; and a liberal will have no special loyalty to an illiberal state, not least because liberals value people over collectivities" ("Cosmopolitan Patriots," <span style="font-style:italic;">Cosmopolitics: Thinking and Feeling Beyond the Nation</span>, ed. Pheng Cheah and Bruce Robbins [Minneapolis: U of Minnesota P, 1998], 93).

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f23" href="#f23-text">23. </a>The case Forster's anecdote makes for tolerance, based on the historical contingency and variability of power-relations, calls into question Wendy Brown's claim that liberal tolerance always universalizes and essentializes: "In [liberalism's] reduction of political conflicts to individuals with attitude, conflict itself is ontologized. History and power analytically vanish as constitutive of the attributes and positioning of those subjects considered to be in need of tolerance . . . This disappearance of power and history obscures not only the sources of conflict, violence, or subordination but also their subject-making capacity" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Regulating Aversion</span>, 142-43). The historically contingent "subject-making capacity" of scapegoating is, of course, precisely what Forster's anecdote holds up for scrutiny.</p></div>

On the claims of "greedy communities," see Michael Walzer, <span style="font-style:italic;">Politics and Passion: Toward a More Egalitarian Liberalism</span> (New Haven: Yale UP, 2004), 53, 60-61. A classic reference point in this debate is John Rawls, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Theory of Justice</span> (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1971), who argues that "an intolerant sect has no title to complain when it is denied an equal liberty" because "a person's right to complain is limited to principles he acknowledges himself" .

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f32" href="#f32-text">32. </a>The classic statement of this position is John Rawls's view that "reasonable pluralism" entails an allegiance to a "political conception" of a "well-ordered society" that makes a citizen's "comprehensive moral doctrine" secondary to a notion of "justice as fairness" that is "neutral" to different value-systems (see Rawls, <span style="font-style:italic;">Justice as Fairness: A Restatement</span>, ed. Erin Kelly [Cambridge: Harvard UP, 2001], especially 3-12, 187-93). Forster recognizes, as Rawls does not, that the very claim to "comprehensiveness" of the differing views of the good life that a pluralistic society welcomes can conflict with the similarly all-encompassing demand of liberalism for acceptance of its founding assumptions. For a useful summary of the controversy surrounding Rawls's position among liberal philosophers, see Appiah, <span style="font-style:italic;">Ethics of Identity</span>, 79-83.</p></div>
