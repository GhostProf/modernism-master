<p>However you think of it, it ends up as the fundamental fact of the mask. In this way the primitive, with all its implements and pictures, opens up for our benefit an infinite arsenal of masks: the masks of our fate—the masks with which we emerge from unconsciously experienced moments and situations that have now, at long last, been recuperated.</p>
<p>Impoverished, uncreative man knows of no other way to transform himself than by means of disguise. Disguise seeks the arsenal of masks within us. . . . In reality, the world is full of masks; we do not suspect the extent to which even the most unpretentious pieces of furniture (such as Romanesque armchairs) used to be masks, too. To hand over these masks to us, and to form the space and the re of our fate within it—this is where folk art comes to meet us halfway. Only from this vantage point can we say clearly and fundamentally what distinguishes it from "more authentic" art, in the narrower sense.</p>

<p>It is a fact that all mankind wears or has worn a mask. This enigmatic accessory, with no obvious utility, is commoner than the lever, the bow, the harpoon or the plough. . . . Complete civilizations, some of them most remarkable, have prospered without having conceived the idea of the wheel, or, what is worse, without using it even though it was known to them. But they were familiar with the mask.</p>

<p>That the experiential dimension and plastic ration of metamorphosis were at the heart of surrealism in the 1930s can be seen in the two mythic res that announced the movement's chief organ of the period, <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span> (1933–1939): the bull-headed monster in ancient Mediterranean mythology from which the review takes its name and a ritualistic mask made with palm leaves from the Ethnographic Museum of Basel.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> But while the Minotaur on the cover page of the first issue remains a familiar iconography in the western tradition despite its placement amidst disparate components of a collage designed by Pablo Picasso, the identity of the small, strange face encrusted in the middle of the review's first page would have been obscure to most readers of the time. (<a name="1-text" href="#1">. 1</a> and <a name="2-text" href="#2">2</a>) All that is available to the eye is three schematic and strategically placed orifices on what looks like a dark mass of wires or bristles. Neither man nor woman, neither bird nor beast, the inchoate face emerging from hair or vegetation is an intermediary being that hovers somewhere between the world of human beings and whatever lies outside of it. No clue as to the possible link between the Minotaur and the mysterious grass mask is available except the four-line poem written by a certain "P. E.," "Un visage dans l'herbe," ("A Face in the Grass") which appears beneath the image of the mask. An analysis of this poem, therefore, is the only way to work out what we might consider the plastic-poetic mission statement of <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span> as a collective surrealist project.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The main components of the poem—vegetation, insect, man, rain, water—are intertwined; the hyphenated nouns ("insecte-feuille," "homme-feuille"), as well as the ambiguous use of adjectival nouns ("végétal" in French being both noun and adjective, "le végétal" could therefore mean both "the plant" or "that which is vegetal"), construct for us a world of ambiguous, indistinct beings in a constant process of metamorphosis. Part-man, part-beast, part-plant, the hybrid creatures inhabit a world of inexplicable coupling and birth. Like the hatching of a ready egg, an unknown face emerges spontaneously from "un nid de verdure" whose architect remains anonymous; the rain and the vegetation are wedded in an amorous union; and water, mediator between the gaseous and the solid, seems ready to take on any form, the way an eager bride offers herself to the first suitor. There is, in other words, a link between composite beings known as chimeras and the fluid identities of things whose interrelations might be characterized as "paraerotic." <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>The above analysis brings me to my main concern in this essay, namely the aesthetic and anthropological efforts in the 1930s by surrealism to come to terms with the phenomenon of mimetic-metamorphosis, in the course of which it becomes possible to identify a corpus of iconographies corresponding to various experiential modalities of passivity. The bull-headed monster <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span> and the Nias Island grass mask only announce a long list of mythic and paramythic res—ancient and modern, manmade as well found in nature—that tie together a review whose scope encompasses "arts plastiques—poésie—musique—architecture—ethnographie et mythologie—spectacles—études et observations psychanalytiques."<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> I shall discuss some examples in the review's first three years: images of Dogon maskers brought back by the surrealist turned ethnographer Michel Leiris from his two-year voyage in Africa (to which <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span> dedicated a special issue); Salvador Dalí's "êtres-objets" ("object-beings"), and photographic clichés of mystic faces; and Roger Caillois's anthropomorphic praying mantis and mimicking insects. That these res serve as a means for the surrealist circle to recuperate forms of passivity is evidenced by the fact that each of these res corresponds to a particular theoretical discourse on a specific mode of <span style="font-style:italic;">depersonalization</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">hors-de-soi</span>, which in "Un visage dans l'herbe" takes the form of impersonality.</p>
<p>The other striking feature of the short poem is the plainness of its idiom, all the more accentuated by the concealment of the poet's name behind two initial letters. Possibly, the surrealist poet Paul Eluard minimized his authorial presence in order to approximate his work to the anonymity of the grass mask, made by the people of the volcanic Nias Island near Sumatra, Indonesia.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> But anonymity is also linked to impersonality. The absence of verbs in the first line, "Après l'insecte-feuille, l'homme-feuille," keeps us in the dark regarding the logical relationship between the leaf-insect and the leaf-man. If the preposition "après" designates a temporal sequence, whereby the leaf-man descended from the leaf-insect as in a filial relationship, it can equally mean that the leaf-man was made after, or in the manner of, the leaf-insect, thereby deferring its origin to its qualities. In the three lines that follow, each a complete sentence in the basic order of subject-verb-object, all suggestion of psychology and subjectivism is suppressed starting with the qualifying part of speech, the adjective. (The use of "nid de verdure" only betrays the poet's effort to avoid its adjectival form, "nid vert.") In short, we are faced with the matter-of-fact language of fairytales and sacred texts, characterized by the condensation of events and elimination of details and psychology.</p>
<p>If we read the poem as a kind of schematic narrative, we get a chain of tableaux that takes us from the chimeric creatures to a scene of birth (the hatching of the face in the green nest), and then to the seduction of rain by the earth. Finally, in the last line, nothing is left but water, alone yet ready to give itself to "le premier venu." This order of events is peculiar because we are accustomed to its reverse. Technically, seduction should precede union, and union should precede birth—unless, that is, the poem is a genesis myth filmed backwards, which in turn reveals the origins of chimeric res such as the Nias Island "leaf-man" and the bull-man Minotaur. In short, the chimeras can be traced back to a spontaneous, mythic creation that results from the fusion between two elements (rain and vegetation). This union, however, would not have been <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  possible had there not been an existential passivity inherent in the elements themselves, whose poetic ration is the fluid, ardent water animated by the feminine principle ("from a hole"). In other words, Eluard's poem not only pays homage to mythic res but more importantly suggests the link between the phenomenon of metamorphosis and the experience of passivity.</p>
<p>The valorization of this experience, whose condition of possibility is a temporary suspension of the self, is not unequivocal in the interwar period. This was a moment when the European intelligentsia were greatly alarmed by the mass hysteria that fascist movements deliberately manipulated to their own political ends, and among these worried minds was the German-Jewish critic and thinker Walter Benjamin. Benjamin's presence in the avant-garde milieu of Paris dates back to around 1927, when he began to write in response and in dialogue with the surrealism of André Breton and Louis Aragon. By 1937, Benjamin was attending meetings at the secret society organized by the dissident surrealists and their friends, Collège de Sociologie, although he quickly suspected the group of protofascist tendencies as certain participants—in particular the young Caillois and Georges Bataille—professed a fascination with carnival, war, and sacrifice that went beyond mere sociological interest.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> And yet, his wariness about aestheticized collective effervescence notwithstanding, Benjamin worked throughout the 1930s on a deeply personal project concerned with the creative forms of passivity, whereby a person is momentarily released from his or her quotidian identity and transformed into other beings. <span style="font-style:italic;">Berlin Childhood around 1900</span>, which Benjamin worked on for nearly as long as the review <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span> lasted, is therefore not simply Benjamin's autobiographical album; it is equally an ethnographic study of childhood with a focus on the paratotemic identification with animals and the magical wanderings in the "arsenal of masks," the name Benjamin gives to his parents' west Berlin household.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> I shall discuss this essay in the context of <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span> as a way of uncovering the value of metamorphosis and passivity at the heart of surrealism.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Mask and Alterity in Artistic and Ethnographic Surrealism</h1>
<p>The debut of <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span> as a review, animated by the triangular relation between Eluard's "Un visage dans l'herbe," Picasso's <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span> cover page, and the Nias Island ritualistic mask, indicates the predicament of the avant-garde in the 1930s; namely, it is with the aid of existing animist and totemic cultures (mostly from Africa, Melanesia, and North America) that the Europeans were able to relate to similar forms of life that had long become marginalized in the west. Had it not been placed next to the Nias Islander grass mask, had the Tsimshian chief of the British Columbian coast not referred to it as an "European totem" to the Swiss surrealist painter Kurt Seligmann, the Minotaur would have remained a trope in western classical literature and iconography.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> The presence of living ritualistic artifacts—most importantly the apparatus of the mask, that time-honored, transcultural technology for creative transformation—now makes possible the recovery of an onslaught of worn-out clichés in the western tradition as res of alterity. The Minotaur, no less than the Sphinx and the chimera, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  can now be demystified and their experiential basis better understood thanks to living practices of metamorphosis, such as the elaborate West African masquerades that Leiris witnessed in his voyage with his friend the ethnologist Marcel Griaule in the Mission Dakar-Djibouti.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> It is in this respect that we are obliged to extend what James Clifford describes as "ethnographic Surrealism" beyond the "perverse collection" of ethnographic artifacts in surrealist publications (notably the eccentric <span style="font-style:italic;">Documents: Archéologie, Beaux-Arts, Ethnographie, Variétés</span> from 1929 and 1930) or the "sheer incongruities" of the surrealist collage, which constitutes merely the rhetorical (that is, provocative) aspect of what I would call "avant-garde philosophical anthropology."<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>If, as indirectly suggested by Eluard's poem, the main concern of avant-garde or surrealist philosophical anthropology in the 1930s has to do with the experiential dimension and ration of metamorphosis, then there is an unmistakable link between the Minotaur, the Nias Island grass mask, and the photographs of Dogon masking rituals in the second issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span>, dedicated entirely to ethnographic reportage from Mission Dakar-Djibouti. The latter provides the means to understand the social dimension of mimetic-metamorphosis, which would otherwise be difficult to assess by simply looking at iconography or an artifact in isolation. Leiris's report of the Dogon initiation ritual in Bandiagara (formerly in French Sudan, today part of Mali), for example, shows the extent to which the technical aspect of socialized metamorphosis depends on a complex network of taboos, rules, and practices accompanied by a corpus of material artifacts. The variety of mask forms, each bearing a distinct name ("masque dégué," "masque bézé," "masque gomintogo"), derives from an old <span style="font-style:italic;">savoir</span> whose development and sedimentation over time within a community produce a tradition. It is the practice of tradition and a corpus of well-made props which make possible the majestic final production that we see in the photographs of Dogon maskers, whose profile as animal-headed mythic beings recall classical res on Attic vases. (<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>)</p>
<p>There are, without a doubt, epistemological limits to the poetic recurrence of classical imageries in Leiris's and Griaule's ethnographic accounts. But, as shown by Leiris's later research, his aesthetic appreciation of African masquerades is animated by a serious interest in the cognitive value of creative forms of depersonalization. The evidence I shall give here is Leiris's study of the experience of possession and trance in the northern Ethiopian cult of <span style="font-style:italic;">zar</span>, which he takes seriously as a socially integrated form of theater that incorporates technical mastery of <span style="font-style:italic;">états sécondaires</span>, or altered states of consciousness.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">La Croyance aux génies zar en Éthiopie du Nord</span> , Leiris offers a brief but instructive phenomenology of how the entry into <span style="font-style:italic;">gurri</span>, the possessed pose signifying the arrival of the spirit <span style="font-style:italic;">zar</span>, is preceded by a series of inchoate (but utterly predictable, even systematic) experiences of emasculation, described by the women themselves as fatigue, oppression, shoulder pains, and the sensation of "being invaded by bees."<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> That the cult has long known how to artificially induce these symptoms and, more importantly, create proper names for them in connection with supernatural beings upheld by the community, suggests that ritualistic possession is as <span style="font-style:italic;">real</span> (in the sense of producing physiological changes in the bodies of the participants) as it is <span style="font-style:italic;">theatrical</span> (insofar as it is performative, therefore always conducted in group). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

</div>
<p>That possession is a technique that can be perfected is clear in the cases of great shamans, who make a living out of what might be called a skilled performance of personality dissociation. Several months in the company of the reputable medium Mälkam Ayyähu, who, even when not in trance, "never speaks of herself other than in the third person," convinced Leiris that the elderly lady had mastered what is essentially a theatrical technique: "Her <span style="font-style:italic;">zars</span> consist for her a kind of wardrobe of personalities that she can put on according to various needs and circumstances in her quotidian existence, personalities that offer her ready-made behaviors and attitudes that hover between life and theater."<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> The <span style="font-style:italic;">zar</span> is therefore not so much the fantasy of a superstitious, primitive people as it is a "mythic ration" ("ration mythique"), "a sort of theatrical mask that the person [in trance] no more than puts on, and becomes the <span style="font-style:italic;">zar</span> simply by virtue of putting it on."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>By understanding the <span style="font-style:italic;">zar</span> as a kind of mask, Leiris not only sheds light on the frequent connection of masquerade with the practices of trance and possession, he also contributes to uncovering the reasons for which mythic res in countless traditions entail altered or composite identities. Part of the challenge that <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span> takes up consists in recovering, without resorting to revival of old clichés, the possibility of new metamorphic res in modern life, for example Brassaï's evocative view of the twilight silhouette of the statue of Maréchal Ney in the Luxembourg quarter of Paris. The artful photographic transformation of a neoclassical commemorative statue into the apparition of a mythic warrior may have little to do with the profile of a masker in <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the initiation ritual "Koré" in southern Sudan in a photograph taken by Griaule, but by comparing these two chimeric silhouettes in <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span>, we perceive the ethos of aesthetic and ethnographic surrealism in the 1930s, a project consisting in developing a corpus of res of alterity in conjunction with phenomenological description of the experience of <span style="font-style:italic;">hors de soi</span>. (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>)</p>
<p>In the artistic sphere, Salvador Dalí contributed to this project with his famous 1933 montage, <span style="font-style:italic;">Phénomène de l'extase</span>, in which he identifies an array of forms and res corresponding to erotic and mystic ecstasy. In the full-page montage, cropped photographs and film stills of faces of women bearing voluptuous expressions are placed amid sculptural res of nymphs and saints with delirious smiles. A vertiginous series of clichés of the right ear, the carnal equivalent of the spiral art nouveau object found in the lower right, suggests that "Extase" is as much modeled after erotic and mystic rapture as it is formally constructed via organic motifs. (<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>) The following description of ecstasy is therefore as experiential as it is plastic, visual, or formal: "During ecstasy, with the approach of desire, pleasure and anguish, all opinion and judgment (moral, aesthetic, etc.) changes sensationally.—All image equally changes sensationally."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Dalí follows up this exercise in a 1935 piece entitled "Apparition aérodynamiques des 'Êtres-Objets'" (published on the page facing Brassaï's Maréchal Ney), where he modifies the category of "ecstasy" with an even more carnal description—as the sensation of an actively devouring space. In his characteristically megalomaniac, crypto-pornographic language, Dalí calls ecstatic space "this good meat, at once colossally arousing, voracious and personal, which at every moment, with its soft, disinterested enthusiasm, presses against the smooth finesse of 'strange bodies' and the bodies of 'object-beings'—which are also bodies that are more or less strange."<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> "Bodies that are more or less strange" include, among others, the three montage male res who, dressed in white slacks and a dark felt coat, seem to have suddenly kicked off their shoes and hopped upon an ornate writing table, wearing what look like cushion covers bearing Millet's paintings <span style="font-style:italic;">Angelus</span> (on the chest) and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gleaners</span> (on the head, like a mask). Despite Dalí's clownish posture, there is a serious attempt to establish the connection between the ecstatic experience of devouring space and the dissolution of bodies, which eventually results in the emergence of "strange," metamorphic "object-beings."</p>
<p>Dalí's particular formulation of "extase" and "êtres-objets" illuminates the link between two genres of interrelated iconographies in <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span>. On the one hand, we are faced with res of alterity or "transformer beings" such as masks, mannequins, and automatons, among which are Hans Bellmer's sadistic "poupée," Marcel Duchamp's mechanical bride (praised by André Breton), robots that the poet Benjamin Péret derived from a 1928 material history of automatons (<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>); René Crevel's "Grande Mannequin" illustrated by a bodiless garment ghost, even the rediscovery of Paolo Uccello's Quattrocento robot-warriors in the battle scenes of San Romano.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> On the other hand, we are given the means to imagine the process of their formation through distorted, fluid, intermediary form in a moment of becoming. Examples from the first three issues include Picasso's half-formed sculptures in the studio; the evocative photographs by Brassaï of incomplete nudes, close-up of the organic ironwork of the Paris <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  metro entrances, and "sculptures involontaires"; Man Ray's photographs of rippling, "edible" Barcelona façades; works by André Masson, Georges Braque, and Joan Miró that can be said to share a specifically 1930s surrealist idiom of dreamlike, metamorphic forms; and highly mannered baroque paintings by painters such as Tintoretto and Peter Paul Rubens. That the central preoccupation of <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span> is plasticity becomes clear in its emphasis on form, which, as in the aqueous receptivity that Eluard evokes in his short poem, yields, melts, and stretches beyond its original shape. Just as Leiris does not stop at the verbal testimonies for the arrival of the <span style="font-style:italic;">zar</span> but inquires into the physiological symptoms of trance that prepare the bodies for possession, <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span> is not only interested in res of alterity but also plastic ration of the very process of metamorphosis that makes their genesis possible.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span> was not the only avant-garde locus of the 1930s concerned with alterity, the other being <span style="font-style:italic;">Acéphale</span>, the journal put out by Bataille, Pierre Klossowski, and Jules Monnerot between 1936 and 1939 in conjunction with their activities in the Collège.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> But in contrast to <span style="font-style:italic;">Acéphale</span>, whose only rative features are André Masson's drawings of the headless man and the bull-headed Dionysus (serving as an insignia for a largely philosophical publication), the heavily visual <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span> is resolutely committed to the polymorphous world of form and ration. Jacqueline Chénieux-Gendron therefore argues that the surrealist investigation of alterity in the 1930s is characterized by the proliferation of "des res, au sens de rines, de poupées, de génies, de totems et autres golems mais aussi au sens d'emblèmes qui servent à donner forme à la difference," in contradistinction to the tendency in Bataille's group to pursue alterity in the mystical form of the "sacred," that key term that drives their sociological study of rituals and secret societies.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Surrealism, by contrast, is first and foremost concerned with anchoring alterity in the order of the symbolic ("l'ordre symbolique").

<p>Nevertheless, despite the differences between surrealism and the Collège and between <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Acéphale</span>, the two milieux were never quite far apart throughout the 1930s. This is demonstrated by Bataille's submissions to <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span>, including an unpublished piece entitled "Le masque" in 1934; the joined forces of Breton and Bataille in the anti-fascist coalition "Contre-Attaque" in 1936; and the contributions of young Caillois to the ration of alterity in <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span> during his brief but instrumental encounter with surrealism.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Although Caillois soon left surrealism to pursue the question of ecstasy and collective effervescence in the Collège in mainly sociological terms, his lifelong reflections on impersonal forms of creativity in nature began in the context of surrealism. On their own, Caillois's two essays on insects in the 1930s, "La mante religieuse. De la biologie à la psychanalyse"  and "Mimétisme et la psychasthénie légendaire"  might read like two obscurantist entomological studies <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  that bizarrely try to contradict all evolutionary explications for animal cannibalism and mimicry. Their publication in the context of <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span> makes it possible to see them as the search for res that evidence the possibility of intelligence without thought, creativity without art, and agency in the absence of the (human) agent.</p>
<p>By identifying the praying mantis and mimicking animals as nature's automatons and masquerades, Caillois begins to formulate in his peculiarly naturalist fashion what it would mean to act and create without the intervention of the sovereign ego, that magnificent artifact of the modern west that surrealism and the avant-garde have taken such drastic measures to counteract. Automatism, the well-known exercise in poetic thinking that Breton devised to free the human mind from rational constraints, is taken to a radical level by Caillois, whose impetuous remedy against human subjectivity is to dispense with the human altogether and to look into the insect and animal world for models of alterity. In "La mante religieuse. De la biologie à la psychanalyse," the praying mantis is identified as a kind of automatic android found in nature, whence its status as a mythic being in various cultures in Provence, Mexico, Melanesia, Africa, and ancient Greece. (<a name="7-text" href="#7"> 7</a>) Its anthropomorphic yet rigid appearance is striking even to scientists, one of whom describes the insect as a robot, "a machine with perfected wheelwork, capable of functioning automatically."<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> The female mantis, whose habit of devouring the male during mating fascinated Breton, Eluard, and Dalí alike, qualifies as "the machine woman, artificial, mechanical, inanimate, incommensurable with living mankind and creatures" ("MR," 25).</p>
<p>That the female mantis synonymously—and <span style="font-style:italic;">homonymously</span>—embodies love ("l'amour") and death ("la mort") has often been cited as the reason for its allure for the surrealists, who have a taste for "uncanny" artifacts such as Hans Bellmer's cadaverous montage dolls.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> But I would suggest that the ultimate interest of the praying mantis is the following: it appears to prove that complex movements and intelligent operations can occur in raw nature, in the complete absence of human agency. If we return momentarily to Eluard's poem, we will notice that the world it depicts, depleted of what we might call human <span style="font-style:italic;">motives</span>, is nevertheless <span style="font-style:italic;">moved</span> by some form of agency, which can only be described as the inexplicable nudging and shoving of things that blur the boundary between the animate and inanimate. The choice of verbs in the last three lines deliberately confuses the human, animal, and inorganic realms. While "éclôtre" describes the birth of birds, reptiles, and the like, and "séduire" the erotic enouncter between of human beings, "livrer" ("to give," "to yield," "to lend") in the last line brings the poem back to a neutral movement applicable to living things as well as inanimate objects.</p>
<p>I bring back Eluard's poem because, just as Eluard is more interested in the neutrality of movement than a lyrically personified nature, Caillois is struck by the praying mantis not so much because it humanizes nature, but because it seems to belong to a world where the very opposition between brute nature and what is commonly understood as human agency fails. In this world, we are asked to confront an alternative source for movement and transformation—one that is as independent from human motivation and purpose as it is from mechanical causality. To emphasize the enigma of the praying <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  mantis, Caillois calls attention to the most eerie aspect of the insect: its ability to act intelligently with or without its head:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>In fact, not only does the jointed rigidity of the mantis resemble that of an armor or an automaton, there is in fact no reflex that it is not capable of performing just as well even when decapitated, in the absence of all center of representation and voluntary activity. Even under these conditions, it is able to walk, find its balance, sever an endangered limb, take up a spectral posture, mate, lay eggs, build an ootheca . . . .</p>
<div class="attrib">("MR," 26)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Here, it becomes clear that Caillois's notion of the praying mantis as an automaton in nature cannot be considered simply another version of the scientific view of nature as a realm governed by objective, impersonal laws. His point is not so much to show that nature is autonomous of human consciousness, but rather that there exists in nature examples of organisms performing creative functions in the absence of a central nervous system.</p>

</div>
<p>Nowhere is Caillois's reasoning clearer than in his adamant rejection of the evolutionary view of many entomologists, who argue that the female mantis instinctively devours the male before mating in order to obtain nutrients necessary for laying eggs. In his counterargument, Caillois recalls the prolonged spasmodic reflexes of decapitated crickets and wonders "if the mantis that decapitates the male before mating were not aiming to remove the inhibiting centers of its brain in order to obtain a better and longer execution of the movement of coitus" ("MR," 25). Without being distracted by the perversity of this hypothesis (perhaps an instance of Caillois's cruelty that had disturbed Benjamin), we see that it is crucial for Caillois to view the mating behavior of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the praying mantis as non-procreative, non-utilitarian, and thereby creative, because—so his reasoning goes—if the praying mantis can continue to make love when deprived of a head, then the surrealist hypothesis that poetic or artistic activity could operate according to "pure psychic automatism" ("automatisme psychique pur") is far from implausible. That Caillois's understanding of automatism is incomplete becomes clear when he realizes to his incomprehension that the surrealist poets actually worked on their poems and discussed them openly in the company of their friends.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> But for our discussion here, the most important aspect of Caillois's phantasmagorical entomology is the extent to which it points to the rability of the experience of suspension of consciousness.</p>
<p>In fact, not only might there be forms and res in nature corresponding to the experience of radical passivity, there might be a direct, causal link between the experience of passivity and the most creative, art-like phenomenon in nature, namely, animal mimicry and metamorphosis. In "Mimétisme et psychasthénie légendaire," Caillois's second publication in <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span>, he goes so far as to argue that psychic and physiological paralysis is directly responsible for mimetic-metamorphic phenomenon in the natural world. As in the case of the cannibalistic praying mantis, Caillois's argument for the presence of creativity or "lyricism" in nature obliges him to show that the phenomenon of animal mimicry cannot be fully justified by utilitarian advantages. The argument of camouflage as organic defense can explain the mimicry of the leaf insects, whose spotted and veined wings blend imperceptibly into the foliage in which they find refuge; and that of mantises whose legs simulate petals or flowers—but not the degree of their virtuosity. Since the predators are often warded off by a rudimentary level of resemblance, no vital need demands the complete illusionism performed by the Caligo butterfly from the Brazilian forests, whose wings bear oculi and feathery patterns that resemble the face of an owl, or that of the Kallima butterfly in Indonesia and Malaysia, whose wings "in fact bear gray-green stains resembling infestation of lichen mold as well as reflective surfaces that give them the look of perforated, torn leaves."<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> And what function of self-defense could justify the case of the leaf insects (Phyllium bioculatum), whose spotted and veined wings blend so imperceptibly into the foliage that they end up being trimmed by the gardeners? (<a name="8-text" href="#8"> 8</a>) Worse, Cailois suggests, for the miserable creatures end up "graz[ing] among one another, taking each other for real leaves in such a way that one would consider it a kind of collective masochism leading up to mutual homophagy" ("M," 7).</p>
<p>What is extraordinary is that this case of imperfect natural adaptation, which actually no more than affirms the random character of natural selection, is interpreted by Caillois as a phenomenon of excess, "une exaggération de précaution," as some entomologists claim. As known to biologists, mimicry is no surefire defense and not all instinctual behaviors are optimal for the species. But to Caillois, this fact proves that "we are thus dealing with a luxury, even a dangerous luxury" ("M," 7). Or, we are dealing with nature as decadent, as an artist. What takes Caillois's anti-evolutionary view beyond the commonplace notion that nature contains art-like phenomena is its distinctly surrealist flavor, in particular Caillois's claim—allegedly backed by entomological research—that <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the virtuosity of animal mimicry is the result of "an act of pure automatism" ("un acte d'automatisme pur"; "M," 8), instigated by the physiological and psychic paralysis of the organism leading to a breakdown of the boundary between the organism and its milieu. In what can only be understood as a derangement of the perception of space and loss of orientation, the organism</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>is no longer the origin of [spatial] coordinates but a point among others; it is stripped of its privilege and <span style="font-style:italic;">no longer knows where to put itself</span>, in the strong sense of the expression. . . . The sense of personality, that is, the organism's sense of distinction in the environment, and the sense of a link between consciousness and a particular point in space, soon become seriously threatened under these conditions. We then enter the psychology of psychasthenia, more precisely of <span style="font-style:italic;">legendary psychasthenia</span>, if we agree to give this name to the derangement of the above definitive relations between personality and space.</p>
<div class="attrib">("M," 8)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">This account of the absorption of an organism into space clearly has many features in common with Dalí's "strange objects" being devoured by the "colossal meat" of an ecstatic, devouring space, not least its culmination in mimicry, more precisely in mimetic-metamorphosis. As a result of the psychic emaciation, of the dissolution of the psychic skin of the organism, as it were, the organism transforms completely into the main component of its environment or the creature that it seeks to imitate.</p>

</div>
<p>That psychasthenia, Caillois's preferred term for experiential passivity, is linked to most if not all mimetic-metamorphic phenomena in the world is the crux of this discourse, which at time risks becoming a vertiginous labyrinth of scientific esotericism. Convinced of the complete identity between the animal world and the world of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  human beings, Caillois suggests that the latter, too, are subject to the laws of mimicry and metamorphosis in their practice of "psychological virtualities" ("M," 7). In the anthropological studies of "mimetic magic" ("magie mimétique") and incantation by Tylor, Hubert, Mauss, and Frazer, the principle of "association by contiguity" often goes hand in hand with "association by resemblance." Just as "things that have once been in contact remain united," things that resemble one another are often considered equivalent; mimicking, in short, is becoming ("M," 7). The process from mimetic gestures to complete metamorphosis, where "an incantation [is] fixed at its culminating point, having took the sorcerer in his own trap," is the technique whose general name is magic ("M," 8).</p>
<p>Paradoxically, however, in order to show the experiential continuity of psychasthenia in animal and human mimicry, Caillois needs to resort to a uniquely human form of evidence, namely, narrative testimonies of the experience of depersonalization. Not only does Caillois appeal to the psychiatrists Pierre Janet and Eugène Minkowski for their clinical accounts of psychotic depersonalization, he reports from his own "attack of 'legendary psychasthenia,' intentionally aggravated for the purposes of ascetic exercise and interpretation," as he tells us in a footnote ("M," 10, footnote 57). If Leiris documents the testimonies of participants in the cult of <span style="font-style:italic;">zar</span>, Caillois uses his self-ethnography to confirm Minkowski's phenomenological description of the experience of emaciation in many psychotic episodes. In both cases, depersonalization is characterized by spatial and temporal disorientation, in which the person has the sensation that "<span style="font-style:italic;">I know where I am, but I don't feel like I am at the spot where I find myself</span>" ("M," 8).<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> For individuals in these conditions, space becomes "a devouring force" that "pursues them, encircles them, digests them in a gigantesque phagocytosis," and, finally, "it replaces them." Once absorbed by space,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>the body then dissociates itself from thought, the individual crosses over the frontier of his skin and inhabits the other side of his senses. He tries to look at <span style="font-style:italic;">himself, from</span> any other point in space. He himself feels as if he were becoming space, <span style="font-style:italic;">dark space ("de l'espace noir") where one cannot put things</span>. He is <span style="font-style:italic;">similar</span> ("semblable"), not similar to something, but simply <span style="font-style:italic;">similar</span>.</p>
<div class="attrib">("M," 8–9)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Although Caillois does not go so far as to claim that this "<span style="font-style:italic;">depersonalization by assimilation to space</span>" could <span style="font-style:italic;">physically</span> transform the human being into a flower or a plant, but insofar as it <span style="font-style:italic;">experientially</span> blurs the boundary between the subject and his environment, it is in his mind at least comparable to "what mimicry accomplishes morphologically in certain animal species" ("M," 8–9).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the fact that Caillois could have documented and reconstructed his own psychasthenic attack "from introspective notes"—an act unimaginable in the animal world—indicates that the animal and human world are nevertheless characterized by certain differences, contrary to what Caillois would have liked to argue. But this does not seem to concern Caillois any more than, for example, the functional difference between sympathetic magic and psychosis. Left theoretically underdeveloped is the contrast between, on the one hand, socially mediated, artfully controlled, and essentially <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  theatrical forms of metamorphosis such as masquerades, shamanism, and trance and, on the other, the anguished, existentially solitary loss of agency in mental illness. As Caillois will later admit, his account of "psychasthenia" in the 1930s is far from being a satisfactory explanation for mimicry, let alone for creative mimetic activities of human beings.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> But insofar as Caillois has identified a spectrum of experiences of passivity with specific species of phantasmagoric insects, insofar as he has understood the issue of mimicry and metamorphosis in terms of alterity and passivity, his two essays for <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span> are in dialogue with Leiris, Dalí, and the philosophical anthropology of surrealism.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Of Butterfly, Otter and the Arsenal of Masks: Walter Benjamin's Childhood Animism</h1>
<p>If, as I have been suggesting, mimetic-metamorphosis is the leitmotif of the avant-garde in the 1930s, it should not surprise us that Benjamin too was concerned with this mode of experience, which, as the European intelligentsia of the period seemed to agree, was no longer easily accessible in the modern west without appealing to ethnographic, artistic, biological, and even psychiatric material. Benjamin's interest in mimicry and metamorphosis can be glimpsed already in the various essays and fragments he wrote in the late 1920s (the period when surrealism began to make a definitive impact on his thinking), not least his essays on children's play and playthings, as well as the inspired "Some Remarks on Folk Art" from around 1929 (see my first epigraph).<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> The latter contains an enigmatic invitation to penetrate quotidian objects such as furniture and inhabit them like masks, thus announcing Benjamin's autobiographical album <span style="font-style:italic;">Berlin Childhood Around 1900</span> where Benjamin reconstructs his own childhood and thereby offers us a personal phenomenology of metamorphosis. It is through this text, which demonstrates that a bourgeois, urban childhood nevertheless contains animist if not totemic episodes, that I wish to uncover the epistemological and cognitive value of metamorphosis and experiential passivity, not only for Benjamin but for the surrealist avant-garde to which he serves as a fellow-traveler.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most convincing accounts of animism and totemism in <span style="font-style:italic;">Berlin Childhood</span> have to do with the child's proximity to creaturely life. Benjamin's homage to the otter in the pantheon of the Berlin zoo is simultaneously an exercise in magical thinking, which, as the anthropologists tell us through the voice of Caillois, is animated by the principle of "association by contiguity." Thus, just as "one forms an image of a person's nature and character according to his place of residence and the neighborhood he inhabits," the child forms the image of the ostriches as ancient Egyptian gods as they are "marshaled before a background of sphinxes and pyramids" and that of the hippopotamus as mandarin high priest who "dwelt in its pagoda like a tribal sorcerer on the point of merging bodily with the demon he serves."<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> The otter, for its preference to dwell in the rain-collecting cistern rather than in the rock grottoes prepared by the zoo, becomes the "sacred animal of the rainwater" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BC</span>, 80). "A pampered animal whose empty, damp grotto was more a temple than a refuge," the otter is only truly in <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  its element when receiving the rain in a mystic union, an event that the child "looked on insatiably" as if experiencing an intense, sensual bliss: "For, to me, the long, sweet day was never longer, never sweeter, than when a fine- or thick-toothed drizzle slowly combed the animal for hours and minutes. Docile as a young maiden, it bowed its head under this gray comb" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BC</span>, 80–81).</p>
<p>But so intense is the child's link to the rainwater god that it is as if every rainy day brings the presence of the otter to him. Here Benjamin's text performs the totemic telepathy between the child and his otter-god by unnoticeably changing the scene on us. For a moment we believe to be standing before the otter's cage, mesmerized like the child Benjamin, who</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>waited. Not until it stopped raining, but until it came down in sheets, ever more abundantly. I heard it drumming on the windowpanes, streaming out of gutters, and rushing in a steady gurgle down the drainpipes. In a good rain, I was securely hidden away. . . . In such hours passed behind the gray-gloomed window, I was at home with the otter. But actually I wouldn't become aware of that until the next time I stood before the cage.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">BC</span>, 81)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">That is, catching his readers unawares and stupefied by the torrential rain, Benjamin the adult writer transports us furtively from the zoo to the sheltered bourgeois home, where, with rain drumming on the roof and windows, the child feels as if he were nevertheless "at home with the otter," now a timeless, placeless mythic re thanks to the transrative power of the child's analogical thinking.</p>
<p>But the identification with creaturely life in <span style="font-style:italic;">Berlin Childhood</span> cannot be mistaken as a sentimental love for animals. The episode entitled "Butterfly Hunt" suggests that the child's identification with butterflies in the gardens of Brauhausberg has more in common with the predatory sympathetic magic of hunting societies. The process begins with the extreme concentration of the predator who, with "butterfly net upraised," hovers next to the unwitting prey, "waiting only for the spell that the flowers seemed to cast on the pair of wings to have finished its work" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BC</span>, 50–51). But the weightless agility of his prey overcomes the frustrated child-hunter, "made a fool of" by the "hesitations, vacillations, and delays" of a cunning vanessa or sphinx moth until he realizes that his success would depend on a transformation of his identity. His first wish is to "have been dissolved into light and air, merely in order to approach my prey unnoticed and be able to subdue it" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BC</span>, 51). Thus, transforming himself into the atmosphere that wraps around the butterfly, so that "every quiver or palpitation of the wings I burned for grazed me with its puff or ripple," the child proceeds to get ever closer until he feels himself metamorphosing into his prey:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Between us now, the old law of the hunt took hold: the more I strove to conform, in all the fibers of my being, to the animal—the more butterfly-like I became in my heart and soul—the more this butterfly itself, in everything it did, took on the color of human volition; and in the end, it was as if its capture was the price I had to pay to regain my human existence.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">BC</span>, 51) <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">What follows the fusion of identity between the butterfly and the child is the combat, whose erotic intensity is accessible to us only through the victor's description of the aftermath:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>And what a state the hunting ground was in when I left! Grass was flattened, flowers trampled underfoot; the hunter himself, holding his own body cheap, had flung it heedlessly after his butterfly net. And borne aloft—over so much destruction, clumsiness, and violence—in a fold of this net, trembling yet full of charm, was the terrified butterfly. On that laborious way back, the spirit of the doomed creature entered into the hunter.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">BC</span>, 51–52)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Here Benjamin's narrative makes the transition from the first person ("what a state the hunting ground was in when <span style="font-style:italic;">I</span> left") to the third person, referring to himself as "the hunter" ("<span style="font-style:italic;">his</span> lust for blood," "<span style="font-style:italic;">his</span> confidence," etc.), the way the great Ethiopian shaman does, as Leiris tells us. Benjamin's transition of voice is all the more curious as it occurs precisely at the moment when the child/hunter/Benjamin allegedly regains his human consciousness, as if the annihilation of the enemy simultaneously brings about the defeat of the self in the first person. Thus the knowledge acquired through his metamorphosis consists not so much in the acquisition of an actual tongue by which the creatures of the world communicate ("the foreign language in which the butterfly and the flower had come to an understanding" [<span style="font-style:italic;">BC</span>, 52]) but rather the entry into the realm of the third person, the world of impersonality that Eluard described with such simplicity and plainness.</p>
<p>Benjamin's autobiographical phenomenology of animal identification in childhood suggests that the experience of depersonalization occurs in forms other than the socialized technique of trance and the pathological condition of psychosis. Insofar as the child's elastic sense of self and his readiness to play, provoke, and master elements of his habitat constitute a quotidian form of mimetic-metamorphosis, Benjamin's remark in the 1929 fragment that "the world is full of masks" demands to be understood from the point of view of the Berlin child, for whom every object in the "arsenal of masks" of his parents' home promises an experience of transformation (<span style="font-style:italic;">BC</span>, 100). Thus, "the child who stands behind the doorway curtain himself becomes something white that flutters, a ghost," and "the dining table under which he has crawled turns him into the wooden idol of the temple; its carved legs are four pillars." When hiding behind a door, "he is himself the door, is decked out in it like a weighty mask and, as sorcerer, will cast a spell on all who enter unawares" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BC</span>, 99). The only way to trap the magician is to uncover his mask, to catch him red-handed in his ruse: "whoever discovered me could hold me petrified as an idol under the table, could weave me as a ghost for all time into the curtain, confine me for life within the heavy door" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BC</span>, 99–100).</p>
<p>In a world where every object is a mask, the self becomes a plastic material, ready to take on the form of all things, including snowflakes, soap bubbles, watercolors, and even a custom-made desk at home, to which the child becomes united against the alienating bench in school: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>And hardly had I regained my desk after a dreary day at school, than it gave me new strength. There I could feel myself not only at home but actually in my shell—just like one of those clerics who are shown, in medieval paintings, kneeling at their priedieu or sitting at their writing desk, as though encased in armor.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">BC</span>, 151)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">That is, the desk is not only a mask but a full-bodied costume that allows the child to break out of his fragile skin and metamorphose into an almighty <span style="font-style:italic;">desk-man</span>, not unlike the Dogon maskers whose complex apparatuses allows them to momentarily become other-worldly beings. Here Benjamin's account of profane childhood animism aligns with the surrealist ration of alterity, only it is neither psychasthenic insects nor possessed shamans who are the protagonists of the drama of metamorphosis. Instead, it is children, not yet hardened by social constraints and endowed with incomparable psychic and physical plasticity, for whom <span style="font-style:italic;">otherness</span> and the suspension of the self constitute a genuine source of joy.</p>
<p>Recently, the philosopher and Benjamin scholar Giorgio Agamben has interrogated the "anthropological machine" of the modern west by appealing to an unusual image of animal-headed res at a Messianic banquet, found in the thirteenth-century illuminated Hebrew Bible in the Ambrosian Library in Milan. Agamben proposes that this rare moment of Judaic totemism can be seen as an invitation to "render inoperative the machine that governs our conception of man . . . to show the central emptiness, the hiatus that—within man—separates man and animal." And if, as Agamben realizes, such a project to overcome the alienation of humankind from creaturely life has been precisely tackled by Benjamin and other critical thinkers of the 1930s, then I would suggest that within the surrealist discourse on mimicry and metamorphosis can be found the answer as to why such an overcoming might be of ethical and political urgency, and why Agamben should urge us, at the end of the twentieth century, "to risk ourselves in this emptiness: the suspension of the suspension, Shabbat of both animal and man."<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>As a way of concluding my discussion, I would like to bring together Benjamin's reflection on mimicry and the subtle yet pointed response of the review <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span> to a social, political, and ethical issue specific to its time, the crisis of sovereignty that had caused the failure of European political culture and was on the brink of bringing on a second, devastating world war. Since, as shown above, the child Benjamin's understanding of mimetic-metamorphosis centers around the emulation and transformation into otherness, it makes far more sense to become similar "to dwelling places, furniture, clothes" than to be "similar to models of good breeding," and "never to my own image" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BC</span>, 131). The child thus finds himself "at such a loss when someone demanded of me similarity to myself," as in the photographer's studio, where "I saw myself surrounded by folding screens, cushions, and pedestals which craved my image much as the shades of Hades craved the blood of the sacrificial animal" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BC</span>, 131). The incomprehension of the child toward an enterprise that consists not of metamorphosing into another being but of producing an artificial image of himself as an ennobled Alpine shepherd—"brandish[ing] a kidskin hat" that "cast[s] its shadow on the clouds and snowfields" of "a crudely painted prospect of the Alps" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BC</span>, 131), is, I suggest, comparable to the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  skepticism of the surrealist milieu toward the rising dictators of Europe, who believed themselves to be sovereign leaders simply by donning themselves in the superficial attributes of power.</p>
<p>In the surrealist art patron Edward James's humorous, yet serious, tribute to the making of a king, the discourse of metamorphosis is fully mobilized as means of critiquing the false travesty of fascism. Published in 1936, "Le chapeau du peuple et les chapeaux de la reine" is partially the Englishman's eccentric answer to the editors of <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span>, having been asked to write on a phenomenon in modern life that qualifies as the surrealist "marvelous." Although the essay begins by espousing the wonders of kings in general, who "like gods, are personages so important in the order of super-natural things that there is always at least one king in every fairytale, just as there is nearly always a forest," it soon becomes clear that James has in mind not <span style="font-style:italic;">all</span> kings but the recently deceased English monarch George V and his spouse Queen Mary.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>The montage printed above the title of James's essay, consisting of postage stamps put together to form a Minotaur's bull-horned head (<a name="9-text" href="#9"> 9</a>), eloquently summarizes a phenomenon as perplexing as it was fascinating to its contemporaries: how an ordinary, not exactly brilliant, stamp-collecting man with essentially middle-class taste could slowly but surely evolve to become a beloved sovereign.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> James's dialectical answer to this enigma is as plain as it is profound: the making of not simply a king but a <span style="font-style:italic;">good</span> king depends as much on the impersonal love of a collective identification as it does on the willingness of the monarch himself to surrender his individuality to the people. Like any phenomenon of metamorphosis, this one requires a milieu that applies certain external pressure on the individuals (Dalí exaggerates this factor by calling it voracious), in the form of "demanding ideas that surround them in concentric circles starting from the farthest to closest persons in their entourage," until the king and the queen finally succumb to "the sum of abstract esteem fixed and directed to them by the general ensemble" and "became really greater than they were" ("C," 56–67). The king and the queen are therefore no other than living mascots that stand for the ensemble of the wishes of their people, "similar to efes, living totems and big puppets" ("C," 57). Like the complete erasure of the first person that Leiris observes in the Ethiopian shaman Mälkam Ayyähu,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>nothing is left from [the] original ego [of the king and the queen] other than the surface, of which even the unconscious gestures and physical contours have become stereotypes by virtue of seeing themselves so often in photographs. They are no longer purely personal traits as they would be in ordinary citizens; on the contrary, they are official attributes and property of the state. The King and the Queen are two urns filled with the idea of what their people want them to be. . . . They are metamorphosed like butterflies delivered from the cocoon of their individual, often simple and bourgeois tastes. . . . Removed from their own normal, human and average nature, projected against the popular screen like enormous shadows, they see themselves with such immensity until they become, by virtue of the sole fact of what they represent, super-human beings.</p>
<div class="attrib">("C," 57)</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus it is hardly surprising that James and the surrealist milieu, with their kind of understanding of the protracted making of a king, should remain unimpressed by the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">overnight successes of fascist regimes. The difference between the fascist dictator and the authentic sovereign or the venerated shaman is the difference between he who sacrifices his individuality to become "the hat of his people" and he who "creates the effect of a hairdo for a short time" ("C," 57) or applies the steel helmet of brute oppression. James's prediction of the inevitable failure of fascism—"in the long run, no doubt a chef like Adolf Hitler or Benito Mussolini will weigh down like a helmet too heavy to wear and injure the forehead like a helm too hard or too narrow" ("C," 57)—is therefore not an underhanded endorsement of monarchy as an institution but a tribute to one ordinary man who became a decent king—a king whose pacifism did not prevent him from criticizing "those horrid fellows Göring and Goebbels" and the "mad dog which must bite somebody" that was Mussolini.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> By locating the "marvelous" aspect of kingship in the metamorphosis that it produces in an individual, James avoids the pitfall of a generalized fascination with monarchy that burgeoned in the Collège de Sociologie (its anarchistic, acephalic icon notwithstanding). From the point of view of surrealism, what might save European civilization was not the return of a traditional <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  hierarchical power (as a thinker like Georges Dumézil would have thought).<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Instead, it was the understanding of mimetic-metamorphosis as a protracted and therefore enduring kind of transformation, which in turn would help to recognize the faux-culture and faux-revolution that is fascism.</p>
<p>The reflections on metamorphosis and alterity presented in <span style="font-style:italic;">Minotaure</span> go to show that no genuine transformation is possible if we refuse to enlarge the notion of the person beyond that of a sovereign individual with rational mastery of the self. In this sense the surrealist avant-garde can be said to have accomplished what their contemporary Marcel Mauss also sought to do in 1938, to restitute the excessively subjectivist notion of the "person" in the West to its origin in the Latin word "persona," meaning the mask through which the voice (of an actor) is projected. And if the social anthropologist and philosopher is right to call attention to the parallel between the pre-Christian notion of the persona/mask and the neuter notion of the person as "soi," which in countless cultures in the world still take precedence over the first-person "moi," then it might be said that the avant-garde recuperation of the mask has at least resuscitated the transcultural value of the third-person, whose historical marginalization in the West must be held partially responsible for the rift between modern Europe and the cultures that became victims to its various forms of social, political, and spiritual violence.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

Benjamin's opinion of Caillois was ambiguous, and although Benjamin wrote scathingly of Caillois's "pathological cruelty" in a letter to Horkheimer, Benjamin's English editors point out that "there are clear correspondences between important aspects of Benjamin's own work and that of Bataille in particular—not least their mutual adherence to a kind of late surrealism. It is also significant that Caillois is cited extensively in the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Arcades Project</span>." Michael W.

This—and not the petty fact of becoming a dissident surrealist—was the subject of Alberto Giacometti's reproach when Leiris returned from Africa. See Jean Jamin, "Présentation de l'Afrique Fantôme," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Miroir de l'Afrique</span> (Paris: Quarto Gallimard, 1996), 79.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Plus de Jazz</h1>
<p>The idea of jazz modernism has two dimensions. The first is the acknowledgement that musicians such as Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and Fats Waller deserve recognition for developing jazz into a modernist art music, comparable within its own genre to the innovations of modernists in other fields and media: "To call Armstrong, Waller, et al., 'modernists' is to appreciate their procedures as alchemists of the vernacular who have 'jazzed' the ordinary and given it new life."<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> The second, as I argue in this article, is the recognition that certain "jazz" principles and techniques are discernible in the works of other contemporary, modernist artists.</p>
<p>The story of jazz modernism is largely a history of migrations and detours, the movement of ideas and influences as well as of people, between the U.S. and Europe and back again, as well as across racial borderlines. The new jazz aesthetic represented by Ellington, Armstrong, and Waller, and the idea that jazz was becoming an art music in a way that had been quite unexpected early in the 1920s, was recognized and championed especially by European intellectuals and critics who were able to hear their music when they undertook tours of Europe in the first half of the 1930s. For example, when Louis Armstrong played in London in 1932, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Herald</span>'s show business columnist Hannen Swaffer reported ordinary people walking out, leaving "excited young men of the pseudo-intellectual kind … bleating and blahing in ecstasy."<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> In 1934, the English critic and composer <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Constant Lambert claimed that he knew of "nothing in Ravel so dextrous in treatment as the varied solos in the middle" of Ellington's 1928 "Hot and Bothered," nor anything in Stravinsky "more dynamic than the final section." At around the same time, the European-based Australian composer Percy Grainger placed Ellington alongside Bach and Delius in his pantheon of composers.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Such appraisals of jazz as art and jazz as modernism took some time to develop. At the start of the 1920s, the Bloomsbury art critic Clive Bell certainly believed that there was what he called a "Jazz theory of art," but he did not approve. In "Plus de Jazz" ("No More Jazz") he rails against the stupidity of its acolytes, "on whose banner is inscribed 'No discrimination!' 'No culture!' 'Not much thought!'"<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> The obituary now seems shockingly premature. Bell himself reckons that the jazz movement "bounced into the world somewhere about the year 1911," the year that Irving Berlin revived ragtime with the worldwide success of "Alexander's Ragtime Band" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 215). Bell was writing a decade later, in 1921, four years after the Original Dixieland Jazz Band made their raucous debut at London's Hammersmith Palais in 1917. Looking forward, this was still six years before Duke Ellington started his residency at the Cotton Club and seven years before Louis Armstrong recorded his genre-redefining "West End Blues." Timing apart, what is most surprising about Bell's attack on jazz is that, although originally written as a journal article, it appears as the final chapter to <span style="font-style:italic;">Since Cézanne</span> , the book in which he championed an emerging great tradition in modern art: the painting of "Derain, Matisse, Picasso, Bonnard, Friesz, Braque, etc." (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 214). Why should Bell decide to end a defense of modern painting with an attack on the modern sounds of jazz—or, rather, with an attack on the modern <span style="font-style:italic;">phenomenon</span> of jazz, given that he offers no discussion or even description of jazz as music?<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>That silence is itself the clue. This is about culture wars, not music criticism. Bell's aim was to discriminate between good modernism and bad modernism; jazz represents the bad modernism that he deplored and to which his good painterly modernism would provide an antidote. If, for many Americans in the 1920s, "to argue about jazz was to argue about the nature of change itself," it was equally true for European intellectuals that to argue about the significance of jazz was to adopt a stance on modernity and the aesthetics of modernism.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>At bottom, Bell disliked jazz because it represented a "revolt against nobility and beauty." "The Jazz movement is a ripple on a wave" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 214), he asserts dismissively, a trivial symptom of modernization that had distracted attention away from the critical and valuable aspect of modernism, which was "the large movement which began at the end of the nineteenth century in a reaction against realism and scientific paganism" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 214). The essence of jazz was its <span style="font-style:italic;">impudence</span>—"impudence which finds its technical equivalent in syncopation: impudence which rags"—and the preference for instant gratification over sustained aesthetic development or intellectual depth evident in its "determination to surprise" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 215). It pandered to "a typically modern craving for small profits and quick returns" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 216). Above all, jazz was liked by the wrong people, the young, the idle, and the unserious: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Jazz is very young: like short skirts, it suits thin, girlish legs, but it has a slightly humiliating effect on grey hairs. Its fears and dislikes—for instance, its horror of the noble and the beautiful—are childish; and so is its way of expressing them. Not by irony and sarcasm, but by jeers and grimaces does Jazz mark its antipathies. Irony and wit are for the grown-ups. Jazz dislikes them as much as it dislikes nobility and beauty. They are the products of the cultivated intellect, and Jazz cannot away with intellect or culture. Niggers can be admired artists without any gifts more singular than high spirits; so why drag in the intellect?</p></blockquote>
<div class="sectionBreak">
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">La bonne compagnie</span> they [the inventors of Jazz] found in the lounges of great hotels, on transatlantic liners, in <span style="font-style:italic;">wagons-lits</span>, in music-halls, and in expensive motor-cars and restaurants. <span style="font-style:italic;">La bonne compagnie</span> was dancing one-steps to ragtime music. This, they said, was the thing. … And, of course, it was delightful for those who sat drinking their cocktails and listening to nigger-bands to be told that, besides being the jolliest people on earth, they were the most sensitive and gifted. They, along with the children and savages whom in so many ways they resembled, were the possessors of natural, uncorrupted taste. They first had appreciated ragtime and surrendered themselves to the compelling qualities of Jazz. Their instinct might be trusted: so, no more classical concerts and music-lessons; no more getting Lycidas by heart; no more Bædeker; no more cricking one's neck in the Sistine Chapel: unless the coloured gentleman who leads the band at the Savoy has a natural leaning towards these things you may depend upon it that they are noble, pompous, and fraudulent.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 216; 217–18)</div>
</blockquote>
<p>For Bell, it seems, snobbery and casually venomous racism are legitimate weapons in the defense of endangered cultural values: the "high seriousness, professionalism, conscience, reverence, and vitality" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 229) that he sees in the work of his preferred painters. His worry, when it comes to music and literature rather than painting (where only the Italian Futurists, "with their electric-lit presentation of the more obvious peculiarities of contemporary life and their taste for popular actualities," had been silly enough to attempt "a pictorial expression of Jazz" [<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 221]), is that good artists can be infected by jazz. In music, he admits, jazz had produced one first-rate master: Stravinsky, who, although "too big to be covered by a label" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 222) had been "influenced much by nigger rhythms and nigger methods" and had "composed ragtimes" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 221). One tier below him sit the <span style="font-style:italic;">petits maîtres</span> of the jazz movement, notably <span style="font-style:italic;">les six</span>, the group of composers, including Milhaud and Poulenc, associated in Paris with Jean Cocteau. In literature, half an hour reading Cocteau along with Blaise Cendrars would give sufficient idea of what jazz poetry could offer. In prose, James Joyce "effectually, and with a will, rags the literary instrument" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 224). Joyce adopts a principle of syncopation that "flouts traditional rhythms and sequences and grammar and logic," even if he does so with "talents which though genuine are moderate only" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 223, 224). Although Virginia Woolf flirts dangerously with syncopation in some of her writing, she remains among the saveable: "she is not imbued with that spirit which inspires the genuine <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Jazz writers, whether of verse that looks oddly like prose or of prose that raises a false hope of turning out to be verse, and conditions all that they produce" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 224) "She is not," in one of Bell's favorite terms of disparagement, "<span style="font-style:italic;">gavroche</span>."</p>
<p>Bell's biggest worry, however, is</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Mr. T. S. Eliot—a poet of uncommon merit and unmistakably in the great line—whose agonizing labours seem to have been eased somewhat by the comfortable ministrations of a black and grinning muse. Apparently it is only by adopting a demurely irreverent attitude, by being primly insolent, and by playing the devil with the instrument of Shakespeare and Milton that Mr. Eliot is able occasionally to deliver himself of one of those complicated and remarkable imaginings of his: apparently it is only in language of an exquisite purity so far as material goes, but twisted and ragged out of easy recognition, that these nurselings can be swathed.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 222–23)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Bell is right about Eliot to the extent that, at this stage of his career, he was not afraid to acknowledge his enjoyment of popular culture or to work its rhythms and iconography into his poetry. In a debate at Oxford in 1914, Eliot rebuked fellow Merton students for disavowing "how much they owed to Amurrican culcher in the drayma (including the movies) in music, in the cocktail, and in the dance."<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> For Bell, aesthetic discrimination was "something altogether different from telling a Manhattan from a Martini" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SC</span>, 230). And Bell would hardly have been reassured by a letter in 1919 in which Eliot tries to explain his difficulties as an American outsider—a southern boy with a "nigger drawl," as he once described himself to Herbert Read. In the end, Eliot worries that "I may simply prove to be a savage."<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Bell's "Plus de Jazz" can in the end best be understood as an early plea for what in French avant-garde circles a few years later would be called the <span style="font-style:italic;">rappel à l'ordre</span>—the title of a book by Jean Cocteau in 1925 that rejected postwar disorientation, hedonism, and anything-goes relativism in favor of the neoclassical virtues of order, discipline, and beauty.</p>
<p>Knowing what the music has gone on to produce, it is easy to say that Bell got jazz wrong. But even more to the point, did Bell get Eliot wrong? Was Eliot really on the side of jazz and opposed to nobility and beauty? It hardly seems likely. So was he doing something beyond Bell's wit? That is, was he experimenting with the possibility that jazz values could be transmuted into "nobility and beauty," or even considering whether "nobility and beauty" might <span style="font-style:italic;">need</span> something that jazz had to offer, if they were to survive in the modern world? Might a jazz aesthetic—as evident at this time in Eliot's poetry—actually be pressed into service for a <span style="font-style:italic;">rappel à l'ordre</span>?</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> certainly, even willfully, demonstrates some of Bell's jazz vices. Bell deplored the reliance of jazz on surprise; Eliot in a series of essays written while working on the poem repeatedly stresses the aesthetic value of surprise. "The strange, the surprising, is of course essential to art," he declares in July 1921. "The craving for the fantastic, for the strange, is legitimate and perpetual; everyone with a sense of beauty has it."<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Bell valued "lucidity above all things" and disliked the sensual appeal of jazz to the young. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> is hardly "lucid." This obscurity did not deter <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  some young readers, for whom the poem's appeal lay partly in its rhythms and partly in an intuitive sense that, however classical in its references, it was in tune with other developments in modern culture. In an autobiographical essay in <span style="font-style:italic;">Shadow and Act</span> , for example, Ralph Ellison recalls being taught at school about the poets of the Harlem Renaissance. As he was more interested in jazz than poetry at the time, he respected them without being inspired:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Then came <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land. The Waste Land</span> seized my mind. I was intrigued by its power to move me while eluding my understanding. Somehow its rhythms were often closer to those of jazz than were those of the Negro poets, and even though I could not understand them, its range of allusion was as mixed and as varied as those of Louis Armstrong.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">On the other side of the Atlantic, the poet Louis MacNiece had a similar reaction when he read Eliot's poem in his final year of school in 1926. "We had seen reviews proclaiming him a modern of the moderns and we too wanted to be 'modern'," MacNiece recalled. Although the literary allusions and anthropological symbolism of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> were beyond his grasp too, like Ellison he found an alternative cultural point of entry. "The cinema technique of quick cutting, of surprise juxtapositions, of spotting the everyday detail and making it significant, this would naturally intrigue the novelty-mad adolescent and should, like even the most experimental films, soon become easy to grasp."<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>What appealed to Ellison and MacNiece might well have struck Clive Bell as the childish impudence of syncopation, the kind of writing that <span style="font-style:italic;">rags the literary instrument</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">plays the devil with the instrument of Shakespeare and Milton</span>. Almost combatively, however, Eliot weaves the syncopation of popular music into <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>'s collage of arcane references. The most famous instance is the allusion to a 1912 song written for the Ziegfeld Follies, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Shakespearean Rag</span>, in which Eliot out-syncopates the syncopators by adding a syllable and making it "that Shakespeherian rag." Equally important is the placing of these lines in "The Chess Game" section of the poem. This chess game appears to be a mutually destructive emotional stalemate between a wheedling and resentful female voice and an emotionally cauterized, but silently screaming, male interior voice. Challenged to say what he is thinking, the lifeless male voice first responds with an honesty that is unspeakable—"I think we are in rats' alley / Where the dead men lost their bones"—and then offers bleak and perfunctory reassurance: "Nothing again nothing." Goaded further, the inner voice reinforces the deadliness of despair with the reference to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tempest</span>: "Those are pearls that were his eyes." The ragtime reference then bursts into this litany of nihilism as a desperate bid to drown out the bickering and to escape into a different psychic reality that might indeed be "so elegant, so intelligent." This is a more desperate escapism than anything imagined in Bell's caricature of the cocktail drinkers at the Savoy. The rhythm of popular song also interrupts and rags the verse in the "Fire Sermon," in a pastiche that has been linked to the minstrel shows of Eliot's St. Louis childhood.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> The shows are evoked explicitly in "The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear," but their "art of mélange" may also structure Eliot's sampling of grotesquely divergent references and quotations <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and their juxtaposition within the context of a nightmarish urban landscape: Spenser, Marvell, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tempest</span>, John Day's pastoral reference to hunting horns transformed into motor horns, a rude parody of the sentimental ballad <span style="font-style:italic;">Red Wing</span>, Wagner's use of the Grail legend, and a line from Verlaine.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>This promiscuous mixing together of elite and popular culture, of authentic and inauthentic culture, of the valuable and the meretricious was just what Bell meant by <span style="font-style:italic;">ragging</span>, although he would probably have recognized the precision of their orchestration. The difference between Bell and Eliot was not that one believed in normative cultural values, while the other did not. It is more that, whereas Bell operated with a Gresham's Law of culture in which the circulation of bad art must necessarily drive out the good, Eliot was already developing a consciously anthropological understanding of culture as a whole way of life in which high and low necessarily coexist and interact. He was therefore able to see <span style="font-style:italic;">the process of culture</span> as the recombination of these elements in new and distinctive patterns. By the same token, <span style="font-style:italic;">the aesthetic process</span> entails the artist remaking his own experience, and also reworking the words and things and traditions in which that experience is objectified, in new and meaningful patterns. This process of anthropological reinvention through recontextualization is what Eliot applauded in the way that Stravinsky's <span style="font-style:italic;">Sacre du printemps</span>  transformed "the rhythms of the steppes into the scream of the motor horn, the rattle of machinery, the grind of wheels, the beating of iron and steel, the roar of the underground railway, and the other barbaric cries of modern life."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> It is a process also evident, as his sometime collaborator Gilbert Seldes implies, in Eliot's "use of the rhythms of jazz to contrast with the stately phrases of the past."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> In Eliot's art of juxtaposition and montage, to quote in a different rhythm is to transform, to make new.</p>
<p>What Eliot captures in the references to popular music—and also through his invocation of communication machines like the typewriter and the gramophone—is a postwar estrangement of the senses, which transmutes into a disturbing rhythm that is sometimes stultifying and sometimes febrile. This is the inner reality of modern life lived to the tempo of jazz. As F. Scott Fitzgerald observed in "Echoes of the Jazz Age" in 1931: "The word jazz … is associated with a state of nervous stimulation, not unlike that of big cities behind the lines of a war."<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> It was this ethos that Eliot and others were able to transform through, and into, a jazz aesthetic.</p>

<h1 class="sec-headA"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Ballet mécanique</span></h1>
<p>Born to artists in Boston in 1897, filmmaker Dudley Murphy moved to Southern California in 1915 with his mother and sister when his parents divorced. He dropped out of his engineering studies to become an aviator, flying bombing missions in the final years of the First World War. Returning to Los Angeles after the war, he spent a year as a Hollywood art director and camera apprentice, while also writing about film for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Los Angeles Evening Express</span>. In 1920, he made his first films: three experimental dance shorts synchronized to music by composers such as Debussy. While continuing <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to experiment with his "visual symphonies" and sound-image synchronization, Murphy spent August 1921 researching lenses and camera technology at the Physics Department of Dartmouth College. In 1922, he made <span style="font-style:italic;">Danse Macabre</span> to the music of Saint-Saëns, his most ambitious film to date and a departure from Californian imagism in favor of a more expressionist style, conjured up through graphic and animated effects.</p>
<p>By this time, Murphy had developed what remained an abiding passion for the mechanical power of the camera to create new forms of choreography—with a taste for Gothic kitsch thrown in. Having developed his "calling-card" portfolio of films, Murphy headed off to Europe for a couple of years, accompanied by his second wife, the young dancer Katherine Hawley, before returning to his marginal and unpredictable career on the fringes of the American industry. There, he developed a treatment for <span style="font-style:italic;">Skyscraper</span>, a film designed to celebrate "the fantastic speed and rhythm of this jazz age" in New York.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> He was occasionally able to get close to the center of the action, but he always remained on the lookout for opportunities to make the type of films that he believed in—while always hoping too that they would bring him fame and fortune.</p>
<p>One of the surprising things about Murphy as a young American traveling to Europe in 1923 is that, although he took with him novel ideas about cinema as a choreographic medium capable of combining music, dance, and movement, jazz does not appear to have been a central concern to him. Instead, he learned in Europe to embrace jazz, developing elements of a jazz aesthetic for film. The decisive experience was working on what remains his best known achievement: his collaboration with Fernand Léger and others on the film <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>, planned, shot, and edited in Paris over a number of months in 1923 and 1924 and first screened at the Internationale Ausstellung für Theatertechnik in Vienna on 24 September, 1924, has claims to being the definitive avant-garde film of the early 1920s. It was certainly one of the first attempts to create a truly abstract cinema, although whether that abstraction is best described as cubist, dadaist, vorticist, or purist remains open to debate. The film has remained controversial in other ways too, most notably the question of who ought to be regarded as is true begetter, or, more pertinently, begetters. The systematic repression over several decades of Murphy's contribution has now largely been made good, but what role was played by three other large American egos—those of Ezra Pound, Man Ray, and George Antheil—remains an intriguing, if in the end irresolvable, enigma.</p>
<p>In this article, the interest of the film lies in the question whether <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> can usefully be regarded as a jazz film. Does it enrich understanding of the film to view it as a manifestation of a jazz aesthetic or, if that is too narrow a term, then as the product of a jazz ethos that was one important aspect of the modernist milieu of Paris in the first half of the 1920s? If it does, then which elements of the film embody a jazz aesthetic or can be attributed to this jazz ethos?</p>
<p>T. S. Eliot's fellow-poet and fellow-American-in-Europe, Ezra Pound, radically edited <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> to create the version that was published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Dial</span> in 1921. Pound also had a hand in brokering the connections that led to the production of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>, and probably in its production as well. When Dudley Murphy arrived <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  in Paris, he called on Pound, with whom the Murphy family had shared a holiday in Venice a decade and a half earlier. "Dudley Murphy, " wrote Pound in a letter to his father, "whom I met in Venice in 1908, he being then eleven; turned up a few days ago. His dad is a painter, he is trying to make cinema into art. ETC." (<span style="font-style:italic;">DM</span>, 52). Pound had developed an interest in the "vortographic" experiments of the photographer Alvin Langdon Coburn, and he was therefore interested in the lenses (or lens covers) that Murphy had developed at Dartmouth, which produced a similar kaleidoscopic fragmentation of the image. There is some evidence that the two of them did at least some production and editing work on the film, with Pound in January 1924 again reporting to his father: "Also work on vorticism film—experiment interesting—but probably Murphy hasn't brains enough to finish the job in my absence or without pushing" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DM</span>, 53). Murphy's recollection in later years—and no one's account of these events wholly squares with anyone else's—emphasizes less collaboration than the way that Pound set in motion the chain of events that led to <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>: "One day, when I was visiting Ezra Pound and talking about my work, he told me that a friend of his, Ferdinand Leger (<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>), wanted to make a movie. Also George Anteil (<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>), the young protege of Stravinsky would like to make a movie. So he brought the three of us together and we decided to make one."<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>This version does not acknowledge that Murphy had already met another American in Paris, the photographer Man Ray, possibly on 6 July, 1923 at the dadaists' "Evening of the Bearded Heart." Along with music by Milhaud, Satie, and Stravinsky, poems from Apollinaire, Cocteau, and Soupault, and a play by Tristan Tzara, the evening presented screenings of several experimental films, including Man Ray's <span style="font-style:italic;">Le retour à la raison</span>.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Whatever he was doing with Pound and Léger, Murphy seems to have suggested a collaboration with Ray and they started to build up an archive of footage. Out in the city they filmed shop windows, traffic, and an amusement park. They shot various still-life arrangements, a parrot, Murphy himself, images of Katherine Murphy sniffing flowers and sitting prettily on a swing, and extreme close-ups of the mouth and eyes of Man Ray's girlfriend, Kiki de Montparnasse, in flat white mime make-up. (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>) They also planned to intercut pornographic footage of the two couples between shots of pistons and other machine parts pumping up and down.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>Soon, predictably, the money ran out. At Ezra Pound's prompting, Léger was approached to support the project, and possibly also the American heiress Natalie Barney, who hosted an influential salon in Paris, to underwrite what Léger called "a musical synchronized adaptation" by the expatriate avant-garde composer and self-proclaimed "bad boy of American music" George Antheil—at this time probably more a protégé of Pound's than of Stravinsky's (<span style="font-style:italic;">DM</span>, 54).</p>
<p>In his autobiography, Antheil claims that he had initiated the whole project. His story is that, in October 1923, he announced in the press that he was working on a new composition to be called "Ballet mécanique" and that he was looking for "a motion-picture accompaniment to this piece" ("BPS," 33). Supposedly egged on by Pound, Murphy accepted the challenge on the condition that he would collaborate with Léger. In the end, working independently and not from any prints, Antheil did produce a score for <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  synchronized player-pianos, sirens, motor-horns, electric bells, aeroplane propellers, and assorted other mechanical objects and musical instruments. This noise-based music was well adapted to leading Léger and Murphy's mechanical dance. The only two problems were that it was not completed until 1925 or 1926 and that it was twice as long as the film. Apart from that, Antheil claimed, Léger "said it was beyond his expectations and that it was as right as right can be" ("BPS," 33). Even if that is true, Antheil's intransigence in refusing to adapt the score to an existing print meant that, for many years, <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> the film and "Ballet mécanique" the composition led separate lives—to the detriment of both.</p>

<p>Whoever did what, with whom, and in what order, there is no doubt that Léger was becoming more and more interested in film by 1923. In 1922, although contributing nothing himself beyond a poster design, he had followed the progress of Abel Gance's film <span style="font-style:italic;">La Roue (The Wheel</span>) through the participation of his friend, Blaise Cendrars, and he wrote enthusiastically about aspects of the film. It was neither the dramatic nor the emotional dimension that interested him, but "a new plastic contribution" in which a "mechanical element" is crucial: "This new element is presented to us through an infinite variety of methods, from every aspect: close-ups, fixed or moving mechanical fragments, projected at a heightened speed that approaches the state of simultaneity and that crushes and eliminates the human object, reduces its interest, pulverizes it."<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>This emphasis on the plastic and the mechanical, and on the new ways of seeing opened up by the close-up and by montage, was no doubt, in part, a projection of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Léger's thinking about his own art. After his traumatic war experience, Léger had reinvented his style, developing a new vocabulary of form, color, and rhythm intended to capture the beat of the modern metropolis. Having been "criticized severely" for tackling "the mechanical element as a plastic possibility," he insists in 1923 that, "The mechanical element <span style="font-style:italic;">is only a means and not an end</span>. I consider it simply plastic 'raw material,' like the elements of a landscape or a still life" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FP</span>, 24). What interests him, even if spectators find it challenging, is to create "an intensive organized state," in which "the weight of masses, the relationship of lines, [and] the balance of colors" are subjected to "absolute order" and to "the law of plastic contrasts" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FP</span>, 28). "I group contrary values together; flat surfaces opposed to modeled surfaces; volumetric res opposed to the flat façades of houses; molded volumes of plumes of smoke opposed to active surfaces of architecture; pure, flat tones opposed to gray, modulated tones or the reverse" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FP</span>, 29).</p>
<p>These surprising and disconcerting juxtapositions set his work in tune with the times:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>We live <span style="font-style:italic;">in a geometric world, it is undeniable, and also in a state of frequent contrasts</span>. The most striking example of this is the advertising billboard—sharp, permanent, immediate, violent—that cuts across the tender and harmonious landscape. A contemporary fashionable party contrasts the men's severe, crisp black clothes with the prettier and more delicately colored dresses of the women. An epoch of contrasts. … So I am consistent with my own time ….</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">FP</span>, 30)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The power of film, and especially the power of the close up, lies in "<span style="font-style:italic;">making images seen</span>" and the consequence of the "cinematic revolution" is therefore "<span style="font-style:italic;">to make us see everything that has been merely noticed</span>." Having observed <span style="font-style:italic;">La Roue</span> in production, and having seen how Cendrars constructed a montage sequence to convey the power of a locomotive through rapid cuts, syncopated visual rhythms, and violently contrasting machine imagery, Léger declared that he "wanted to make a film at any cost."<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>The explicit aim was to create in film what Léger called a <span style="font-style:italic;">machine aesthetic</span>. Hence the selection of objects in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>: industrial machines and machine-made objects carefully patterned in characteristic Léger assemblages, or in such extreme close-up that they become unrecognizable. He wanted to provoke spectators not just into seeing them anew, but into seeing them as <span style="font-style:italic;">beautiful</span>. But, like his fellow purists Le Corbusier and Amédée Ozenfant, Léger was not after any old fuzzy aestheticism, but a classical, yet uniquely modern, "Beauty." In trying to define the essence of that machine-age beauty, Léger suggests why there are so many saucepan lids, whisks, flan dishes, and other kitchen utensils dancing around in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>: "The Beautiful is everywhere: perhaps more in the arrangement of your saucepans in the white walls of your kitchen than in your eighteenth-century living room or in the official museums" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FP</span>, 52–53).</p>
<p>What appealed to Léger about cinema as a vehicle for a machine aesthetic were the possibilities of "the mechanical element" becoming the leading character, of composing visual fragments into an artistic whole (montage), and of introducing a temporal <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  dimension (a <span style="font-style:italic;">modern rhythm</span>) into his art. In 1923, he contributed set designs for a futuristic laboratory that was the setting for the climactic scene in Marcel L'Herbier's <span style="font-style:italic;">L'inhumaine</span>, but it was only in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> that he found the opportunity to create a film that demonstrated the mathematical principles of order, discipline and, especially, rhythm, which he saw as being intrinsic to the times, but which were also indicators of the emerging <span style="font-style:italic;">rappel à l'ordre</span>:<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>The particular interest of the film is centered upon the importance which we give to the "fixed image," to its arithmetical, automatic projection, slowed down or accelerated—additional, likeness.</p>
<p>No scenario—Reactions of rhythmic images, that is all.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Judging from his earlier and later films, Murphy probably had a less clearly articulated aesthetic agenda than Léger. Less theoretical than intuitive and hedonistic, Murphy wanted to explore and expand the potential of film as a medium for the creation and representation of dance. One of Murphy's dominant memories was of getting hold of the mannequin legs to be used in the stop-motion Charleston sequence: "In bringing the legs to the studio, I drove through Paris in an open cab, with a leg over each shoulder, screaming. Even the Frenchmen were startled by this" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DM</span>, 46). With Pound, Murphy seems to have been happy to make a vorticist film. He deferred to Man Ray's desire to produce a dadaist celebration of machines and machinery—"I insisted on my Dada approach if we were to work together, to which he readily agreed" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DM</span>, 49). And, when Man Ray decamped, Murphy was able to fit in with Léger's more classical and more disciplined agenda:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>We talked over ideas and I set out with my camera and the film, executing the ideas that we had talked over and photographing things that stimulated my imagination around Paris. The premise on which we decided to make the film was based on a belief that surprise of image and rhythm would make a pure film without drawing on any of the other arts, such as writing, acting, painting.</p>
<div class="attrib">("BPS," 31)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">This does not mean that Murphy was a naïve technician at the beck and call of egotistical artists. Rather, he was an artist who could learn, pragmatically rather than theoretically, from each of his collaborators—but also a filmmaker who had something to teach them. Just as Murphy acquired from Léger a more considered cinematic grammar for his future dance experiments, so Léger learned from his collaboration on <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> a new understanding of the meaning and associations of objects, and new ideas about how to work their kinetic plastic juxtaposition into his future paintings (see "BPS," 42).</p>
<p>This speculation on the provenance of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> makes it tempting to suggest that there was something jazz-like about its production. At least five idiosyncratic voices <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  were articulating dissonant styles, and yet somehow they managed to "hear" enough of what the others were doing to be able to respond, interact, and, in the end, produce a single dynamic film art work. This is no more than an analogy; it is not where the film's jazz aesthetic lies. Even so, it does suggest a way of looking at <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> that is more alert to its improvised polyphony than those critical views that want to tie it down to being one thing or another, or belonging only to one author or another. The provocative dadaist voice of Man Ray—"All the films I made were improvisations"—is there in some of the imagery and in the film's eroticism; Pound's residual vorticism can be seen in the kaleidoscopic fragmentation of the image; Léger's "more theoretical" purism shapes the film's structure as well as the look of many of the parts; and perhaps, in the end, it is Murphy's cinematic choreography that holds the whole thing together—preferably to Antheil's machine-music accompaniment.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>Seen like this, the opening minutes of the film appear not just as an exercise in abstract cinematic rhythm, but as more argumentative and culturally engaged than is often supposed. Before the title credit, we see Charlot, Léger's Charlie Chaplin marionette, of which more later. <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> starts, then, with the mechanical choreography of stop-frame animation, which at the same time not only makes a cubist design dance, but also asserts that this film stands in some sort of relation to the energy and power of popular cinema. After the title, the images appear to be Murphy and Ray's, even if the logic of their montage may largely be Léger's. We see Katherine Murphy, smiling coyly and fluttering her eyelashes on her garden swing (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>) and setting up the underlying metronomic rhythm for the sequence, before the scene is interrupted (in accordance with Léger's graph of the film's construction [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>]) by a rapid montage of objects—a bowler hat, numerals, colored circles and triangles (that are Léger's nod to the abstract cinema of Richter, Fischinger, Eggeling, and Ruttmann), bottles, Kiki's mouth demonstrating the rhythmic mechanics of a smile, the bowler hat again, Kiki's mouth again, spinning circular objects that could be umbrellas or just painted discs, a vertiginously gyrating pendulum.</p>
<p>Then the first rhythm is restored by a return to Katherine on her swing, but this time projected upside down. Is this inversion nothing more than a formal device? The visual pun of "the world turned upside down" is hardly new or subtle. Look, it says: this is the ethos of modern dance—feminine, Arcadian, natural—that our film will overturn. Next, reflected in a swinging Christmas-tree ball, whose arc and rhythm replicate exactly those of the inverted swing, we see a movie camera and two men, Murphy operating the camera, Léger in the foreground directing. So: out with the female body in a pastoral setting, in with the mechanical eye of the camera, in with the cameramen who create new ways of seeing, and in with a new vision of modern woman, made up, hair waxed and reduced (like Charlot) to a montage of parts.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>At this point, Murphy's kaleidoscopic prism over the camera lens is brought into action, creating a choreography of objects or part objects—often, so far as they can be made out, saucepan lids, flan dishes, jelly molds, and other kitchen utensils photographed from disorienting angles or distances. This is Léger making us see, and see the plastic beauty of, "<span style="font-style:italic;">everything that has been merely noticed</span>," whether that be these <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">objects or the abstract shapes or the extreme close-ups of Kiki's mouth and eyes, with which they are interchangeable. Then, perhaps as the end point of this prelude, we see Dudley Murphy himself emerging from the jumble of objects, like Venus rising from the surf. (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>)</p>
<p>This way of seeing the film locates it in its cultural moment. And this is where jazz legitimately comes into the analysis. 1923 was still the moment of jazz in Paris, and it is that jazz ethos that is rendered in the mechanical imagery, the plastic contrasts, and the rhythm of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>. The most apposite account of the jazz ethos, and one that is more historically alert and more socially nuanced by far than Clive Bell's diatribe, is offered by Michel Leiris in his autobiography, <span style="font-style:italic;">Manhood</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>In the period of great license that followed the hostilities, jazz was a sign of allegiance, an orgiastic tribute to the colors of the moment. It functioned magically, and its means of influence can be compared to a kind of possession. It was the element that gave these celebrations their true meaning: a <span style="font-style:italic;">religious</span> meaning, with communion by dance, latent or manifest eroticism, and drinks, the most effective means of bridging the gap that separates individuals from each other at any kind of gathering. Swept along by violent bursts of topical energy, jazz still had enough of a "dying civilization" about it, of humanity blindly submitting to The Machine, to express quite completely the state of mind of at least some of that generation: a more or less conscious demoralization born of the war, a naïve fascination with the comfort and the latest inventions of progress, a predilection for a contemporary setting whose inanity we nonetheless vaguely anticipated, an abandonment to the animal joy of experiencing the influence of a modern rhythm, an underlying aspiration to a new life in which more room would be made for the impassioned frankness we inarticulately longed for. In jazz, too, came the first public appearance of <span style="font-style:italic;">Negroes</span>, the manifestation and the myth of black Edens which were to lead me to Africa and, beyond Africa, to ethnography.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>In this remarkable passage, Leiris identifies several features that resonate with aesthetic and cultural impulses already identified as being at work in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>. These signs of the time are, therefore, relevant to understanding the alchemy of transmuting jazz context into film art. For Léger, no doubt more than for his American collaborators, the drive behind his radical change of approach and style, in the attempt to create an art adequate to the times, can be attributed at least in part to "demoralization born of the war"; Murphy was the only one to have seen service, but, for him, the experience had been exhilarating rather than traumatic. In their individual ways, the Americans would all have shared Leiris's ethical ambivalence about modernity. Certainly, Léger at this time showed a fascination, whether naïve or not, with "the latest inventions of progress"—including cinema—even if it stopped just short of "blindly submitting to The Machine." In <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>'s contrasts between two types of the modern woman, and in the copulatory rhythms and erotic symbolism of its machines and objects, there may well be a gesture toward "the impassioned frankness" about sexual matters that Leiris wistfully invokes.</p>
<p>So far, this catalogue has established a degree of thematic congruence, without yet identifying how jazz as a transformative aesthetic might be at work here. Paradoxically, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  a pointer toward that crucial mechanism may be found in one of Leiris's features of jazz, which is manifestly <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> visible in the film: that is, Negroes. Despite that absence, and recalling his reference to "latent or manifest exoticism," it is relevant to recall that this was the moment of <span style="font-style:italic;">l'art nègre</span>, as well as of jazz—or together with jazz, as one of the features of the voguish primitivism was that the two were frequently conflated.</p>

<p>Several of the contributors to <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> were very much bound up in <span style="font-style:italic;">l'art nègre</span>. Although Man Ray's 1926 photographs of Nancy Cunard bedecked in African ornaments and of Kiki de Montparnasse with an African mask are notorious examples, he did have a degree of self-knowledge about his relationship to black art. A year or two before <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>, he had shot a slyly ironic portrait of himself. He poses as a stylized jazz drummer, with sticks at the ready and regulation shadows projected on to the wall. There are no drums, however, just a small cymbal attached to what looks, on the wall, very like a grand piano, but which, on closer inspection, turns out to be an ordinary gramophone. Any jazz here is mechanically reproduced, and Man Ray declares himself to be a white consumer, rather than a black producer, of the music; or perhaps his point was that, in the very act of appropriating the music as an expatriate white Jewish American dadaist, he might actually be reworking it according to his own cosmopolitan lights, and so doing something a little bit alchemical.</p>
<p>Most explicit about the impact of <span style="font-style:italic;">l'art nègre</span> on the ethos of the time when <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> was being made was George Antheil. In his contribution to Nancy Cunard's <span style="font-style:italic;">Negro</span> anthology, published in 1934, Antheil recalls how Paris had reacted to African American music a decade earlier: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Since Wagner, music has had two giant blood infusions: first the Slavic, and, in recent times, the Negroid. […] Negro music appeared suddenly (after a gigantic preparation) after the greatest war of all time … it came upon a bankrupt spirituality; to have continued within Slavic mysticism would have induced us all, in 1918, to commit suicide; Negro music made us to remember at least that we still had bodies which had not been exploded by shrapnel and that the cool 4 o'clock morning sunshine still coming over the hot veldt of yesterday was this morning very, very sweet. We needed at this time the licorice smell of Africa and of camel dung … the roar of the lion to remind us that life had been going on a long while and would probably go on a while longer. Weak, miserable, and anaemic, we needed the stalwart shoulders of a younger race to hold the cart awhile till we had gotten the wheel back on. But first acquaintance with this charming and beautiful creature, the Negro, made us love him at first sight; we could not resist him.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Here Leiris's "demoralization born of the war" is hyped up into Antheil's "bankrupt spirituality," Leiris's "bursts of tropical energy" and "animal joy" find their parallel in Antheil's realization "at least that we still had bodies" and, above all, Leiris's response to "Negroes" as "the manifestation and the myth of black Edens" is given a eugenicist twist in Antheil's view of "this charming and beautiful creature, the Negro," whose historic role would be to reinvigorate a white race rendered "weak, miserable, and anaemic."<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> One difference seems to be that Leiris knew quite well that he was listening to African <span style="font-style:italic;">American</span> jazz, even if it did inspire him to become an anthropologist and work in Africa, whereas Antheil, whether naïvely or disingenuously, reproduces the primitivist conflation between jazz and Africa. Despite all his rhapsodizing over the veldt and the camel dung, however, Antheil also thinks of jazz in terms of a machine aesthetic. The music represents "an incredible musical machinery." "One can scarcely believe," he exclaims, "that one has not to do with a civilized race, <span style="font-style:italic;">masters of steel, mathematics, and engineering</span>, in hearing these choruses from the Congo."<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>At the same time as he started contributing to <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>, Léger was designing the costumes, sets, and curtain for <span style="font-style:italic;">La Création du monde</span>, the Ballets Suédois's attempt at a <span style="font-style:italic;">ballet nègre</span>, which had its first performance on 25 October, 1923. With a book by Blaise Cendrars, based on traditional African stories, Léger's designs provided a visual counterpoint to the contemporary jazz-influenced score by Darius Milhaud, newly arrived back from a trip to New York and Harlem. Spiking the worst excesses of primitivism with the spirit of the <span style="font-style:italic;">rappel à l'ordre</span>, Léger and Milhaud aimed for an Africanism stripped down, "purified," and jazzed up as an antidote, again mixed with the logic of the machine, against the decadence and lassitude of contemporary European culture. Léger's set and costume designs may have depicted an anthropologically dubious pastiche of images from the "deepest jungle," filled with "savage idols" and "wild beasts," but he insisted that they were based on "African sculpture from the classical period" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FP</span>, 63) (whenever he imagined that to have been) and that their purpose was to turn dancers into a "mechanism like everything else." Milhaud, likewise, compared the jazz bands he admired to well-oiled machines, and stressed that he used "the jazz style to convey a purely classical feeling."<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>The inference from the fact that Man Ray, Antheil, and Léger were all caught up with <span style="font-style:italic;">l'art nègre</span> is that they experienced what Leiris called "the influence of a modern <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  rhythm" through jazz and specifically as "Negro jazz." This is the key condensation: <span style="font-style:italic;">a modern rhythm was at the same time the rhythm of the machine and the rhythm of "Negro music."</span> The claim that <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> embodies a jazz aesthetic therefore rests on the extent to which its vernacular imagery of everyday life and ordinary objects is rhythmically "jazzed," and so given new life. The possibility suggests quite a different reading from that which sees the film as purely abstract, although abstraction is undoubtedly part of the jazzing process in the sense that rendering the world in terms of geometric and tonal images is the necessary first step before those can then be put into a syncopated rhythmic relationship to each other. In 1923, Léger refers to the way that a painting "organized, orchestrated, like a musical score, has geometric necessities exactly the same as those of every objective human creation (commercial or industrial achievement)" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FP</span>, 28). In film, those "geometric necessities" are orchestrated temporally and everything becomes rhythm, although rooted in a still recognizable cultural vernacular. The film, in other words, demands both a sensory response that might be described as abstract, and also a more poetic reading that picks up on cultural clues and references.</p>
<p>An example of the predominance of the purely sensory impact of rhythm can be found in the sequence of the washerwoman climbing the stairs. Both Murphy and Léger laid claim to it, and the shades of difference between their accounts are revealing. For Murphy it was an exercise in montage that takes on a certain metaphoric significance:</p>

<p>An example of jazzing the semantic vernacular, so that it becomes almost pure rhythm, is the treatment of the cod headline <span style="font-style:italic;">On a volé un collier de perles de 5 millions</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">(Pearl necklace worth 5 million stolen</span>), apparently inspired by the headline "Un collier de 5 millions. On l'a volé naturellement" ("A 5 million necklace. Naturally, it was stolen") in <span style="font-style:italic;">L'intransigeant</span> on 10 September, 1924. Léger regarded advertising, and especially billboards, as part of the "enormous stage set of life" that provided his plastic raw material. But they were also both symbols and expressions of urban life, part of the overload of information that produced the defining urban sensations of temporal discontinuity and spatial disorientation. Léger's original work notes suggest that he had planned to reproduce this modern sense of unease by incorporating and interpreting some of the "plastic and theatrical values" through which commerce intruded into public space, most notably billboards and the press. Such ideas may have been inspired by the American artist Gerald Murphy's set design for <span style="font-style:italic;">Within the Quota</span>, a jazz ballet with a score by Cole Porter that opened as the other half of the Ballets Suédois double bill with <span style="font-style:italic;">La Création du Monde</span> in October 1923. The huge backdrop showed the front page of an American tabloid, with headlines like "UNKNOWN BANKER BUYS ATLANTIC," "Ex-Wife's Heart-Balm Love Tangle," and "RUM RAID LIQUOR BAN." Behind this lay a longstanding cubist fascination with the graphic power of typography, evident not only in a painting like Léger's own <span style="font-style:italic;">The City</span> , but also in Picasso's <span style="font-style:italic;">Guitar, Sheet Music, and Glass</span> , where the chopped-short newspaper masthead LE JOU connotes not only "Journal" but also <span style="font-style:italic;">jouer</span>, to play. In the end, Léger scaled back his ambitions for <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> to a single decontextualized headline. Already unanchored from its story, Léger and Murphy take the headline apart, break it into fragments, reverse those fragments, and stretch them out spatially and temporally. Zeros flash, singly or in groups, then alternate on screen with fragments of the message. Both words and numerals take on a dynamic force that overwhelms any referential meaning. They too become grist to the rhythmic mill: they are jazzed.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>In a third example of the film's jazz-like alchemy of the vernacular, the plastic raw material is so freighted with cultural significance that it cannot be drained of value, even though it unquestionably contributes to the rhythm of the film. The raw material, in this case, is the image of Charlie Chaplin, the cubist Charlot marionette. Léger had adored and been inspired by Chaplin's films since Apollinaire had introduced him to them during the war. In 1920 he had provided four illustrations for Yvan Goll's book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Die Chapliniad: Eine Kinodichtung</span>, and, in 1922, he designed the sets and costumes for Jean Börlin's Ballets Suédois production, <span style="font-style:italic;">Skating Rink</span>. With music by Arthur Honegger, this was based on a poem by the Italian Futurist, Riciotto Canudo, that in turn derived from Chaplin's short, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rink</span> . Between these two projects, Léger had begun to develop quite an elaborate scenario for an animated film, <span style="font-style:italic;">Charlot Cubiste</span>, and it is material from this uncompleted project that he imported into <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> What Léger most admired about Chaplin, apparently, was his ability to affect and manipulate his audiences. The presence of Charlot at the beginning of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> may, therefore, be a statement of Léger's faith in the power of cinema in general, and of this film in particular, to control audience response.</p>
<p>"Overwhelmed by the enormous stage set of life," Léger had asked himself, "what can the artist who aspires to conquer his public do?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FP</span>, 36). Opening with the Charlot <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  re suggests that one primary technique for conquering the public in this film will be a certain cinematic <span style="font-style:italic;">rhythm</span>, insofar as Chaplin was widely taken to embody cinematic rhythm. In a 1926 interview, for instance, Murphy insisted that "the secret of Chaplin's success lies in his consummate knowledge of and feeling for tempo" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DM</span>, 62). In the first issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Criterion</span> in 1922/23, another fan, T. S. Eliot, had observed that Chaplin's "egregious" merit lay in the fact that he had "escaped in his own way from the realism of the cinema" and had thus "invented a <span style="font-style:italic;">rhythm</span>."<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>On both occasions that Charlot appears, he is juxtaposed against Katherine Murphy. <a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> And, on both occasions, it is the contrast between Charlot's jerky stop-frame choreography and bodily disintegration and the metronymic regularity and balletic elegance of Katherine's human movements that is most striking. At one level, this may be experienced as one of Léger's rhythmic plastic contrasts. At the semantic level, however, the opening contrast needs to be linked to the close-up images of Kiki's mouth, which follow Katherine on the swing and then to the juxtaposition of the swing image inverted against the reflected image of Léger and Murphy.</p>
<p>The sequence of contrasts thus runs in this order:  articulated/disarticulated male marionette re (Charlot);  integrated female human re (Katherine);  disaggregated female re (Kiki);  inverted integrated female re (Katherine);  reflected and distorted male res (Léger and Murphy). From this it may be inferred that the presentation of Katherine as female, classical, and integrated is contrasted against Kiki as female, modern, and disintegrated, and that the disintegrated/reconstituted Charlot may represent a rhythm that is masculine, modern, and urban. The framing of Katherine, before by Charlot and after by Léger/Murphy, also indicates a degree of erotic aggression that is more overt in the second appearance of the Charlot/ Katherine juxtaposition. On this occasion, it follows another of the moments in the film designed to test the limits of the spectator's exasperation: almost half a minute of rapid, split-second intercutting between a round boater and an unmistakably phallic shoe. That visual assault is then relieved by a cut to Katherine, in the garden. The rhythm slows, but then the frenetic Charlot marionette reappears and disassembles, or disintegrates, in reaction to the image of the woman and shoots off-screen left, leaving only his head to tip his hat to the audience. Here Charlot embodies (or disembodies) not just a rhythm of urban modernity, but the demonic energy of modern male sexuality. And this too was part of jazzing.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> should be taken primarily on its own terms, as the presentation of a <span style="font-style:italic;">ballet</span> that is genuinely, and ingeniously, <span style="font-style:italic;">mechanical</span>. This mechanical dance, conjured up though the machinery of cinema, takes a number of forms. The "mechanical element" takes a leading role, as the beauty of all those machine-objects is revealed when they are set in rhythmic motion. The film explores both the mechanics and the aesthetics of the human body as it moves, and the kinetics of the mechanically fragmented image. And it is also an experiment in technologically-mediated, or technologically-created, forms of choreography, both through montage and through animation.</p>
<p>The film does not appear to have been a self-conscious attempt to articulate a jazz aesthetic, in the programmatic sense that Léger wanted it to demonstrate a machine <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  aesthetic. Nevertheless, its principles of construction are informed by a chain of cultural associations that linked together, however arbitrarily, machine, modernity, rhythm, jazz, and negritude. And there is evidence that both Léger and Murphy were aware of the jazz dimension of the film, as each came up with his own solution to the non-appearance of Antheil's score. When <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> was first screened at the London Film Society on 14 March, 1926, the program notes make a revealing semi-apology: "Mr. George Antheil was engaged in the composition of music for this picture but, according to Mr. Léger, his music is not likely to be suitably ready for some time and a jazz accompaniment suggested by Mr. Léger will accordingly be played instead" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DM</span>, 61). Later that year, when Murphy presented his print of the film at the Film Arts Guild in New York, he quite independently came up with a comparable but distinctly American response: "I got a Negro drummer from Harlem, who played on drums, tin washpans and washboards, and who would watch the film as he played interpretations in his own far-out manner, to the images which excited him on screen" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DM</span>, 61). After the event, and despite their different perspectives, both Léger and Murphy at least <span style="font-style:italic;">heard Ballet mécanique</span> as a jazz film.</p>
<p>Those differences between them remain one of the pleasures of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>. The film combines an energetic impudence that rags with a new kind of neoclassical discipline that orders, without ever coming down decisively on one side or the other. "The romantic pushes to the left—an excess of subjectivity (a warm state)," observed Léger in 1923. "His opposite pushes toward the right—an excess of objectivity (a cold state)" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FP</span>, 30). If Murphy and Ray veered towards this version of the left, here Léger knew himself to be (if only in this sense) a man of the right, predisposed to objectivity above all. The experience of working on <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>, says Léger, taught him "to consider the event of objectivity as a very new contemporary value" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FP</span>, 50).</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Encore de jazz</h1>
<p>If there was a jazz aesthetic that informed works like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span> in the first half of the 1920s, it turned out to be, for the most part, a passing phenomenon. Many of the artists and intellectuals who had flirted with jazz as a rhythm and as a cultural phenomenon, which could help to convey what it felt like to live in that disconcerting, modernizing, unhappy, and exhilarating time soon turned their back on the music. Comparing Gertrude Stein's style to saxophones and the Charleston in a 1927 review, T. S. Eliot warned that, if her kind of jazz-influenced writing were the way of the future, then the future is "of the barbarians" and that "this is the future in which we ought not to be interested."<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> After that, jazz became a private pleasure for Eliot. In France, Darius Milhaud decided that jazz had done whatever good it was going to do, by way of rejuvenating war-battered Western traditions, and that it was time to sign up to the <span style="font-style:italic;">rappel à l'ordre</span>. "But already the influence of jazz has passed like a beneficial storm after which one again finds a clearer sky and more stable weather," he wrote. "Little by little the renascent classicism replaces the broken gasps of syncopation."<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> In his <span style="font-style:italic;">Negro</span> article, even if with an overly melodramatic <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  flourish, Antheil called this concerted "reaction" for what it was: "the musical world of Europe" becoming "alarmed at its racial problem." "Every time a white composer was caught consorting with Negro music," he observed, "he was promptly run off and musically lynched; after a vigorous year of campaigning Europe sat back and told itself that Negro music was no more."<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>Unaware of such recantations, or unfazed by them, Dudley Murphy returned to a maverick career in the American film industry over the next couple of decades. He wrote much of the dialogue for Tod Browning's <span style="font-style:italic;">Dracula</span> , he spent some time with William Faulkner fruitlessly exploring the possibility of adapting <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom! Absalom!</span> for the screen, he directed a few mostly undistinguished features in Hollywood and in Mexico, he made some "soundies"—early 1940s forerunners of music videos—and in the 1950s, even in retirement, he tried to persuade Cecil B. DeMille that his old prismatic lenses might solve the problem of parting the Red Sea in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ten Commandments</span> .<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> From his European experience, Murphy seems to have brought back a pleasure in jazz and a vision of cinema as a medium that could combine jazz and dance under the sign of a machine aesthetic: his visual symphonies were now more attuned to a contemporary vernacular than Californian pastoralism. Even though, post-Europe, his jazz aesthetic surfaces only from time to time, when it does it usually constitutes Murphy's best work—most notably in two jazz-based shorts he made for RKO in 1929.</p>
<p>Although famous for Bessie Smith's singing, the most memorable sequence at the heart of <span style="font-style:italic;">St. Louis Blues</span>  features Jimmy the Pimp (Jimmy Mordecai). Jimmy's louche charisma is celebrated in an astonishing dance that allows Murphy to show what he had learned from Léger and <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>. As James P. Johnson's band swings into an up-tempo number in a crowded speakeasy, and as a prelude to Jimmy's entrance, the waiters break into a dance that involves them spinning their round metal trays on their fingers. Jimmy glides smoothly around the room greeting acquaintances. As he breaks into his dance, recalling the mechanics of Kiki's face, the washerwoman endlessly repeating her climb up the steps, or Charlot's demonic energy in the earlier film, Jimmy's body becomes machine as his arms flail in circles and his legs drive like pistons around the comparatively still axis of his torso.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Black and Tan</span> , the machine ballet aesthetic turns up in the central "Cotton Club" sequence. A troupe of male dancers, the Five Hot Shots, enters in tight formation from screen left. Disavowing any individuality, these five bodies combine to create a dancing machine: a human train that offers a visual correlative to the sounds of Ellington's streamlined locomotion. This dancing-machine is first duplicated by its reflection in the mirrored floor of the club, and then, motivated as the hallucinatory point of view of the dying Fredi Washington, it is multiplied into kaleidoscope fragments by the same bevelled prisms that Murphy had used on <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet mécanique</span>. A camera-created dance is thus overlaid on to the already machine-like choreography of the dancers. This is very far from the primitivist fantasy of Josephine Baker's <span style="font-style:italic;">danse sauvage</span>, although that is evoked in the costumes of the Cotton Club dancing girls and in Fredi Washington's frenetic, fatal dance. What Murphy was responding to, and seeking <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to develop further, were the geometrical discipline and mechanical precision of the Hot Shots' Black dance: a style of jazz dancing, attuned to the camera, that articulated his sense of a machine aesthetic.</p>
<p>Murphy's film of <span style="font-style:italic;">Emperor Jones</span> , starring Paul Robeson, was supposed, yet again, to kick-start his career—this time after a scandal involving a socialite mistress being found dead in his apartment. Two inexperienced producers, John Krimsky and Gifford Cochran, had made more money than they had expected through the U.S. distribution of Leontine Sagen's <span style="font-style:italic;">Mädchen in Uniform</span>  and were looking to make an artistically adventurous feature. Murphy introduced them to Eugene O'Neill, who, desperate to pay off debts, sold the rights to the play for $30,000. The producers assembled a multitalented team that reflected Murphy's own mix of industry experience, modernist aesthetic, and 1920s Negrophilia. The sound design of the film—overseen, uncredited, by J. Rosamond Johnson, brother of the author James Weldon Johnson—is particularly interesting. Matching the film's narrative sequence of episodic tableaux, recording Brutus Jones's rise from Pullman porter to island Emperor and then his tragic fall back down into madness and death, the music moves in a quasi-anthropological circle, from the African rhythms of the opening (over the image of a circular tom-tom that fills the screen) through the Gullah music of South Carolina, to the sophistication of Harlem jazz, and back to the voodoo tom-tom of the conclusion, a beat calibrated to replicate that of the human heart. The film was predictably controversial, and although it did not lose a great deal of money, Eugene O'Neill's judgment represents the consensus view: "a compromise neither artistic nor commercial."<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> More hurtful to Murphy, had he read it, might have been the review in <span style="font-style:italic;">Close Up</span> by his fellow experimentalist Herman G. Weinberg, who accused it of lacking the cinematic rhythm that had been so central to Murphy's aesthetic:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p><span style="font-style:italic;">Hallelujah</span> [1929] was ten times better cinema than <span style="font-style:italic;">The Emperor Jones</span>. It had rhythm and swing, cadence shunted into cadence and the whole remained a unity in the mind of the director from its inception. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Emperor Jones</span> as a film has the rhythm of the drum beats but <span style="font-style:italic;">Hallelujah</span> was rhythm personified. It had what René Clair calls "inner rhythm"—it MOVES!<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Murphy was staying true to the idea of a jazz-machine aesthetic that continued as a minority discourse in debates, as often as not in Europe, about the cultural significance of jazz. One intellectual who did not recant his belief in jazz in 1927 was a professor at the Conservatoire Rameau in Paris, Albert Jeanneret. He published an article on "Le Nègre et le jazz" in <span style="font-style:italic;">La revue musicale</span>, which restated the case that jazz, far from being a music opposed to a new classical order, should be welcomed as a contribution to bringing that classicism into being. Describing the creators of good jazz as "masters of steel, mathematics, and engineering"—the exact words used by Antheil for his <span style="font-style:italic;">Negro</span> article seven years later—Jeanneret approached jazz less as a cultural phenomenon, than in formal musical terms. From this perspective, jazz signifies "the restoration of a principle of economy." "The negro brings to European music an imperative recall to <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  rhythm," writes Jeanneret. But not without being influenced in return: America has taught "the negro" mathematical structure and "the value of meter." Put African rhythm and European mathematics together, proclaims Jeanneret, and the outcome will be a more muscular and more rational modern music. "One can say then that an intellectualized way of thinking, conditioned by the methods of a productive mathematics and based on physicality and instinct will orient our musical creation towards a new sentiment of order and economy."<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>Whether it had represented a conscious strategy or an intuitive response to the times, the jazz aesthetic of the early 1920s had been one aspect of broader artistic attempts to give sensory and rhythmical expression to industrial modernization, urban life, and a more inclusive and anthropological conception of culture. Even if it turned out to have put down only shallow cultural roots in European art, jazz modernism had enduring consequences for the connotations and international appeal of black American culture and especially black American music.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>In cinema, jazz modernism lingered on fitfully, in the later American films of Dudley Murphy, and in some styles of film musical and film dance. However, Murphy's thwarted film career—he ended up running a classy restaurant and motel in Malibu designed by Richard Neutra and he bought land either wisely or luckily or both—acts as a reminder of a dimension of cinema that is often underplayed. Cinema as a medium is defined neither by photography nor by narrative, even though the mainstream industry thrives by telling and selling character-driven stories. Rather, what defines cinema is <span style="font-style:italic;">movement</span>: the organization of movement over time, and so rhythm, and so choreography. Reconsidered from this point of view, Murphy's obsession with using cinema to make objects dance—whether they be California girls, kitchen utensils, or black male bodies—may turn out to be less eccentric than it appears at first sight. For all his undeniable limitations as a filmmaker, he did at least understand that cinema is a choreography-machine. He spotted an affinity between jazz and cinema in terms of their modernism, as well as their modernity. What jazz and cinema had in common was that both were improvisatory, and both have remade the world by inventing new ways of dancing.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f43" href="#f43-text">43. </a>Jazz modernism reached its greatest heights in the classic jazz of Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and others, but that was by no means the end of the story. On the "revolution in culture" that Bebop represented for Ralph Ellison, for example, see Scott DeVeaux, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Birth of Bebop: A Social and Musical History</span> (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1997).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f44" href="#f44-text">44. </a>This formulation derives from a phrase used by Adrian Martin—"Cinema invents new ways of dancing"—which he originally attributed to Serge Daney. When I asked him about its provenance, however, Martin uncovered a more complicated process of appropriation and rewriting: "Where I (dimly) remembered it from was an essay on Abel Ferrara's <span style="font-style:italic;">King of New York</span> by Nicole Brenez and Sebastien Clerget, written in 1996. Under a still of Christopher Walken dancing, Sebastien had appended a floating quote from Serge Daney: '<span style="font-style:italic;">L'histoire invente des façons de danser</span>.' Now, in the context of their article, this seemed to mean, 'the story invents ways of dancing.' OK. Then I tracked the quote to its source: Daney's <span style="font-style:italic;">L'exercise a été profitable, monsieur</span> (Paris: P.O.L, 1993), a book of Daney's notes and diaries in his final years—and if you know your Fritz Lang pirate movies for kids, you will spot the quote in that title from <span style="font-style:italic;">Moonfleet</span>: 'The exercise has been beneficial, sir.' It's on page 131. BUT in its original context, Daney is talking about the difference between 'scenario' (a film script) and '<span style="font-style:italic;">histoire</span>,' meaning in the context something like 'lived history' (not History with a capital H, which Daney uses elsewhere in the passage to signify Grand World History.) So, in context, Daney muses that whereas, in a movie fiction, one is free to take action, in history one is subjected, prodded, almost a prisoner—and hence 'history invents ways of dancing': 'Dancing with chance, with what is unforeseeable, the amateurism of the world, of clouds, faces ...' To live, one must 'develop a talent for improvisation, like in jazz' (ibid.). To sum up: for Daney, history creates ways of dancing. For Clerget and Brenez, a story invents ways of dancing. And for yours truly, cinema invents (new) ways of dancing!" (E-mail correspondence with the author.) <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>

<div id="body">
<p>During the transition to sound in Hollywood, several articles in the film industry trade press suggested that audiences were no longer interested in "sophisticated" fare and that the new technology had occasioned the resurrection of "10–20–30 style melodrama" or "old tear-jerking hits."<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Most of the films to which the journalists referred were adaptations of well-known stage plays—<span style="font-style:italic;">Madame X, East Lynne, Common Clay</span>—that fell under the generic rubric of what present-day critics have called the maternal melodrama. This essay investigates the reception of such films across the course of the 1920s and early 1930s in order to shed light upon what was considered "old fashioned melodrama" in the period, and to explain shifts in critical attitudes toward the genre.</p>
<p>The maternal melodrama derives from several late-nineteenth century and early-twentieth-century theatrical proto-types. Although there are many narrative variants, the basic plot concerns a mother who is suspected of adultery and expelled from her home, thereby becoming separated from her children. She suffers degradation, sometimes becoming a drug addict or a prostitute. After a long period of separation, she again encounters her children who do not recognize her. In <span style="font-style:italic;">East Lynne</span>, a perennially popular stage melodrama based upon Ellen Price Wood's best-selling novel of 1861, the mother returns to her former home in disguise and takes a position under her husband's new wife, acting as nursemaid to her own children. She nurses her son during an illness and dies of grief after his death (in the 1925 film version, by Fox, the boy lives as a result of her care and only the mother dies; in the 1931 film version, also by Fox, the boy is <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  not ill and his mother goes blind before dying). In <span style="font-style:italic;">Madame X</span>, from Alexandre Brisson's play of 1908, the mother stands accused of murder and is defended by her son, now grown and a lawyer, who does not realize her connection to him.</p>
<p>The genre has been discussed by film scholars from several perspectives. Christian Viviani first coined the term "maternal melodrama" in a special issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Cahiers de la Cinémathèque</span> devoted to film melodrama as such.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> Less concerned with questions of genre, feminist scholars have interrogated the maternal melodrama's representation of motherhood, and the appeal of stories of maternal suffering and self-sacrifice for women spectators.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> While there are good reasons for using the genre to pose theoretical questions about the structure of female fantasy, this approach does not give us a good handle on the historical problem of reception. In the 1920s, these films were not primarily understood as "women's pictures." Rather, within the film industry trade press, the films were discussed in terms of long-standing oppositions between rural and urban theaters, and naïve and sophisticated taste. An awareness of these oppositions is crucial for understanding the cultural status of the maternal melodrama as well as the variation in its reception over time.</p>
<p>Take the example of William Fox's <span style="font-style:italic;">Over the Hill to the Poorhouse</span>, directed by Harry Millarde, a successful 1920 release based upon poems by Will Carleton published in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Farm Ballads</span> in 1873.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Although a print apparently survives at the Archives françaises du film du Centre National de la Cinématographie in Paris, copies are not widely available. The following summary was submitted by Fox to the Library of Congress for copyright purposes in October 1920:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Where is the mother that has ever given a thought to the sacrifices made for her children? Ma Benton slaved for hers and has seen them drift away one by one, with the exception of John, the harum-scarum, who cannot marry Isabella Strong because he cannot support her; and Charles, whose desire to become an artist has kept marriage from his mind. To his brothers and sisters, John is a standing reproach. Particularly does he irritate his oldest brother, Isaac, a pillar of the church. Only his parents and sweetheart have faith in him.</p>
<p>Horse thieves irritate the surrounding country, until the farmers decide upon concerted action to put a stop to the thefts. To John's horror, he finds his father implicated. The boy's effort to save Pa Benton results in his own capture and imprisonment. Fearful lest knowledge of his father's guilt kill Ma, John keeps silent. Although his brothers and sisters turn against the boy, Isabella's love is so strong that she promises to wait for him.</p>
<p>Knowledge of his own guilt eventually kills Pa Benton. Charles marries and moves to New York. One by one, Ma tries to make her home with her children, only to find that she is in the way. John, released from prison, has gone West. Success comes his way, but because of his former disgrace he allows his mother and the rest of the family, with the exception of Isaac, to think him dead.</p>
<p>Failing of success in New York, Charles returns to the old home with his wife, Lucy, a selfish, designing woman. Unable to live with Isaac, Ma goes back to the house in which she reared her children—only to be turned out eventually and sent to the poor-house by her first-born.</p>
<p>Isabella discovers that John is alive and wires him a plea to come home. The boy does so, and learns of his mother's whereabouts. His fury knowing no bounds, he breaks in <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  upon Isaac, whom he thrashes. His next step is to send Charles and Lucy packing and then hasten to the poor-house, where he finds Ma failing fast. Back the two go to the old farmhouse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The review in <span style="font-style:italic;">Wid's Daily</span> (26 September 1920, 4) indicates that Isaac's villainy is exacerbated by the fact that he appropriates money John has sent him for his mother's support before sending her to the poorhouse. The reviewer for <span style="font-style:italic;">Moving Picture World</span> commended the director for the "psychological thrill accomplished when John Benton starts dragging his brother to the poorhouse to apologize to their mother, which starts the spectators into outbursts of applause" (2 October 1920, 623). Trade press reviews also indicate that the film actually began with a largely comic prologue set twenty years before the main action in which child actors took on the roles of the Benton clan later played by adults.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> This permitted Mary Carr, in the role of Ma Benton, a theatrical <span style="font-style:italic;">tour de force</span>, since she played both the young and still vigorous woman of the film's opening and, later, the frail and aging mother. All the reviewers praised Carr's performance. <span style="font-style:italic;">Motion Picture News</span> wrote: "Her role is a crystallization of the ideals of mother-love, mother-devotion, and mother-understanding, and her acting, especially in the second act, is the most beautiful, the most exquisite, and the most touching feature of the production" (2 October 1920, 2703). <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibitor's Trade Review</span> was similarly impressed: "Mary Carr does honor to <span style="font-style:italic;">your</span> mother, and to <span style="font-style:italic;">mine</span>, and to the others, everywhere" (2 October 1920, 1919). So great was Carr's success that she was typecast: although middle-aged she played mother and grandmother roles, often in small parts, throughout the 1920s and early 1930s.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> reported that the film initially did scanty business at the Astor in mid September, but business built on Broadway due to word-of-mouth (24 September 1920, 40).<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">Motion Picture News</span> reported that Fox kept the film on Broadway, moving it from the Astor to the Nora Bayes Theatre, then to the Central Theatre and finally to the Lyric, all prior to a general release planned for 1922 (20 November 1920, 3924). In a later review for a comparable mother-love story, with the same star, <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> described Fox's distribution strategy for <span style="font-style:italic;">Over the Hill</span> as "a forced Broadway showing" (review of <span style="font-style:italic;">Drusilla with a Million</span>, 27 May 1925, 40), a process of keeping a film in the major Broadway theaters, and allowing demand to build on the assumption that urban audiences would eventually flock to it. What I have been able to discover about the distribution of <span style="font-style:italic;">Over the Hill</span> suggests that it did, in fact, follow this pattern although the film seems to have gone into general release earlier than planned. Advertisements for the film appearing in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> from 3 October 1920 through 19 November 1920 trace its movement from the Astor at Broadway and 45<sup>th</sup> Street to the Lyric on 42nd Street. The film reappeared briefly in February 1921 at the Broadhurst on 44<sup>th</sup> Street, and then played throughout May and June of that year at the Park on Broadway and 57<sup>th</sup> . Newspaper advertising indicates that the film was playing in smaller cities and towns by the end of 1921: for example, in Fort Wayne, Indiana and Anaconda, Michigan in September; Des Moines, Iowa in November, and Janesville, Wisconsin in December.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">Moving Picture World</span>'s weekly "Straight from the Shoulder Reports" <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  columns also indicate that <span style="font-style:italic;">Over the Hill</span> was appearing in neighborhood theaters in California and Massachusetts beginning in October 1921, although the film played at what the small-town exhibitors considered an inflated price of $1.00.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>While most of the trade press commentary on <span style="font-style:italic;">Over the Hill</span> lauds it as what <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> called a "hymn to mother love," there are several hints that even as early as 1920 this kind of plot was considered old fashioned and a tough sell in urban venues. According to <span style="font-style:italic;">Moving Picture World</span> the Will Carlton poems on which the film was based were best known to "the older generation." The reviewer went on to note: "And here a word must be said for Paul H. Sloane, who wrote the scenario. One has only to go back to the original poems of Will Carleton, couched in their sentimental, bucolic phrases, to understand that a scenario writer may not only be a 'brick layer' as he builds up these situations, but an imaginative architect as well." A similar evaluation of the source material was made by <span style="font-style:italic;">Motion Picture News</span>: "To Will Carleton's poem, a slighter doff—for in other hands it might have been made into a hash of exaggerated characterizations and strained drama." <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> thought the film itself was too long, and was worried about the lack of a love interest. <span style="font-style:italic;">Wid's Daily</span> praised the film wildly, but noted that the "sob stuff" was laid on a bit thick at times. The reviewer concluded "everyone is going to enjoy this picture except the snobs and you don't have to bother about them." The <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span>, apparently the newspaper of record for snobs, was much less enthusiastic: "Seldom has a motion picture been so deliberately sentimental as this one. Its assault upon the emotions is undisguised and sweeping. It is ruthless in its mass attack. Its capacity for tear-water and gallery cheers is unlimited . . . . Without subtlety, without restraint, it pours out its appeal—its towering demand—for the laughs and the smiles and the sobs of the susceptible spectators—of whom, as its makers know, there are many—and many more" (20 September 1920, 21). In a more ironic vein Robert Sherwood, writing in the pages of the New York humor magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Life</span>, called <span style="font-style:italic;">Over the Hill</span> "the sort of rural sob drama that warms the cockles of your heart, provided you have such outlandish features."<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Over the Hill</span> helps us to define the market niche usually accorded the maternal melodrama in the late silent period. The trade papers predicted it would be popular and make money, and its pattern of distribution suggests that they were correct in this judgment. At the same time, the trade journals gently suggested that the film was best suited to theaters outside of the biggest metropolitan centers. The negative responses of film critics writing for journals which addressed the urban intelligentsia, that is, the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Life</span>, bear out this judgment.</p>
<p>Across the course of the 1920s, critical judgments about the maternal melodrama bear a strong resemblance to those made about <span style="font-style:italic;">Over the Hill</span>. Thus, while generally optimistic about the commercial prospects of Fox's 1925 remake of <span style="font-style:italic;">East Lynne, Moving Picture World</span> nonetheless cautioned that the film probably would not appeal "to the sophisticated or the super-flapper" (7 November 1925, 58). By the middle of the 1920s, <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> became much less enthusiastic about such films than the other major trade papers such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibitors Trade Review, Moving Picture World, Motion Picture News</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Film Daily</span>. This disparity may be explained by the distinct audiences addressed <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  by the trade press. <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> was oriented to the metropolitan theaters of the major producer/distributors, and particularly sought to anticipate a film's success or failure on Broadway. In contrast, the other trade papers were directed to a wide range of theater owners in the smaller cities and towns.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Many <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> reviews clearly position maternal melodramas as modestly priced fare for those theaters outside the circuits of big downtown theaters owned by the major studios, that is, theaters at the lower end of the distribution hierarchy. <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> writes of the Universal release <span style="font-style:italic;">The Goose Woman</span>: "Universal in this picture has a release capable of playing any regular program house in the country. It can certainly stand up for a week in the major theatres, and they'll like it where the box office isn't so heavy" (5 August 1925, 31). In <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> parlance "regular program house" meant a subsequent-run as opposed to a first-run theater: the implication is that the film will last for a week in a large metropolitan venue and do its best business outside such venues. Similarly, <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span>'s review of <span style="font-style:italic;">Dearie</span> characterizes it as: "One of those typically formula prepared mother-love stories that the Warner Brothers must provide for Irene Rich . . . . Not an expensive production, but a most satisfactory one for the program houses, as the exhibitor will never be hi-jacked for the rentals . . . . Will not break house records, but should always keep the exhibitor out of the red" (6 July 1927, 20).</p>
<p>Maternal melodramas produced at higher budget levels and with the biggest stars were more positively assessed, but only slightly. Writing of Frank Borzage's brilliant <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lady</span>, starring Norma Talmadge, whose acting was highly respected in the period, <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> commented:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>B. S. Moss bought the picture up for its first-run New York rights, and is said to have guaranteed $25,000 for the privilege. From its start Sunday afternoon it looks as if he'll get out nicely . . . . The production is elaborate and well handled, while Miss Talmadge does wonders with the title role . . . . From the exhibitor's angle there is this much—the picture itself is okay, and with the Talmadge draw 'The Lady' is safe.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span>, 28 January 1925, 32)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">While this review anticipates <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lady</span> will have a decent Broadway run, it is far from the tone <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> adopted for the most successful hits; the reviewer judges that exhibitors will get away with this version of the plot given its production values and the actress involved. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> reviewer's reservations were echoed by the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span>: Mourdant Hall wrote his review from the perspective of "two grey-haired old ladies" who liked the film, as if he could not admit liking it himself (27 January 1925, 11).</p>
<p>It should be noted that mother-love stories were seconded by father-love stories, although they were by no means numerous in the 1920s, and, with the possible exceptions of King Vidor's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Jack Knife Man</span>  and Frank Borzage's <span style="font-style:italic;">Lazybones</span> , are now extremely obscure. This plot variant experienced a vogue just at the end of the silent period with releases from three major studios in 1927: Fox's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Music Master</span>, First National's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Prince of Headwaiters</span>, and United Artist's <span style="font-style:italic;">Sorrell and Son</span>. Like the mother-love stories on which they were modeled, father-love stories often had some sort of theatrical pedigree or were chosen as a vehicle for a respected actor. David <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Belasco's original 1904 production of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Music Master</span> ran for two years on Broadway with David Warfield in the title role and it was revived with the same star in 1916.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> His identification with the part was so complete that the credits for the film version in <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> described actor Alec B. Francis as starring "in the Warfield role" (19 January 1927, 18). While <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> respected the theatrical origins of the piece, and praised Alan Dwan's direction, it nonetheless cautioned that the story was "old fashioned, out of line with the screen mood of this year of grace" and concluded: "the chances are against it inspiring the younger fans educated to a taste for more highly seasoned screen fare." <span style="font-style:italic;">Sorrell and Son</span>, from a novel by George Warwick Deeping, starred the accomplished Broadway actor H. B. Warner. <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> praised the film highly, and indeed, it won Herbert Brenon the first Academy Award for direction, but the reviewer thought the film might lack appeal in the "10 and 20 cent," that is, smaller, exhibition venues:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>It may be a cinch to pull the mother love thing for box office angles, but the love of a father and a son may be intensified many times, although a precarious proposition in constant danger of suffering in screen treatment. While the movie mob is always willing to accept and ready to understand the heartaches of a mother, they don't fall so hard when it's the old man who is suffering.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span>, 16 November 1927, 21)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The critics' association of the maternal melodrama with popular, and rather conservative, taste altered for a group of films released in 1924 and 1925 which provided self-consciously up-dated or modernized variants. Ernst Lubitsch's <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Women</span>, released in August 1924, concerns a wealthy widow, Mabel Wilton (Pauline Frederick), who uses all the cosmetic arts at her command to remain attractive. She initiates a liaison with a roué, George Lamont (Lew Cody), who is hoping to use her money to pay his debts. Mabel discourages her eighteen-year-old daughter Jeanne (May McAvoy) from leaving college to visit her the better to disguise her age. When Jeanne returns home nonetheless, her mother expresses displeasure and neglects her to pursue her amorous adventure. Lamont initiates a flirtation with the lonely girl, becoming especially interested after one of his creditors discloses that half of Mabel's fortune is held in trust for her daughter. One night, Jeanne goes to Lamont's rooms and, when Mabel finds them there together, he implies that he has seduced her, more or less forcing the mother to permit their marriage. This alliance comes as a blow to Jeanne's shy college boyfriend who had been too slow with his own proposal: he is comforted by his sweet, white-haired old mother (played, predictably, by Mary Carr). Once married, Lamont renews a relationship with an old flame (Marie Prevost) and provokes a scandal at a notorious night club. In despair, Jeanne flees to her mother. The next day, Mabel demands that Lamont give her daughter a divorce but he refuses, blackmailing her with the threat of publishing her old love letters to him, and suggesting that they resume their former sexual relations. In fury and panic, she shoots and kills him, thereby freeing her daughter but also making her former relationship apparent to Jeanne. At her trial, she tells the jury: "I do not regret the act I committed. My only remorse is at having been shown to be a negligent and frivolous mother." She is acquitted, and her daughter forgives her and prepares to marry the boyfriend. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The moralized ending of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Women</span>, as well as the structural opposition between Jeanne's "bad" mother and her boyfriend's "good" mother, may make it seem quite conservative to present-day viewers, but, in the 1920s, the fact that Mabel was not a passive and idealized re of virtue, that she was stylish, sexually aggressive, and inadvertently in competition with her own daughter led critics to view the film as both daring and distinctive. It was dubbed a "modern domestic drama" by <span style="font-style:italic;">Moving Picture World</span> which proposed that Lubitsch handled this drama in much the same way as his earlier film <span style="font-style:italic;">The Marriage Circle</span>, a "clever and sophisticated domestic comedy with a continental flavor" (27 September 1924, 334).<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> The reviewer continued: "Obviously this is not a Sunday school story and it may mildly shock the unsophisticated, but it is a production that should register heavily with a large majority of spectators." <span style="font-style:italic;">Motion Picture News</span> noted that: "It has a story that is distinctly modern, possessing that much desired element—pep" (23 August 1923, 1044). <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> was also enthusiastic about the direction, and described the story as "decidedly European" even though set in New York (8 October 1924, 27). A British trade paper, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bioscope</span> compared the film to von Stroheim's <span style="font-style:italic;">Foolish Wives</span> and cautioned: "Obviously it is a film for adult audiences only—and not for all adult audiences" (11 September 1924, 40). Interestingly, many of the American trade papers, including <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety, Film Daily</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Motion Picture News</span>, predicted that the film would be particularly successful with women due to its racy subject matter and, no doubt, its emphasis on fashion.</p>
<p>The only elements of the film which drew criticism from the press were the shooting of the villain and the mother's trial, those elements which bore the closest resemblance to older prototypes of the plot, particularly <span style="font-style:italic;">Madame X</span>, in which the heroine shoots the villain when he threatens to blackmail her former husband and bring scandal to her family. In its review of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Women, Film Daily</span> complained that "when the outraged mother shoots Cody thus paving the way for her daughter's marriage to a real man it's just regulation movie stuff and doesn't ring true" (19 October 1924, 4). The <span style="font-style:italic;">Bioscope</span> complained: "The only serious fault of the picture lies in the incident of the shooting, a quite unnecessary touch which tends to conventionalise into mere melodrama an otherwise flawlessly human and credible narrative." Robert Sherwood praised the film but found fault with the ending:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>"'Three Women' lacks the fragile grace of 'The Marriage Circle' and makes a few more concessions to Hollywood tradition; but even the most obvious movie tricks, like the discovery by the embattled heroine of a revolver in the villain's desk drawer, are accomplished so skilfully that they actually look new."</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">Life</span>, 30 October 1924, 26)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The review in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> was succinctly headlined: "Mr. Lubitsch's Direction Outshines His Narrative" (12 October 1924, X5).</p>
<p>Several other films produced in the middle 1920s emulated Lubitsch's lead. <span style="font-style:italic;">Smouldering Fires</span>, released in January 1925, about six months after <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Women</span>, also starred Pauline Frederick as a forty-year-old career woman who falls for and marries a much younger man. The difficulties of adjusting her life to his are complicated by <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the relationship he develops with her much younger sister. Eventually she steps aside and sacrifices her own happiness for theirs. <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> thought the film bore more than a coincidental resemblance to <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Women</span>, but found it "a step forward as far as the average run of Universal productions go," singling out Clarence Brown's direction and remarkable cinematography (1 April 1925, 38). <span style="font-style:italic;">Dancing Mothers</span>, Paramount's adaptation of the 1924 play by Edgar Selwyn and Edmund Goulding, was, as <span style="font-style:italic;">Film Daily</span> noted, "another slant on the modern girl" (28 February 1926, 185). Ethel Westcourt (Alice Joyce) spends her evenings alone, abandoned by both her husband, who is having an affair with another woman, and her flapper daughter Kittens (Clara Bow). <span style="font-style:italic;">Film Daily</span> commented: "There is the usual round of night clubs of unique design and a liberal display of jazz atmosphere while Dad and daughter make merry . . . ." When Kittens pursues Jerry Naughton, Ethel decides to court him herself in order to protect her daughter. The situation when the mother shows up at Naughton's rooms at the same time as her daughter is not, as <span style="font-style:italic;">Film Daily</span> noted, "entirely new," dating back at least to Oscar Wilde's play <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Windermere's Fan</span>, and occurring in many subsequent films, including <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Women. Dancing Mothers</span> alters the fundamental situation somewhat in that Ethel falls in love with Naughton. In the mode of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Doll's House</span>, the film does not provide a definitive conclusion. Ethel plans to sail for Europe, but she regretfully rejects Jerry who has bought passage on the same boat. When she returns home to pack, her husband and daughter beg her to remain but, repelled by the lack of any apology and their continued selfishness, she leaves the house, presumably to catch the boat. <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> noted that the studio was uncertain about the final scene and was proposing an alternative "happy" ending in which the family was reconciled. The reviewer judged the alternate ending preferable for "the regular audience outside the bigger towns" (17 February 1926, 40). This suggests the film as originally released was considered metropolitan fare although it should be noted that Robert Sherwood dismissed <span style="font-style:italic;">Dancing Mothers</span> in <span style="font-style:italic;">Life</span> as conservative and trite, "the usual tirade against the jazz-mad younger generation" (11 March 1926, 26).</p>
<p>The trend in maternal melodramas in which the mother re was represented as stylish and sexually available was countered by perhaps the most successful version of the story in the late silent period, Henry King's adaptation of Olive Higgins Prouty's <span style="font-style:italic;">Stella Dallas</span>, released in November 1925. This plot variant is more familiar than many of the films cited thanks to King Vidor's well-known remake, released in 1937 and starring Barbara Stanwyck. The story concerns a working-class woman (Belle Bennett) who is irredeemably vulgar. Her dress and behavior drive away her upper-class husband, but he leaves behind a young daughter, Laurel, who has inherited his taste and manners. As Laurel grows up, her social prospects at school are jeopardized by her mother's character, as is, finally, her courtship with a young man of good family. When Stella finally comes to realize that her presence is harming her daughter, she grants her husband a divorce, enabling him to marry a woman of his own class, and drives Laurel to live with her father by suggesting she will marry an old acquaintance, a drunken riding instructor whose manner has offended both Laurel and her father. At the end <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of the film, famously, she stands alone, gazing in on the scene of Laurel's wedding, her daughter unaware of her presence and of the sacrifice she has made.</p>
<p>In contrast with films like <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Women</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">Dancing Mothers, Stella Dallas</span> was not explicitly labeled a "modern" story and the film was judged likely to play well outside of the big cities. <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> mentioned that the film was "clean" (18 November 1925, 42) and <span style="font-style:italic;">Film Daily</span> that it was "fine for any type of house," a signal to exhibitors that it was not likely to offend small town audiences (22 November 1925, 5). Yet, it was to my knowledge the only silent maternal melodrama in the late 1920s that was released as a "road show," that is, shown at special prices in the biggest metropolitan theaters before going into general release. <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> commented on the distribution pattern as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>It is understood the picture will release through United Artists and that Goldwyn brought it into the Apollo for the purpose of giving it a whoop sendoff, maybe also ring on roadshowing it. The idea of a special New York display bears out the reasoning upon viewing, for the picture should draw corking notices and the word-of-mouth billing it will get should be plentiful and sufficient to keep it in at the special price scale for at least a moderate run. As a road show "Stella Dallas" looks to have more than a good chance if the price is right, at about $1.50 top.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">While $1.50 was not the highest price for a special (for example, <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> judged <span style="font-style:italic;">The Big Parade</span>, released in the same season, would bear a price of $2.00, the top price I have seen quoted for the 1920s), this is nonetheless evidence that the film was considered a major hit.</p>
<p>It is difficult to enumerate the qualities which lifted <span style="font-style:italic;">Stella Dallas</span> into the road show category. <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span>'s assessment of the film was mixed. The reviewer praised the film's "sentimental wallops" and commented that it was not excessively pathetic: "Henry King has told his story simply and directly without dramatics, gauging the extent to which he can play upon such an emotional subject." Nonetheless, the reviewer qualified his praise: "A mother picture. Not a great picture, but a great mother picture." And, much like Mordaunt Hall's review of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lady</span>, which posited grey-haired lady spectators enjoying the film, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> reviewer posited a largely feminine appeal for the film, as if to distance himself from it: " 'Stella Dallas' is 'a woman's picture.' Women will love it. Men will respect it if nothing else . . . ." The film was also damned for all audiences in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New Yorker</span>, which was rapidly becoming one of the bastions of sophisticated taste:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>"Stella Dallas", having been washed into the Apollo on the crest of a million dollar wave of ballyhooing, we went fully expecting to see what we would see and found that it came out exactly as we expected. We were drenched in salty niagaras of tears, tears, tears . . . . It is a Magnificent, Searching, Intense, Brilliant, Wonderful, Human, Mighty Peep into the Heart of Motherhood. (<span style="font-style:italic;">New Yorker</span>, 28 November 1925, 26) <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">However, two reviews in the New York press suggested, <span style="font-style:italic;">pace</span> the <span style="font-style:italic;">New Yorker</span>, that the film differed from the usual mother-love story. Robert Sherwood compared the film favorably to <span style="font-style:italic;">Over the Hill</span> and Frank Borzage's 1920 film <span style="font-style:italic;">Humoresque</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>The mother of "Stella Dallas," however, can not by any stretch of the imagination be confused with the grey-wigged, bespectacled, simpering, holier-than-thou old pest who represents the conventional mother on the screen. Stella Dallas is a coarse, gross woman, painfully devoid of the most ordinary social graces, gaudy but not neat—a ridiculous person and an inexpressibly pitiful one.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">Life</span>, 10 December 1925, 24)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The qualities that Sherwood praised were also singled out for criticism by Mordaunt Hall in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> who felt there was "unnecessary emphasis on the coarse rôles" (17 November 1925, 30). Although they evaluated the emphasis on Stella's vulgarity differently, both critics seemed to feel that the representation of the mother as a coarse, almost grotesque, character, was unusual.</p>
<p>The originality of <span style="font-style:italic;">Stella Dallas</span> can be measured not only against previous mother-love films, but also against what might be called the "anti-mother plot" which, while not prominent in the cinema in the 1920s, had begun to appear in the most advanced theatrical venues. For example, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mama's Affair</span>, a comedy by Rachel Barton Butler produced by Oliver Morosco at the Little Theater in January 1920, a manipulative mother controls her daughter Eve by feigning hysterics whenever the girl shows the least sign of independence. When Eve is about to be wedded to the son of her mother's best friend—the mothers are planning to spend their lives looking after both their "children"—she has a genuine fit of hysterics. The doctor who takes charge of her case removes her from her mother's care. After her "cure" Eve is not only able to call off the marriage and face down her mother, but to pursue the doctor to whom she eventually proposes. Writing in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span>, Alexander Woollcott proposed: "'Mamma's Affair' suggests how many interesting new patterns for plays may be found as by-products of the Freudian researches in the subconscious" (25 January 1920, 74). Sidney Howard's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Silver Cord</span>, a drama produced at the Theater Guild in December 1926, went even further, suggesting that the manipulative mother's supposed love for her sons was a perverse replacement for a normal sexual relationship. While both these plays were adapted as films, <span style="font-style:italic;">Mama's Affair</span> by Victor Fleming in 1921, and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Silver Cord</span> by John Cromwell in 1933, they were by no means a dominant trend, and it was well into the 1940s before Hollywood produced dramas such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Now, Voyager</span>  or <span style="font-style:italic;">Mildred Pierce</span>  in which the mother/child relationship could be explicitly represented as destructive or obsessive.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Yet it seems to me that hints of this possibility undergird <span style="font-style:italic;">Stella Dallas</span>. Molly Haskell has suggested that part of the pleasure of <span style="font-style:italic;">Stella Dallas</span> lies in the representation of a veiled hostility to children (Stella gets rid of Laurel by giving her daughter up for her own good).<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> But it could equally be interpreted as representing a veiled hostility to the maternal re, in its creation of a mother who is socially impossible and embarrassing for her child. And this interpretation is given some weight within the context of film's reception in the 1920s: as Robert Sherwood noted with approval, and as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> critic noted with some dismay, Belle Bennet's <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  performance as Stella Dallas violated accepted ideas of decorum and of taste—Stella is a far cry from the sweet, diminutive mother <span style="font-style:italic;">à la</span> Mary Carr.</p>
<p>Of course, as the reviews in <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Film Daily</span> indicate, most critics and, presumably, audience members, considered <span style="font-style:italic;">Stella Dallas</span> simply a mother picture of the familiar sort, albeit of a quality that merited it being roadshowed in the best theaters in the biggest cities. But an examination of the history of the genre in the 1920s leads me to suggest that the film's inherent "quality" lay in its departure from more old-fashioned plot prototypes, and in this sense the film can arguably be compared to other modernized variants such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Women</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Dancing Mothers</span>. One other indication of the importance and originality of <span style="font-style:italic;">Stella Dallas</span> is its influence on other maternal, and paternal, melodramas, an influence that becomes most marked in the early sound period. For example, in Rouben Mamoulian's <span style="font-style:italic;">Applause</span> , from the novel by Beth Brown, Helen Morgan plays Kitty, an aging burlesque singer who is irrationally attached to her seedy dancing partner, a man who exploits her for money and tries to seduce her innocent daughter behind her back. Although Kitty finally sacrifices herself for her daughter's good, the film is much more concerned with her relationship to her deceitful lover, and her daughter's suffering at this man's hands. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Min and Bill</span> , Marie Dressler gives a brilliant performance, at once grotesque and funny, as a hard-boiled proprietress of a waterfront hotel who makes a series of escalating sacrifices on behalf of a child who was abandoned and left to her care many years before. In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Champ</span> , King Vidor essayed a paternal melodrama in the same vein with Wallace Beery, Dressler's co-star in <span style="font-style:italic;">Min and Bill</span>, in an Academy Award winning role as a former boxing champion whose predilection for drinking and gambling make him dependent upon his adoring young son.</p>
<p>Yet despite the presence of relatively more modern variants of the maternal and paternal melodrama in the early 1930s, it is clear that, as already noted, the transition to sound motivated the resurgence of what critics considered old-fashioned variants of the plot. Several factors contributed to the resurgence of such films between 1928 and 1932. In general, the studios preferred to adapt well-known theatrical properties which could showcase the cinema's new-found capacity to render synch-sound dialogue. Trial scenes were particularly favored: the <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> review of <span style="font-style:italic;">Madame X</span> noted that "at present the talking screen is flooded with two kinds of full lengths; the trial picture for the drama and [the] back stage or Broadway for the musicals" and because of its courtroom finale it dubbed <span style="font-style:italic;">Madame X</span> "a great drama for the screamer" (1 May 1929, 17). In addition, the maternal melodrama provided bankable theatrical vehicles for the actresses moving to Hollywood from the legitimate stage. MGM's version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Madame X</span> in 1929, with stage actress Ruth Chatterton, was followed by Fox's version of <span style="font-style:italic;">East Lynne</span> in 1931, with stage actress Ann Harding. In a recycling of film history comparable to the recycling of theater history, Fox also released a sound version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Over the Hill</span> in 1931 starring Mae Marsh. Conditions created by the transition to sound thus favored the reworking of the maternal melodrama's history in theater and silent film. These and similar films were made at the highest budget ranges and often showcased in the studios' most prestigious theaters on Broadway. <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> indicated that <span style="font-style:italic;">Madame</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">X</span> opened in New York as a $2 special. Both <span style="font-style:italic;">East Lynne</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Over the Hill</span> opened at Fox's flagship theater, the Roxy, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> judged that the former was "assuredly for the big houses" (25 February 1931, 12). Both <span style="font-style:italic;">Madame X</span> and Dorothy Arzner's <span style="font-style:italic;">Sarah and Son</span>, a mother-love story released in 1930, were targeted for production in the multiple language versions that the studios prepared in the years before dubbing became the accepted way of preparing films for international release.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Thus, despite the fact that the films were widely perceived as excessively sentimental, they red much more prominently in the cinema of the transitional era than they did in the late silent period.</p>
<p>Another factor also contributed to the renewed attention to old-fashioned mother-love stories during the transition to sound: the studios' interest in popular song, particularly what were called "mother songs."<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Mother songs seem to have been most prevalent in the period prior to the First World War, but they remained a staple of the 1920s repertoire. A 1927 songwriting manual notes: "The most popular of popular songs is naturally the HOME and MOTHER theme, always a sure-fire idea and universally appealing."<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> A 1928 manual entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Song Requirements of Talking Pictures</span> feels compelled to defend the genre:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The mother song will always occupy a distinguished place in American popular music. The longer we live, the more we think of our mothers . . . . There are certain types of songwriters who have been so long away from home, so long away from mother and living in an unwholesome environment, that they have become callous and insusceptible to the influences we have indicated. They will tell you that there is no demand for mother songs, because they have found no response to their own emotionless and hypocritical phrases, and insincere efforts. Songs like "Mother Machree," "Dear Little Mother of Mine," "My Mother's Rosary" and "Pal of My Cradle Days" will always find a public ready to welcome their sentiments.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">As noted above, mother songs were often tied to a nostalgic evocation of home. Mammy songs were associated with the American South, and frequently sung in dialect by vaudeville blackface performers. Irish mother songs, such as "Ireland Must Be Heaven, for My Mother Came From There" (Joe McCarthy, Howard Johnson, and Fred Fischer), also made use of dialect to some degree and were commonly performed by the Irish tenors who were a feature of the vaudeville stage. In addition, many mother songs of the late teens treated the separation of mothers and sons instigated by the First World War.</p>
<p>Of course, Al Jolson was most frequently identified with Mammy songs. In 1927, <span style="font-style:italic;">Motion Picture News</span> dubbed him "the big blackface and mammy man" (21 October 1927, 1266). In his 1926 Vitaphone short <span style="font-style:italic;">A Plantation Act</span>, Jolson sings "Rock-a-bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody" (Sam Lewis, Joe Young, and Jean Schwartz) a hit often identified with him.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> He defends mother songs before launching into the performance:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>And now ladies and gentlemen, I am going to sing you a song that as a rule the folks love to hear me sing. It's a little Mammy song. And a very funny thing. People have been making <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  fun of Mammy songs and I don't really think it's right that they should. For, after all, Mammy songs are the fundamental songs of our country. And not only that, you take John McCormack. John McCormack, the famous radio singer. He sings "Mother Machree." And that's a Mammy song. And folks, he ain't bad. So, if you don't mind, I'm going to sing you my little Mammy song, "Rock-a-Bye your Rock-a-Bye Baby with a Dixie Melody."</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Jolson's spoken defense of Mammy songs is echoed in the lyrics of the song itself, which is somewhat atypical in that it not only evokes a longing for the singer's Southern home and mother, but a nostalgia for a certain kind of music:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>"Weep no more my lady," sing that song again for me;<br>And "Old Black Joe," just as though you had me on your knee;<br>A million baby kisses I'll deliver,<br>The minute that you sing Swanee River.<br>Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby with a Dixie melody.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Thus, both the song lyrics and Jolson's spoken introduction to this number reflect on the mother song as a genre, which is perceived to be old fashioned and, indeed, celebrated as such.</p>
<p>It seems to me that Jolson's appeal as a performer and his identification with the Mammy song were important factors in the resurgence of the maternal melodrama on film, especially in the first two seasons of sound feature film production. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Jazz Singer</span>, adapted from Samson Raphaelson's 1922 short story "The Day of Atonement" (and subsequently a play by the same author), was widely perceived to be modeled on Jolson's life story. When Raphaelson's play opened at the Fulton theater in September of 1925 with George Jessel in the role of Jack Robin, the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> noted that the character was Jolson-like, and that the play was rumored to be based upon Jolson's own life (15 September 1925, 29). Following the release of the film, <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> repeated the rumor: "Jessel is still out in the play and doing big business. When the show first opened on Broadway last year talk was that the story was based on Jolson, so now with Jolson actually doing it the psychology is perfect" (12 October 1927, 16). This identification between actor and character powerfully motivated the use of the two mother songs: "Mother of Mine, I Still Have You" (Al Jolson, Louis Silvers, and Grant Clarke), and Jolson's signature tune, "Mammy" (Sam Lewis, Joe Young, and Walter Davidson). And most commentators discussed the songs in terms of Jolson's performance and persona. Yet it should be noted that these songs are also narratively motivated by what is effectively a maternal melodrama. Jack may sing the "Kol Nidre" for his dying father, but the Broadway showtunes that make him a star are explicitly addressed to his mother: first, Irving Berlin's "Blue Skies" sung on the occasion of the reunion of mother and son, and, later, the Mammy songs performed publicly but with Mama Rabinowitz in attendance. In many ways the plot of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Jazz Singer</span> resembles Frank Borzage's <span style="font-style:italic;">Humoresque</span>, derived from Fanny Hurst's short story of 1919. The hero of <span style="font-style:italic;">Humoresque</span> is a violinist not a singer, but the two stories share the setting in a Jewish immigrant household, the emphasis on the "Kol Nidre" as an expression of Jewish identity, and, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  most importantly, the mother's unquestioning support of the hero's musical endeavors in contrast to her husband's lack of sympathy for his boy's aspirations.</p>
<p>Given the interest in the Vitaphone technology and in Jolson himself, there was understandably little discussion of the plot of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Jazz Singer</span> in the trade press at the time of the film's release, but some reservations were expressed. <span style="font-style:italic;">Motion Picture News</span> praised the "sentimental and heart interest touches" but complained that the film "is made too sobby" (21 October 1927, 1266). <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> concluded: "Jolson in 'The Jazz Singer' is surefire for Broadway. With his songs that holds good for any town or street. Exclude Vitaphone and there crops up the problem that it amounts to a Jewish mother-son religious story . . . ." Thus, the mother songs helped to "put over" the plot, in the sense that the reviewers liked the songs, if not the sobby story that motivated them. But, most importantly, and in contrast to most silent maternal melodramas which were generally thought to be best suited for neighborhood theaters and rural districts, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Jazz Singer</span>, at least in its "Vitaphoned" version, was by definition a film for Broadway and other metropolitan centers, since these were the first theaters to be wired for sound.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> That is, the use of sound brought this "Jewish mother-son" story to the forefront of the distribution hierarchy.</p>
<p>If the Warners were banking on Mammy songs, Fox went for Irish ballads. The release of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Jazz Singer</span> in October 1927 was almost immediately followed by the premiere of Fox's <span style="font-style:italic;">Mother Machree</span> directed by John Ford and based on the 1910 song by Rida Johnson Young, Ernest R. Ball, and Irish tenor Chauncey Olcott. The song was originally written for a musical entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Barry of Ballymore</span> featuring Olcott (<span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span>, 26 February 1928, 110). According to Tag Gallagher, Ford's film went into production in September 1926; the studio was apparently planning to release it as a silent film marketed along with sheet music and discs of the title song (this had been done for other silent films with prominent theme songs such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Mickey</span>).<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Its release was delayed, presumably to allow for the addition of the score. It premiered in January 1928, a few months after <span style="font-style:italic;">The Jazz Singer</span>, and went into regular exhibition at the Globe theater in March on a program with Movietone shorts. The film was based on a short story written by the lyricist, Rida Johnson Young. An Irish widow emigrates to America and, in order better to provide for her only son, gives him up for adoption. Years later, she is working as a servant in the home of a wealthy family when her son, now grown, becomes romantically involved with the daughter of the household. The reunion of mother and son is preceded by a synch-sound performance of the title song, which is supposedly sung by Neil Hamilton, the actor playing the son.</p>
<p>Although the emphasis on Irish songs and on mothers in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mother Machree</span> fits into John Ford's larger oeuvre, the film also clearly derives from more general patterns of song adaptation in 1927–1928. It was apparently not as big a hit as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Jazz Singer. Variety</span> noted that the film was not a $2 special, adding: "If it stays any length of time [on Broadway] it'll take some forcing, but there's not much question on its capabilities as program material" (7 March 1928, 23). Nonetheless, both <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> (11 March 1928, 113) had praise for the score. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The release of <span style="font-style:italic;">Mother Machree</span> was followed in February by the release of another maternal melodrama from the same director, <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Sons</span>. The theme song in this case, "Little Mother," was written by Erno Rapee and Lew Pollack, the song-writing team that had already produced two hit songs for Fox, "Charmaine" (in <span style="font-style:italic;">What Price Glory</span>) and "Diane" (in <span style="font-style:italic;">7</span><sup>th</sup><span style="font-style:italic;">Heaven</span>). Apparently thought to be a bigger film than <span style="font-style:italic;">Mother Machree, Four Sons</span> opened at the Gaiety in New York as a $2 special. Although the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> was sniffy, "as one might imagine, a highly sentimental study" (14 February 1928, 27), most of the trade press praised the story without reservation. <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> wrote: "In its favor is some of the finest and most touching passages of high sentiment ever shown on the screen, and the dramatic elevation of Mrs. Mann to picture eminence, which bids to exceed in public interest the sudden stardom of Mary Carr . . . . [It] will probably suffice to give the Fox people another 'Over the Hill'" (15 February 1928, 24, 26).</p>
<p>The song trend continued for at least one more season. George Jessel, who had played the original Jack Robin on Broadway, appeared in <span style="font-style:italic;">Lucky Boy</span>, in which, in addition to the title song, he sang the the ballad "My Mother's Eyes" (both were by L. Wolfe Gilbert and Abel Baer). Pathé exchange produced <span style="font-style:italic;">Mother's Boy</span>, about an Irish tenor (played by Morton Downey) trying to break into show business. Jolson appeared in two films that stressed paternal love and devotion. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Singing Fool</span>, Jolson's second film, premiered in September 1928. It concerns a Broadway star who is separated from his young son by a divorce engineered by his unfaithful wife. According to <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span>, the star sang the theme song "Sonny Boy" (Lew Brown, B. G. DeSylva and Ray Henderson) in the hospital to his dying son and again after the boy's death when, still in the throes of grief, he goes onstage and sings it in blackface. <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> praised the lachrymose plot without qualification: "Besides these [songs], and these would be enough without anything but Jolson, there are tears. You've gotta cry at this one. The cards are stacked against you on the weep" (26 September 1928, 4). Even the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> endorsed the film enthusiastically, praising the "peculiarly appealing bits of sentiment" when Jolson as the father sings to his young son (20 September 1928, 42). Like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Singing Fool, Say It With Songs</span>, also released in the 1928–1929 season, is a father-love story with Jolson singing for his sick boy (this time the child makes a miraculous recovery, to music). It features the unforgettable Brown, DeSylva and Henderson song "Little Pal."</p>
<p>There were also maternal melodramas with a Broadway setting that featured female performers. Fox's <span style="font-style:italic;">Not Quite Decent</span>, which opened in May 1929, starred Louise Dresser as a night club singer, Mame, who meets the daughter taken from her by relatives years before. Without making her identity known, she protects the girl from the attentions of a Broadway roué, one of her own former lovers, and eventually sends her daughter off with her small-town boyfriend. In an ending reminiscent of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Singing Fool</span>, the mother is left alone, performing "Empty Arms" (Con Conrad, Sidney Mitchell, and Archie Gottler) in blackface. According to <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> (8 May 1929, 20), "The finis forces the toughest heart strings to twang. It's not the old stuff of the boy and girl going home, but the way in which Miss Dresser expresses the sentimental situation [at] the climax in her song." <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The vogue for the mother-love story was short lived. By November 1931, <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> was complaining about the plethora of such films in a review of Paramount's <span style="font-style:italic;">Once a Lady</span>: "What's really funny is that Paramount had to go out and buy a play to get this story. It seems about as sensible as buying the American rights to the 'Star-Spangled Banner.' And it took two literary names, Zoe Akins and Samuel Hoffenstein, both of whom should have better ideas of their own, to adapt it" (10 November 1931, 15). This film, and many others released in 1932, such as Frank Capra's <span style="font-style:italic;">Forbidden</span> and George Cukor's <span style="font-style:italic;">Rockabye</span>, were criticized for being sentimental and derivative, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> suggested their appeal would be largely confined to women in the neighborhood theaters. By 1935, the numbers of mother-love stories produced had declined dramatically and, with the exception of the occasional knock-out performance such as that of Barbara Stanwyck in the 1937 remake of <span style="font-style:italic;">Stella Dallas</span>, they garnered much less attention from the critics. Their unequivocal relegation to the ranks of the "woman's picture" by <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> after 1932 is another indication of the growing distaste for such highly emotional or pathetic fare, and the genre's increasingly marginal cultural status.</p>
<p>The example of the maternal melodrama is indicative of several aspects of what I have called the decline of sentiment in the Hollywood cinema, a result of literary modernism's progressive infiltration of popular culture.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> It is clear that within the film industry, critics and reporters eventually followed the lead of elite journalists in rejecting sentimentality and "old-fashioned melodrama." By 1932, <span style="font-style:italic;">Variety</span> was as impatient with the films as Robert Sherwood in <span style="font-style:italic;">Life</span>, or Mourdant Hall in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span>. However, the rejection of sentimentality was more uneven, and more tenuous, in the realm of popular culture than in the domain of elite literary culture. The point to be emphasized is the astonishing persistence of the maternal melodrama, given that the films were considered "sobby" and associated with neighborhood and small-town venues as early as the release of <span style="font-style:italic;">Over in the Hill</span> in 1920.</p>
<p>I have attributed the longevity of mother-love stories to several factors. First, and perhaps most importantly, the towns did not always follow the cities: according to repeated assessments in the film industry trade press, there was a fairly steady audience for the maternal melodrama in rural and small-town theaters. While the run-of-the-mill mother-love story did not always break records on Broadway, it reliably kept the subsequent-run exhibitor out of the red, and provided the producer of a modestly priced feature with a decent return on his investment. Against the backdrop of this relatively steady market, filmmakers in the 1920s found innovative ways to alter the plot so that it could succeed in metropolitan venues. Hence, the modernized variants such as those directed by Ernst Lubitsch, Clarence Brown, and Herbert Brenon. In addition, Henry King's adaptation of <span style="font-style:italic;">Stella Dallas</span> seems to have provided an alternative to the exceedingly idealized representations of mothers common in the films of the early 1920s. At the end of the period considered here, the genre in <span style="font-style:italic;">toto</span> gained a renewed presence on Broadway due to the transition to sound. The genre lent itself to several industry initiatives: the search for theatrical set pieces that could show off the new capacity to render spoken dialogue and that would suit actresses from the legitimate stage, and, during the very first years of sound film production, the systematic exploitation of a <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  vital genre of popular song. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Jazz Singer</span> and the films which followed in its lead helped to re-energize older strains of the maternal melodrama. The performance of familiar ballads like "Mammy" and "Mother Machree" bridged the gap between rural and urban audiences, naïve and sophisticated taste, and, for a brief time, made what most critics saw as old-fashioned stories palatable on Broadway.</p>

<div class="contrib"><a href="#back">David Lewis</a></div>

<div id="body">
<p>It is well-known that nearly all modern painters relied upon non-Western sources to invent and renew their paintings and themselves. It has also been well-established that such borrowings could only have taken place within a structure of Western domination and exploitation. Strangely, however, the meanings of the "imported" forms, <span style="font-style:italic;">as forms</span>, remain fairly constant, although chastened by current suspicions about power and advantage. Little attention has been paid to the manner in which such attempts to escape or overcome modernity were always betrayed specifically <span style="font-style:italic;">by</span> their "imported" sources—even when this negativity was obviously registered, or intriguingly rejected, by those involved.</p>
<p>Take the case of Byzantium in the eyes of modernists, for example. A whole formalist history of modern painting, identified for a half century with Clement Greenberg but in fact much earlier in origin, invoked Byzantium as a model of formal splendor and spiritual wholeness. In "Byzantine Parallels," published in 1958, Greenberg directly linked Byzantine art to the broad movement of modern painting and sculpture, citing Newman, Rothko, and Still as pertinent examples.1 Greenberg, however, was even then only rearticulating principles that had been established in the first years of the century, and at that crucial point the modernist most closely allied to Byzantium had been Henri Matisse, whose reverence for Byzantine art culminated in his 1911 trip to Russia:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Yesterday I saw a collection of old Russian icons. They are really great art. I am in love with their moving simplicity, which, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to me, is closer and dearer than Fra Angelico. In these icons the soul of the artists who painted them opens out like a mystical flower. And from that we ought to learn how to understand art.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">He no doubt saw formal as well as spiritual affinities, such as a shared lack of Albertian space and an abiding interest in the picture as a vessel or even generator of light. Such kinships were noted especially by critics: Roger Fry, for example, made of Byzantine art a paradigm of formalism—"we may perhaps be allowed to use Byzantium as a term generally expressive of the recovery of the <span style="font-style:italic;">objet d'art</span> from the representative side of pictorial art"—and championed Matisse in just such terms.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> So confident was Fry of the connection that he began a 1930 article on Matisse with a lengthy discussion of Byzantine art, after which he wrote, "I trust my reader will see by now that I have never once lost sight of M. Matisse."<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Similarly, Matthew Prichard—Bergsonian, friend to Matisse, and dedicated Byzantinist—commonly contrasted what he called the "Byzantine-Matisse" style favorably to the "Greek-Renaissance-Academic" stance, even as collectors like Serge Shchukin and Albert Clinton Landsberg were independently comparing pictures like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Conversation</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Portrait of Yvonne Landsberg</span>  to Byzantine icons.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> And even in the absence of such direct links, Byzantium was always present for Matisse via his friends, such as the acclaimed American Byzantinist Thomas Whittemore (rediscoverer of the Hagia Sophia mosaics) and especially family, notably his son-in-law Georges Duthuit, a scholar of Byzantine art who in 1949 published an essay called "Matisse and Byzantine Space."<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>Byzantium therefore occupies a central position in the imagination of Matisse, while, conversely, Matisse assumed a dominant position in the imaginations of many prominent early-twentieth-century critics, scholars, and dealers of Byzantine art. Because this connection was articulated on both sides in terms of shared formalist and spiritual interests, it is celebratory. Its best-known art-historical account was offered by Pierre Schneider in his 1975 article "The Striped Pajama Icon." Schneider traces Byzantine formal elements in Matisse's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Conversation</span>; these in turn suggest an underlying spiritual connection, so that the power of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Conversation</span> is, according to Schneider, a purely religious power, despite its mundane subject matter.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> By rearticulating this formalist-spiritual ideal, his argument follows the modernist path first trod by artists and critics around 1900, which until recently stood as the canonical understanding of Matisse. Here, for instance, is Frank Stella in 1975:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>I think that Matisse reaches the highest level that art can reach. He sets a kind of level or standard of achievement, whatever you want to call it.</p>
<p>. . . A lot of people go to abstract art, and they go away feeling hungry. With Matisse, you go away with exactly the opposite feeling. I can't imagine anyone going away hungry from Matisse.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, Stella was wrong: there were many, in the early years of Matisse's artistic maturity, who were left entirely unfulfilled. Matisse studies in the last ten or fifteen years have sought to uncover these voices and their meanings, thereby complicating <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the canonical modernist account.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Might we accordingly come across less obvious—and less celebratory—ways in which Matisse and Byzantium could have been linked, and, through this, to the underside or negativity of high modernism more generally, to meanings that were present but undesirable and therefore forgotten, even repressed?</p>
<p>We begin by shifting away from the modernist paradigm put forth by the painter's partisans and listening instead to what his enemies had to say; and we begin with <span style="font-style:italic;">Joy of Life</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">Le bonheur de vivre</span>, 1905–1906 [<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>]), not only because of its importance and fame, but also because it could have been directly influenced by Byzantine art, for in the crucial months leading up to Matisse's break with divisionism, Paul Signac, at whose side he had been painting, returned from Venice with photographs of Byzantine mosaics.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Had Matisse seen these images—a very real possibility—then it would have been Byzantium that led him out of apprenticeship, however promising, into fauvism and towards the status of modernist master.</p>
<p>Today <span style="font-style:italic;">Joy of Life</span> is well-established as the outstanding Fauve picture and as an image of Arcadian hedonism, just as Matisse is celebrated for his sensuality, so much so that when Matisse is dismissed, it is as <span style="font-style:italic;">merely</span> sensual, as a painter of nothing <span style="font-style:italic;">but</span> the joy of life. But for many of the critics at the 1906 Salon des Indepéndants, the picture was neither sensual nor accomplished but rather formally and spiritually empty, devoid of artistic presence or achievement.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Much of this criticism reads as a reaction to what was perceived as the picture's failure to offer <span style="font-style:italic;">life</span>—a failure made intolerable by the painting's title and ostensible theme, by the betrayed promise of bodies in heat, of the most physical kind of pastoral pleasures: music, dancing, sunlight and seaside. Charles Morice wrote, famously: "The joy of life, that? But life is absent!"<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> He complained of the picture's coldness, echoing his earlier hostility—"Cold, irretrievably cold remains the art of the virtuoso; cold and artificial"—and since coldness is associated not with life and the organic but rather death and the inorganic, it is only a short step, metaphorically speaking, to Jean Claude's lament—"It is indescribable and incomprehensible: it makes you contemplate suicide."<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> This lifelessness was extended, as well, from the res in the picture to the absence, or lifelessness, of the artist, whose presence, or <span style="font-style:italic;">life</span>, failed to manifest in the picture, so that the art of painting, <span style="font-style:italic;">as</span> life, was betrayed as well. Morice, for example, noted that the painter had entirely failed "to demonstrate his personality."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> And here, for the sake of emphasis, is the sympathetic Julius Meier Graefe in 1915, looking back over a decade of such criticism: "I am here for you to ingest, Matisse's paintings say, but the ingesting must be made an art. With the right organs, you will suck from my tapestry all that others pull from your soul: truth, simplicity, poetry, life—yes, even life."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Even Stella's much later and seemingly offhand metaphor of hunger and its formal-spiritual satisfaction is apropos of, or, more exactly, inherited, in a victorious fashion, from this discourse.</p>
<p>As is well known, it was the joy of life rather than the horror of lifelessness that eventually carried the day, but the signs of its morbid negation remain. Take, for example, the res of <span style="font-style:italic;">Music</span> , characterized by Russian critic Yakov Tugendhold as "boy werewolves," and in particular their gaping black mouths, which Yve-Alain Bois more recently described as "a disquietingly true representation of death."<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Again, take <span style="font-style:italic;">Nymph</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">and Satyr</span> (1908–1909), in which the fleeing and therefore lively nymph falls into a perfect half-circle, so that sensual intensity leads to freezing and schematization; or the obvious atavism of the central re in <span style="font-style:italic;">Bathers with a Turtle</span> ; or even Bois's discussion of Matisse's oeuvre as an aesthetic of blinding, which points quite obviously beyond the gratification of vision, however sumptuous, to its cancellation in darkness and in death. The point is not to deny or overturn Matisse's vitality and originality but rather to set these again against their opposites, which, as the critics demonstrate, were there all along, but then consistently warded off by his modernist canonization.</p>

</div>
<p>We have seen already that Byzantium was invoked by Matisse's champions as a paradigm of formal and spiritual vitality, of renewed artistic <span style="font-style:italic;">life</span>. By doing so, Fry and others were contesting convention, which esteemed Ingriste or impressionist modes of picture-making; these, because of their greater naturalism, were deemed to offer more life while Byzantine art was for the most part imagined as rigid, impersonal, and geometric, and therefore less living. There are exceptions (prominently Maurice Denis, or to a lesser extent Gustave Klimt), but the Byzantine revival in the later nineteenth century was more sustained in architecture and decoration; to make painting, especially re painting, in "Byzantine" fashion was to swim against academic, naturalist, and even impressionist tides. So conventional was this view of Byzantine art as insensate and inorganic that British critic and poet T. E. Hulme in fact celebrated it <span style="font-style:italic;">for</span> its lifelessness.</p>
<p>Hulme traveled in the same circles as Prichard and Fry and Clive and Vanessa Bell, and there are numerous dismissals of Fry in his writings.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Like Prichard, Hulme was a devotee of Henri Bergson, whom he knew personally; Bergson wrote him a letter of recommendation, and they both attended the Fourth International Philosophical Congress in Bologna in 1911, at which Hulme was first exposed to Byzantine sites at <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Ravenna.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> While reading Worringer and championing artists like Picasso, Jacob Ep stein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, and Wyndham Lewis, Hulme often invoked Byzantium as a world beyond hunger or any living human appetites or pleasure at all, a mechanical and geometrical world:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>[Byzantine] forms are always what can be described as stiff and lifeless. The dead form of a pyramid and the suppression of life in a Byzantine mosaic show that behind these arts there must have been an impulse, the direct opposite of that which finds satisfaction in the naturalism of Greek and Renaissance art.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">There is therefore not only a lifeless Matisse but also a lifeless Byzantium, developed in overlapping social and intellectual circles during the same years. This suggests a lifeless Byzantine-Matisse.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> That the negativity of Matisse's relationship to Byzantium went essentially unstated in fact bolsters this contention, because such an insight was hardly desired: not by Matisse's champions, who would have hardly wanted their formalist-spiritual ideal contradicted at its source, not by Matisse himself, and not by the painter's enemies, who had no need to trace his affinities and influences since to them the canvases were damning enough. Rather, lifelessness <span style="font-style:italic;">presented itself</span> as the inevitable but repressed mark of modernity upon the effort, via modernism, to reinvigorate modernist life. Escaping or overcoming modernity via a "primitivism" or imported spirituality of any kind is shown to be like trying to sail beyond the sunset; any modernist invocation of Byzantium as a spiritual refuge must always betray itself.</p>
<p>This is demonstrated not only by the proposition of a lifeless Byzantine-Matisse but also by the most famous artistic vision of Byzantium produced in any medium by a modern artist, which is W. B. Yeats's "Sailing to Byzantium" . The poem is generally interpreted as an artistic-spiritual quest for transcendence and artistic immortality by means of Byzantium, which for Yeats represented the ideal synthesis of religious, aesthetic, and practical life. In "Byzantium a little before Justinian opened St. Sophia and closed the academy of Plato," wrote Yeats, "I think I could find in some little wine-shop some philosophical worker in mosaic who could answer all my questions . . . ."<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> The holy city is the site of a plea for the immortality of the artist's soul. But in the final stanza, the poet is not transformed, as might be expected, into a creature of pure spirit, but rather into a mechanical bird:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Once out of nature I shall never take<br>My bodily form from any natural thing,<br>But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make<br>Of hammered gold and gold enamelling<br>To keep a drowsy Emperor awake;<br>Or set upon a golden bough to sing<br>To lords and ladies of Byzantium<br>Of what is past, or passing, or to come.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The image, derived from the golden bird of the Byzantine emperor Theopholis, is a complicated one, as is the Byzantine myth in general for Yeats. It is remarkable, however, that the poet's quest appears unable to fulfill itself properly, or at best to fulfill itself only by conjuring a purely mechanical paradise—the traditional negation of both flesh and spirit.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> It is especially noteworthy given that Yeats, who had twice toured Byzantine sites in Italy and Sicily (including Ravenna) and expressed great admiration for Byzantine revival architecture (in particular the Stockholm town hall), had a huge stock of Byzantine imagery to draw on, as well as the enormous powers of his imagination. As if in spite of his intentions, he chose the image of a mechanical bird; or, better, we might say that the bird-machine chose him—precisely <span style="font-style:italic;">because</span> it was a machine.</p>
<p>We know from Yeats's letters that he was concerned about what he thought of as a poetic misstep, or the unintended revelation of modernity-as-mechanization. The fact that close readers took the poem's conclusion as a robotic bird, pure and simple, and could not find transcendence there caused Yeats not only to admit that the image had failed to convey his intentions but also to write a second Byzantine poem in 1930. This poem, called "Byzantium," can be read as a sustained attempt to do away with the unwanted mechanical truth that the Byzantine quest had in fact produced. It can be read, that is, as a poem about its predecessor, which it attempts to correct (but ultimately to little avail). Fittingly, it begins with a lyric about lyric, and with a firm thematic shift from day to night:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>The unpurged images of day recede;<br>The Emperor's drunken soldiery are abed;<br>Night resonance recedes, night-walkers' song<br>After great cathedral gong;<br>A starlit or a moonlit dome disdains . . . <a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Given that this poem continues and modifies "Sailing to Byzantium," it is quite plausible to read the "unpurged images of day" as a reference to the first poem, and, more specifically, to the problematic mechanical images that prompted "Byzantium." <span style="font-style:italic;">Unpurged</span> is a telling choice of word, pointing as it does towards a failure to repress fully. That the images are not purged but merely <span style="font-style:italic;">recede</span>, as if associated with a bad waking dream, suggest that the mechanical truth is an indelible stain and <span style="font-style:italic;">cannot</span> in fact be expunged but only shunted aside, covered, complicated. Yeats associates these still unpurged—but also unpurgable—images with day, which suggests light, in which truth becomes visible; because this is undesirable, "Byzantium" moves from day into night, thereby attempting to obscure its problematic hypogram in darkness. It is therefore a nocturnal poem (in only the first five lines, quoted above, we read of soldiery "abed," of "night resonance," "night walkers," and a "starlit or moonlit" dome). But this attempt to blind the reader is not enough:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Miracle, bird or golden handiwork,<br>More miracle than bird or handiwork,<br>Planted on the starlit golden bough, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <br>Can like the cocks of Hades crow,<br>Or, by the moon embittered, scorn aloud<br>In glory of changeless metal<br>Common bird or petal<br>And all complexities of mire or blood.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Like everything in the poem, the bird returns at night, so that it is inscribed within a thematic of non-sight—but it nevertheless returns, like anything repressed. Therefore an additional strategy of obfuscation by multiplication is employed. This is tantamount to double or triple vision—to already darkened sight placed behind a fragmented lens. Notice that the possible identities—miracle, bird, and golden handiwork in the first two lines, denizen of the underworld and rival of the non-mechanical world in lines 3 to 6—are in fact linked only with <span style="font-style:italic;">or</span>, never <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span>, so that the multiple images/identities never coalesce but instead remain permanently multiple. In fact this multiplicity is itself doubled: it is "planted" on the golden bough, its scorn is directed equally at bird "or petal," suggesting transformation into a flower or a tree (significantly, an organic rather than mechanical doubling). Because of all this, Yeats's affirmation in the stanza's second line can only be read as a choice among others, not a final or stable truth. The passage as a whole offers a protracted oscillation—we might even say <span style="font-style:italic;">vacillation</span>, which is the title of a poem published, along with "Byzantium," in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Winding Stair and Other Poems</span>—between the intransigent mechanical truth of the bird and the attempt to simultaneously conceal it in darkness and fragment its possible meanings.</p>
<p>Yeats was born in 1865, Matisse in 1869; they are of the generation that came of age with the fin de siècle terror of industrialization, a horror of the machine and the threat it represented to organic and traditional life on the one hand and spiritual and artistic life on the other. Neither Matisse nor Yeats developed a machine aesthetic, as did many of their younger peers, but their work is nevertheless haunted by the mechanical. Matisse's pastoral evocations of music and lovemaking and dance, his supposedly untrammeled hedonism of color and flesh, are in fact inflected, as we have seen, by lifelessness, as if life's affects—like painting's affects—are present somehow in the absence of actual life, as if these were <span style="font-style:italic;">mechanical</span> bodies; just as Yeats's artifice of eternity is, in the end, only a machine. Moreover, we cannot in either case tell the dancer from the dance: Matisse, whose early work was always criticized, as neoimpressionism, for employing a purely mechanical technique, was seen to have failed to assert himself as a living presence in his paintings, "failed to demonstrate personality"; and the poet, himself working through séances, during which spirits (he called them instructors) would dictate ideas and images, was in a fundamental sense reduced even before the act of writing into a mere transcribing machine.</p>
<p>Because these possibilities were forgotten in favor of tales of formal splendor and spiritual wholeness, it would take a later artist, one whose iciness and anti-humanism placed him outside the high modernist trajectory, to one day connect the dots. That artist was Andy Warhol, who famously quipped, "I want to be a machine." But Warhol also said, "I want to be Matisse," which is harder to interpret, unless we imagine that Warhol, the great artist of the mechanical and the lifeless, saw quite clearly, and applauded, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the lifeless and mechanical in Matisse. Warhol was not simply Catholic but specifically a devout <span style="font-style:italic;">Byzantine</span> Catholic: could he have found his way to this mechanical Matisse, and therefore, as we have done, to the mechanical consciousness of high modernism, precisely through Byzantium?</p>

<div id="body">
<p>Some years ago, the question of pure poetry began to be debated in our literary discussions. In 1926 or thereabouts, we wanted the poet to be spontaneous and uplifting. Now we sometimes want him to be "pure"—and sometimes we do not. Although I could never clearly understand the problem as it is set forth in Greece, it seems to me that we Greeks have a tendency to call pure poetry not works written prior to Karyotakis but those that came after his <span style="font-style:italic;">Elegies and Satires</span>.<a name="fs1-text" href="#fs1"><sup>1</sup></a> Furthermore, it seems to me that we assess the quality of these poems not through comparison to other poems, but according to a defined theory of poetry. The danger of this procedure is that it can be misleading: a person may be under the erroneous impression that he is evaluating a poem when in fact he is denigrating or propounding an aesthetic dogma.</p>
<p>I would not have used the term "pure poetry" if it did not cover, according to the way we perceive it, the entire problem of European poetry during the past fifty or sixty years. And it is time to arrive at somewhat clear and verifiable conclusions about this poetry. I fear that, as time passes, it will be increasingly difficult to agree on questions regarding poetry, either of our own time or of any other time, if we do not understand the efforts, the difficulties, and the goals of poets who, no matter how different from each other, have remarkable similarities in their contributions to the total picture of the art as we see it. Whether or not we like that picture is an entirely different matter; and I am not inclined to believe that there does not exist any other path besides the one which these poets followed. On the contrary, for the true artist there is always some other path. But we must try to understand better exactly what it is we are talking about.</p>
<p>Of course, it would not be impossible to give a few broad definitions of contemporary poetry. But I fear lest the definition would irrevocably supplant the very thing it defines. This danger is very real in our country, where not only do we ignore, as a rule, the works which I am attempting to determine, but where it is also difficult for us (I mean, of course, a public that surpasses a hundred readers) to agree regarding the impressions we receive from those works we happen to know. Naturally, I do not expect that all of us agree in the acceptance or rejection of any specific thing that might come to our awareness. I mean only that there does not yet exist in Greece—not even regarding our own concerns—that somewhat deep-rooted, basic agreement without which each dissent degenerates into pointless turmoil. Of course, a tacit agreement on basic principles is implied in every discussion. Without it, we might have many parallel monologues—but we do not have a <span style="font-style:italic;">dialogue</span>. For the moment, we are the nation of parallel monologues.</p>
<p>When I speak of contemporary poetry, I mean that stretch in the development of the poetic art which begins with Charles Baudelaire, reaches a first milestone with French symbolism, and continues up to our "postwar" era. Its underpinning is French. But if we wanted to muse for a little while on the role of intellectual crossbreeding in the life of nations, we could point out strange yet sufficiently illuminating—albeit hotly <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  contested—foreign influences on Greek art. We encounter writers striving to express their unique individuality who feel stronger bonds with creators outside the province of their own language. These creators, in turn, help our writers to find within our own national tradition the most original and least exhausted fonts of inspiration. Remy de Gourmont writes, "Every time you observe a movement in a national literature, search outside the boundaries of that literature to find the force that animates it." Baudelaire, reading Poe, finds entire sentences expressed precisely as he himself had conceived them. Nonetheless, he is the first representative of the romantic movement to refer to the French tradition of the seventeenth century. The elements that molded the great generation of symbolism belong to all peoples, including our very own Papdiamantopoulos. <a name="fs2-text" href="#fs2"><sup>2</sup></a> Be that as it may, the symbolist movement yielded forms that are distinctly French, such as the works of Mallarmé or Verlaine, even while its radiance extended to all the major European literatures. The debt which as important a poet as R. M. Rilke owed to symbolism is well known. But the manner in which French literature paid back its debt to Anglo-Saxon literature is somewhat more original.</p>
<p>Contemporary literature, to limit myself to its recent history, was introduced to England through the narrow gate. The people who cultivated it were not even English, to tell the truth, and most lived far away from that country, which continues to insist on being an island. Among its most important masters—W.B. Yeats, James Joyce, D. H. Lawrence, Ezra Pound, and T. S. Eliot—two are Irish, two American, and two of their most important works were banned in England and in America. Nearly all of them went through considerable periods of wandering, and Eliot, in one of his earliest French poems, satirizes himself through a paraphrase of Tristan Corbière as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>En Amérique, professeur;<br>En Angleterre, journaliste;<br>C'est à grands pas et en sueur<br>Que vous suivrez à peine ma piste.<br>En Yorkshire, conférencier;<br>A Londres, un peu banquier,<br>Vous me paierez bien la tête.<br>C'est à Paris que je me coiffe<br>Casque noir de jemenfoutiste.<br>En Allemagne, philosophe<br>Surexcité par Emporheben<br>Au grand air de Bergsteigleben;<br>J'erre toujours de-ci de-là<br>A divers coups de tra là là<br>De Damas jusqu'à Omaha.<br>Je célébrai mon jour de fête<br>Dans une oasis d'Afrique<br>Vêtu d'une peau de girafe.</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>On montrera mon cénotaphe<br>Aux côtes brûlantes de Mozambique. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Nonetheless, the decisive—and most fruitful—influence on Eliot's oeuvre was exerted by Jules Laforgue: bitter feelings beneath a humorous, dispassionate exterior; common-place details with the potential to stir powerful emotions; a thirst for the absolute that ends up in nihilism; images full of realism blended with a sense of emotional isolation; poetry of a jester, in which scholarly terms and erudite expressions are used to cover up a Hamlet-like indecisiveness; music full of dissonances, just like psychology. We, too, got to know something of this mood through the poetry of Karyotakis. The verse from "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" that was so admired around 1915—</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>I have measured out my life with coffee spoons<div class="attrib">—is not so different from the verse of Karyotakis's <span style="font-style:italic;">Elegies</span>—</div></p></div></blockquote>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>or if you would measure the depth<br>of your empty head with a hair pin!</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">One begins as one can. Eliot himself admitted that he began to write in a form emerging from a study of Laforgue and of late Elizabethan drama. "The lion is made up of all the sheep it has digested" ("Le lion est fait de mouton assimilé"), said Valéry. If the lion were to start bleating, it would seem very strange to us, but only for a little while. Therefore, it is more interesting to study the personality of Eliot as it emerges in his first poems under the influence of his French ancestor. The differences are significant in the articulation of a thought in its final expression, I would say. The tone is deeper, the rhythm more deliberate, more tightly structured without twists and turns. The images are more rugged, better fitted together, with less ornamentation. Laforgue says the following about the sun:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Ce soir un soleil fichu gît au haut du coteau,<br>Gît sur le flanc, dans les genêts, sur son manteau.<br>Un soleil blanc comme un crachat d'estaminet<br>Sur une litière de jaunes genêts,<br>De jaunes genêts d'automne.<br>--<br>Et il gît là, comme une glande arrachée dans un cou,<br>Et il frissonne sans personne! . . .</p></div></blockquote>
<p>And Eliot:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Let us go then, you and I,<br>When the evening is spread out against the sky<br>Like a patient etherised upon a table . . . .</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The kinship between these two images is obvious. So is the difference. In the following lines from the same poem ("The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"), there is no longer any evidence of an original influence still exerting energy, of a kind of sound that seems <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to lie between two voices and irritates with its ambiguity. It is more like assimilated Shakespeare, from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tempest</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>We have lingered in the chambers of the sea<br>By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown<br>Till human voices wake us, and we drown.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The process of assimilating foreign elements, which we discern to a greater or lesser degree in every artist, is particularly interesting in the case of Eliot because it is one of the most characteristic aspects of his work. The apprentice who left behind in Boston a society altogether uncivilized yet refined far beyond the limits of civilization found his mentor at the age of twenty. His first published poem is nothing other than an exercise upon a given theme:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>You, madam, are the eternal humorist<br>The eternal enemy of the absolute . . . .</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">These lines could have appeared in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Imitation de Notre Dame la Lune</span>. But this is an isolated case. Immediately afterwards, one can discern parallel tendencies which might end up in similar outcomes—in any case, temporary for Eliot—but of a different caliber. The hesitations, the twists and turns, the boredom, and the despair are not—as in the case of Laforgue—the consequences of the tortured sensitivity of a practically virginal adolescent. Much more than that: they are the reactions of a soul which carries within itself a kind of biblical sense of doom. One recalls, almost involuntarily, the resistance against voluptuousness and the moral complexes of another writer burdened with a puritanical heritage, Eliot's predecessor André Gide. But in the case of Eliot, the resistance is grim, and disgust follows right along. Except for the poem, "La ia che Piange" (the only one I happened to see in anthologies of respectable literature), there does not exist in Eliot's entire oeuvre another portrait of a girl, bearing any resemblance to nearly all of the heroines of Laforgue. It is true that the bitter recollection of nakedness left by a mowed-down adolescent love—"<span style="font-style:italic;">o quam te memorem virgo</span>"—runs through all of his poetry. We find it once more addressed directly to the hyacinth girl in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, and perhaps even later in the poem, "Marina" (compare <span style="font-style:italic;">The Hollow Men</span>, as well), or suddenly, at the very end of a set of cohesive images, we find:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>With the smell of hyacinths across the garden<br>Recalling what other people have desired . . .</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">or:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>The notion of some infinitely gentle<br>Infinitely suffering thing. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">But such verses are nothing more than delicate traces surrounding the loneliness of a city dweller who pieces together, with "old English humor . . . terribly serious," narrow, dirty streets, cheap restaurants, decrepit beds, worn-out women, high-strung ladies, psychological resistances plaguing an aging body, days burned out like cigarette butts, derailments of memory—"the thousand sordid images of which your soul was constituted"—chilled ashes within a sensation akin to voluptuousness.</p>
<p>It is difficult for each person to rid himself of the invisible dance of the old men who pursue him his whole life long. The arduous struggle against his forbears—the Puritan refugees who sought religious freedom in New England—was to become Eliot's struggle, as well. His initial condemnation of Puritanism and his subsequent conversion to the Anglican faith, as well as his fixation on Mediterranean personalities like that of Dante, show this struggle quite clearly. "Milton's celestial and infernal regions," he writes somewhere, "are large but insufficiently furnished apartments filled with heavy conversation; and one remarks about Puritan mythology an historical thinness."<a name="fs3-text" href="#fs3"><sup>3</sup></a> But even though the old men sometimes change aspect, rarely do they truly die. Eliot's brand of Catholicism always retains a trace of puritanical reproof, as well as a trace of the priggish moralizing of a sermon, elements from which works of Catholic origin dating from flourishing epochs are exempt, such as the poetry of Villon, or even the sculpture of Gothic churches.</p>
<p>Nor, to an even greater degree, do we find in Eliot that all-embracing tolerance proffered by Claudel. Of course, such comparisons are arbitrary and can lead to error if they are not preceded by the clear establishment of parameters. But what I want to note here is that I could hardly imagine a person of the Catholic faith without his Paradise, or a Paradise somewhere nearby, and that if Eliot gets beyond the circles of Hell, he does so only to enter Purgatory. His poetry always revolves around the notion of "anti"—or, at least, it is in the instances when it does that it yields its greatest rewards, in my opinion. Indeed, it seems to find its redemption when it is sunk into the realm of purification: "<span style="font-style:italic;">nel foco che li affina</span>." Perhaps this fire is also the fire that brings Eliot hope. But it seems to me that in most—as well as in the most important—of Eliot's poems, the poetic redemption is relinquished, as is the case with the characteristic ending of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, with a gesture corresponding to that of Arnaut Daniel at the moment when he is consumed by "the purifying fire." The last reverberation that is left with me after reading these poems by Eliot bears a strange resemblance to the works of the poet from Provence before he is once again consumed by flames: "Remember my pain when your hour comes—<span style="font-style:italic;">sovenha vos a temps de ma dolor</span>." In such cases, the concept of redemption acquires a Catholicity we rarely encounter in his other poems, poems in which he attempted to express religious hope. Thus, among the poems of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ash Wednesday</span>—even though it is not a poem of lower poetic art—we encounter abundant evidence of the difficulties he had to face. And "the silent sister veiled in white and blue" and "the three white leopards" might well be beautifully decorative, but one could hardly attribute to them a greater significance.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is due to the fact—as Eliot himself notes—that the gift of poetry is rare; rare too is the capacity for religiously motivated emotions at their greatest intensity . . . <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and rarer still is the coexistence of those two faculties in the same individual. It might well be that this is a case of mutually exclusive functions: though they may at times borrow certain elements from each other, nonetheless each of them remains entire and finds its fulfillment through distinctly separate faculties. But it might be more prudent for one to follow the advice of the old teacher—namely, that one misunderstands a writer when one feels hostile to him. Thus, even though I was unable to avoid writing the above lines, I will leave psychological commentary to people who have studied, in greater depth than myself, questions concerning God's justice and omnipotence in view of the existence of evil.</p>
<p>In the more specific context of literature, this characteristically Eliot-esque awareness of decay is not unrelated to the feelings of another great disgusted writer: Flaubert. The following excerpt by Eliot would not surprise us in the least if it were found instead among Flaubert's correspondence: "The natives of that unfortunate archipelago," writes Eliot in 1923 about the population of Melanesia,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>are dying out principally for the reason that the 'Civilization' forced upon them has deprived them of all interest in life. They are dying from pure boredom. When every theatre has been replaced by 100 cinemas, when every musical instrument has been replaced by 100 gramophones, when every horse has been replaced by 100 cheap motor-cars, when electrical ingenuity has made it possible for every child to hear its bedtime stories from a loud speaker, when applied science has done everything possible with the materials on this earth to make life as interesting as possible, it will not be surprising if the population of the entire civilized world rapidly follows the fate of the Melanesians.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">And Albert Thibaudet notes regarding <span style="font-style:italic;">Bouvard et Pécuchet</span>, that no book is more closely connected to the depths of Flaubert's existence; the source of <span style="font-style:italic;">Bouvard et Pécuchet</span> goes back still further, to the time when Flaubert and his little sister would go to look through the window at the corpses in the amphitheater of the Hotel-Dieu, at the time when Flaubert could not see, as he avowed, a living person without thinking of his corpse. <span style="font-style:italic;">Bouvard et Pécuchet</span> is a painting of the realities, the knowledge, the desires of mankind seen through the vantage point of the corpse, seen at the very moment that they themselves are to become corpses. And nothing comes closer to a corpse, spiritually and physically, than the old age of two idiots. But, by then, for a long time already, Flaubert was unfortunately more able to observe old age in himself than in others. As he himself said in a thousand different ways, he was born an old man. He carries old age within him.</p>
<p>And Eliot, observing a woman of easy morals, thinks of Webster, who saw the skull behind the skin, and perhaps Eliot was born old, as well. "Mr. Prufrock" (in the poem published when the poet was 27 years old) does not dare to confess his love, as he takes stock of his body's decay; five years hence, he will have become "Gerontion"; later, the ancient Tiresias, and later still Simeon, who exclaimed: "Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace." Everything can be interpreted in psychological terms. But what really matters here is not what our virtues, our faults, or our own difficulties may be, but rather what we have done with what was given to us by God and men. What <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  really matters is not what ancestral traits brought a poet to the point where he had to take a stance, either of acceptance or rejection, but that through those ancestral traits he was able to create a work of poetry. And in this work—whether or not he himself was "an old man in a dry month"—Eliot created himself, grafting himself drop by drop, just like Flaubert—and like Flaubert, in an impersonal work. If the death of an era found a spokesman attuned by nature to death, so much the worse for that era.</p>
<p>Until he came to the point of writing "Gerontian"—which is his first verse written in a purely Eliot-esque style—he was either experimenting with form, along with his friend Ezra Pound ("the best craftsman," <span style="font-style:italic;">il miglior fabbro del parlar materno</span>"), on the model of the four-line stanza of Théophile Gautier, or he was writing a few poems in French, for which I at least can find no other explanation than that they were written as a drill in transposing from one language into another. His poems, until the end of the war, are either caricatures of the incurable mediocrity of certain vulgar types, such as Sweeney, or turn hopelessly towards the fulfillment of a life forever lost—</p>

<p class="continued">—or they meet the skeleton at the edge of the senses, or move, independently of the generalization that can be applied to artistic expression, within the circle of a personal drama. Peace has given to the world the capability of looking more deeply into its hopelessness. In France, where the spirit traditionally maintains a stance of aloof independence, the total negation had already broken into the intellectual realm. Perhaps in England, the conditions lent themselves better to the expression of post-war despair in a manner more directly human. In certain cases, for Eliot, death is no longer a personal feeling; it is all the dying things that surround him because the entire world is squalid. With "Gerontian," with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Hollow Men</span>, with "Sweeney Agonistes," with the series of poems that ends with "Difficulties of a States-man," Eliot, like nobody else, gave, if not the epic of an era, as has been written, at least the epic of a pivotal feeling of a moment in history, of an emotion that we all felt, whether we want to keep on living now or whether we want to die. If he did nothing else, at least he did this: he burned a few bridges behind him. At the moment when putrefaction was spreading all around him, he felt it and he bellowed it out. After Eliot, we can do whatever we want, but we can no longer turn back toward some things that are already rotten. And the spot of isolation has become abominably narrow. This is no small matter. They leveled against him the accusation that he abandons the reader within the dry, barren <span style="font-style:italic;">Waste Land</span>, alone, without the hope of salvation. This would be true if Eliot had not created poetry. No matter how despairing it might be, poetry always rescues us, in some way, from the turbulence of passion. But looking at it from another perspective, even if we were not to acknowledge, as do all those who agree with the poet in all of his conclusions, that the devout portion of his work is not sufficient to counterbalance the elements of despair that he proffers to us, I would look for the cause of this among Eliot's successors, among those who took off from the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  point at which he himself was able to arrive. And they speak to us about death, but in a somewhat different and more decisive tone.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>If we really want to live, we'd better start at once to try;<br>If we don't it doesn't matter, but we'd better start to die.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Thus spoke one among the more recent, W. H. Auden. Both ambiguity and hesitation have become difficult.</p>
<p>Eliot . . . is a difficult poet. But first of all I would like to call to mind that all poetry is by definition difficult, noting however that whereas in bygone times poetry gave us the deceptive feeling that we understand, now it leaves us no escape route. Confronted with the problem of ease versus difficulty, I would say that the lines—</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>there will be a day when the holy city of Troy will lament<br>and so will Priam and the people of melodious-voiced Priam</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">—are as difficult for to grasp poetically as these lines of Mallarmé:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Une sonore, vaine et monotone ligne.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The only difficulty is that the first example leaves something to be desired if it is translated into prose, whereas the second leaves nothing. But our capability of substituting one thing for something else does not, of course, alter in the least the substance of the thing itself.</p>
<p>Before we blame the poets for the incomprehensible forms that they confront us with, it would be fair to acknowledge that they have the basic right to be judged, just like other artists, according to the rules of their art and according to the difficulties which their material forces them to face. They are entitled to this. On many occasions, we hear extremely educated people admit that they do not understand this or that piece of music, which however seems very simple to understand for whomever has even a slight acquaintance with music. And if we tell them that they do not understand the work because they do not understand music in general, they do not snub us as a result. However, if one were to say to the same person that he does not find meaning in a poem (what is the <span style="font-style:italic;">meaning</span> of a painting?) because he does not understand poetry, he considers it a personal affront, as if someone had called him illiterate. And the odd thing is that, at the point we have reached today, it is very likely that illiteracy would help rather than hinder the understanding of poetry. Because the first misunderstanding derives from the fact that poems are written in letters, just like travelogues and advertisements for drugs. And it would be preferable that poems have the good luck to fall into the hands of a reader who is not used to numbing his brain—like the majority of half-educated people—with the inexhaustible printed matter that assails the cultured person every day. This half-educated person, most of the time, asks that art <span style="font-style:italic;">speak</span> to <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  him or that it <span style="font-style:italic;">resemble</span> something, whereas a work of art, in any event, <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> something with which we either can, or cannot, establish contact.</p>
<p>I do not mean to imply that poetry should not communicate rational meaning. The only thing I maintain is that the existence of that meaning is often unrelated to the poem's value as such, and that it is a sign of bad judgment, or of a bad method, to begin approaching poetry from its rational meaning. And, above all, I maintain that poetry is meant to be recited and to be heard. Even though today, we are accustomed to reading only with our eyes, we must first of all approach poetry as oral if we truly aspire to arrive at an understanding of it. Because that is its source and that is its "race": the spoken word, which, in the remotest corner of its origin, meets the "savage beating on a drum in the jungle," to quote Eliot. And if we look in that direction to discover the difference between poetry and prose, I imagine that our toil will not be in vain. For example, poetry utilizes silence as one of its constructive elements; it is indeed made of words and silence; it sculpts silence in some sort of way. Prose is a silent art; it unfolds within the silence. It contains interruptions; nonetheless, it cannot have silences. Usually, the kind of prose that invites recitation, poetic prose, is bad prose. Equally true, poetry that does not invite recitation is bad poetry. And yet, how few readers of poetry feel the need to hear them in order to understand them? And, among them, fewer still know how to listen to them!</p>
<p>As an expression of spoken rhythm, poetry addresses itself to the whole person—his senses, his feelings, and his mental processes, as the molders of his feelings. Poetry demands a response from the whole person, from him who gives himself to it with the greatest immediacy, without stopping to contemplate whether or not he really understands. We do not understand precisely when we fear we will not understand. This fear is the greatest obstacle to making contact with poetry. In the absence of this fear, understanding comes later, on its own—and gradually, as always. The adage that "poetry is an attitude towards life," means, I imagine, many things, but it also means this: a pose, in the sense that we use the word when we speak about statues. The poet constructs man vis-à-vis life, and in the final analysis that is how I perceive Aeschylus when, at the conclusion of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Oresteia</span>, the procession of Eumenides disappears from view:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>    Zeus the all-seeing<br>with Destiny has now concurred.<br>Singing and dancing follow our footsteps all.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">But our own world is a far cry from the ancient Greek city state or from the organized societies whose members flocked to the theater to see the dramas of Shakespeare or Racine. Ours is a world in dissolution, a sick and benumbed world, a world in which the sensations evaporate and lose their touch with reality, assailed by a chaotic multitude of impressions, a world in which a man trying to coordinate those sensations does not find solid ground to step on anywhere except within himself. The feeling of the unreality of the individual is characteristic among contemporary writers. One could <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  observe the reactions to these kinds of feelings in works of such dissimilar personalities as those of Eliot, André Malraux, or D. H. Lawrence. Even more characteristic is the tendency towards monologue—interior monologue. And speaking to oneself is not so very different from speaking in a foreign tongue.</p>
<p>I would not like one to suppose that I believe that poetry has become a private matter. I would like to observe only that instead of saying that poetry has reached the point where it negates communication, it would be much more fitting to muse about a world in which <span style="font-style:italic;">communication</span> has become so difficult that it dictates the existence of so difficult an art. If there be one being all of whose powers push it towards communication, that being is the poet. With the only caveat that the poet is not free—and that is precisely why he claims his independence—to prefer another expression besides the one, the only one, imposed on him by the material he must express without ceasing to be an artist. And his material is exceedingly complex. Because, apart from the phenomenon of social dissolution that ever more excludes the existence of shared feelings, it is not only the violent and swift impressions from outside that heap themselves upon each other, tearing each other to pieces ("contemporary perception of rhythm has been affected by the internal combustion engine," as Eliot would say), but even more a kind of inner excavation, hitherto inconceivable, which has now honed the artist's sensitivity to an even more painful sharpness. This communication is something that the artist sought in our time, as best he could, and if at times he was compelled to step, like the mystics, outside the parameters of this world, or to deny his physical existence in order to practice his art, if at the end of his strenuous effort he found silence, let us not rush to condemn him. Let us rather owe him a debt of gratitude because from the midst of his myriad difficulties, he did his best to serve, until his last breath, certain values without which our world would have lost every human quality.</p>
<p>"From the time of impressionism and cubism," writes André Lhote, "art has become profoundly disturbing, with an eruption of technical advances that faithfully reflect inner struggles." The techniques of Mallarmé and Rimbaud, from which to a large extent the contemporary art of poetry derives, are not simple quests for forms; they are human dramas one of which features at its conclusion an act of madness, as Mallarmé once characterized the <span style="font-style:italic;">Coup de dès</span>, and the other ends up in the annihilation of one of the strongest personalities ever known in the annals of poetry. Behind the odd manners and the complications that provoke indignation, time and again a very tragic plot is being played out. What is at stake here is precisely the existence of a man struggling with every drop of his blood to achieve balance among the erratic elements in the world all around him. And together with the existence of that man, who also expresses what we ourselves feel, even without always knowing it, our very own existence is at stake, as well.</p>
<p>The text to which I referred above should be implemented with another observation, by Maritain, which Eliot himself quotes: "Work such as Picasso's shows a fearful progress in self-consciousness on the part of the painting." The changes of mind within a single night (<span style="font-style:italic;">La Jeune Parque</span> by Paul Valéry), the fluctuations of many consciousnesses in a single day in Dublin (<span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> by James Joyce), the reactions of a conscience at a <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  historical moment which encompasses all of civilization (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>): these are not coincidences. They are tragedies played out on the last piece of ground (the souls of a few people), which was left to a deeply fragmented humanity striving to express its most crucial realization, the realization that it is in danger of losing everything.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Car c'est vraiment, Seigneur, le meilleur témoignage<br>Que nous puissons donner de notre dignité . . .</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Eliot's poetry is not obscure, in the sense that one would characterize that of Lycofron.<a name="fs4-text" href="#fs4"><sup>4</sup></a> On the contrary, one of its salient characteristics is an extreme clarity in the details. There is nothing fleeting about its images, no dimness around the feelings it expresses. The means of his expression are always direct and the objects in his scenery contoured with hard lines. Even where it could be difficult for one to transmit the sense of concreteness, he manages to communicate the resistive power of solid matter. The <span style="font-style:italic;">solidity of his dreams</span>, of the feeling of thirst in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, or of revulsion in the chorus, "Clear the air! Wash the wind! Clean the sky!" are striking examples. About the fog and the smoke, he will be able to say:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,<br>The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes . . .<br>Curled once around the house, and fell asleep.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Besides the way in which his poems hold together, which is primarily based not on logic but on the psychological or emotional coherence of his ideas and his images—things accepted by us and known to us even through the movies—the difficulty in understanding Eliot is mainly due to three hallmarks of his technique.</p>
<p>First: Eliot's poetry—which, in any case, was to end up in the theater—is not lyrical poetry, like that of Mallarmé or Valéry. It is not the "development of an exclamation." It is, essentially, dramatic poetry. And in those of his poems in which this would not become evident at first sight, such as the poem "Marina," we feel as though we have in front of us an excerpt from a drama, rather than a lyrical piece of writing.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>What seas what shores what grey rocks and what islands<br>What water lapping the bow<br>And scent of pine and the woodthrush singing through the fog<br>What images return<br>O my daughter.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">We have a stage before us. As Eliot notes with regard to Seneca, I would say about Eliot that his poems are dramas meant not to be performed in the theater, but to be recited by a narrator. Nonetheless, they are truly dramatic works. This becomes abundantly evident in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> or in "Difficulties of a Statesman," which is nothing other than a one-act play. Even his words—one can easily detect it—do not have that cohesion in the unfolding of the poem. They do not flow as a complete, harmonious entity, as is <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the case with lyrical poetry; instead, they contain within themselves a kind of purely theatrical energy. Consider the word, "unreal" in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, for example: if we were to follow its various appearances throughout the work, we would discern that it plays a specific role, that it is, I would say, a kind of code word between two characters. We heard it uttered in act one and it returns in the last act just before the disaster.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Jerusalem Athens Alexandria<br>
Vienna London<br>

			Unreal.</p></blockquote>
<p>I selected the less obvious example. The difficulty inherent in poetry of this kind is that behind the drama that seems to unfold, there is another drama unfolding, parallel to the first but on a deeper level. Here, I will opt for the easier example. In the bar scene of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, we encounter two women in conversation. The waiter announces that it is time for the bar to close for the night. The women part, bidding each other "good night." Nothing could have been more commonplace. And yet the atmosphere that has been created (this, too, a hallmark of Eliot's art) is so intense that when we hear the good night, we feel that something much more portentous is being implied, something like the sinking of a whole world into darkness. The same thing can be said of the cry, "mother," in "The Difficulties of a Statesman," a cry which is one of the most isolated utterances that I have ever chanced to hear. Thus, whereas the more remote meaning of the poem is unified and not at all blurred—blurriness always makes for bad literature—the partial meanings are never aimed at one and only one end. They are two-pronged: meanings which with one foot seem to be stepping in the immediate action we are witnessing, while with the other seem directed to a drama that is unfolding at a far deeper level of consciousness. And the double nature of these objectives is mutually complementary. While on the outside this duality seems to result in a gain in perspective—if my thought is not an exaggeration—it the deeper level it results in a gain in energy.</p>
<p>The second difficulty is a lesser one. It is to be ascribed to the poet's sense of history. For Eliot, history is not whatever has died, but whatever is still living. Living, present, contemporary. The reader is surprised finding Parker the telephone operator next to the Volscian commission, Mrs. Porter and Mr. Eugenides next to Tiresias or Phlebas the Phoenician. However, the same reader has Odysseus by his side, while he is reading Homer, without being surprised in the least, and when I say by his side I do not mean that he has "recourse to the past," but that Odysseus—if Homer endows him with any quality at all—is contemporary with the ocean liner that the reader sees through his window, and with himself.</p>
<p>Writing about Dante, who "has made to fit in real men, his contemporaries, friends, and enemies, recent historical personages, legendary and Biblical res, and res of ancient fiction," Eliot notes that "these, as well as Ulysses, are transformed in the whole; for the real and unreal are all representative of types of sin, suffering, fault, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and merit, and all become the same reality, and contemporary." Eliot's characters are radically changed, as well, and they are contemporary. We will understand this when we get away from analyses, which, no matter how useful, are most useful when one forgets them altogether in order to return to the work itself, and when we accept that the poem is not an assemblage of segments—we always sectionalize it arbitrarily—but rather an organic whole in which constituent elements of both the external and the internal world have been used, and where those elements in confluence are never more as they <span style="font-style:italic;">used to be</span>. They are changed precisely due to the nature of the poem.</p>
<p>The third singularity of Eliot is also connected with his sense of history. It is a matter of the interpolations, or of the paraphrases, from foreign texts one comes across in almost all his poems. Commenting on <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, I note that a paraphrased verse of Dante leads the reader to an emotional and mental landscape different from, but complementary to, the emotional and mental world of the original poem. And in both his earlier and in his later works, Eliot made use of this kind of transplantation, but never—and that is precisely why I am citing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> as an example—to such an extent or with such nakedness. In order for one to completely understand this work, one must have a knowledge of the entire poetic corpus, beginning with Sappho, and simultaneously to include in his perusal six or seven different languages. Such a load of references would be enough, as a critic once said, to sink any poem ever written. Nonetheless, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> did not sink, and that shows how difficult it is for one to pinpoint the essential elements of poetry. Today, we can maintain that <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> reaches the limits of technique. But we should realize that the term "limit" is only valid until a new poem appears to modify our vista.</p>
<p>I for one find in this technical peculiarity a sense of solidarity, much more than a tendency towards hermitism. Eliot is not an isolated artist, but rather thoroughly within the tradition, as he himself molded it through his own selections. His dominant, his personal tone, carries along with it other voices as well, harmonized with it and colored through it, independent though these voices may remain. In one of his first and most significant critical essays, "Tradition and the Individual Talent," Eliot writes that "the historical sense compels a man to write not merely with his own generation in his bones, but with a feeling that the whole of the literature of Europe from Homer and within it the whole of the literature of his own country has a simultaneous existence and composes a simultaneous order." The poet must provide and must constantly develop the consciousness of the past as present and when that is the case, what results is "a continual surrender of himself as he is at the moment to something which is more valuable. The progress of an artist is a continual self-sacrifice, a continual extinction of personality." These pronouncements are related to the general question of how poetry functions, and it is not appropriate to examine this subject here. What is noteworthy, however, is that the thought that is expressed critically in the above paragraph finds an objective correlative in Eliot's poetic technique. Just like Tiresias, who is identified with all the characters in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, the poet identifies himself with the poets of the past who, for him, represent tradition. Borrowing from their personalities, on <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the one hand, he denies his own; while, on the other, he enriches it with a deeper perspective.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it seems to me that through this technique, Eliot tried to find in his time something that would play the role of mythology, be it even for a limited public. When myth was a shared experience, the poet had at his disposal a live carrier, a ready-made emotional atmosphere within which he could move freely in order to come near the people around him, an atmosphere in which he was able to express <span style="font-style:italic;">himself</span> sincerely. A single word, the skill of the craftsman notwithstanding, was able to awaken in souls an entire world beset by fears and brightened by hopes. We have nothing in our contemporary languages that might be equivalent in weight or in catholicity of application, or in emotional wealth, to the simple word "semnaiv" (pure, unsullied women) from the time of Aeschylus, or to the two words <span style="font-style:italic;">eterno dolore</span> (eternal suffering) from the time of Dante. I suppose that Eliot sought, above all, from the verses that he either translates or paraphrases, that they provide him with the common carrier which the psychological functioning of mythology offered to the poet in bygone times. This brings me to a more specific observation.</p>
<p>Referring to Shakespeare, he notes that the playwright gives the word a new meaning or extracts from it an esoteric meaning; again and again, the right image, replete with meaning at the depths of Shakespeare's memory, is revealed like Aphrodite from the waves. What gives intensity to a word or to an image is precisely that saturation, that thorough steeping with feelings which is accomplished in the deepest recesses of the poet's soul. And what happens with regard to the word, we can project with regard to verse: "<span style="font-style:italic;">le vers qui refait un mot neuf et comme incantatoire</span>" ("a verse that shapes a word anew and like an incantation"), as Mallarmé said. Verses, just like words, if they penetrate to the deepest recesses of our existence, create around them an emotional halo that transforms them in an altogether personal kind of expression, which is, for each of us, irreplaceable. Similarly and from yet another point of view, we could not say that the foreign words interwoven into Eliot's texts, though they may be distillments of other poets' verses, are foreign elements pure and simple. But I would be more inclined to say that they draw, through a kind of secondary gestation, a tone similar to the personal contribution of the poet and that they harmonize freely within the general atmosphere of his poems.</p>
<div class="sectionBreak">
<p>Eliot has been called a poet of decadence. I really do not know if such poets exist. I suppose there are good and bad poets, and there exist eras that are easier or more difficult for poetry. But if we accept that in the continuum of history, there are eras of highest achievement as well as of decadence, we should consider artists of decadent periods those whose works are somehow identified with their times and which present all the hallmarks of decline. And even that would not be entirely correct either because in each era it is not an entire world that is decadent, but a specific group of institutions and individuals. To put it more succinctly, I imagine that it is precisely a work that <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  could elicit the unanimous approval of those people and those institutions that should be dubbed a work of decadence. Thus, within the same era, works of entirely different character can coexist. The folk song is not a work of decadence, whereas a poem in ostentatious <span style="font-style:italic;">katharevousa</span>, composed at the same time, is.<a name="fs5-text" href="#fs5"><sup>5</sup></a> At a time of decadence, a poetry contest takes place to extol the beauty of the bald Queen Stratoniki's hair. The poet who wins the first prize in that contest is, to be sure, a poet of decadence—and that, only under certain circumstances. Be that as it may, it is difficult to classify in the same category the poet who suffers during such an era, who sees it in all its degradation and expresses it in such terms. The poet does not identify himself with the decadence of his era. He prepares the ground for a different tomorrow. That is how I see Eliot's poetry. Even though he began alone and remained "alone with the Only" (the quintessence of himself), in an era of isolation, he was able, by fitting together the smithereens that he found all around him, to give utterance to a "passion." And he expressed this "passion" by making poetry at a time when poetry was a frightfully difficult and desperate undertaking. This is the significance of his service. For beyond historical moments and local circumstances, what matters is that art was able to continue its eternal flow wherever the souls of humankind travel.</p>
<p>The era of doubt, of anxiety, and of isolation seems already to have given its place to the era of need. What the spirit will sprout from within the religious strife gestated by the "time of orthodoxy" which we are entering is "invisible to all except god."<a name="fs6-text" href="#fs6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">In Memoriam David Foster Wallace</h1>
<h2 class="sec-headB">By Steven Moore</h2>
<p>I knew him, Horatio. Not exactly a fellow of infinite jest—more Hamlet than Yorick, mild-mannered and self-deprecating rather than loud and merry—but an extremely decent human being, which made the shocking news of his suicide in September 2008 all the more painful. The greatest writer of his generation, yes, but I remember the gent who went easy on me the one time we played tennis together, gave much-needed advice on my orangutanic serve, and who politely asked to play full out before proceeding to blow me off the court.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>It was with sadness, shock, and a profound sense of loss that the journal learnt of the suicide of <span style="font-weight:bold;">David Foster Wallace</span>. Through his friends and admirers, we here provide a tribute to one of the great voices of contemporary America.</p></blockquote>
<p>His loss to contemporary fiction is devastating, because more successfully than anyone he demonstrated what the next stage after postmodernism might look like. Born in 1962, he came of age in the 1970s, the most ludicrous decade in the twentieth century except for the appearance in America of totemic postmodern masterpieces like Pynchon's <span style="font-style:italic;">Gravity's Rainbow</span>, Gaddis's <span style="font-style:italic;">J R</span>, Delany's <span style="font-style:italic;">Dhalgren</span>, Coover's <span style="font-style:italic;">Public Burning</span>, Barthelme's <span style="font-style:italic;">Dead Father</span>, Barth's <span style="font-style:italic;">LETTERS</span>, and Sorrentino's <span style="font-style:italic;">Mulligan Stew</span>. How does an ambitious young author follow <span style="font-style:italic;">that</span> parade? Certainly not by reviving Hemingwayesque understatement, as some writers in the 1980s did, and certainly not by merely imitating Pynchon et al. (Wallace was mortified when a reviewer of his first novel accused him of doing just that, because he had not even read any Pynchon at that point.) They had taken irony about as far as it could go—it was being co-opted by the culture at large anyway and was losing its bite—and these postmodernists pretty much exhausted the mine of classical literature, myth, and fables their <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  modernist forebears had used to structure their work. Besides, they appealed mainly to highly educated readers and were representative of high culture, which in the 1980s was becoming as obsolete as spats and top hats. So for an aspiring writer like Wallace, <span style="font-style:italic;">Quo vadis</span>? (as he asked in a special issue of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Review of Contemporary Fiction</span> I asked him to edit).</p>
<p>He could have written precious, experimental works published by small presses and enjoyed by a chosen few. For example, Janice Galloway's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Trick Is to Keep Breathing</span>  is a brilliant dramatization of one of Wallace's signature themes (depression), but its experimental format limited its audience. With his background in mathematics he would have excelled at the rule-based fictions generated by the OuLiPo group, and in all likelihood could have produced something like Georges Perec's <span style="font-style:italic;">Life A User's Manual</span> . Wallace's brilliant solution was to craft shiny new fiction that would attract the big New York publishers, appeal to a wide range of readers, yet display the kind of intellectual rigor and formal innovation that should make the cognoscenti think.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Post</span>-postmodernism could be as brainy as postmodernism but draw its materials from pop culture rather than (or in addition to) high culture. It could leave irony to older writers who still found it a potent weapon (Gaddis, Sorrentino) and revive the compassion readers once felt for characters in novels. It could explore a wider variety of formal approaches—short fictions made up of one half of an interview, a therapy session, a dictionary entry—in a wider variety of narrative voices. Wallace's two novels were literally forward-looking, both ostensibly set a dozen or so years in the future but dramatizing what we were likely to become if we continue living the way we do now. His superb nonfiction pieces built on the New Journalism of Wolfe and Thompson and added features from fiction and academic criticism. As Pound urged, he made it new.</p>
<p>His innovations and novelties were not mere showpieces but techniques applied to the somewhat old-fashioned purpose of making the reader <span style="font-style:italic;">feel</span>. After postmodernists and their critics demolished the grand narratives that had sustained Western culture for thousands of years, Wallace perfectly captured the disorientation, ennui, and bone-deep sadness of a generation not so much "incredulous toward metanarratives" (as Lyotard put it) as unaware there had ever been such a thing. He did it in meticulously crafted language that echoed and parodied the new lexicon of post-postmodernism, a kind of slacker mandarin (as I put it in my review of <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span>) made up of slang, fractured syntax, corporate-speak, advertising lingo, political blather, self-help bromides, and post-industrial tech-talk, as well as the barely literate mumblings of junkies, drunks, and the poor. The maniacal detail, the lexicographer's precision, the footnotes, the willingness to unfurl sentences to Proustian lengths—all this made him a lord of language who not only captured the way modern America <span style="font-style:italic;">sounds</span> in all its cacophony better than any of his contemporaries, but whose stylistic versatility is the equal of anyone in literature—Joyce, Rabelais, whoever.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this mastery of art and language was not enough to keep his personal demons at bay. Wallace wrote his suicide note a decade ago in the opening lines of one of his stories: "The depressed person was in terrible and unceasing pain, and the impossibility of sharing or articulating this pain was itself a component of the pain and a contributing factor in its essential horror." <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Like Hamlet, he had a fatal tendency to overthink everything. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince.</p>
<h2 class="sec-headB">By Dave Eggers</h2>
<p>Since Dave's passing I've been unable in any way to summarize his life. My sister took her own life eight years ago and I will say that I don't understand it any better now than I did then. So I hope to offer some comfort to all of you reading this collection of tributes by saying that if you haven't made peace with the way Dave Wallace left this world, you're not alone. And if it doesn't make sense now it may never make sense. But there is strange but enduring comfort, I think, in knowing a question has no answer.</p>
<p>In any case, we can brighten the corners of this dark house with our memories. So here are a few.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, I was going through some old boxes in storage and in the thick of one I saw the corner of an envelope, postmarked 1998, with the return address Rural Route 2, Box 361, Bloomington, IL. I uncovered it more to reveal the name on this address was David F. Wallace. It was on one of those pre-printed return-address labels you get free in the mail. There were two little Christmasy flowers in the corner.</p>
<p>I come from Illinois, and went to school in Champaign-Urbana, so it shouldn't have been so exotic to me, but this was the first time I'd seen "Rural Route" on any kind of address. It was fascinating then, thinking of this writer, already a giant back then in 1998, getting his mail at RR 2, Box 361. He must have kept that unimproveably prosaic address for 10 years. It seemed then and has always proven a testament to, for lack of a better word, Dave Wallace's unshakeable realness.</p>
<p>The envelope was empty, but I remember that inside had been a check he'd sent to <span style="font-style:italic;">McSweeney's</span>. I had written to him before the magazine's first issue, asking for any unpublished material he might have, and he sent us not only a story, but a check, too. It was our first donation. I know he did this for many other small magazines, too—he sent them work even before they published their first issue, and he sent them money, too. He was a true and egalitarian booster of the printed word, on every scale.</p>
<p>I never did get to know Dave all that well. We were professional friends, you'd have to say, and most of our contact was through the U.S. postal service. Usually I would write to him asking for help or advice, and he would promptly provide, in 7-point-type, help and advice. It was only in the last few years that we exchanged a few emails. And after his passing I couldn't remember his email address. I wanted to reread anything he had written but he had one of those addresses that wasn't simple, like <a href="mailto:DaveWallace@pomona.com">DaveWallace@pomona.com</a>. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>And just a few days ago, I was searching through my back email for an unrelated message, and I typed the letters "cap" in my search function. And I came upon the email address "<a href="mailto:ocapmycap@comcast.com">ocapmycap@comcast.com</a>." I opened the email and realized it was from Dave Wallace.</p>
<p>His email was a perfect microcosm of everything we loved about the man. It begins like this:</p>
<p>"I am ting with my dog as I write this. His teeth are in my knee. He just has these spells. Hang on … OK that wasn't pretty, but I won. Again."</p>
<p>In the email, he was granting my high school students permission to reprint his beautiful commencement address at Kenyon College, he was insisting on receiving no payment for the rights, and he was looking forward to a week or so in Capri, where he would be making a rare appearance at a literary festival. "If you'll be anywhere near Naples at the end of the month," he wrote, "you should jet ski over or something."</p>
<p>Back to the email address. People of our generation might know the reference in the email address best from <span style="font-style:italic;">Dead Poets Society</span>. In that movie, a cherished and inspirational teacher has to leave his students unexpectedly but permanently. In protest of his premature departure, his students stand on their desks and yell "Oh Captain my captain!"</p>
<p>It's the title of a poem by Walt Whitman. <span style="font-style:italic;">O Captain! My Captain!</span> was written after the death of Abraham Lincoln, and though much of it is too morbid to reprint in this context, there are a few lines, cobbled together below, that seem appropriate to the place we find ourselves—missing David Wallace, another great man from Illinois, a man of great and abiding decency who taught many so much.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>O CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,<br>The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,<br>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;<br>Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,<br>For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,<br>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,<br>From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won … <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>
</blockquote>
<h1 class="sec-headA">In Memoriam</h1>
<p>By Kathleen Fitzpatrick</p>
<p>I spent several days after getting the news trying to process my grief over the loss of my colleague Dave Wallace, trying to imagine saying something even remotely significant about it. The phrase "words fail me" had never seemed quite so appropriate; the thing that I felt those days—and still feel—felt quite literally impossible to say.</p>
<p>But I wanted to try, if for no other reason than that I felt I owed it to him: so much of his life was devoted to trying to find ways to say the unsayable, to communicate a pain that simply cannot be communicated, to find a way inside something that won't let you in, and to share what's in there with the outside when the in-there won't let you out.</p>
<p>Dave was, in multiple ways, my culture hero—the single person whose creative work meant more to me than any other. His writing, both the fiction and the essays, represented for me the first really successful attempt to meld the pyrotechnic postmodern gamesmanship that I adored with something more—something real, heartfelt, and vitally important—something, if you'll forgive the truism, deeply human. This is what I was attempting to convey to the reporter from the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> who wrote the first obituary they published: that while his work got described as ironic, it never used irony as a self-protective gesture, a mode of maintaining a pose of disaffection or distance from genuine emotions. Rather, his writing was always brave enough to wallow in the muck of real human life, with all its ugliness and pain. And it's that bravery that made his work stand out for me—while his work had all the stylistic panache and uproarious humor and analytical savvy of the best of postmodern fiction, it also taught me, in a way that the work of no other postmodernist ever could, something about what it is to live.</p>
<p>I developed an unbelievably sappy intellectual crush on Dave when I was working on my dissertation, the project that later turned into <span style="font-style:italic;">The Anxiety of Obsolescence</span>, when one of my friends handed me a copy of "E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction." Though I disagreed with (and still do) his reading of the Most Photographed Barn in America scene in <span style="font-style:italic;">White Noise</span>, the essay struck me then, and still strikes me now, as being exactly right—that if there is a danger presented to contemporary novelists by television, it has nothing to do with the usual fears of couch-potatodom and the disappearance of the reading public. Instead, it's the distance that some modes of television work to create between people and their emotions, a hip, knowing, safe ironic distance that allows us to watch and sneer at the same time. Dave understood this kind of distance to be corrosive to the project of fiction writing, and said at the close of that essay that</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The next real literary "rebels" in this country might well emerge as some weird bunch of "anti-rebels," born oglers who dare to back away from ironic watching, who have the childish gall actually to endorse single-entendre values. Who treat old untrendy human troubles and emotions in U.S. life with reverence and conviction.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">And this, for me, was the genius of Dave's work—and the genius of his life at Pomona. His commitment to his students here was entirely composed of those single-entendre <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  values, a determination to really know them, to treat them as actual people whose struggles were every bit as real as his own. But he also had the respect for them that led him to refuse them the easy way out, to forbid any laziness in their expression, to force them to wrestle with their sentences with the same ferocity that he did.</p>
<p>Dave was my hero, and I had for six years the unimaginable privilege of working with him. In the English department's meeting, back in 2000, during which we first discussed our desires for the new endowed chair we'd been given, I tentatively floated the idea that the kind of writer I most wanted us to hire was someone like David Foster Wallace—someone in the midst of a formidable career, someone with a range of writing that would clearly translate into a range of teaching that would enrich the life of the department and the lives of our students.</p>
<p>Sometimes the universe hears your wishes, however briefly.</p>
<p>But during these six years, I never told Dave what his work meant to me, primarily out of the certainty that it would have pained him far more to hear it than not. As I wrote on my blog several years back, a significant percentage of my collegial relationship with Dave was founded on not-saying, on the polite fiction that, for instance, he didn't know I was teaching his work, and that I didn't know that he knew, a fiction necessary for both of us to avoid being mired in a kind of useless, paralytic self-consciousness.</p>
<p>I wish now that that hadn't been so, but it was. I wish we were going to get the chance to finish the conversation we'd started about <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wire</span>. I wish that he were going to be able to help the department think through the transformations it'll be undergoing in the next few years. I wish that I were going to be able to work with many, many more students over the years who've been transformed by his classes. And I wish, utterly selfishly, that I were going to get the opportunity to read more of his work for the first time.</p>
<p>But I'm grateful for having had the privilege of those conversations, those students, that collegiality, and that work for as long as I did. And I've been grateful to see, over the weeks since, the enormity of the response to his death—the sheer number of lives that his work not only touched but changed. The evidence—as if it were needed—that the unflinching courage that meant so much to me meant that much to others as well. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">A Gesture Toward Understanding David Foster Wallace</h1>
<p>By Marshall Boswell</p>
<p>The title of my book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Understanding David Foster Wallace</span>, was not my title. The title was preordained by the conventions of the University of South Carolina Press's Understanding Contemporary American Literature series, of which my book is a part. I do not presume to understand David Foster Wallace at all. I can only make gestures toward understanding his fiction, using the tools of literary interpretation as I have ineptly mastered them. A better, more precise title might be, "A Guarded and by No Means Complete Attempt to Understand and Interpret David Foster Wallace's Fiction to Date, with Particular Attention Paid to Positioning that Fiction Within the Context of Post-War Experimental Fiction of High Distinction," a title which, of course, sounds like an essay by David Foster Wallace, whom I never met. We did have a brief correspondence, however, which I cherish. As I approached the end of my book, I realized I still had some holes in my research, and so wrote him an embarrassed letter asking if he would be willing to answer a few questions regarding his biography and his work. Rather than write me back, Wallace returned my original letter with his answers included as handwritten footnotes scrawled in fat red felt-tip ink. At least once a year, a student of mine will pick up <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span>, become utterly obsessed, and show up, sleep-deprived, in my office, looking less for guidance than for a fellow traveler in Wallace's intricate grottoes. My rule of thumb is that any student who makes it past page 550 in the novel gets to see the letter. The phrase "a sense of wonder" fairly describes what many of those students experience when they look at the gray piece of Rhodes College letterhead and take in the fact that the sloppy and utterly unprepossessing handwriting they're looking at belongs to the man who wrote the book that is indelibly transforming the way they view the world.</p>
<p>I originally planned to write no such letter. I did not want to bother David Foster Wallace with my book, because it wasn't about him at all. Years earlier I had written an obsessive dissertation on John Updike's "Rabbit" novels and, as I neared the final draft, my dissertation advisor urged me to write Updike directly to request an interview of no more than an hour or two, the transcript of which I would include as an appendix. I did as I was told, and Updike wrote me back an angry dismissal—"You must think I have nothing else to do" was the key phrase, as I recall—yet he also added something at the end of that note that has remained with me still. "In general," Updike concluded, "I think scholarly workers should treat me as if I were purely a research, and not an interview, subject." He's right, of course. For although Wallace was much more gracious in his reply to my even more tentative request for information from the author of the work I was studying, he was nevertheless equally reluctant to turn himself into the subject of my book. It's about the fiction, was the message he cagily tried to impart. The fiction is for <span style="font-style:italic;">you</span> to read and make sense of. It's not about me at all.</p>
<p>In his moving eulogy to Wallace published in the 21 September 2008 edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times Book Review</span>, A. O. Scott eloquently describes Wallace's distinctive literary voice as "the voice in your own head." Scott is absolutely correct, of course, but in a very technical sense that bears exploring. As <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span> reaches its shattering <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  conclusion, Don Gately is found mute and supine on his back, in tremendous pain, and heroically refusing any form of pharmacological relief. Soon, Gately's interior is visited by a spectral conversational "wraith" who listens to Gately's thoughts, occasionally pushes up his glasses, and replies back in a voice that is partly his own and partly Gately's. "The wraith," Wallace writes, "could empathize totally." What's more, the "wraith could move at the speed of quanta and be anywhere anytime and hear in symphonic toto the thoughts of animate men, but it couldn't ordinarily affect anybody or anything solid, and it could never speak right to anybody, a wraith had no out-loud voice of its own, and had to use somebody's like internal brain-voice if it wanted to try to communicate something, which was why thoughts and insights that were coming from some wraith always just sound like your own thoughts, from inside your own head, if a wraith's trying to interface with you." That's on page 831, if you missed it first time around. My point is that the wraith is, in many respects, the personification of Wallace's literary voice. It is a concrete analogue for Wallace's trace presence in his own texts. Not to be confused with Wallace the man. <span style="font-style:italic;">Emphatically</span> not to be confused with Wallace the man.</p>
<p>In "Self-Reliance," Emerson declares, "In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty." As is typical with his work, Wallace takes that Emersonian formulation and turns it on its head. For if our own thinking is indeed his work's primary target—and one should recall here Wallace's key artistic doppelgänger, the stalled writer and archery champion Mark Nechtr from "Westward the Course of Empire Takes Its Way" in <span style="font-style:italic;">Girl with Curious Hair</span>—then the moral purpose of that work is to save us from our majestic alienation. What makes Wallace's fiction so important and formative in the ongoing sweep of postwar literary history is the extraordinarily resourceful and original way it goes about achieving this paradoxical end. As I point out at probably too much length in my book, it achieves this end by using postmodernist self-reflexivity and poststructuralist textuality against itself. If, as Wallace concedes, there is no way from the text to the world outside the text—that is, if the literary text is always already an alienated, self-referencing artifact—then what is required is a narrative method that will invoke certain cherished emotions—kindness, empathy, wonder, love—in such a way that they remain in the world, rather than in the text itself. And the world outside Wallace's books is always the reader's interior. Hence Wallace's work is not simply hyper-self-aware. It is also self-aware about its own self-awareness, and self-aware about <span style="font-style:italic;">that</span> double self-awareness, etcetera etcetera ad infinitum. And as the layers of self-awareness replicate, what emerges as a by-product of this endlessly enfoliating self-consciousness is precisely what the work refuses to subject to its own relentless intellectual analysis—namely, those "single entendre principles" he speaks of in "E Unibus Pluram," or what Hal Incandenza calls "gooey sentiment." And because these "single entendre principles" are <span style="font-style:italic;">felt</span> by the reader rather than articulated by the writer, they remain vital and alive.</p>
<p>That residue feeling of empathetic connection is what the Wallace wraith in our heads offers us when we read his work. Nothing accidental about it, at all. As he told Larry McCaffery back in 1993, "This is the way Barthian and Derridean post-structuralism's <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  helped me the most as a fiction writer: once I'm done with the thing, I'm basically dead, and probably the text's dead; it becomes simply language, and language lives not just in but 'through' the reader." I cannot begin to imagine the misery the real David Foster Wallace must have experienced when he took his life, but I know that puncture of pain I feel when I think of that misery is in many ways more acute because my own alienated self has been punctured, opened, and made more empathetic to the pain of others as a direct result of David Foster Wallace's texts coming to life through me, as a reader. That was true before 12 September 2008, and it is no less true now. If you don't believe me, put down this journal and go read something of his—a story, a cherished chunk of <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span>, one of the essays. You'll see what I mean. The Wallace wraith is alive and well in those books, ready to push his glasses up his nose and listen to you read your own thoughts even as he speaks to you in your own voice. That is the buried treasure that lies at the innermost interior of Wallace's best work. It his selfless gift to us, his readers. The only thing that has changed is that the gift is now more precious than ever.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Everything No More</h1>
<p>By Michael North</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Everything and More: A Compact History of</span> 8 is almost certainly the least read of David Foster Wallace's seven books. Though it seems to have sold well enough when it was published in 2003, the reviews, even those determined to be kind, were cruel, and it has not been discussed much in the articles and obituaries following his recent death. Nonetheless, <span style="font-style:italic;">Everything and More</span> has an obvious claim on the attention of anyone interested in Wallace and his work, all the more so now that it has retrospectively become his last full-length book.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Everything and More</span> was the second in a series that assigned contemporary writers, mostly novelists, to write about important scientific discoveries. The discovery in this case is apparently the transfinite mathematics of Georg Cantor, but the first 236 pages of this 319 page book are taken up with an elaborate history of mathematical analysis before Cantor, in which the lack of "a coherent theory of ∞" is the central obstacle to be overcome.<a name="f1a-text" href="#f1a"><sup>1</sup></a> Though Wallace lightheartedly accepts the label "pop science" for this work, which he insists on calling a "booklet" even though it is a dense and substantial book, he doesn't actually seem very comfortable with the compromises entailed by the genre. In fact, Wallace's own plight as an author without much authority leading a sub-competent audience is such an overt feature of this book that one is forced to wonder why he accepted the assignment. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>One answer that Wallace offers himself is that he finds the math beautiful. By this he means that it is clear, precise, and bound by obvious rules, and in this he confesses that there is a certain kind of ethical interest behind his work. But transfinite math also has an obvious transcendental quality that raises this ethical interest very nearly to the point at which it would become religious. For Wallace, Cantor's heroism consists in bringing order and precision to the very largest and most unbounded of all abstractions, infinity, without reducing it one iota in size. Unlike Alain Badiou, who has based his expansive philosophical project on the axiomatic set theory that follows Cantor, Wallace does very little to apply this math to anything outside the world of numbers, and yet the relevance of it to his own work at least is obvious. <span style="font-style:italic;">Everything and More</span> is really Wallace's second book about infinity and as such it seems to offer a very useful perspective on its predecessor, <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span>, and thus on Wallace's place in the history of modern fiction.</p>
<p>The two books actually touch at a single point, the word "diagnate," which is used in <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span> to describe the beauty of tennis.<a name="f2a-text" href="#f2a"><sup>2</sup></a> Apparently Wallace's own coinage, "diagnate" gestures toward Cantor's diagonal method, an ingenious numerical proof by which he is able to show that there must be a set of numbers larger than that of the natural numbers and therefore uncountable. In one way, Cantor extends infinity itself by showing that there is always a larger number set, for any infinite set we might want to try. In another way, he makes it possible to deal with infinity, to work with it, as it were, to compute and compare what might otherwise seem unimaginably abstract quantities. For Wallace, as coincidentally for Badiou, Cantor's math helps to make infinity thinkable and thus to reduce the intellectual and ethical paralysis it can induce. That there are infinite points of view, for example, need not mean that assertion is impossible. That time and art both go on apparently forever does not necessarily mean that we have no choice but simply to suffer their variations. Insofar as it is a history of attempts to get a handle on infinity, <span style="font-style:italic;">Everything and More</span> is more than just a belated philosophical introduction to <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span>; it is also a heavyweight attack on the problems left by postmodernism, and a precise indication of where and how Wallace's concerns diverge from those of his predecessors.</p>
<p>Despite Wallace's vociferous insistence on the math itself, there is also a personal side to this jousting with infinity, one that seems more obvious now that Wallace's suicide has called into question the title of <span style="font-style:italic;">Everything and More</span>. A fair number of the early pages of this book are devoted to the familiar topic of Zeno's paradoxes, those popular mindbenders that show, for instance, that it's impossible to cross the street because you must first cover half the distance, and then half of the remainder, and then half of that, and so on. The goal of mathematical analysis, in Wallace's account, is to conquer the mental paralysis caused by these paradoxes. The language itself often shows how much is at stake: the relation between Weierstrass's infinitesimals and Zeno's paradoxes is compared at one point to that between "chemo and cancer" (<span style="font-style:italic;">E</span>, 144). In purely mathematical terms, Zeno represents a bad infinity, unbounded and thus overwhelming. In the somewhat larger terms that Wallace slips into his account from time to time, Zeno represents "the crevasse of self-reference" (<span style="font-style:italic;">E</span>, 276), and it is significant how different his feelings are about the infinite regress that used to bring such joy to <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  experimental fiction. This opposition is based on principle and not on mere feeling, but it is also impossible to miss the feeling, because Wallace continually interrupts his account with personal asides, illustrative anecdotes, in which the paralysis caused by Zeno's paradoxes, that sense of infinite finitude, leads to an actual inability to cross the street, or even to get out of bed. Zeno's bad infinity, in other words, becomes a re for depression.</p>
<p>In an extra-mathematical sense, then, <span style="font-style:italic;">Everything and More</span> is about humankind's attempts to think its way out of the dead-end of introspective thought, which may be one reason why Cantor's mental illness is such a radioactive topic for Wallace that Cantor himself almost disappears from the book. In Wallace's account, the irony of that story is decisively separated from the triumphs of transfinite mathematics. Though Cantor dies in confinement, math itself "continues to get out of bed" (<span style="font-style:italic;">E</span>, 305). And yet this irony is not really suppressed but returns at the level of style. Organizationally, <span style="font-style:italic;">Everything and More</span> is quintessential Wallace, which is to say that it is digressive in the extreme. There are, of course, footnotes, 408 of them to be exact. In addition, there are numerous sections marked IYI, for If You're Interested. These are supposedly optional, but there are gradations, so that some are semi-IYI and some really necessary to the argument. There are also various interpolations, marked and titled as such, some emergency glossaries, and a number of minor "time-jumps" and "hiccups" that involve fast-forwarding or rewinding the narrative.</p>
<p>Part of what Wallace is trying to accomplish with all this paraphernalia is to gesture toward the actual complexity of matters that he cannot fully explain. The involutions, repetitions, digressions, qualifications, and so on that make up the text build up a stylistic ration of infinity itself. In some sense, it seems there is a calculated paradox here, one also operative in some of Wallace's other prose writings, whereby the desire to be clear and precise generates a structure that is dizzying in its complexity. In Wallace's work, this paradox is not meant to carry the usual corrosive irony but rather to function as a real demonstration of how hard it is to work toward the truth. The organization demonstrates the sweat-inducing difficulty of making a finite text stretch over an infinite and infinitely variable reality.</p>
<p>Even so, it is hard to miss the resemblance between Wallace's ever-proliferating, endlessly self-qualifying style and the very paradoxes he has set out to confute. As a concept, infinity has a certain appeal to the Buzz Lightyear in all of us, an appeal that Wallace exploits in the title of his book, which suggests an extensiveness that always opens up another vista beyond itself. In its style, though, <span style="font-style:italic;">Everything and More</span> shows how brutally that concept, or any concept for that matter, returns thought to its own first bases. What starts in the desire to transcend the personal limits of thought ends up tunneling deeper and deeper into them, simply because thought is the only mechanism that can work on itself. The infinity thus opened up is an intensive one, getting smaller and smaller, the endlessness of which looks a lot like stasis.</p>
<p>At its best, Wallace's work pursues the infinite in both directions, endlessly extending itself and endlessly tunneling into itself at the same time, and what it wants to show in this way is that the intensive infinity to be found within the process of introspection, of writing and reflection itself, is every bit as large as the one we imagine at <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the ends of the cosmos. What makes rereading <span style="font-style:italic;">Everything and More</span> at this point a sobering task is the hints it now seems to contain that for Wallace believing this was not enough, that the ability of mathematics to "get out of bed," which is after all the ability of thought itself to get out of bed, did not help him in the end. At some point, for writers, for readers, for everybody, there isn't any more anymore. It's at this point, trying to balance infinite promise against the fact of finitude, that it becomes almost impossible to do the math.</p>

<span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span> and the Twentieth Century: David Foster Wallace's Legacy</h1>
<p>By Stephen J. Burn</p>
<p>David Foster Wallace's fiction is full of ghosts who have fallen out of time. In "Good Old Neon" , a character returns from death to tell the reader how "I kill myself" and reveal "what happens immediately after a person dies." The secret he reveals is that the "one-after-the-other temporal ordering" of life ceases after death.<a name="f1b-text" href="#f1b"><sup>1</sup></a> In <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span> , the shade of another suicide stalks the novel's dark night and explains that "death was just everything outside you getting really slow."<a name="f2b-text" href="#f2b"><sup>2</sup></a> The frequency with which ghosts haunt these books tells us something about Wallace's belief in a temporal economy, and, in fact, the way time is trisected into past, present, and future provided one of Wallace's great themes. Whatever counterfactuality characterizes the world of Wallace's novels comes from the deflecting of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Broom of the System</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span>'s chronologies into the near future, but the larger architecture of the books—and the core of Wallace's explorations—always hinged upon the continuity of time past into time future. Wallace's ghosts represent the culmination of this exploration. The dead speak to us, these ghost-haunted novels insist. They continue to shape our thoughts and actions. As if fulfilling a grim prophecy, on 12 September, Wallace ended his journey through time and ensured that he would now only speak to us through his work from beyond the grave.</p>
<p>The body of work that Wallace leaves behind him is remarkably eclectic. Ranging from transfinite mathematics through radically concise short fiction to encyclopedic excess, his books bespeak both an intellectual restlessness and a versatility that is unmatched by any other living writer. Equally remarkable is the extent of his influence. Despite only publishing two novels, the imprint of Wallace's fiction nevertheless circulates through the bloodstream of American fiction. As genealogies of the end of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  postmodernism begin to be written, this influence is likely to rest upon his dialogue with self-referential postmodernism—especially as explored in his essay, "E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction," and stories such as "Westward the Course of Empire Takes its Way" and "Octet"—as well as upon the virtuoso performance of <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span>. A 1079-page journey into the maelstrom of the modern self, <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span> will continue to speak to readers because of the strength and invention of its sentences, because of its extravagant humor, and because of the secrets it keeps.</p>
<p>But in trying to estimate the significance of Wallace's work, I would like to consider <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span>'s importance in relation to its ancestor texts: the encyclopedic novels of modernism and postmodernism. Much of this investigation hinges on exploring affinities or highlighting Wallace's technical innovations. But fundamentally, this is an effort to try to bring into focus the way that intertextual allusion represents a mode of communication in Wallace's work. In June 1992, Wallace wrote to novelist Don DeLillo for the first time, telling him that "a lot of your voices and constructions … hang around in my head and get mixed up with other experiences and ideas and voices." When Wallace didn't deliberately excise DeLillo's influence, he said the allusions represented "the sincerest form of compliment I'm capable of."<a name="f3b-text" href="#f3b"><sup>3</sup></a> Despite the indelible originality of much of Wallace's work, the way he encoded allusive "compliments" into his work is a critical element of the legacy he leaves to the encyclopedic novel.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span> is a coordinate in late-twentieth-century literary history where encyclopedic modernism and postmodernism converge to look forward to what the novel calls the "'post-post'-modern" (<span style="font-style:italic;">IJ</span>, 142). The novel represents a culmination of reading and theorizing about contemporary fiction, and many of the signposts along that journey seem to have been written into Wallace's work during the period. Throughout the first half of the 1990s, Wallace seemed to be drawn to the imaginative potential of revisiting modernism in general, and James Joyce's work in particular. In his 1991 fiction, "Order and Flux in Northampton," for instance, Wallace focused in part upon a doctoral candidate writing "an exhaustive study of Stephen Dedalus's sublimated oedipal necrophilia vis à vis Mrs. D. in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>."<a name="f4b-text" href="#f4b"><sup>4</sup></a> Appropriately enough, the story features a "Reproduction Technician" ("Order," 91), and as the plot incidents circle around the day before Bloomsday, the story reproduces <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>'s parallactic shifts and incorporates allusions to "Oxen of the Sun" before engineering a multiple climax modeled upon "Wandering Rocks." The pattern of "Wandering Rocks"—where the movements of multiple characters within a limited geographic grid either intersect or come close to intersecting—also provides the template for <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span>, though the novel's architecture seems calculated to highlight multiple parallels to <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>.</p>
<p>As the title of <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span> indicates, Wallace's novel shares with <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> a desire to rework the outlines of <span style="font-style:italic;">Hamlet</span>, and it also uses its scalar shifts to suggest larger mythical resonances to its action. Like Joyce's punning "met him pike hoses," Wallace's character "Madame Psychosis" provides one of the hints that <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span> should be read in terms of the mythic parallels it establishes, as characters unwittingly recast Greek myths or re-enact the festivals of the dead recorded by Sir James Frazer in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Bough</span> (1890–1922). The movement between characters also suggests the Joycean example. For all its "Wandering Rocks"-style dispersion, <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span> is essentially organized <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  around two overarching narratives that balance a youthful prodigy who has problematic relations with his father, opposite an older man who is less educated but more humane. In both books, the author begins by showcasing the prodigy but ultimately moves toward the older re, leaving at the book's end the young man isolated in the loneliness of his own talent.</p>
<p>The engine of the novel, then, seems designed to pay homage to the Joycean template, and Wallace makes his heritage explicit—twice repeating Mulligan's famous compound "scrotum-tightening" (<span style="font-style:italic;">IJ</span>, 112, 605); professing an interest in "telemachry" (<span style="font-style:italic;">IJ</span>, 249); and setting a tall, sometime-alcoholic ghost named James to shape the words his characters use. These calculated parallels and allusions are part of Wallace's attempt to imprint his novelistic genealogy into his novel, but the affinities between Joyce and Wallace cannot be contained in a simple list of overlaps. The two connect on a deeper level in terms of their approach to language. Like Joyce, Wallace seemed to have had a prose range that could move elastically between different registers. On one level Wallace thrived on opportunities to pinpoint the sensuous immediacy of quotidian experience. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span>, he takes evident delight in mimicking the sound of a Seven-Up can being opened ("SPFFFT") and then gulped down by a greedy eleven-year old ("SHULGSHULGSPAHHH") (<span style="font-style:italic;">IJ</span>, 28). Yet, on another level, Wallace's prose consistently reaches toward poetic qualities, stressing its aural aspect. In "Order and Flux," for instance, a list-like sentence alliteratively describes "the tender meat of red toes, the toes taking turns at self-harm, swelling, shining" ("Order," 98). Elsewhere in the same story, he moves through a long series of o-sounds, before running together paired e's and a's: "the reverend f<span style="font-style:italic;">o</span>ret<span style="font-style:italic;">o</span>ld the w<span style="font-style:italic;">o</span>rld's c<span style="font-style:italic;">o</span>ld and imminent end," noting "am<span style="font-style:italic;">o</span>ng <span style="font-style:italic;">o</span>ther p<span style="font-style:italic;">o</span>rtents: p<span style="font-style:italic;">oo</span>r nutriti<span style="font-style:italic;">o</span>n and its attendant m<span style="font-style:italic;">o</span>ral and d<span style="font-style:italic;">e</span>nt<span style="font-style:italic;">a</span>l d<span style="font-style:italic;">e</span>c<span style="font-style:italic;">a</span>y" ("Order," 94). While critics have made much of Wallace's tentacular sentences and vertiginous vocabulary, the rhythmic pulse of his writing deserves wider appreciation as critics assess the total body of his work.</p>
<p>Allusions to Joyce are palpable in the later work, too. One of the questions rehearsed by <span style="font-style:italic;">Oblivion</span>'s "The Suffering Channel," for instance, is effectively the question posed by Stephen as he outlines his esthetic theory near the end of <span style="font-style:italic;">Portrait of the Artist: "Can excrement … be a work of art? If not, why not?</span>"<a name="f5b-text" href="#f5b"><sup>5</sup></a> But the form of <span style="font-style:italic;">Portrait</span> also points toward <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span>'s dialogue with postmodernism. Joyce's first novel famously begins in the third person and ends in the first person, a perspectival shift calculated to amplify Stephen's emerging status as an individual. <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span> reverses this pattern. The novel's first word identifies a confident "I," calmly mapping the world around the narrator, but by the time the reader reaches the end of the novel proper (excluding footnotes), the narrative is filtered through a disorientated third-person lens. As if this drift away from the discrete individual isn't clear enough, the final endnote of the novel reads simply "Talwin-NX—¯Sanofi Winthrop U.S." (<span style="font-style:italic;">IJ</span>, 1079 n.388). Human agency is axed away as the novel remorselessly moves from the personal, to the impersonal, to the corporation.</p>
<p>Inverting Joyce, this trajectory recalls works such as William Gaddis's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Recognitions</span>  and Thomas Pynchon's <span style="font-style:italic;">Gravity's Rainbow</span> , novels that trace the eclipse of the individual in a postmodern world. Yet Wallace seems to have been deeply ambivalent <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  about the bandwith of the postmodern novel. He evidently revered DeLillo, and in 1992 planned to edit a special issue of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Review of Contemporary Fiction</span> on DeLillo that he hoped would include contributions by Jonathan Franzen, Richard Powers, Mark Leyner, William T. Vollmann, and Susan Daitch. Pynchon provoked more caution, and while Wallace admired <span style="font-style:italic;">Gravity's Rainbow</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Mason &amp; Dixon</span> , his estimate of <span style="font-style:italic;">Vineland</span>  was significantly less effusive. Without wanting to flatten the nuanced distinctions Wallace certainly made between different writers, at the core of his suspicion of postmodern fiction was his belief that—after metafictional techniques had been coopted by television—self-referring forms no longer served to remind the reader of a vital dialogue between author and reader. Instead, Wallace saw self-reflexivity as a mode of self-promotion that edged fiction toward solipsism. In "Octet" , he emphasizes this point, arguing that the supposed honesty of the metafictional author who is "respectful enough of you as reader/audience" to acknowledge "that he's back there pulling the strings" is in reality "an 'honesty' which personally you've always had the feeling is actually a highly rhetorical sham-honesty that's designed to get you to like him and approve of him."<a name="f6b-text" href="#f6b"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>These reservations about metafiction do not, of course, mean Wallace retreated to a naïve belief in language as a mirror of reality. Often he sought to employ metafictional techniques against themselves to break this narcissistic spiral. But the emphasis on fiction as a struggle to establish honest communication between reader and author that Wallace articulates in his critique of metafiction offers a good way to think about his allusive technique. William Gaddis—whose novels, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Recognitions</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">A Frolic of His Own</span> , were included on some of Wallace's syllabi—is worth considering here.</p>
<p>Gaddis is a pivotal re in the development of the encyclopedic novel across the twentieth century. Permeated by T. S. Eliot's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> , his first novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Recognitions</span>, forms a vital link between modernism and postmodernism, and, on a technical level, Wallace seems to have learned much from his example. Gaddis's fiction—especially his later fiction—is crafted from a kind of collage of different texts and voices, and relies on the narrative energy of its dialogue to drive the book forward. Taking modernist impersonality to a new level, for long stretches this dialogue is presented without the usual signposts of the realist novel—the "he" and "she saids"—providing Gaddis with a wonderfully economic technique where speech rapidly implies the stage directions (gesture, spatial relations, dress) traditionally offered by a laborious narrator, as in this scene from <span style="font-style:italic;">J R</span> :</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>—Oh you frightened me! what are you doing there …</p>
<p>—I was just, just making a call I …</p>
<p>—But why are you making it hiding back there? and what, what on earth are you wearing …<a name="f7b-text" href="#f7b"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">This technique is relevant to <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span> not just because Wallace regularly employs a similar approach to dialogue in his fiction. It is also significant because a variation Gaddis employs very rarely becomes central to Wallace's dialogue. On just a handful of occasions in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Recognitions</span>, Gaddis enters a blank line of dialogue to indicate the intrusion of something nonverbal—perhaps a look of incomprehension or distaste—into <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the verbal exchange. Near the end of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Recognitions</span>, for instance, Gaddis shows his diffident protagonist Wyatt (now called Stephan) in terse conversation with a forger:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>—You're not a bum.</p>
<p>—…</p>
<p>—Stephan.</p>
<p>—What?<a name="f8b-text" href="#f8b"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">In Gaddis's work this technique rarely appears in his novelistic toolkit. In Wallace's work it becomes much more central. Near the start of <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span>, Wallace shows two of the Incandenza brothers in conversation:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>"You're talking about since Himself passed away."</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>"See? You never say."</p>
<p>"I do too say. I just did."</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>"I just didn't happen to say what you wanted to hear, Booboo, is all."</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>"There's a difference."</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">IJ</span>, 40–41)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Sometimes Wallace even dramatizes moments where a supposed dialogue ends not with words, but with an exchange of loaded looks. Later in the novel Wallace shows two characters talking at a halfway house for recovering addicts:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>"Why are you even up, [you] don't have to work."</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">IJ</span>, 533)<a name="f9b-text" href="#f9b"><sup>9</sup></a>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">On one level, the relative abundance of blank dialogue in Wallace's fiction is indicative of how much more likely his characters are—in comparison to most fictional res—to respond physically to the verbal, or to look silently in disbelief at each other. Yet on a deeper level, this technique seems an extension and an amplification of his distrust of metafiction. If self-reflexivity abused the reader's trust in the service of a writer's self-indulgence, then Wallace's fiction tried to escape this solitary pleasure. The relationship between reader and writer is analogous to the relationship in dialogue between listener and speaker, and Wallace's dialogue strives to acknowledge and dramatize the role of the silent partner. It strives to empathetically register that through any monologue (or monograph) the listener/reader may be punctuating the performance with grimaces, puzzled looks, or smiles. In short, Wallace agonized over the writer's responsibility to effect something closer to a symbiotic relationship with the reader.</p>
<p>This provides another clue to Wallace's influence. These obsessive efforts to connect with the reader presumably helped shape Jonathan Franzen's essay, "Mr. Difficult" . Wallace and Franzen were close friends who communicated and argued about fiction throughout the 1990s, and the distinction in Franzen's essay—between "status" <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  writers, who strove to create historically-important "Art" without concern for the reader, and "contract" writers who wanted to establish a pleasure-filled compact with the reader—reads like a somewhat more populist version of Wallace's theorizing. But regardless of its impact on other writers, for Wallace, himself, this perhaps impossible struggle to inflect the imaginative space of a novel so that it establishes an authentic reciprocity between reader and writer turns out to be fundamentally connected to both the network of allusions and plot of <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span>.</p>
<p>While early estimates of <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span> criticized its length and erudition as an example of authorial self-indulgence—an excuse for Wallace to "show off his remarkable skills as a writer and empty the contents of his restless mind"—much of the tissue of allusion that lies over—and expands—Wallace's prose is linked to his desire to make writing a dialogue.<a name="f10b-text" href="#f10b"><sup>10</sup></a> That is, instead of operating centripetally, pointing inward to the gifted writer, the allusions function centrifugally, pointing outward to the world around the book. It is impossible to catalogue comprehensively the full spectrum of the novel's allusions here, but some of the dialogues instigated by the novel seem intensely personal, engaging, for instance, with the philosophical work of Wallace's father. The America that <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span> grew out of, Wallace told an interviewer, was one where "pleasure" had become "a value, a teleological end in itself." In a culture that Wallace saw as increasingly defined by the hedonistic horizons of television, he questioned "to what end, this pleasure-giving?"<a name="f11b-text" href="#f11b"><sup>11</sup></a> Yet in interrogating the ends that pleasure should lead to, Wallace engaged with philosophical questions that his father had mapped thirty years earlier. In "Pleasure as an End of Action" , James D. Wallace's argument intersects with numerous subjects that would be important to his son's novel—including Platonic philosophy, and the thought-patterns fostered by addiction—and the core of the essay concerns a relationship that is also close to the heart of <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span>: the relationship between freedom and desire. The elder Wallace's essay considers the act of neglecting "one's needs and obligations" in favor of pursuing pleasure for no end other than itself, as "paradigmatic of acting freely," and, of course, the movie at the heart of the novel dramatizes exactly this situation.<a name="f12b-text" href="#f12b"><sup>12</sup></a> The movie offers a pleasure so all-consuming that viewers lose "even basic survival-type will for anything other than more viewing" (<span style="font-style:italic;">IJ</span>, 507), and the opportunity to watch the film is defended by Hugh Steeply in the novel as one of the "hazards of being free" (<span style="font-style:italic;">IJ</span>, 320). But while the choice to watch or not to watch the movie seems to play out the father's paradigm of free acts, a further paternal dimension is added to <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span>'s investigation when Rémy Marathe counters Steeply's conception of freedom by asking: "How to choose any but a child's greedy choices if there is no loving-filled father to guide, inform, teach the person how to choose?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">IJ</span>, 320).</p>
<p>While Wallace's technique reaches outside the novel, the characters he dramatizes within <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span> enact a parallel quest. In the first monologue spoken by one of his central characters, Hal Incandenza insists, "I <span style="font-style:italic;">read</span> … I study and read … I do things like get in a taxi and say, 'The library, and step on it'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">IJ</span>, 12), and reading is an activity that an unusual number of his characters are involved in. But reading in Wallace's books is rarely a solipsistic activity. Wallace used strategically-deployed allusions to show how reading returns the reader to the world, by showing how solitary reading <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  alters the way his characters behave socially. When one of the novel's tennis coaches, Gerhardt Schtitt, argues against linear approaches to sporting success by exclaiming, "straight ahead! Plow ahead! Go! This is myth … they assume [in America] always the efficient way is to plow in straight" (<span style="font-style:italic;">IJ</span>, 80), his pronouncement makes more sense if the reader catches the allusion to DeLillo's novel <span style="font-style:italic;">End Zone</span> . In this book about football and nuclear terror, one of DeLillo's coaches, Tweego, builds a philosophy around thinking "in one direction, straight ahead."<a name="f13b-text" href="#f13b"><sup>13</sup></a> Schtitt—like several other characters in <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span>—seems to have read DeLillo's novel, and altered his beliefs on the basis of that reading.<a name="f14b-text" href="#f14b"><sup>14</sup></a> In a very similar fashion, when Hal's grandfather begins tennis coaching, his advice to a new player (Hal's father) is philosophical: "Son, you're a body, son. … those thoughts in your mind are just the sound of your head revving, and head is still just body, Jim. … Today, Lesson One out there, you become, for better or worse, Jim, a man. A player … A machine in the ghost, to quote a phrase" (<span style="font-style:italic;">IJ</span>, 159–60). As the mangled quote at the end of this lesson suggests, and as the insistence upon a physicalist explanation of consciousness confirms, Hal's grandfather has read Gilbert Ryle's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Concept of Mind</span> , where Ryle mocks Cartesian dualism as "the dogma of the Ghost in the Machine."<a name="f15b-text" href="#f15b"><sup>15</sup></a> Wallace is dramatizing how reading once more is the foundation of action.</p>
<p>Wallace was arguably the most intellectually-gifted American writer of his generation—I can think of only Richard Powers as his equal in terms of raw neural talent—and his prose range was unparalleled. Yet despite his virtuosity, his work consistently and passionately argues for symbiotic connection, rather than self-involved self-promotion. The learning and scale of <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span> offers an encyclopedic distillation of the twentieth century, but the book strives to use its erudite allusions to span outward from the novel—to trace Wallace's genealogy as a writer, to remind the reader of human connection, and to dramatize the way reading shapes behavior. Wallace's greatest bequest to the writers who come after him may lie in this systemic attempt to overcome the solipsism of metafiction. He reconceived the novel not as an isolated object, but as a node in a connectionist network, always striving to reach beyond itself.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Can We Say What We Mean?</h1>
<p>By Brendan Beirne</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Genius is not replicable. Inspiration, though, is contagious, and multiform—and even just to see, close up, power and aggression made vulnerable to beauty is to feel inspired and (in a fleeting, mortal way) reconciled.<a name="f1c-text" href="#f1c"><sup>1</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>One way to read the question posed in the title of this piece is as an elbow in the ribs to authors who would still indulge in postmodern metafictional hijinks at this date. Keith Cresser expressed the sentiment in his coda to the inaugural issue of the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">n+1</span> averring that "it is time to say what you mean." In the wake of September 11, 2001, such pronouncements that irony had finally run its course were everywhere. But it also asks, "<span style="font-style:italic;">can</span> we say what we mean?" Is such "straight talk" even possible? The difficulty, indeed the paradox, of saying what one means is delineated by the narrator of Wallace's story "Good Old Neon":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>that many of the most important impressions and thoughts in a person's life are ones that flash through your head so fast that <span style="font-style:italic;">fast</span> isn't even the right word, they seem totally different from or outside of the regular sequential clock time we all live by, and they have so little relation to the sort of linear, one-word-after-another-word English we all communicate with each other with that it could easily take a whole lifetime just to spell out the contents of one split-second's flash of thoughts and connection, etc.—and yet we all seem to go around trying to use English (or whatever language our native country happens to use, it goes without saying) to try to convey to other people what we're thinking and to find out what they're thinking, when in fact deep down everybody knows it's a charade and they're just going through the motions.<a name="f2c-text" href="#f2c"><sup>2</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>I have always been intrigued by the divergent responses that David Foster Wallace has provoked in his readers. On the one hand, Wallace enjoyed a level of notoriety <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  that few authors ever achieve—<span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span> recruited a sizeable if somewhat irregular army of acolytes, his essay collections were commercially successful, and many of the foremost young authors of our day looked to him as a sort of éminence grise. Throw in a trio of appearances on Charlie Rose, and his status as a "Major American Author" would seem beyond dispute. And yet Wallace's iconic status hasn't quite translated into much serious engagement with his work. Twelve years after the publication of his monumental masterpiece, it is still relatively uncommon to find Wallace devotees within the academy, for instance. I suspect that this will change in the coming years, but it is worth asking why Wallace inspires the fervent allegiance of so many readers while earning exasperated shrugs from so many others.</p>
<p>In a recent appraisal, Madison Smartt Bell expresses the ambivalence that many feel toward Wallace's fiction: "Everything he did was clearly brilliant, some of it was clearly charming, but some of it had an inhuman brilliance that may have cost him some readers …. It's all electricity and not much blood."<a name="f3c-text" href="#f3c"><sup>3</sup></a> Bell follows the standard formula here: first, tip your hat to Wallace's genius, then shake your head in regret that he didn't use his preternatural gifts to elucidate matters of the human heart. While I think it takes a misreading of some proportion to produce the notion that Wallace writes like a bloodless automaton, it is a common one.</p>
<p>Debunking this view is a task for another day, though. The really staggering irony here is that Wallace levels this very charge against his own literary milieu time and again. One might even argue that it is Wallace's central concern. Seeking an "explanation for our own lit's thematic poverty," he remarks that, "The big thing that makes Dostoevsky invaluable for American readers and writers is that he appears to possess degrees of passion, conviction, and engagement with deep moral issues that we—here, today—cannot or do not permit ourselves."<a name="f4c-text" href="#f4c"><sup>4</sup></a> This last phrase brings us back to the question posed in my title. Why is it, Wallace wants to know, that postmodern novelists seem largely indifferent to issues like love and loneliness, and tend only to approach them under the protective cloak of irony? And do their uses of recondite diction, fugal sentence structures, and metafictional plots betray an elitist disdain for the reader, sheer misanthropy, or both?</p>
<p>Wallace attempts an answer in his 1993 essay "E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction," a trenchant appraisal of the vexed interplay between technology and contemporary culture. The piece is something of a manifesto on why contemporary writers have become stuck in the rut of literary postmodernism, and how they might get out of it. At once engagingly precocious and deeply unnerving, "E Unibus Pluram" evinces an ambivalent disposition towards television akin to Sun-Tzu's dictum that you should "Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer" (though Wallace would surely credit <span style="font-style:italic;">The Godfather Part II</span> as the source of this koan-like conflation of paranoia and voyeurism). After an opening gambit that catalogues the alienating effects of television viewership ("Every lonely human I know watches way more than the average U.S. six hours per day") and the easy but ultimately vacuous—because fake (or rather, self-consciously fake)—opportunities for "espial" which it affords fiction writers, Wallace admits his only slightly-abashed affection for the medium: "Existentiovoyeuristic conundra notwithstanding, there's no denying the simple fact <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  that people in the U.S.A. watch so much television basically because it's fun. I know I watch for fun, most of the time …."<a name="f5c-text" href="#f5c"><sup>5</sup></a> Except that television fun, Wallace observes, mostly consists of opportunities to "make fun"—of the stilted dialogue, the absurd premises, the predictable plots, and, most of all, the poor saps who are taken in by the dog and pony shows that make up standard prime time fare. Mere seeing is shouldered aside by seeing-through. Thus Wallace holds that today's televisual encounters are, from the start, implicated in a metafictional hermeneutic that is constitutive of our relationship to television rather than truly responsive to it.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>… it may seem odd that so much of the pleasure my generation takes from television lies in making fun of it. But you have to remember that younger Americans grew up as much with people's disdain for TV as we did with TV itself …. It's fun, when a withered June Allyson comes on-screen for Depend Adult Undergarments and says "If you have a bladder-control problem, you're not alone," to hoot and shout back "Well chances are you're alone <span style="font-style:italic;">quite a bit</span>, June!</p>

<p class="continued">Many viewers, especially those of us who take serious fiction seriously, are consoled by the notion that such jeering from the bleachers bespeaks a healthy, even redemptive mistrust of television. Yet it is precisely this disdain for television which allows us to rationalize endless hours in front of the screen watching insipid shows that we know are insipid. Our skepticism, we think, inoculates us from the contagions that infect more credulous viewers.<a name="f6c-text" href="#f6c"><sup>6</sup></a> Wallace insists that we let ourselves off the hook too easily when we believe in the efficacy of ironic distancing. Just when we think we are having fun with television, it turns out that television is having fun with us:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>… television has become immune to charges that it lacks any meaningful connection to the world outside it. It's not that charges of nonconnection have become untrue but that they've become deeply irrelevant. It's that any such connection has become otiose. Television used to point beyond itself. Those of us born in, say, the '60s were trained by television to look where it pointed, usually at versions of "real life" made prettier, sweeter, livelier by succumbing to a product or temptation. Today's mega-Audience is way better trained, and TV has discarded what's not needed. A dog, if you point at something, will look only at your finger.</p>
<div class="attrib">("EUP," 33)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">This kind of image is a Wallace staple; for example, "They're all the kind of men who look like they're smoking cigars even when they're not smoking cigars," and "The very best way to describe Scott Peterson's demeanor is that it looks like he's constantly posing for a photograph nobody is taking."<a name="f7c-text" href="#f7c"><sup>7</sup></a> The eerie humor resides in the appositional relation between perceiving subject and aesthetic object that occurs when television inculcates both "the deep thesis that the most significant quality of truly alive persons is watchableness" ("EUP," 26) <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> that television is "a mirror." The ouroboric outcome of this "ontology of appearance" is the harrowing notion that "true actualization of self would ultimately consist in [our] becoming one of the images that are the <span style="font-style:italic;">objects</span> of this great herd-like watching. That is, television's real pitch … is that it's better to be inside the TV than to be outside, watching" ("EUP," 56). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The joke, of course, is on us. We are the dog, staring impassively at television's great wagging finger, unwilling or unable to look where it's pointing, in part because it's pointing right at us. By flattering our sense of ourselves as expert viewers, television creates a feedback loop in which solitary watchers congratulate themselves on detecting false notes in the programs they watch. The kind of discernment proper to a pawn shop clerk is elevated to the highest rank, with the result that "genuine human worth is not just identical with but <span style="font-style:italic;">rooted in</span> the phenomenon of watching" ("EUP," 26). Wallace's argument gathers real force here, for his point is not that television is "bad for us"—though he does think that—it's that television's level of sophistication caught up to and then, for all practical purposes, surpassed that of its consumers sometime around 1985 has been altering our lived experience in fundamental ways ever since.</p>
<p>Weighing the value of war reportage, William T. Vollmann once remarked that, "Illumination is the first step toward alleviation."<a name="f8c-text" href="#f8c"><sup>8</sup></a> Wallace's big ethico-epistemological claim in this essay is that this truism may no longer hold water in our televisual age. He argues that the implicit link between knowledge and action, or to put it another way, the notion that intellectual understanding is conducive to the amelioration of real conditions, has been short-circuited by "TV's power to jettison connection and castrate protest" ("EUP," 35). "It was assumed," says Wallace, "that etiology and diagnosis pointed toward cure, that a revelation of imprisonment led to freedom" ("EUP," 66–67). In <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span>, this predicament manifests itself in the case of Ennet House resident Geoffrey Day, "a red-wine-and-Quaalude man …. Who taught something horseshit-sounding like social historicity or historical sociality at some jr. college …."<a name="f9c-text" href="#f9c"><sup>9</sup></a> Day, whose name evokes the cold light of reason, cannot abide the logical inconsistencies and clichéd adages that undergird the Alcoholics Anonymous philosophy. Despite a sincere desire to get sober, he balks at full participation in his recovery program because it runs counter to his sense of himself as an autonomous, rational individual. Don Gately, the live-in counselor at Day's drying-out facility, responds to his exhortation to "show me the flaw in my reasoning" by diagnosing him with "<span style="font-style:italic;">Analysis-Paralysis" (IJ</span>, n.90, 1002) and encouraging him to, in effect, <span style="font-style:italic;">try</span> AA before he knocks it. Gately, himself a recovering drug addict, believes that "the clichéd directives are a lot more deep and hard to actually <span style="font-style:italic;">do</span>. To try and live by instead of just say" (<span style="font-style:italic;">IJ</span>, 273). As expected, this cajoling only incenses Day, who equates the temporary tabling of intellectualism with infantilization: "Oh lovely, Oh very nice. By all means don't <span style="font-style:italic;">think</span> about the validity of what they're claiming your life hinges on. Oh do not ask what <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> it. Do not ask whether it's not insane. Simply open wide for the spoon" (<span style="font-style:italic;">IJ</span>, n.90, 1002). The Prufrock reference, which Day knows is way over Gately's head, tells us who the real baby is. It also reprises one of Wallace's favorite conceits (elaborated most fully in the short story "Good Old Neon"), which posits an inverse relationship between verbal sophistication and emotional honesty. <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span>'s most literate characters (Hal Incandenza, his mother Avril, and Geoffrey Day) are the ones least capable of expressing themselves with sincerity and hearing what others are saying. When Hal's brother Mario becomes concerned over Hal's increasingly distant behavior, he asks his mother, "How can you tell if somebody's sad?" Avril responds with, "A quick smile. 'You mean whether someone's sad'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">IJ</span>, 763). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, Wallace is much better at anatomizing our televisual culture than he is at telling us what to do about it. The analytical precision he brings to bear in identifying the corrosive effects of non-communal spectatorship shows signs of fatigue by the time he attempts to tell us what to do with ourselves "in the absence of any credible, noncommercial guides for living" ("EUP," 79) or what contemporary novelists should do in the wake of postmodernism's "irreverent rejection of 'outmoded' concepts like integrated plot or enduring character" ("EUP," 80). Wallace surmises that</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>The next real literary "rebels" in this country might well emerge as some weird bunch of <span style="font-style:italic;">anti</span>-rebels, born oglers who dare somehow to back away from ironic watching, who have the childish gall actually to endorse and instantiate single-entendre principles. Who treat of plain old untrendy human troubles and emotions in U.S. life with reverence and conviction. Who eschew self-consciousness and hip fatigue …. The new rebels might be artists willing to risk the yawn, the rolled eyes, the cool smile, the nudged ribs, the parody of gifted ironists, the "Oh how <span style="font-style:italic;">banal</span>."</p>
<div class="attrib">("EUP," 81)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">This is all well and good, but having been convinced that irony has an iron grip on our culture, we are apt to expect that it is going to take more than prelapsarian wishes to pry it off. As it turns out, Wallace offers us different, more convincing answers to this question in his fiction.</p>
<p>Around the time the television was invented, John Dewey was grappling with many of the problems I have been considering here. He too worried about the pernicious effects of culture, and advocated "a kind of intellectual disrobing" not unlike Wallace's entreaties for a sentimentalism that might replenish our collective spiritual well. But Dewey saw that there were limits to such disrobing:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>We cannot permanently divest ourselves of the intellectual habits we take on and wear when we assimilate the culture of our own time and place. But intelligent furthering of culture demands that we take some of them off, that we inspect them critically to see what they are made of and what wearing them does to us. We cannot achieve recovery of primitive naivete. But there is attainable a cultivated naivete of eye, ear and thought, one that can be acquired only through the discipline of severe thought.<a name="f9c-text" href="#f9c"><sup>9</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In place of this "primitive naivete," Dewey advocated a sort of mature, open awareness—a receptivity to light and shadow that might lead us down the road toward enlightenment. In the essay, "The Lost Individual," he writes:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>There is a prophetic aspect to all observation …. When a situation is as confused and divided within itself as is the present social estate, choice is implicated in observation …. Because acknowledgment in thought brings with it intelligent discrimination and choice, it is the first step out of confusion, the first step in forming those objects of significant allegiance out of which stable and efficacious individuality may grow.<a name="f10c-text" href="#f10c"><sup>10</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Everywhere in his stories, we find that David Foster Wallace is prodding us to consider not just the anomie of individual existence, but also the fellowship of our social bonds. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  It is no mistake that Neal, the suicidal narrator of "Good Old Neon," finds some solace at the Downer's Grove Community Center. In Neal's case these bonds are not enough, but in his frantic search for human connection, he unwittingly charts a new way out of the labyrinth. Or rather, he charts the labyrinth itself so fully, with such sensitivity, that he achieves a sublimity of consciousness which finally affords him the privilege of metempsychosis, the kind of "transcendence [through] absorption" (<span style="font-style:italic;">IJ</span>, 12) that Hal Incandenza subscribes to in <span style="font-style:italic;">Infinite Jest</span>.</p>
<p>In his last moments of consciousness, Neal is hurtling down Lily Cache road in a Corvette. He is on his way to kill himself by driving into a bridge abutment. As the end approaches, Neal begins addressing a "you" repeatedly. As a reader, I become confused as to who it is that is supposed to be driving the car. I am trying to re out my relation to this narrator whose suffering I was pitying only a few minutes ago, who now, more Virgil than victim, seems to pity <span style="font-style:italic;">me</span> because I continue to fear what I need not fear at all. I am still turning this question over in my mind when he asks me, the solitary reader, "What exactly do you think you are?"<a name="f11c-text" href="#f11c"><sup>11</sup></a> But before I have an answer we are "clanging around in David Wallace 81's head" as he flips through a high school yearbook, contemplating the suicide of a classmate, trying to imagine what sorts of pain or problems might have driven the guy to do it, this fair haired boy who seemed to have had it all.</p>

<div id="body">
<p>Friedrich Nietzsche, in <span style="font-style:italic;">On the Genealogy of Morals</span>, writing of the relation between the ascetic ideal and modern science, claimed that the word "science" in the mouths of modern scientists was obscene:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>these trumpeters of reality are bad musicians, it is clear from the sound they make that their voices do <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> rise up from the depths, that the abyss of the scientific conscience—for today the scientific conscience is an abyss—does <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> speak through them, that the word "science" in the mouths of such trumpeters is simply an obscenity, an abuse, an example of impudence.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The word he uses is <span style="font-style:italic;">unzücht</span>; here it is translated as obscene, but it can also mean indecent, a word with more social or class connotations. Science, for Nietzsche, is obscene for two main reasons: first, because modern scientists are abusing the language of science; and second, because Nietzsche foregrounds the mouth in his extended musical metaphor. The mouth is thus visualized as more than a mouthpiece for language. It is also a body part whose physical nature shapes, moistens, warms, and potentially contaminates its words. In Nietzsche's work, the assertion of knowledge is tied to the physical nature of the will. The ascetic ideal, by trying to cancel out the body, has both "ruined" "health and taste" and created a set of "monstrous" cultural ideals.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> While the ascetic ideal has made the healthy body obscene, then, Nietzsche uses images of repressed and unhealthy bodies to concretize the moral hypocrisy of late-nineteenth-century culture. Foul bodies, disgusting smells; they are everywhere in Nietzsche's writing. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The word obscene is from the Latin <span style="font-style:italic;">obscenus</span> meaning ill-omened; but over time it has come to mean that which is off-stage. There are always important reasons for sidelining certain areas of representation. Ideas of obscenity depend on labeling and circumscribing particular kinds of language or representation. Nietzsche alters where we locate obscenity, but not the circumscribing logic that informs its assignation. The obscene is a kind of last resort, a limit beyond which a writer will not go; the reasons for the assertion of this limit are always revealing.</p>
<p>It is partly from the desire to test conventional limits that obscenity plays such a central role in modernist writing. Like Nietzsche, modernist writers use obscene images because they want to reveal, and sometimes revel in, the uncomfortable limits of representation. Alternatively, there is a desire to attack a combination of an unhealthily repressed attitude to the body and hypocritical cultural norms, a theme present in novels from the late nineteenth century on. From Emile Zola's <span style="font-style:italic;">L'oeuvre (The Masterpiece</span> [1886]), through to <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span> , it is the sentimental cant of the moral majority that is labeled as obscene, not the explicit references to naked bodies or sexual interaction. These writers attempt to overturn dominant cultural and legal understandings of obscenity. Thus, the rise of literary realism coincided with the rise in legal prosecutions of literary obscenity.</p>
<p>The literary inclusion of sexualized flesh in realist novels meant that prosecutions for obscenity in Britain and America rose exponentially from the 1870s through to the 1933 <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> trial in the U.S. and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span> trial in Britain in 1960. At the same time, this literary drive coincided with a new kind of desire to stamp out sex in literature. What became known as the New Puritanism in America, and "comstockery" by those on the other side of the argument, was run by the virulent Anthony Comstock who boasted two years before his death in 1915, "In the forty-one years I have been [in New York] I have convicted persons enough to fill a passenger train of 61 coaches . . . I have destroyed 160 tons of obscene literature."<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Much of what he destroyed seems innocuous now: the mere mention of prostitution, for example, was enough to send a book to the pulping machine.</p>
<p>Modernist and avant-garde writing, with its more deliberate flouting of moral conventions and exploration of sex and the language of sex, ratcheted up this confrontational dynamic. The period of modernist writing is framed by an embattled context of legal censorship. This legal censorship is clearest in the famous <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> trials in 1921 and 1933 and the banning of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow</span> in 1915, as well as Lawrence's difficulties in getting <span style="font-style:italic;">Women in Love</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span> published. However, there were less institutionalized, but sometimes just as powerful, forms of censorship which worked to control the dissemination of modernist writing: printers, publishers, customs officers, postmen, editors, journalists, managers of circulating libraries, typists, husbands of typists, daughters of lawyers, daughters in general, and even other modernist writers all played their part in the censorship process.</p>
<p>The controllers of the big circulating book libraries, such as Smith's and Boot's, exercised considerable influence over the circulation and publication of fiction in Britain. As late as 1937, Boot's circulating library refused a book of Wyndham Lewis's called <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">False Bottoms</span> because the title was too vulgar. The hard-up Lewis dutifully changed the title to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Revenge for Love</span>. But the modes of censorship went far beyond these large companies. A London based printer, for instance, famously refused to set the manuscript of Joyce's <span style="font-style:italic;">Dubliners</span>, helping to delay the already protracted history of the book's publication.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> In 1924, an Irish printer refused to set the Irish journal <span style="font-style:italic;">To-Morrow</span>, because of two pieces of writing which were devoted to the subject of rape, one of which was Yeats's "Leda and the Swan."<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> This high-handed behavior was a result of the fact that printers were legally responsible for the writing they set; this legal responsibility created, to the displeasure of modernist writers such as Joyce and Pound, the power of unknown printers to control the moral coordinates of modern literature. Although typists were not inhibited by any legal responsibility, they too had qualms in transcribing literature they considered obscene. Nellie Morrison, a friend of D. H. Lawrence, who, with some misgivings, asked her to type up the manuscript of <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span>, only managed to get as far as the fifth chapter before she declared herself unable to continue. "It is too indecent" she breathlessly announced.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Up to nine typists refused to deal with Joyce's "Circe"; indeed, on one occasion, it was a typist's husband who interfered—when a British Embassy official found his wife typing up a section of "Circe," he famously threw it into the fire.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Perhaps the most pernicious form of censorship, however, was the obscure threat of prosecution which publishers either feared or appealed to when turning down or altering a manuscript. This meant that the censor as a target was hard to pin down. It was not a person or single piece of the law which could be brought on stage and openly challenged. The res of Anthony Comstock and his successor John Sumner came closest to performing this role in the United States; and in Britain the key hate res were James Douglas and the Home Secretary Sir William Joynson-Hicks (known as "Jix"), who was Home Secretary from 1924 to 1929. However, in reality, these individuals were only part of a wide and complex structure of censorship.</p>
<p>The system that Comstock had helped to put in place, in which customs officials with no specific training should decide on whether a piece of writing was obscene, was by its very nature haphazard and subject to ungovernable individual decisions. Censorship was to change in the early twentieth century, but these shifts must be traced in the individual decisions that were made, which were manifestations of wider cultural changes. In the face of this network of control, writers quickly realized that it was essential to take control of the editorship of publishing houses and journals. No wonder, also, that the moral protest against the censorship of obscenity became a theme in modernist texts.</p>
<p>But, perhaps more intriguing than the rational-moral protest against censorship, is the way that a number of writers explore and stretch the meaning of literary obscenity, putting the obscene at the heart of their aesthetic projects. If the directness of literary naturalism and realism had led to trouble with the vice squad, then, my proposition is that modernist writers adopt the concerns of realism, only to twist them in a new direction. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Returning to Nietzsche's obscene trumpeters, decayed mouths, for example, make notable appearances in modernist writing. T. S. Eliot, in his 1915 prose piece, "Hysteria," provides an extended description of a female mouth that threatens to engulf and inhale a man. He had a sustained interest in rotting orifices. In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> "The Dead mountain mouth of carious teeth that cannot spit" in "What the Thunder Said" echoes back to Lil's famously decayed teeth in "A Game of Chess." While the I, we're told, doesn't "mince" her words, Lil, with her putrefied mouth, would not be able to. Eliot's connection of female infertility and rotting mouths is one among a number of moments in his writing when he manipulates disgust in order to undermine established ideas of aesthetic taste.</p>
<p>Joyce, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dubliners</span> story "An Encounter," also connects a corrupted orifice with bad morals: the creepy man who jerks off in the field has "great gaps in his mouth between his yellow teeth."<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> No wonder, then, that the boy of the story "disliked the words in his mouth." The boy's dislike is focused on the specific sexual words the man repeats to himself; but, by implication, the man's language is saturated with the contours of his putrid mouth more generally.</p>
<p>This focus on mouths is more than simply an insight into early-twentieth-century dental hygiene. It involves an interest both in how the individual body frames words and in the sensual properties of language. Just as Nietzsche insists on recognizing the perspectival nature of knowledge, so words, in modernist texts, tend to be written through, not over, character. The subject, armed with all his or her physical characteristics, in this instance bad breath, tends to be in the words of modernist literature. The foregrounding of the subjectively sensual nature of language splinters writing apart into distinct styles which are infected with healthy or decaying bodies, as well as the accents of class, racial, or sexual difference.</p>
<p>This focus on the physical self underscores Nietzsche's reliance on a dichotomy of health and illness, which in his writing might be seen to displace the dominant moral oppositions of late-nineteenth-century culture. The designation of books which are "for all the world" as "foul-smelling" because "the smell of small people clings to them," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Beyond Good and Evil</span>, deliberately asserts a visceral, rather than rational, response to something.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Here, bad odor contaminates the object, injecting a vivid sensuality into the image of overuse. The desire to transfer the focus of writing from moral argument to visceral response informs modernist writing more generally. In "An Encounter" disgust still seems framed by a moral argument; the connection of the man's rotten mouth and rotten morals is closely enforced. In other texts, the manipulation of disgust moves the literary or interpretative register beyond moral reason; and this is to place the obscene, and thoughts on the nature of the obscene, at the heart of modernist writing. The more explicit meditations on the nature of obscenity in modernist texts, then, involve a testing of human boundaries in which the mind's relation to the body is implicitly questioned.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Women in Love</span>, Gerald, after the rabbit Bismarck tears open the flesh on Gudrun's arm, stares at the bloodied rip and is prompted to thoughts on the obscene: "The long, shallow red rip seemed torn across his own brain, tearing the surface of his ultimate <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  consciousness, letting through the forever unconscious, unthinkable red ether of the beyond, the obscene beyond." Gerald's glimpse of what lies under Gudrun's skin opens up an uneasy view of an obscene interior. As the passage goes on, Gerald's look inside Gudrun creates an obscene kind of knowledge. An "obscene smile," we are told, flits over Gerald's face, while Gudrun's face "relaxed into a smile of obscene recognition."<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> This muted sexual interaction, with its synthesis of sexual violence and unconscious recognition, creates a genuinely disturbing image of human desire. While modernist writing often takes us into the self Lawrence here visualizes a bloody interior, disturbing in its organic unreadability. It sets the scene for their murderous and failed relationship. When Gudrun finally rejects Gerald, we are told that she has finished with the world of healthy men and embraced an "obscene" egoism: "There was only the inner, individual darkness, sensation within the ego, the obscene religious mystery of ultimate reduction . . . ."<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Here, again, the obscene interior is unreadable, this time in a spiritual rather than organic sense. The implication is that if we look too far into ourselves, we will destroy something central to our humanity. But Lawrence also stands outside the obscene and comments on it here, seeing it as that which is and should be, precisely, unreadable. On another occasion, Lawrence spelled out his belief that there should be limits on the literary journey into the self: "What was there in the cave: Alas that we ever looked! Nothing but a huge slimy serpent of sex, and heaps of excrement, and a myriad repulsive little horrors spawned between sex and excrement."<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Lawrence vigorously asserts a barrier to representation, insisting that the obscene interior is that which cannot, and should not, be put into language.</p>
<p>The scene with Gudrun, Gerald, and the rabbit is genuinely disturbing; it seems to implicate the reader in the obscene. Obscenity, and both the assertion and the disruption of representational limits which it involves, is part of what it means to be human. Selfhood is unimaginable without a sense of the obscene, the things or bodily functions that we banish in order to maintain a sense of self. George Bataille makes such a universalist claim in <span style="font-style:italic;">Eroticism</span> . In the introductory section to the book, where he is setting out his understanding of eroticism in relation to selfhood he says the following: "Bodies open out to a state of continuity through secret channels that give us a feeling of obscenity. Obscenity is our name for the uneasiness which upsets the physical state associated with self-possession, with the possession of a recognised and stable individuality."<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> By continuity, Bataille refers to his central claim that humans are discontinuous beings but that certain basic human experiences such as death, nakedness, and sex disrupt this self-sufficiency. Bataille wants to explore, rather than expel, the "secret channels" of obscenity, the uneasiness that disarranges stable individuality. His claim that self-possession collapses in face of the obscene helpfully provides a way of considering the radical aesthetic possibilities of literary obscenities.</p>
<p>Obscene modernism, then, is at its most obscene when it disarranges human frontiers, calling into question the mind's relation to the body. In this sense, it is not the case that modernist writing was obscene, and is no longer so. Modern readers may locate modernist obscenity in different places, but the ability of these texts to shock or to disrupt remains. This article argues from a slightly different angle to existing books <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  on modernism and censorship by Adam Parkes, Florence Dore, and Celia Marshik. These books helpfully reveal the conflict between modernist writers and "Vice Crusaders," and show how the eventual liberalization of the law on obscene literature after the war corresponded to a freeing up of cultural attitudes to sexuality and in particular homosexuality.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> I want to suggest, however, that explorations of the obscene in modernist writing take us into unresolved and ongoing questions about aesthetic boundaries; about where and how to place and police them.</p>
<p>Take the re of Gerty MacDowell in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>. She is the classic "young person" whom the law against obscenity was designed to protect. Since Lord Campbell's Obscene Publications Act of 1857, and the subsequent interpretation of this law by Lord Chief Justice Cockburn in 1867, known as the Hicklin ruling, the test of obscenity had rested on the following famous rule: "whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> There were three kinds of readerships "whose minds" were seen to be most "open to immoral influences": the young, women, and the working class. These susceptible readers, the Vice Crusaders and lawyers argued, needed to be protected from the corrupting influence of obscene literature.</p>
<p>Gerty appears in "Nausicaa" as a sentimental subject, prone to blush charmingly at the mention of the body's functions, and, in her moral judgements as a young female, offering an unerringly accurate correspondence with the moral coordinates of the Society for the Suppression of Vice. In the "Circe" section of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, she reappears as a slobbering, ogling, and disgusting re, who has dreamed her encounter with Bloom. Here, not only does Joyce make Gerty obscene, he also presents us with the other side of the sentimental legal subject, whose tender sensibilities presided over the legal censorship of modernist literature.</p>
<p>Perhaps Joyce's more radical literary departure, however, was to move beyond this Gertyish opposition of the sentimental and the obscene. And this is why when <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> first appeared even Joyce's most artistically advanced contemporaries found it difficult to interpret its obscene material. Virginia Woolf confessed that the book "raised a blush even upon such a cheek as mine," Lawrence condemned Penelope as "the dirtiest, most indecent, obscene thing ever written," while Arnold Bennett argued that "Ulysses is not pornographic, but it is more indecent, obscene, scatological and licentious that the majority of professedly pornographic books." Ezra Pound's condemnation of Joyce's "arsethetic" is a more engaged, if no less critical, condemnation of Joyce's combination of art and arses.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>These comments help us recapture something of the bemusement of Joyce's contemporaries in the face of the obscenities in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>. While the Vice Crusaders and lawyers debated whether this text was pornography or literature, Joyce's fellow writers also found themselves worrying about semantics. The desire to pile up adjective after adjective in the reactions detailed above tells us much about the anxiety about how to define this new kind of writing: is it, in the end, obscene, scatological, indecent, licentious, dirty? If it is all or any of these things, can it still be literature? Of one thing <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  all were agreed: through these elements Joyce had created an oddly hybrid literary object. It was clear to his fellow writers that <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> was literature; but the category of literature would need to change in order to accommodate this new kind of text.</p>
<p>Pound, for one, was worried about stretching the category of literature to include the obscenities in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>. He believed that Joyce had pushed his writing beyond the realism of his earlier works into gratuitous obscenity. In the interchanges between Pound and Joyce on this question obscenity becomes a term that signifies that which is in excess, as though Joyce is reveling in obscene language for the sake of it. According to Pound, as Joyce's language descends into dirt it becomes more divorced from its referent. Pound suggests that, rather than being the culmination of a realist drive to capture the world in all its guises, Joyce's obscenity is language at its most self-referential. He was right to see the obscenity in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> as different to that in previous works by Joyce, and to see it as connected to something other than its realism. From the "Nausicaa" section on, the use of obscene language rises exponentially. As the writing becomes more focused on linguistic and stylistic artifice, it becomes more obscene. When Molly states, "that's what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damned well fucked too up to my neck nearly" something new enters the literary object: the colloquial meets the obscene.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Bataille captures the revolutionary energy of those images or bits of language that create a feeling of genuine disquiet in the reader. Joyce's radical move, along with other modernist writers, was to extend this disquiet to the very texture of language, casting obscene slang into the language of literature, and challenging the idea that literature could be sealed from the language of the streets.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Offensive Modernism</h1>
<p>Modernism as a term is, of course, impossible to pin down simply. Yet, we might take as one of its salient characteristics a desire to offend, something Peter Gay argues in his recent book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Modernism: The Lure of Heresy</span>.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Perhaps the obscenities in modernism, then, should be seen as simply part of a more general iconoclasm. I want to suggest, however, that a scrutiny of the specifics of the representation and policing of the obscene opens up something different to a general logic of heresy. It was because of their experience of the censor that these writers got caught up in tangled concerns about the materialist networks of censorship and distribution which policed the dissemination of texts. It involved them in historical understandings of legal and philosophical discussions about freedom of speech. It also prompted writers to engage in a series of discussions about aesthetic boundaries. The debates between Pound and Joyce about the aesthetic status of shit, shitting, and toilets, is surely one of the more bizarre yet fascinating episodes in the history of modern literature. These messy encounters altered the relationship these writers had with more abstract ideas of art, authority, tradition, or the state.</p>
<p>In the rest of this article I focus on an aesthetic question which synthesizes a number of these concerns: where do we place the boundary separating literature and pornography? "Pornography" is originally from the Greek meaning "writing about prostitutes." <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Despite the fact that the "Circe" section of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> is quite literally about harlots, his contemporaries were keen to dissociate <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> from pornography: "<span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> is not pornographic," as Bennet declared. Lawrence, while employing a series of related words, studiously avoided using the word pornography. These responses betray a clear anxiety about the relationship between <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> and pornography.</p>
<p>More generally, there is an anxiety about the taint of the pornographic in modernist writing. Alisson Pease argues that modernist writers incorporated "pornographic tropes and images" into their works, and that this altered understandings of the aesthetic. The distinction between "aesthetics and pornography," which had been put in place in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries "collapsed in the twentieth century."<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> I want to suggest, however, that something slightly different happens: that the categories of pornography and obscenity are pushed apart in the early twentieth century and that an aesthetic interest in the latter often goes hand-in-hand with a denigration of the former.</p>
<p>As late as 1929, D. H. Lawrence insisted that despite his lifelong struggle with the censor and interest in exploring ideas of obscenity, he would happily curtail the rights of pornographers to publish.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Earlier, in 1914, Wyndham Lewis declared in <span style="font-style:italic;">BLAST</span> that pornography was the "great enemy of progress." On another occasion in the same year, he distinguished between different kinds of sexualized writing: "I have always found pornography extremely boring and regarded it as the hallmark of the second-rate. As for Phallic aesthetics, I have no quarrel with them, only I don't happen to participate myself, that is all: though much preferring the naked and clean thing to the boudoir suggestiveness and Yellow Book Gallicisms."<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Lewis is careful to distinguish aesthetic explorations of sex, whether in the form of "phallic aesthetics" or "boudoir suggestiveness" from pornography, a distinction he repeats in his novels. There are also notable discussions in modernist literature of what constitutes pornography, in which art is specifically opposed to the pornographic. In a dispute about aesthetics in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</span>, for example, Stephen uses pornography as an instance of the "improper" arts which excite kinetic, rather than aesthetic, emotions. Lynch's "fleshy" response to a naked statue is a bodily "reflex" which has nothing to do with beauty or aesthetics.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>In particular, however, pornography publishers make notable appearances in modernist texts. In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>  Conrad represents the pornographer, "agent provocateur," Verloc, who sells both pornographic and revolutionary tracts. The connections of pornographic and revolutionary publishing date back to the early nineteenth century, but Conrad links the disreputable wares of the pornography trade with ineffectual and solipsistic anarchistic passion.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Lewis, in the character of the publisher Ratner, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Apes of God</span> , also presents us with the sordid financial transactions of the pornography trade. Ratner contemplates a man looking at one of his books. The man "was weighing its pornographic promise against his big cheque in his pocket." Ratner responds by pointing the man to the pornographic parts: "he guides the customer with a sleuth-like index to the satisfying spots one by one.—The cheque changes hands."<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Lewis captures the sordidness of the pornography trade by <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  synthesizing ideas of sexual and financial satisfaction. It is remarkable, however, that alongside this denigration of pornography, Lewis repeatedly refers to the obscene as a way of staging ideas about aesthetic boundaries. In his novels, he depicts obscene dwarfs, puppets, and babies, part of a repertoire of obscene-grotesque imagery which works to reveal repressed desires or human misrecognitions.</p>
<p>In the rest of this article I consider this focus on pornography as a trade and its significance for our understanding of modernist obscenity. At the same time, I offer an engagement with Lawrence Rainey's influential account of the production of modernist texts as luxury, as investible commodities.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Trade in Salacious Books</h1>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>He made his living, and in the process convinced himself that he was serving the arts, by printing limited and expensive editions of the more scabrous specimens of the native and foreign literatures.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Aldous Huxley, in his depiction of Cuthbert Arkwright in his 1928 novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Point Counter Point</span>, represents an important type of the modernist period: the publisher of limited and expensive editions of obscene literature who also fancies that he serves the "arts." Arkwright is presented neither as a straightforward pornographer nor as a publisher entirely free of the taint of the pornographic. He is caught, it seems, between competing interests. He needs to make his living, but he also has a different desire, which is to convince himself that he is interested in that thing which stands outside commercial interests: "art." We are led to believe that he is deluded in this second need. Or, perhaps, that he is wrong in his faith about art's resistance to commodification. Yet this belief is, nevertheless, an important strand in his sense of self.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Institutions of Modernism</span>, Lawrence Rainey discusses in detail the dynamics of production, commodification, and notions about "art" which are here represented by Huxley. Rainey argues that Sylvia Beach, as well as Joyce and Pound, published <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> as an expensive limited edition through a careful manipulation of the mechanisms of marketing, distribution, and price. In the process, the modernist text was produced as a special, investible commodity beyond the reach of the ordinary reader. In particular, Rainey considers the significance of the use of subscription lists, rather than more conventional methods of distribution, to disseminate the book. He argues that the "private edition" was a technical term with a "recent" meaning: a "ploy" to "evade the laws on obscenity that prevailed in both the United States and England." He goes on: "Instead of distributing the volume through normal retail outlets, Heinemann, or, in the case of Beach, Shakespeare and Company, announced that it was available only 'by subscription' directly from the publisher. In this way, it could argue that the book was not for sale in the public realm, hence could not be charged with harming public morals." Rainey argues that these methods of distribution created a "social space where aesthetic value became confused with speculation, collecting, investment, and dealing, a space in which modernism and commodity culture were not implacable enemies but <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  fraternal rivals."<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Within the logic of Rainey's argument, Arkwright's claim to serve the arts is a disingenuous one.</p>
<p>I want to pick up on the point about subscription lists and the private edition, and consider a different history to the one sketched by Rainey, a history which leads to some rather different conclusions. The distribution of obscene or pornographic texts by means of private subscription lists predates the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> by decades. Modernist publishers and writers adopted these techniques for the same reason that pornographers did; to avoid the customs officials. Yet they were often acutely aware of the proximity of modernist texts to the pornography trade, an association all the more disturbing because it was in place at both a legal and a publishing level. A fraught intellectual battle resulted, in which modernist writers attempted to claim a different "social space" to the one described by Rainey, one where aesthetic value was connected not with speculation, but with freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Pornography was a lucrative trade. Salacious texts could command impressive prices, especially if they were produced in limited editions. The most famous of these was the eleven-volume <span style="font-style:italic;">My Secret Life</span> , which was produced in a print run of only ten copies. It was supposedly created in Amsterdam and then smuggled back into Britain through subscription lists to avoid the postal authorities. The extremely rare <span style="font-style:italic;">My Secret Life</span> came at a price of between £40 and £100. <span style="font-style:italic;">Frank and I</span>, a text produced in 1902, was advertised at the cost of £5 or $25, a dual pricing policy which suggests the internationalism of the pornography trade. If we consider that Rainey makes much of the fact that Ulysses sold for £7.7s in 1922, we can begin to see just how expensive this high-class pornography was.</p>
<p>There was also a lucrative market for pornographic journals. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Pearl: A journal of Facetiae and Voluptuous Reading</span>, for example, was issued monthly for 18 months between 1879 and 1880. A complete set of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Pearl</span> was available in a limited edition of 150 at the price of £25. Other examples include <span style="font-style:italic;">The Boudoir</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Cremorne</span> , which sold in limited editions of 300 for half a guinea and a guinea respectively.</p>
<p>All of these books and journals were produced for a distinctly middle- and upper-class audience. The Special <span style="font-style:italic;">Pearl</span> Christmas number of 1879 was called "Swivia; or, the Briefless Barrister," indicating one possible kind of professional audience for the journal.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> This expensive luxury pornography was text-based, and included "voluptuous" stories and poems about sex and flagellation. The methods of textual dissemination used by the pornography trade were also similar to those discussed by Rainey. The opening editorial of the first edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Pearl</span>, for example, hoped that the "hypocritical swine" who might be inclined to "trample" the journal "underfoot" would instead "become subscribers on the quiet."</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Pearl</span> was published privately in London under the ironic "Society of Vice" imprint. The editorial joke about turning possible prosecutors into "quiet" subscribers picks up on the established nineteenth-century conventions of expensive pornography distribution, in which pornographers avoided the police by targeting lists of private subscribers through the mail. The techniques of production and distribution perfected <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  by pornography producers in the late nineteenth century relied on a fine balance between scarcity and price. Expensive journals and books commanded exorbitant prices because they were luxuriously produced, limited in number, and represented a considerable risk on the part of the publishers and distributors.</p>
<p>Huxley's Arkwright, with his claim that he is not simply a pornographer, is typical of a certain kind of publisher who features on the publishing landscape throughout the nineteenth century and up until the Second World War. The publisher John Camden Hotten, for example, who died in 1873, published respectable books of history, anthropology, and poetry, alongside more explicitly pornographic books such as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Female Flagellants in the Modest and Incontinent World</span> .<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> At the end of the period in which modernist writing was produced, Jack Kahane's Obelisk Press, which he ran from 1931 to 1939, published volumes of poetry such as Joyce's <span style="font-style:italic;">Poemes Penyeach</span>  and obscene literary books such as Henry Miller's <span style="font-style:italic;">Tropic of Cancer</span>  alongside more straightforward salacious tomes such as Kahane's own <span style="font-style:italic;">Amour—French for Love</span> , which he brought out under the name Cecil Barr. There are significant differences, however, between the publishing ventures of these two men. While Hotten was happy to have different kinds of writing on his list, the books themselves were fairly obviously distinct from one another; he seems to have classified them as either pornography or books of political history, for example. What is notable about Kahane's publication list is both its impressive literary credentials (it includes works by Joyce, Lawrence, Miller, James Hanley, Radclyffe Hall, Anaïs Nin, and Lawrence Durrell), and the fact that these books were both literary and, in a legal sense, obscene. This shift began in the 1880s and 1890s, when publishers such as Vizetelly were prosecuted for bringing out obscene books by literary writers such as Zola. From this point on, there was often an unspoken legal view that books could be classified as both obscene and literary. It was not until 1933, when Judge Woolsey declared that a book could not be both a work of art and obscene, that the two terms were legally separated again.</p>
<p>Two different publishers of the 1890s capture some of the competing interests at stake here. First, there was the London publisher Leonard Smithers, whom Wilde fondly described as "the most learned erotomaniac in Europe."<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Smithers began his career as a publisher of straightforward pornography, but from 1895 went on to produce luxury editions of risqué works by Wilde, Beardsley, Dowson, Symons, and others. By producing the books as luxury editions, Smithers imitated the longer standing practice of pornography publication, in which limited, expensive editions of erotica were sold to a high-class readership.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Smithers was not the only publisher who adopted techniques from the pornography trade in order to bring out the legally suspect texts of fin de siècle aestheticism. John Lane, for example, published limited editions of the doubtful <span style="font-style:italic;">Yellow Book</span> (1894–97) and later <span style="font-style:italic;">BLAST</span> (1914–15), under the Bodley Head imprint, by specifically nurturing a network of private investors. As Peter McDoland puts it, "Capitalizing on the prestige of the 'limited edition,' the 'beautiful book,' and the appeal of the risqué, [Lane] commodified and popularized 1890s aestheticism."<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The second publisher was Paul Ferdinando, who changed his name to Charles Carrington, and emigrated from London to Paris in 1895 in order to set up his illegal publishing operation. Carrington, from his shops in the Faubourg Montmartre and rue de Chateaudun produced salacious books such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Raped on the Railway: A True Story of a Lady Who Was First Ravished and then Chastised upon the Scotch Express</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Sweet Seventeen: The True Story of a Daughter's Awful Whipping and Its Delightful if Direful Consequences</span>  as well as pseudo-medical books, such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Flagellation in France from a medical and historical standpoint</span> . He also brought out new editions of obscene or suspect literary works such as his <span style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs of Fanny Hill: a new and genuine edition from the original text</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Picture of Dorian Gray</span>  which Methuen were reluctant to keep in print after Wilde's trial in 1895.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> He would then ship these books back to England via mail order lists. Over the years and up until his death in 1922 Carrington devised ingenious methods of avoiding Customs Officers. When he realized that the Post Office had begun to confiscate his mail, he organized a series of postal drops or middlemen to fool the authorities. He was also a canny salesman. He created advertising brochures aimed at upper-middle-class British and American buyers who wanted both intellectually stimulating and erotic limited edition books.</p>
<p>Carrington was not the only publisher to move operations to France at this time. In face of the attempt by police to crack down on pornography publishers in the 1880s and 1890s, others such as Edward Avery, Harry Sidney Nichols, and William Lazenby (who published <span style="font-style:italic;">The Pearl</span>) followed suit. Many of the publishers or sellers of modernist and avant-garde texts, such as Robert McAlmon, Sylvia Beach, Nancy Cunard, and Jack Kahane, partly gravitated to Paris for similar reasons. It was easier to produce and circulate obscene texts from Paris because the French authorities were not interested in prosecuting publishers of English-language material which was being transported off French soil, despite pleas from the British police for them to do so. French publishers of erotica, in turn, moved their own operations to Brussels in order to avoid French censorship laws. Despite the international trade in pornography and obscene literature, the authorities failed to find ways to prosecute across national borders. Paris became the publishing centre of Anglo-American modernism partly because it was free of the British and American censors.</p>
<p>There were, however, significant differences between different kinds of publishers of obscenity from the 1890s. Despite the fact that Smithers had originally been a publisher of more straightforward pornography, his desire to publish the work of Wilde, Symons, and others was not simply commercial. In fact, his commitment to making beautifully bound and illustrated books was to bankrupt him in 1900, and he went on to die in poverty in 1907. Carrington's interests, on the other hand, seem to have been more simply financial. He produced obscene literary works because he saw that there was a lucrative market for them.</p>
<p>In some ways Smithers and Carrington represent the different interests at work in a number of publishing ventures in the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s. On the one hand, publishers on both sides of the Atlantic were keen to produce "obscene" modernist <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  texts because they saw that there was a lucrative market for them. Further, it became clear towards the end of the 1910s that a public brush with the law afforded enviable amounts of publicity for a book, something that publishers as diverse as the Paris based Kahane and the New York based Horace Liveright, were quick to capitalize upon. On the other hand, publishers and writers often found themselves unwittingly caught up in censorship battles. In some cases, writers would seek out alternative lines of distribution which, ironically, had associations with the very illicit trade that they were in other respects keen to avoid.</p>
<p>D. H. Lawrence's London edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow</span>, for example, was initially ushered into print by the respectable publishing company, Methuen. When the book was seized by the authorities in 1915, much was made of the fact that this "mass of obscenity" would find its way into respectable homes because it was clothed in the Methuen imprint.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Methuen, scared of the bad publicity that would attach to their name were keen to capitulate to the authorities and hush up the affair. When the suppression of the book was debated in the House of Commons, Sir J. Simon stated that "so far from resisting the proceedings they said they [Methuen] thought it right that the order should be issued."<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Lawrence responded to the censorship by trying to enlist support from influential friends such as Cynthia Asquith, Dollie Radford, and Edward Marsh.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> In a series of letters written immediately after the seizure of his book, he declares that he would "move a body of people" to support him (<span style="font-style:italic;">L2</span>, 430). He seems to have hoped that Cynthia Asquith would be able to persuade her father-in-law, the Prime Minister, to intervene on his behalf. Methuen had a hand in trying, in turn, to prevent gestures of support. When Clive Bell wanted to write a defense of Lawrence, Methuen discouraged him from doing so. The firm also persuaded Pinker, Lawrence's agent, not to take legal action to reverse the Magistrate's order against <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow</span>.</p>
<p>In a bid to get help, Lawrence joined the Incorporated Society of Authors, Play-wrights and Composers, which aimed to protect literary property, on 11 November 1915 and wrote hopefully of a letter of protest to be sent to the papers signed by Walter de la Mare, E. M. Forster, John Middleton Murry, J. D. Beresford, Hugh Walpole, and Gilbert Cannan (<span style="font-style:italic;">L2</span>, 435). His hopes were ill-founded. The letter was never circulated and the Society of Authors decided on 7 December that "after hearing the opinion of the solicitors in regard to the legal aspect, the Committee came to the conclusion that in the present circumstances they could not take any useful action on the general principles involved."<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>Lawrence's immediate response to this combination of factors, the authoritarianism of the law, the submissiveness of Methuen, and the reluctance on the part of the Society of Authors or writers in general to support him, was to consider setting up his own publishing venture, to be called <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow Books and Music</span>, with the composer Philip Heseltine. It was Murry who had initially aired the idea of a publishing scheme in which authors would be publishers towards the end of 1915.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> Lawrence appears to have taken up the idea and made it his own by early 1916. He first wrote of setting up his own "private publishing concern, by subscription," in three letters written on 11 February 1916: one to Catherine Carswell, one to John Middleton Murry and Katherine <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Mansfield, and one to Bertrand Russell. He wrote excitedly to Carswell: "We could begin with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow</span>, which is likely to give a start, publish at 7/6. Then we can go on with the next as we like. The thing is to be a crusade, to gather the sincere people into one reading circle, and to give them every living book that is born" (<span style="font-style:italic;">L2</span>, 532).</p>
<p>Lawrence's idea that the publishing company would also constitute a "reading circle" reveals much about his hopes for the venture. It seems to have been a publishing equivalent of his plans at the time to move to Florida with a like-minded bunch of artists. This explains the tenor of his attempts to persuade influential res to join the company before it launched itself onto the market. He wrote to Russell: "When we have a sufficient number of names to justify us, we could begin" (<span style="font-style:italic;">L2</span>, 534). Three days later he contacted Lady Ottoline Morrell and Dollie Radford, clearly with the hope of securing both financial and intellectual support.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> In the end, Lawrence and his co-organizer Heseltine wrote and circulated 700 copies of an advertisement which proposed that authors would be able to publish their own books as private editions. Support was to be in the form of a signature. The advertisement concludes, "All who wish to support the scheme should sign the accompanying form, and send it at once to the secretary" (<span style="font-style:italic;">L2</span>, 542).</p>
<p>The plan to distribute the new publications by means of private subscription lists was an obvious ploy to avoid the censor. Lawrence also wanted to secure, through a signature, the support he had singularly failed to get in his immediate battle against the legal authorities. Something other than commerce was at stake for Lawrence in his publishing scheme: he seems to have hoped that <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow Books and Music</span> would constitute a cultural space of independent thought and freedom of speech, outside the jurisdiction of the British authorities. Ironic, then, that Lawrence was tempted to turn for help in this project to a Paris based publisher of dubious standing. In a letter to his agent Pinker from Cornwall, on 1 March 1916 he states: "Some friends of mine want to publish <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow</span> here by subscription. I suppose it could be done in conjunction with Paul Ferdinando. I also know nothing of him, but he has a nice and brigand-like name" (<span style="font-style:italic;">L2</span>, 561). In his desire to evade the censor, Lawrence found himself seeking out the pornography publisher, Paul Ferdinando, and embracing the very channels of distribution long perfected by the pornography trade. By so doing, and seemingly in ignorance, Lawrence risked marking his book as pornographic and confirming the judgement of the court, which legally declared <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow</span> as "pornographic" as the other books on Carrington's list.</p>
<p>Lawrence's publishing venture did not meet with much success (only thirty people responded to the advertisement), but after the war private presses such as the one imagined by Lawrence were to spring up in Paris and London and become central to the production and circulation of modernist writing. Something similar to Lawrence's hope for a cultural space of free expression was also at the heart of some of these ventures: something other than commerce, in other words, was staked in the signatures which attached themselves to subscription lists for banned books, all the more acutely felt because of the entrenched cultural association of private presses, subscription lists, and expensive editions with pornography, an association which was to extend well into the 1920s. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>After <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow</span> was banned in Britain and fearing problems with the censor, Lawrence's American publisher Benjamin Huebsch deliberately avoided issuing the novel as a limited edition because of the pornographic associations of limited editions. He adhered to this logic well into the 1920s. Sherwood Anderson wrote to Huebsch in 1922 to suggest publishing his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Many Marriages</span> in a limited edition because Anderson feared U.S. censors might ban the book. The conservative Huebsch objected to Anderson's plan because "to issue a book in that manner is to stamp it as pornography." Publishers who specialize in such limited editions "sell books with a wink and a leer." Even if the book in question is a work of art, publishers of limited editions handle it with "slimy fingers" and aim their appeals to "the furtive-eyed erotomaniac."<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> In 1928, Radclyffe Hall too was worried when Jonathan Cape wanted to issue <span style="font-style:italic;">The Well of Loneliness</span> in a limited edition of 1,250 copies, priced at 25 shillings. Hall was shocked because this was three times the average cost of a novel and suggested "under-the-counter sales to the prurient."<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Joyce, however, responded to the censorship of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, and the subsequent decision by Huebsch that he would be unable to publish the book unexpurgated, by seeking out a private press reliant on subscription lists: Sylvia Beach's Shakespeare and Company Bookshop.</p>
<p>If Rainey sees Beach's use of subscription lists as part of an attempt to create <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> as a special, luxury commodity, he downplays the fact that such means of dissemination had a long and complex history. It is only in retrospect that the distinctions between <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> and pornographic texts, and the literary market and the pornography trade, are straightforward. It did not look so clear-cut to some lawyers, judges, Vice Crusaders, publishers, customs officials, typists, husbands of typists, daughters of lawyers, or others at the time.</p>
<p>By downplaying this aspect of the story, we also underestimate the significance of the "something" other in Lawrence's dreams of a free publishing space, or the fictional Arkwright's claim that he serves something called "Art." The "something" other was defined by a structural logic in which censorship actively curtailed freedom of expression. The tangled and contested battle for literary freedom that resulted from the clash between texts such as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rainbow</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> and the law involved the attempt to defend "art" from accusations of obscenity. In this, the "something" other was specifically independent of the commercial trade in books. Are we to discount altogether the spirit of André Gide's statement, for example, that when he went into the Shakespeare and Company bookshop to place his order for <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, he wanted to support "the cause of freedom of expression"?</p>
<p>There was an anxiety about pornography among some modernist writers as I stated earlier in this article, not only because writers were accused of creating pornography by the legal authorities, but because there was an uncomfortable proximity between the mechanisms manipulated by publishers of banned modernist books and the pornography trade. All the more reason, then, for writers to claim for their works an artistic status free of the legally enshrined idea of the corruptible young female reader. Gide's signature is a gesture of defiance; one which joined the many signatures on petitions opposing censorship in the 1910s and 1920s. Arguments against censorship often ended up claiming a vigorous difference between pornography and art in order to extricate <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  texts such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> from the messy implications of these connections. These arguments were important: the ban on <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> was lifted in 1933 because Judge Woolsey made the groundbreaking legal ruling that art and pornography were mutually exclusive terms. In his considered view, <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> was art.</p>
<p>The obscene is a term which is taken up and played with in ever more fascinating ways in texts by Lawrence, Pound, Lewis, Joyce, Barnes, Huxley, Miller, and others; the pornographic became a word often used by modernist writers to refer to a particular kind of commercial trade in books. The attempt by writers to disentangle these complex and related words is important to the history of modernism.</p>

<div id="body">
<p>Tolerance is a defining value of liberalism, but it is also a nagging vulnerability and an embarrassment, as critics and defenders of liberalism both recognize. Liberals call tolerance "elusive," "difficult," "unstable," "contradictory," and even "impossible," but they nevertheless regard toleration as an indispensable practice not only for believers in the values of self-creation and pluralism but also for citizens of whatever persuasion in a world of cultural, moral, and ideological variety.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Many of its advocates acknowledge its flaws—for example, that tolerance can be condescending, hypocritical, and insufficiently ambitious in pursuit of justice and equality—but the only thing worse, they agree, is intolerance. As John Horton observes, "Generally, to be the object of tolerance is a welcome improvement on being the object of intolerance, but typically people do not wish themselves or their actions to be the object of either."<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> Tolerance involves acceptance, sometimes grudging, of beliefs, values, and practices with which one disagrees or of which one disapproves, and that may understandably be felt as something less than the full recognition and equal treatment that dignity and respect require. David Heyd notes that tolerance is "'compressed' between two spheres: phenomena that by no means should be tolerated (like cruelty and murder) and phenomena that should not be objected to in the first place (like gender or racial identity)."<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Both poles here are variable and contestable, however. What counts as intolerable "cruelty" is historically and culturally contingent, as are the practices and identities to which a liberal society thinks it unjust and unfair to deny full, equal recognition. Part of the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  difficulty here, as Michael Walzer points out, is that "justice is a human construction, and it is doubtful that it can be made in only one way."<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> As what Judith Shklar calls "the sense of injustice" is contested and a liberal society changes its understanding of the claims of justice, so too will it redefine where tolerance is called for and where mere toleration is not tolerable.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>A deeper problem, however, as many liberals acknowledge, is that tolerance may pretend to a neutrality that it does not have. Horton notes that "tolerance is not a virtue that stands altogether outside the moral and political conflicts it often seeks to mediate."<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> The values that guide it—for example, respect for individual self-direction, appreciation of variety, or skepticism about absolutes—may not be shared (and probably aren't) by the groups one may decide to tolerate (or not, if its values are sufficiently illiberal). Building on the criticism that tolerance is not neutral, foes of liberalism argue that tolerance is not benign, benevolent, and apolitical but is a ruse of power. Wendy Brown argues, for example, that "tolerance as a political practice is always conferred by the dominant" and is a way of containing and regulating those it marginalizes.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> By adopting a posture of open-minded acceptance of different viewpoints, according to this line of criticism, democratic tolerance seeks to disguise that it is an ideology allied to particular interests. Taking the position that it is beyond political disagreements is a strategy for protecting the prevailing order of things. Hence Herbert Marcuse's call to "t against an ideology of tolerance which, in reality, favors and fortifies the conservation of the status quo of inequality and discrimination."<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> According to this critique, the seeming neutrality of tolerance, by attempting to defuse conflict and deflect challenges to the dominant order, thereby blocks changes needed to remedy injustices and to bring about conditions of greater equality and more fulfilling community.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite all of these problems and contradictions, tolerance still has defenders because it seems at the very least a practical necessity for living side by side. As Isaiah Berlin observes: "In a world in which human rights were never trampled on, and men [and women] did not persecute each other for what they believed or what they were, the cause of toleration would not need to be defended. This, however, is not our world."<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Brown herself acknowledges that "to remove the scales from our eyes about the innocence of tolerance in relation to power is not thereby to reject tolerance as useless or worse."<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> What Brown and other critics of tolerance want, no less than its liberal defenders, is a way of practicing toleration that avoids its self-defeating difficulties and advances ideals of justice, fairness, and equality instead of thwarting them.</p>
<p>It is not enough to concede that tolerance is an imperfect virtue in an imperfect world and simply get on with it. The contradictions of tolerance suggest that practicing it unthinkingly runs the risk of undermining the aims of egalitarian democracy and inadvertently veering into intolerance, and so the reservations of its critics, whether friendly or hostile, must not simply be acknowledged and then ignored. Their criticisms point out serious problems which, if unaddressed, will subvert the claim of toleration to be a practice that supports justice and fairness.</p>
<p>The perhaps unlikely re of E. M. Forster can provide assistance in constructing a practice of toleration that is mindful of its potentially self-defeating contradictions. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Although Forster has long been regarded as an emblematic re in the liberal tradition, his name has been oddly absent from recent liberal analyses of tolerance.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> This is especially curious and unfortunate because a renewed interest among political theorists in the values and vulnerabilities of tolerance has been spurred by the debates about multiculturalism, globalization, and cosmopolitanism. The author of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Passage to India</span> has much to say about these matters.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Forster's experiences in Egypt during World War I and later in India as a secretary to the Maharaja of Dewas gave him an acute sense of the uses and potential abuses of such liberal values as individual autonomy, self-creation, and respect for the dignity and worth of different ways of being as a response to a world of permeable boundaries and shifting affiliations.</p>
<p>Forster's sexual identity also made him aware of and wary about the contradictions of tolerance. His position as a closeted homosexual whose sexual preferences were widely known among his friends but could still have landed him in prison if publicly disclosed gave him a revealing double-perspective not only on the need for tolerance but also on its shortcomings as an attitude short of full equality, dignity, and respect. Although he was widely regarded as the leading English novelist of his day, Forster felt himself an outsider to dominant institutions and attitudes, a contradictory position that expressed itself in his persistent, unremitting, if often coyly ironic challenges to prevailing views, especially when they seemed to solidify into ideologies that threatened the private sphere, the realm of individual self-direction and personal relations where he felt most himself. His liberalism and his cosmopolitanism flow from a deep sense of the primacy of the person given his understanding of himself as someone out of place in his society whose possibilities for self-creation and intimacy depended on protecting and enhancing room for difference. Forster's abiding doubleness, feeling proudly and defiantly but also defensively other, despite (or all the more because of) his prominence as a cultural authority, is at least part of why he famously declares that "if I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend, I hope I should have the guts to betray my country."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> His position as an "insider-outsider" gave Forster a unique appreciation of the power-dynamics of tolerance—how the condescending acceptance of the marginalized by the dominant may reinforce norms that are the problem in the first place—but also of its usefulness nevertheless because of the suffering he and his fellow outsiders endured from intolerance.</p>
<p>The twin foundations of Forster's liberalism are a pluralistic appreciation of the variety of defensible versions of the true and the good that might guide rewarding lives and an abiding suspicion of power and the powerful as threats to vulnerable individuals and their relations with one another. Forster's belief in the value of difference and his consequent skepticism about the incompleteness and inadequacy of any culture's defining norms are evident in his 1926 essay "Notes on the English Character," which offers a cross-cultural analysis of the necessary provincialism of national types. "No national character is complete," he writes; "We have to look for some qualities in one part of the world and others in another."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Long before Anthony Appiah and James Clifford, Forster saw and personally experienced how those with the means and mobility to cross cultural boundaries might enjoy increased possibilities for self-creation, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  even as he worried that more frequent and closer contact between people who looked, thought, and acted differently from one another would increase the likelihood of conflicts, misunderstanding, demonization, and various forms of intolerance and oppression. As he observes in this same essay, if the incompleteness of national types is an invitation to cosmopolitan self-creation, it can also be an incitement to violence: "The nations <span style="font-style:italic;">must</span> understand one another, and quickly; and without the interposition of their governments, for the shrinkage of the globe is throwing them into one another's arms" . The need to re out how to get along in a world without the self-protective comforts of homogeneity and with fewer barriers to prevent collisions between potentially disruptive differences is a concern to which he returns repeatedly in the 1930s and 40s. As he explains in his preface to <span style="font-style:italic;">Two Cheers for Democracy</span>, his collected essays from these difficult decades, "We cannot expect to love one another," but "we must learn to put up with one another. Otherwise we shall all of us perish."<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Forster's advocacy of tolerance is based on a pragmatic recognition that it is a necessary but less than ideal response to the volatile contingencies of difference.</p>
<p>His pragmatism does not let liberalism off the hook, however. Forster saw the shrinking globe as a challenge to liberal complacency about injustices its values should condemn: "I know very well how limited, and how open to criticism, English freedom is," he told a Paris "Congress of Intellectuals in Defence of Culture" in his address "Liberty in England" in 1935. While Gide, Malraux, and other French intellectuals were vying for the limelight and Stalin's agents were trying to steer the Congress behind the scenes, Forster, perhaps naïvely but with disarming candor and humility, defended English liberty by calling on it to admit and address its flaws: "It is race-bound and it's class-bound. It means freedom for the Englishman, but not for the subject-races of his Empire . . . Freedom in England is only enjoyed by people who are fairly well off . . . The hungry and the homeless don't care about liberty any more than they care about cultural heritage. To pretend that they do is cant."<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> As he wrote ten years later, just as the Second World War had ended, "The poor have kicked. The backward races are kicking—and more power to their boots."<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Forster's appreciation of difference made him aware that justice is a contestable value, and his suspicion of power and his identification with the vulnerability of the marginalized allowed him to recognize, with a skeptical clarity equal to any of liberalism's critics, that a defense of liberty could stand in the way of necessary social change unless it recognized that it was not a universal ideal but a contingent social practice and an ideology that could be exclusionary and oppressive.</p>
<p>Forster's resistance to bullying of various kinds goes hand in hand with his pluralism because both oppose the dominance of majority attitudes and prevailing norms, even when these may seem benevolent and benign. "I have no mystic faith in the people," he writes; "I have in the individual. He seems to me a divine achievement and I mistrust any view which belittles him" ("Believe" 57). Forster's liberalism is based on a fundamental faith in the value of difference (the contingent variability of the "individual" versus the oppressive homogeneity of "the people") and on the consequent need to t for the little person against the power of the great, whether the bully is a leader <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  or an institution or an authoritative way of thinking. As he wrote in his great essay, "What I Believe," composed in the difficult, anxiety-ridden summer before Munich: "I distrust Great Men. They produce a desert of uniformity around them and often a pool of blood too, and I always feel a little man's pleasure when they come a cropper" . The violence of the powerful, the vulnerability of little people, and the threat of uniformity are profoundly linked in Forster's political imagination.</p>
<p>Forster traces the variety and the vulnerability of difference to the contingencies of our mortality, as evidenced in birth and death: "The dictator-hero can grind down his citizens till they are all alike, but he cannot melt them into a single man . . . they are obliged to be born separately, and to die separately, and, owing to these unavoidable termini, will always be running off the totalitarian rails. The memory of birth and the expectation of death always lurk within the human being, making him separate from his fellows and consequently capable of intercourse with them" ("Believe" 76). It is perhaps understandable wishful thinking on Forster's part to regard our mortality as an all-powerful reminder of our differences that will always escape totalitarian control.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> The opposite is also almost self-evidently the case. Forster is elsewhere painfully aware that the contingent existence of individuals who are all too easily stamped out is proof of their weakness and evidence of their need for vigilant protection. This vulnerability is a reason for advocating tolerance in order to protect the "little person" even while recognizing that toleration is insufficient to provide the dignity and respect to which different lives are entitled.</p>
<p>Ironically self-critical but assertive toleration is an inherently contradictory practice, and guidance about how to act in a coherently self-contradictory manner is perhaps best conveyed indirectly, through the form of one's arguments and not merely their content. The lessons of Forster's ironic liberalism are most effectively communicated through his characteristically oblique style. Forster's coy, elusive manner as an essayist stages the contradictions of liberalism in order to educate the reader through its twists and turns not only about the pragmatic necessity of liberal values like tolerance but also about how these values can go wrong, fall short, and undermine themselves. Forster's indirection is also a way of acknowledging that his discourse is necessarily entangled in the workings of power it criticizes. The very precariousness of the little person who takes on the great and powerful is a reason for using oblique, ironic means rather than a frontal attack. Catching the reader off-guard and disarming defenses in advance is a kind of rhetorical guerilla warfare. Ironic indirection is David's best hope for beating Goliath even if, despite Forster's wishful optimism, David does not always win.</p>
<p>For Forster, the moral and political significance of art is linked to the vulnerability of contingent individuals that liberalism should protect and nourish. "To make us feel small in the right way," he writes, "is a function of art."<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Forster wants people to "feel small" so that they might acknowledge and appreciate their contingency, with all the splendor and vulnerability that their capacity for difference entails. This is not only a psychological strategy but also a political tactic for ting power with rhetorical power. Part of what is at stake here is suggested by Isaiah Berlin's point that "It is terrible and dangerous arrogance to believe that you alone are right."<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> For Forster as for Berlin, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  epistemological certainty is dangerous because of its will-to-power and its refusal to give difference its due. Making readers "feel small" opposes epistemological arrogance and attempts to inculcate humility about the contestability of their views. Shaming them out of their certainties may then make readers feel the contingency they share with their fellow mortals, and this in turn might be a first step toward reconsidering firmly entrenched habits and beliefs that would otherwise be resistant to dislodging by logical arguments.</p>
<p>One of the best examples of Forster's provocative indirectness is his essay "Jew Consciousness," published in January 1939, two months after the destruction of synagogues and Jewish property by Hitler's goons during "Kristallnacht." Forster characteristically takes up the topic of anti-Semitism not by directly condemning the atrocities in Germany but by examining an English institution that had been a source of national pride. If English patriots anxious about impending war in the months after Munich might like to remember that the playing fields of Eton had produced heroic victories in the past, Forster recalls his school-days differently:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Long, long ago, while Queen Victoria reigned, I attended two preparatory schools. At the first of these, it was held to be a disgrace to have a sister. Any little boy who possessed one was liable to get teased . . . Public opinion was not bitter on the point, but it was quite definite. Sisters were disgraceful. I got through all right myself, because my conscience was clear, and though charges were brought against me from time to time they always fell through.</p>
<p>It was a very different story at my second school. Here, sisters were negligible, but it was a disgrace to have a mother. Crabbe's mother, Gob's mother, eeugh! No words were too strong, no sounds too shrill. And since mothers at that time of life are commoner than sisters, and also less biddable, the atmosphere of this school was less pleasant, and the sense of guilt stronger. Nearly every little boy had a mother in a cupboard, and dreadful revelations occurred.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The point of the analogy between these instances of seemingly trivial adolescent stupidity and the ugliness and brutality of the Nazi persecution of Jews is not only to unsettle his reader's complacency that only the barbaric Germans could be guilty of such nonsense; it is also to induce humility in the reader about the contingency of the differential positions that racial prejudice naturalizes:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Those preparatory schools prepared me for life better than I realised, for having passed through two imbecile societies, a sister-conscious and a mother-conscious, I am now invited to enter a third. I am asked to consider whether the people I meet and talk about are or are not Jews, and to form no opinion on them until this fundamental point has been settled. What revolting tosh! . . . Jew-consciousness is in the air, and it remains to be seen how far it will succeed in poisoning it . . . Today, the average man suspects the people he dislikes of being Jews, and is surprised when the people he likes are Jews. Having been a Gentile at my first preparatory school and a Jew at my second, I know what I am talking about. I know how the poison works, and I know too that if the average man is anyone in particular he is a preparatory school boy.</p>
<div class="attrib"> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Instead of appealing to universal moral values to condemn the cruelty and inhumanity of anti-Semitism, Forster takes the more indirect route of dramatizing for his readers their own vulnerability to shifting categories of social exclusion. Tolerance is not an apolitical ethical attitude but a pragmatic response to contingencies of classification that define the powerful and the powerless—and that can change, so that today's Gentile may become tomorrow's Jew (the obvious but unspoken analogy here is the variable contingency of Forster's own doubleness as a cultural authority and a sexual outlaw).<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Forster's anecdote implicates the reader uncomfortably in mechanisms of social solidification that cannot simply be dismissed as a foreign aberration because they represent a society's use of the contingencies of classification for political purposes that threaten the vulnerable (i.e., potentially everyone, or at least anyone with a mother).</p>
<p>The surprise of the analogy and the obliqueness of the approach are typical of Forster's style. The rationale for this indirectness, he explains, is that "the only effective check to silliness is silliness of a cleverer type" . W. H. Auden made a similar point more directly: "The best reason I have for opposing Fascism is that at school I lived in a Fascist state."<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Forster would agree, but he prefers to say so obliquely and ironically. As he explains elsewhere, "I have the sort of mind that likes to be taken unawares. The frontal full-dress presentation of an opinion often repels me, but if it be insidiously slipped in sidewise I may receive it" ("Book" 222). If the surprise induced by a "sidewise" approach may feel "insidious," Forster's mischievousness suggests that deviousness may be necessary to t power with rhetorical power. Although he stopped writing novels after <span style="font-style:italic;">A Passage to India</span> appeared in 1924, his manner as an essayist is that of a ruminative narrator whose seeming casualness sets the reader up for the rhetorical turn that will take us off guard, disorienting in order to reorient.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Rather than come at the reader straight-on in a way that might prompt objections or resistance, Forster welcomes our confidence in order to prepare us to accept a point about the pervasiveness of the behavior he derides that is more sweeping and unsettling than Auden's indictment of public school tyranny and that the reader might have dismissed without the set-up. Not merely the civility of a liberal British gentleman, these are the tactics of a David who takes on Goliath by pretending not to be combative while preparing a blow that is all the more effective because it is unexpected.</p>
<p>Forster is not saying that all Englishmen are Nazis at heart, but he is calling for candor, humility, and self-criticism in a hostile environment where the anxieties of the time were a temptation to defensive oversimplification and a rejection of the uncomfortable contradictions of a vulnerable, contingent existence. He realizes that he is writing in what he called in another essay of the period a "post-Munich world," where the general relief about the peace Chamberlain seemed to have achieved by his concessions to Hitler the previous September was as great as the anxiety that it wouldn't last and that a war for which Britain was ill-prepared was inevitable very soon. "The state of being half-frightened and half-thinking about something else at the same time is the state of many English people today," Forster writes, and such "worry is terribly insidious; besides taking the joy out of life, it prevents the victim from being detached and from observing the human experiment. It tempts him to simplify, since through simplification he may <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  find peace." For Forster, however, "the only satisfactory release is to be found in the direction of complexity."<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Rhetorical strategies emphasizing complexity and resisting simplification—reminding readers of the contingency and contestability of their beliefs and exposing the contradictions bedevilling seemingly self-evident positions—are for him ways of using power to resist and oppose epistemological power.</p>
<p>Combating the temptations of simplicity and holding one's mind open to the contradictions of contingency are necessary for the defense of freedom, self-creation, and difference at a time when those are under threat, not just from the Fascists in Germany, Italy, and Spain, but from the patriots and the authorities and the psychological pressures at home. "All is lost if the totalitarians destroy us. But all is equally lost if we have nothing left to lose," he writes; the dilemma, he feels, is "that if Fascism wins we are done for, and that we must become Fascist to win" ("Post-Munich" 23). His strategy of ironic indirection is not only a way of resisting the simplifications of accepted ideas and authoritative opinion. It is also a strategy for using power, as one must to t the bully at home or abroad, without replicating the tyranny and intolerance one is resisting. This is a necessarily contradictory practice, and the indirections of style are an attempt to enact it coherently and self-critically, without lapsing into paralysis or becoming a bully oneself.</p>
<p>Forster's essay "Jew-Consciousness" reflects his concern about the temptations of simplification and his belief that ironic indirection is the best way to defend and teach critical, coherently self-contradictory complexity: "I don't think we shall ever reintroduce ghettos into England; I wouldn't say for certain, since no one knows what wickedness may not develop in his country or in himself if circumstances change. I don't think we shall go savage. But I do think we shall go silly. Many people have done so already" . Anti-Semitism is an example of such silliness, and that makes it all the more dangerous because easier to fall into than blatantly brutal savagery. If prejudices that build community by demonizing others are a defense against anxieties, whether those of adolescence or of a nation facing the threat of war, then this shows how weak reason is as an antidote to superstition, violence, and the vulnerabilities of contingency: "To me, anti-Semitism is now the most shocking of all things. It is destroying much more than the Jews; it is assailing the human mind at its source, and inviting it to create false categories before exercising judgment" . The weakness of reason is, however, why Forster tries to sneak up on the reader through ironic indirectness rather than delivering a straightforward, step-by-step argument. "Cool reasonableness would be best of all, of course, but it does not work in the world of today any better than in my preparatory schools" . Making people ashamed of themselves is more effective: "The best way of confuting it is to say sneeringly, 'That's propaganda.' When 'That's propaganda' has been repeated several times, the sniggering stops, for no goose likes to think that he has been got at" .</p>
<p>ting fire with fire, if the susceptibility to prejudice shows how vulnerable people are to blindly accepting what others think, then embarrassing them into behaving reasonably (lest others think them foolish) may be more effective than providing logical arguments for doing so. If Forster imagines that reasons might nevertheless work, it is not because of a Habermasian faith in the unforced force of the better argument <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  but because their rhetorical power may compel rethinking by catching the reader off-guard: "There is another reply which is more intellectual but which requires more courage. It is to say, 'Are you sure you're not a Jew yourself? Do you know who your eight great-grandparents were? Can you swear that all the eight are Aryan?'" . Are you sure you don't have a sister or, horror of horrors, a mother?</p>
<p>Forster follows his own advice about ting silliness with strategic counter-silliness in "Racial Exercise," first published in March 1939, two months after his essay on anti-Semitism. He begins disarmingly and ironically: "Let us do some easy exercises in Racial Purity. And let me offer myself for dissection-purposes."<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> Taking up his question about the necessary ambiguities of genealogy, he asks again: "Can you give the names of your eight great-grandparents? The betting is eight to one that you cannot" . In his own case, he says, "If I go the right way about it, I come of an old English family"—"right back to a certain Richard of Sykes Dyke who flourished somewhere about the year 1400"—"and am proud of it" :</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Unfortunately in other directions the prospect is less extensive. If I take a wrong turning and miss the Sykes', darkness descends on my origins almost at once. Mrs. James is a case in point, and a very mortifying one. Mrs. James was a widow who not so very long ago married one of my great-grandfathers. I am directly descended from her, know nothing whatever about her, and should like at all events to discover her maiden name. Vain quest. She disappears in the mists of ambiguity . . . She might be anyone, she may not even have been Aryan. When her shadow crosses my mind, I do not feel to belong to an old family at all.</p>
<div class="attrib">(17–18)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Silent sympathy with Hitler's assertions of Nordic pride certainly existed in England, and not only among Sir Oswald Mosley's Black Shirts. The point of this little "exercise" is not just to combat the stupid arrogance of racial superiority, however; it is also to question the whole idea of "purity" and the purposes it serves.</p>
<p>Forster is not trying to knock down a straw man but, rather, to dislodge through irony and indirectness—combating "silliness" with "silliness of a cleverer type"—a powerful habit of mind that he understands full well because it is a defense against the human, all too human sense of vulnerability and contingency:</p>

<p>Community of race is an illusion. Yet belief in race is a growing psychological force, and we must reckon with it. People like to feel that they are all of a piece, and one of the ways of inducing that feeling is to tell them that they come of pure stock. That explains the ease with which the dictators are putting their pseudo-science across. No doubt they are not cynical about it, and take themselves in by what they say. But they have very cleverly hit on a weak spot in the human equipment—the desire to feel a hundred per cent, no matter what the percentage is in.</p>
<div class="attrib"></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">If our mortality is evidence of our precious individuality, this littleness can also make us feel anxious, weak, and alone, and feeling at one with something larger and more complete than oneself can seem to provide a refuge against contingency. The temptations of purity—the desire to feel homogeneous, whole, and harmonious rather than <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  different, deficient, and incomplete—are especially troublesome to Forster because they are integral to the psychological landscape of individualism and to the political challenges of contingency. Forster's belief in the value of the individual is not a naïvely self-confident ontological universal but is deeply informed by a sense of how precarious and uncomfortable difference can be because it is historical, variable, and contingent through and through.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to make cosmopolitan heterogeneity seem chic or exotic, Forster calls it a "mongrel" condition, a deliberately unattractive metaphor that turns racial thinking against itself in order to provoke reflection about the dangerous, all-too-easy temptations of purity. "Whether there ever was such an entity as a 'pure race' is debatable," he writes, "but there certainly is not one in Europe today—the internationalisms of the Roman Empire and of the Middle Ages have seen to that. Consequently there never can be a pure race in the future. Europe is mongrel forever, and so is America" . Earlier cosmopolitanisms of imperial conquest have made mixture and difference inescapable. Against simplistic biological essentialism, impurity is a stubborn historical fact. Although Forster understands heterogeneity as an opportunity for personal self-creation, he warns against underestimating the cruelty and barbarity that mixed breeds are capable of: "We only know that we are all of us mongrels, dark haired and light haired, who must learn not to bite one another" . As incomplete, deficient, and vulnerable individuals, we are prone to violence and susceptible to temptations that seem to offer an escape from contingency. Recognizing and coming to terms with the psychological appeal of homogeneity in a "mongrel" world is, for Forster, politically necessary to preserve the possibility that differential self-creation and non-conforming personal relations might stand a chance.</p>
<p>Typically turning the rhetorical weapons of his opponents against themselves, Forster uses a biological analogy to counter racial essentialism. At a time before eugenics had been discredited by the atrocities of the Holocaust and other forms of ethnic cleansing, Forster finds in evolutionary thinking not an invitation to genetic engineering in pursuit of racial purity but a resource for liberal individualism and a defense of the value of aberration. He makes this turn by offering for contemplation what he calls "the civilising re of Mendel":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>He embodies a salutary principle, and even when we are superficial about him, he helps to impress it in our minds. He suggests that no stock is pure, and that it may at any moment throw up forms which are unexpected, and which it inherits from the past. His best-known experiments were with the seeds of the pea. It is impossible that human beings can be studied as precisely as peas—too many factors are involved. But they too keep throwing up recessive characteristics, and cause us to question the creed of racial purity.</p>
<div class="attrib"></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Instead of refusing biological thinking as a temptation to essentialism, Forster uses Mendel to turn the race-based genetic argument upside down and, in the process, suggests a more accurate interpretation of the political implications of the mechanisms of Darwinian evolution.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> The example of Mendel recalls that for Darwin the production of variants is a crucial driving force in evolution by providing ever-new possibilities <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of adaptation for species to test in their struggle for survival. It turns out to be a good thing for evolution and the survival of species that they are impure, that DNA does not replicate itself perfectly, but that the ever-changing heterogeneity of a species provides a variety of adaptations that can respond to environmental conditions that also do not stand still. For Forster, of course, it is less the scientific accuracy of the analogy that matters than its rhetorical force: "Thanks to Mendel and to a few simple exercises we can see comparatively clearly into the problem of race, if we choose to look, and can do a little to combat the pompous and pernicious rubbish that is at present being prescribed in the high places of the earth" . Toppling the high and mighty by the power of the recessive pea exemplifies Forster's strategy of taking the great by surprise and demonstrating the unexpected resources of the small.</p>
<p>The case Forster makes for the core liberal value of "tolerance" is based on an ironic recognition of the dangers of purity. In his essay "Tolerance," which was first delivered as a BBC broadcast in early July 1941 and then published a few weeks later, Forster imagines what will be needed to rebuild civilization after the war. His contrarian thinking not only opposes the Nazi dream of "a new order in Europe" but also questions the patriotic visions of "reconstructing London beautifully" proposed by English politicians who were trying to lift spirits shaken by the long winter of the Blitz and pessimism about the war's outcome (a few months earlier Forster had broadcast a talk entitled "What Would Germany Do to Us?" if she won, which was not an idle question at the time). Concerned to counter what he calls a "perilous and vague sentimentalism" that was in the air, Forster writes: "Most people, when asked what spiritual quality is needed to rebuild civilisation, will reply 'Love.' . . . Respectfully but firmly, I disagree. Love is a great force in private life; it is indeed the greatest of all things: but love in public affairs does not work."<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>Part of his argument is tough-minded pragmatism: "The fact is we can only love what we know personally. And we cannot know much" . But his deeper concern is that simple-minded talk about how "Love is what is needed" not only ignores hard truths about the imperfections of social relations but would itself be a dangerous force for purification and homogeneity:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>The world is very full of people—appallingly full; it has never been so full before, and they are all tumbling over each other. Most of these people one doesn't know and some of them one doesn't like; doesn't like the colour of their skins, say, or the shapes of their noses, or the way they blow them or don't blow them, or the way they talk, or their smell, or their clothes, or their fondness for jazz or their dislike of jazz, and so on. Well, what is one to do? There are two solutions. One of them is the Nazi solution. If you don't like people, kill them, banish them, segregate them, and then strut up and down proclaiming that you are the salt of the earth. The other way is much less thrilling, but it is on the whole the way of the democracies, and I prefer it. If you don't like people, put up with them as well as you can. Don't try to love them: you can't, you'll only strain yourself. But try to tolerate them. On the basis of that tolerance a civilised future may be built.</p>
<div class="attrib">(45–46)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Although Forster does not say so directly, the uncomfortable implication is that "Love" has more in common with "the Nazi solution" than with the tolerance he prefers. Forster <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  worries that "Love" is not simply a sentimental illusion but potentially a fascistic force in public life because it would run roughshod over differences. In Forster's view, human relations are rife with negativity—full of deficiencies, unpleasantness, disagreements large and small—and the homogenizing force of "Love" is not only dangerously unrealistic but also potentially oppressive in its embrace.</p>
<p>Ever vigilant to preserve and protect the sphere of personal self-creation and the possibility of individual differences, Forster is not only more modest in his demands and expectations but is also deeply suspicious of the will-to-power of idealism: "I have lost all faith in positive militant ideals; they can so seldom be carried out without thousands of human beings getting maimed or imprisoned" . Forster consequently rejects the idealism of "Love." Instead of the "three cheers" that he says "Love the Beloved Republic" would deserve, he offers only "Two Cheers for Democracy," and, he says, "Two cheers are quite enough" ("Believe" 70). The contingencies and contradictions of social relations call instead for "tolerance" which, he concedes, "is a very dull virtue. It is boring. Unlike love, it has always had a bad press. It is negative. It merely means putting up with people, being able to stand things" ("Tolerance" 45). But the very "negativity" of tolerance is what he values because it leaves room for difference and resists homogenizing forces of various kinds.</p>
<p>Although Forster describes tolerance as essentially "negative" (it includes "not being huffy, touchy, irritable, revengeful" [46]), it is not for him a weak or easy virtue. For one thing, "it entails imagination. For you have all the time to be putting yourself in someone else's place. Which is a desirable spiritual exercise" . If a liability of individualism is its potential for apolitical, asocial isolation, then the practice of toleration that Forster urges counters the self-centeredness of the private sphere with an imagination for how others are feeling, whether (to cite Forster's ever-widening circle of examples) in a queue or the Tube, "in the street, in the office, at the factory," or even "between classes, races, and nations" . Nor is tolerance, as Forster envisions it, an invitation to indifference and disengagement. Forster's notion of tolerance is informed by a deep skepticism about the easy arrogance of self-righteousness and a vigilant appreciation for injustice. For example, as he writes with characteristically disarming self-criticism: "it is very easy to see fanaticism in other people, but difficult to spot in oneself. Take the evil of racial prejudice. We can easily detect it in the Nazis . . . But we ourselves—are we guiltless? We are far less guilty than they are. Yet is there no racial prejudice in the British Empire? Is there no colour question?" (47–48). Ever wary of smugness and complacency, Forster recognizes that the refusal to ask hard questions and to confront unpleasant contradictions and complexities is not benign. His conception of tolerance is consequently not a way of turning a blind eye to prejudice and injustice but a call to turn the spotlight on them. Not simply passive and accepting, it necessitates a tough-minded suspicion of prevailing ideologies and institutions. Requiring both imagination and criticism, "tolerance" as Forster conceives it is anything but the easy way of deflecting opposition and suppressing difference its critics rightly worry it can be. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Forster's suspicion of "militant ideals" and "fanaticism" also responds to two other frequent criticisms of liberalism—that it is too weak to t for itself against illiberal opponents or that, if it does, it reveals its fundamental hypocrisy because it is not all-accepting and value-free. "Tolerance is not the same as weakness," he writes; "Putting up with people does not mean giving in to them" . Forster unabashedly admits, for example, that he is intolerant of intolerance, and necessarily so. Militantly anti-militant, he would have no difficulty joining contemporary liberals who accept all modes of self-creation except for "authoritarian identities" that do not accept the rule of mutual toleration (the Taliban is an often cited example). Forster would also agree on the need to set limits on the demands of so-called "greedy communities" that seek to impose their values and beliefs not only on their own members (refusing them the right of exit) but also on others in the community of communities that a liberal democracy aims to foster.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>When Forster states his articles of faith, he famously declares: "I do not believe in Belief" ("Believe" 67). This negative formulation recognizes the need to oppose the will-to-power of illiberal creeds with an equal and opposite force—not only the power of skeptical criticism but also the values this negative creed is intent on preserving, including individual self-creation, the privacy of personal relations, and the possibility of non-normative ways of being. Forster did not agree with fellow Bloomsbury-ite Clive Bell, who took the pacifism of many 30s liberal intellectuals to its logical extreme in a 1938 pamphlet entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">War Mongers</span>: "A Nazi Europe would be, to my mind, heaven on earth compared with Europe at war . . . the worst tyranny is better than the best war . . . War is the worst of all evils."<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Forster can imagine worse evils than war, even if he understands the Tolstoyan argument that one resists evil only by becoming what one opposes. Hence his worry about becoming fascist as one ts fascism but his recognition that this is a risk one must take.</p>
<p>Forster acknowledges that his liberal values constitute a "faith," worth ting and dying for, and he states his reasons with typical irony that deflects and disarms the criticisms to which it is open by acknowledging their validity in advance. He notes, first of all, that he is in the same contradictory position as all believers: "Since to ignore evidence is one of the characteristics of faith, I certainly can proclaim that I believe in personal relationships" ("Believe" 68), not only because they fail more often than not to justify one's confidence in them, but also because they can only succeed if one continues to believe despite the abundance of contrary indicators. Secondly, he notes that</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>there lies at the back of every creed something terrible and hard for which the worshipper may one day be required to suffer, and there is even a terror and a hardness in this creed of personal relationships, urbane and mild though it sounds. Love and loyalty to an individual can run counter to the claims of the State. When they do—down with the State, say I, which means that the State would down me.</p>
<div class="attrib">("Believe" 69)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Given his awareness of the pervasiveness of bullying even in a democracy, coupled with his wariness of how democratic institutions may become instruments of oppression, Forster is not as sanguine as some contemporary liberal philosophers that conflicts can <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  be mediated, resolved, or defused when the interests of a democratic society clash with the variety of projects of self-creation its pluralism should foster.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>Forster can imagine an irreconcilable conflict between the political demands of a well-ordered democratic society and the defining moral values of his liberalism, and his belief in those beliefs, despite their small "b," trumps his duties as a citizen, with consequences he acknowledges and accepts. Forster's allegiance to democracy as a political conception is secondary to his belief in individual differences and the entitlement of the little person to his or her own view of a good life. The possibilities of self-creation and non-normative personal relations that pluralism should enable are more fundamental to Forster than the democratic institutions whose purpose, in his view, is to preserve and protect them. His allegiance to those political structures is consequently conditional on their effectiveness in doing so.</p>
<p>These concerns inform the "two cheers" that Forster thinks democracy deserves: "one because it admits variety and two because it permits criticism" ("Believe" 70). As these "two cheers" suggest, the value of democracy in Forster's view is that it allows practices ("criticism") and states of affairs ("variety") that counteract the tendency of the political conception to become coercive. The usefulness of criticism for Forster is that it resists the state's imposition of control and conformity. The value of "variety" is that it encourages a flourishing of differences against the tendency of political consensus to uniformity and homogeneity.</p>
<p>Militant in its anti-militancy even where his own values are concerned, Forster's faith in self-creation and relations between individuals is a deliberately self-contradictory creed that calls for suspicion even as he continues to believe. The fact that "there is a terror and even a hardness" in his creed is something that he is proud of but also troubled by because of his suspicion of fanaticism and militancy of all kinds. As an ideology skeptical of self-righteous, intolerant ideologies, Forster's liberalism is also mindful of the liability of its own constitutive beliefs to fall into the rigidity, absolutism, and sentimental oversimplification he criticizes. Recognizing these contradictions without allowing them to become paralyzing is a difficult trick, and this is another reason why irony and indirectness are Forster's preferred modes. The fragility of Forster's contradictory stance is, however, also a reason why the bully oblivious to irony and indirectness is in a stronger position and can all too easily prevail. (This is not something Forster was always clear about. After the war, he wrote in defense of his liberalism's "softness": "I have seen plenty of hardness" and "I know it does not even pay," citing as proof Mussolini "hanging upside-down like a turkey, with his dead mistress swinging beside him" ["Challenge" 56]. Well, the Mussolinis don't always lose, and often it's the "soft" who hang.)</p>
<p>Forster shares the concern of liberalism's critics that it itself may become a coercive regime. As he writes in his reflections on "Liberty in England" in 1935: "Our danger from Fascism—unless a war starts when anything may happen—is negligible. We're menaced by something much more insidious—by what I call 'Fabio-Fascism,' by the dictator-spirit working quietly away behind the facade of constitutional forms" (65–66). Administrative regulation and efficiency worry Forster not only because even socially <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  progressive bureaucrats can be domineering and condescending (the expert's claim to know best what a citizen needs is a particularly noxious version of epistemological arrogance). More fundamentally, Forster fears that bureaucracy as such is defined by a "dictator-spirit" because of the oppressive force of administrative rationality. If bureaucracy is tyrannical, that is because its insistence on conformity and regulation can become yet another form of bullying that threatens individual differences and non-normative behavior. Worse, the coercive tendencies of administrative rule may be less visible in a liberal regime than they might be in an actual dictatorship because they are disguised by the defensive coloration of democratic consensus. The machine of administrative instrumentalism may itself endanger individual liberty, he fears, and the justification of "constitutional forms" may make this all the harder to recognize and resist.</p>
<p>Forster finds it a merit of democracy that "it permits criticism" because dissent, disagreement, and even quiet questioning can be used to t back against the bully. Hence his praise for the back-bencher in Parliament, "the Private Member who makes himself a nuisance. He gets snubbed and is told that he is cranky or ill-informed, but he does expose abuses which would otherwise never have been mentioned, and very often an abuse gets put right just by being mentioned" ("Believe" 69, 70). The back-bencher who evades the controlling structures of government or party and makes his voice heard even (or especially) when this is not welcome is an example of the little person whom Forster cheers on against the dominance of the great and mighty. Forster is not naïve, however, about the capacity of bureaucrats and politicians to deflect resistance and stifle dissent. His 1939 essay "Our Deputation" is an amusing if sobering depiction of how a government official defuses a protest: "Was the interview going to be an unfriendly one? No, no, nothing as definite as that. Civilities were re-exchanged, time was up, we thanked and were counter-thanked, our opinions were to be given their full weight, and performing a final can-can, the Minister slipped from the room. He had performed his duty, and we ours"—and presumably nothing will change.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Nevertheless, democracy does have the advantage in Forster's view of allowing the little person room to maneuver by making possible strategies of evasion, protest, and resistance.</p>
<p>As Forster notes, "the fact that our rulers have to <span style="font-style:italic;">pretend</span> to like freedom is an advantage" ("Liberty" 65; original emphasis). The cynicism of this comment acknowledges that democracy is a regime of power, like all political structures. What the little person consequently needs is not ideal sentiments but tactics and strategies that will be effective in defending and advancing his or her interests. Canny use of the rhetorical powers that democratic values make available is a non-idealistic way of defending the ideal. Shaming leaders to do the right thing even if for the wrong reasons—to avoid embarrassment rather than because they recognize the logical and moral force of an argument—is a way for the small to turn the tables on the great in the never-ending battle against the bully. The fact that shaming tactics rather than rational argument may be necessary acknowledges the vulnerability of democratic values to abuse and hypocrisy, but the fact that liberal values can be used as political instruments to preserve and enhance liberty is for Forster a reason for preferring democracy to more coercive regimes where such strategies would not work. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Forster's suspicion of administrative rationality and his willingness to t back are evident in an entertaining BBC broadcast on "The Police versus the Public" that he did in 1932 with his lifelong intimate friend, the unfortunately named policeman Bob Buckingham. Meeting in a train, Forster thinks Buckingham's suitcase belongs to someone else and (bizarrely) attempts to heave it out a window. Buckingham rescues his case, and the two strangers strike up a conversation, in which Bob complains about various popular prejudices toward the police and brags about the training they receive. Forster asks: "This excellent education they give you, . . . does it make you human?" Buckingham replies: "I should hope not . . . The public doesn't want us to be human beings, with human faults. It wants us to be a machine on which it can rely . . . If I may say so, isn't it rather a pity to keep on grumbling against the Police and everything the way you do?" Bob is then taken aback by sharpness of Forster's reply:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>It is not a pity and I shall continue to grumble. And I'll tell you why. This bickering ungenerous attitude of the general public whom I represent; this endless uninformed ungracious criticism of the Police and their ways; I suggest to you it's much more valuable than you think. It keeps you up to the mark [Buckingham interjects: "Well I'm blessed," but Forster continues]. . . Our mark, not yours. It counteracts your officialism. It helps you to be human beings and at the bottom of your hearts you should be grateful for it.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The vehemence of Forster's riposte is yet further evidence that his liberalism is not quietistic. This soft, mild-mannered intellectual could be tough and forceful, and appearances to the contrary only work to his advantage because they allow him to catch his interlocutor off guard, as he does here with poor Bob.</p>
<p>Reflecting his concern with the "dictator-spirit" lurking behind administrative rationality, Forster worries in this exchange that "officialism" is a danger to the individual human being and needs to be held in check. A bureaucrat, even an educated one, may easily forget that he or she is human rather than an instrument in a well-regulated, smoothly functioning machine (Bob's ideal impersonal police force). Reminding administrators that they too are mortal is an important form of resistance to the bullying tendencies of bureaucratic anonymity. A democracy is not necessarily a police-state, however, as long as "grumbling" of the sort Forster defends and enacts can counter the "dictator-spirit" of "officialism." Once again the point is not that liberal democracy is a regime outside of force and power (Forster knows it isn't) but, rather, that it provides the small with weapons and tactical resources with which to defend their differences.</p>
<p>As a public intellectual, Forster sees his role as teaching readers how to t the bully wherever they may find him, including in themselves. Forster's answer to the question of why anyone should pay attention to the thoughts of a novelist and a literary critic about contemporary political developments has less to do with his authority as a commentator on the events of the day than with his capacity as a writer to use the resources of a novelist to give rise to thought. His essays are memorable not because he seeks to compete with his Bloomsbury friends Leonard Woolf or John Maynard Keynes in analyzing specific political questions or economic issues in order to make statements about social policy. The content of his essays taken as a guide to policy-makers <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  is thin to non-existent, and Forster would not have been taken seriously if he had pretended to an expertise he did not have. The value of his political writings comes not only from the moral authority of a novelist who is attuned to the personal implications of social problems but also, and perhaps even more, from their narrative style. It is the surprises, the ironic twists and turns, and the tonic challenges to smugness, self-certainty, and oversimplification that make his essays effective as criticism and as social commentary. Forster the public intellectual is a writer whose power comes not from his expertise as a social scientist but from his narrative skill as a teacher of the art of ironic criticism in his very manner as an essayist.</p>
<p>The strengths and weaknesses of Forster's posture as a public intellectual are a reflection of the powers and vulnerabilities of his ironic style. Like all styles, his indirectness has its advantages and disadvantages. It is arguably less effective than a direct approach, although it is not clear that a Malraux or an Orwell (say) accomplished more. To his credit, Forster never succumbed to the intellectual's illusion that he could change the world by the power of his thought and writing alone. The strength of Forster's style is its combination of clarity and complexity. Unswerving in his advocacy of a creed that he simultaneously questions, Forster straightforwardly asserts a simple set of values even as he does so with a wry indirectness that encourages contrary thinking and an all-encompassing skepticism. He delights in bold gestures of provocation even as he is ever humbly alert to the dangers of oversimplification and the temptations of self-certainty. Forster describes his political writings as "the reflections of an individualist and a liberal who has found liberalism crumbling beneath him and at first felt ashamed. Then, looking around, he decided there was no special reason for shame, since other people, whatever they felt, were equally insecure" ("Challenge" 76). What they need to address these insecurities, he thinks, is not reassurance but the courage of ironic self-examination that a novelist can teach by example and (most of all) by the contradictions of his indirect style.</p>

This oversight is not accidental but is evidence of the unfortunate disconnection between Anglo-American political philosophy and contemporary literary theory, despite the invocation of literature and literary concepts by Kwame Anthony Appiah, Martha Nussbaum, Richard Rorty, and others (often without an adequate understanding of the issues at stake; for example, see my critique of Rorty's notions of irony and reading in <span style="font-style:italic;">Play and the Politics of Reading: The Social Uses of Modernist Form</span> [Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 2005], 10-15).Politically minded literary critics have contributed to this disconnection by tending to over-simplify liberalism, routinely dismissing it as epistemologically naïve and politically reactionary. As my summary of the debate about "tolerance" should suggest, liberal political theorists tend to be acutely aware of dilemmas about which literary critics think them clueless. A recent example of this animus toward liberalism is Lauren M. E. Goodland's revealingly titled essay about Forster's advocacy of the value of "care," a liberal value she wrongly but understandably (given the current climate) feels she can defend only by distancing him from liberal politics and caricaturing liberals as lacking intellectual courage (see "Where Liberals Fear to Tread: E. M. Forster's Queer Internationalism and the Ethics of Care," <span style="font-style:italic;">Novel</span> 39, no. 3 [Summer 2006]: 307-36). Important studies of Forster's liberalism by literary critics begin with Lionel Trilling, <span style="font-style:italic;">E. M. Forster</span> (New York: New Directions, 1943) and include Frederick Crews, <span style="font-style:italic;">E. M. Forster: The Perils of Humanism</span> (Princeton: Princeton UP, 1962); Michael Levenson, <span style="font-style:italic;">Modernism and the Fate of Individuality: Character and Novelistic Form from Conrad to Woolf</span> (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1990), 78-93; and Brian May, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Modernist as Pragmatist: E. M. Forster and the Fate of Liberalism</span> (Columbia: U of Missouri P, 1997). My essay tries to connect literary and philosophical concerns by reading Forster's political essays through the lens of contemporary liberal political theory—but with an attention to the workings of style that it typically overlooks.</p></div>

History and power analytically vanish as constitutive of the attributes and positioning of those subjects considered to be in need of tolerance . . . This disappearance of power and history obscures not only the sources of conflict, violence, or subordination but also their subject-making capacity" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Regulating Aversion</span>, 142-43).

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f32" href="#f32-text">32. </a>The classic statement of this position is John Rawls's view that "reasonable pluralism" entails an allegiance to a "political conception" of a "well-ordered society" that makes a citizen's "comprehensive moral doctrine" secondary to a notion of "justice as fairness" that is "neutral" to different value-systems (see Rawls, <span style="font-style:italic;">Justice as Fairness: A Restatement</span>, ed. Erin Kelly [Cambridge: Harvard UP, 2001], especially 3-12, 187-93). Forster recognizes, as Rawls does not, that the very claim to "comprehensiveness" of the differing views of the good life that a pluralistic society welcomes can conflict with the similarly all-encompassing demand of liberalism for acceptance of its founding assumptions. For a useful summary of the controversy surrounding Rawls's position among liberal philosophers, see Appiah, <span style="font-style:italic;">Ethics of Identity</span>, 79-83.</p></div>

<p>This temperamental statement on the priority of radio over surrealism appears in a small book, titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Pour un art radiophonique</span>  and written by the French radio pioneer Paul Deharme in an attempt to prove to himself and his readers that indeed, surrealism and radio could be distinguished from each other. In principle, radio broadcasting seemed to Deharme a surrealist medium par excellence. Similar to the surrealist automatic writing, it made its audience listen to the dictate of an unknown voice; also, it allowed for instantaneous communication between audiences all over the world that resembled the quasi telepathic communication achieved by the first members of the movement <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  in their creative sessions. How could the surrealists not be taken in by a medium that seemed to promise liberation from analytical "written" reasoning and grant access to a mass audience that had been out of reach until then? And yet, surrealist radio broadcasting would remain an experiment, created by a team of three men, Paul Deharme, Robert Desnos, and Alejo Carpentier, who had taken their distance with André Breton and his group. Together they would, during the 1930s, put in place an experimental radio practice that aimed at being better than surrealism itself. In the following I trace the uneasy dialogue of those first radio professionals with surrealism and demonstrate what was at stake when "radiophonic" art and surrealism coalesced.</p>
<p>The first twenty years of radio broadcasting had been characterized by the rapid global expansion of the new medium; public as well as private radio stations experimented with formats and purposes of radio programming.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, those who were in charge of the first radio programs rarely had professional training as writers and inversely, those who wrote about radio would not necessarily know how to make it. Even though avant-garde artists and writers all over the world became interested early on in radio as a new communication medium, few of them bothered to learn about the technology itself. The idea and potential of radio, however, fascinated many, including the Russian Futurist Velimir Khlebnikov, who wrote an essay on "The Radio of the Future," and the Italian Futurists, who from 1914 on wrote about radio as a way of liberating speech.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> In Spain, the medium was promoted by Ramón Gómez de la Serna's radio chronicles and <span style="font-style:italic;">greguerías</span>, and in Mexico the <span style="font-style:italic;">estridentista</span> group, as Rubén Gallo tells us, became so fascinated with radio that they named their first journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Irradiador</span>.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> In England, Ezra Pound wrote a set of radio operas in the 1930s for the BBC. As Sarah Wilson has shown, listening to the radio made Gertrude Stein reconsider the importance of a participatory audience in the new public sphere; however, this new preoccupation of hers was reflected in her writing, not in activities related to radio as such.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The French surrealists presented a more complicated picture. If, according to Christopher Schiff, early French surrealist theater had experimented with sound, noise, and radio, André Breton's group did not engage with the wireless; on the contrary, Breton made his distaste for music and sound known in <span style="font-style:italic;">Surrealism and Painting</span>: "Auditive images, in fact, are inferior to visual images not only in clarity but also in strictness, and, with all due respect to a few megalomaniacs, they are not destined to strengthen the idea of human greatness."<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> To whom was Breton referring when speaking about the "megalomaniacs of the auditive image"?</p>
<p>In France, with its combination of public and private radio stations and an especially fierce competition among them, the incentives for making creative use of the medium were strong.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> For the private stations, advertising soon became an important source of income and, paradoxically, made them more innovative than the public stations. Paul Deharme made a name for himself by inventing advertising spots able to capture and retain the listeners' attention. He worked at first in the radio division of the Havas information and news agency and later directly for the private radio stations Radio Paris, Poste Parisien, and Radio Luxembourg; while there, he transformed his ideas about how to manipulate the subconscious of the audience into the principles <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of a theory of an art made for the ear and later began to conceive of commercial radio as a new form of popular art.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Deharme knew André Breton's surrealist associates well through his wife Lise Deharme, a poet who had been close to Breton, and also through his friendship with Robert Desnos, who had been with Breton from the beginnings of the surrealist movement on. Deharme also harbored an interest in Sigmund Freud, and was himself a client of Pierre Allendy, a noted psychoanalyst at the time. He was in an ideal position to draw a connection between the advertiser's interest in the manipulation of the audience's desires, the surrealist interest in exploring the subconscious for artistic purposes, and that of Freudians in therapy through the revelation of the workings of the subconscious.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the 1920s, André Breton's group suffered its first crisis, one in which Robert Desnos would have no small part. In fact, the first decisive expulsions from Breton's circle coincided with the moment when some surrealists began to work in print journalism and radio. In 1929, Breton excommunicated several poets and artists from the movement and denounced them in his "Second Manifesto" (published in December 1929), to which several responded with their own manifesto, "Un cadavre" (February 1930), arguing that Breton's way of rallying and excluding friends was that of a dictator. This manifesto would be signed by, among others, Robert Desnos and his Cuban friend Alejo Carpentier, who had recently arrived in Paris. On June 14, 1930, Desnos went on air for Radio-Paris for the first time. In the rift between Breton and the group around Desnos, the acknowledged contentious point was the question of how to engage politically with the revolutionary ideas that the surrealists had proclaimed.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Breton and some friends had become members of the Communist party and decided to act in conformity with its policies while others refused to do so. However, another argument laid beneath the confrontation, that of the engagement not with politics but with mass media, and with a greater audience. Breton criticized Georges Bataille and Robert Desnos in particular for their journalistic activities, an example of which he saw in Desnos's publications in popular magazines like <span style="font-style:italic;">Marianne</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Merle</span>. According to Breton in his "Second Manifesto," the surrealist activity had to remain secluded from and in opposition to the greater public:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The approval of the public is to be avoided like the plague. It is absolutely essential to keep the public from entering if one wishes to avoid confusion. I must add that the public must be kept panting in expectation at the gate by a system of challenges and provocations. I ask for the profound, the veritable occultation of surrealism.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>[L'approbation du public est à fuir par dessus tout. Il faut absolument empêcher le public d'entrer si l'on veut éviter la confusion. J'ajoute qu'il faut le tenir exaspéré à la porte par un système de défis et de provocations. Je demande l'occultation profonde, véritable du surréalisme.]<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">For Breton, the release of individuality in favor of a collective mind was possible only among those committed exclusively to surrealism; the ties among those chosen ones <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  were of an affective, intellectual, and political nature. Breton cited as a model for this affective community of spirits the telepathic coincidence of ideas and images, which had occurred repeatedly between him and Desnos, or the surrealist writing exercises that had led to the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les champs magnétiques</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Les vases communicants</span>. For him, this surrealist activity was radically self-sufficient.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> To publish in popular magazines, found journals addressed to a wider audience—Bataille had founded in 1929 the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Documents</span> and Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes <span style="font-style:italic;">Bifur</span>—, or to speak on the radio came therefore close to desertion. To address the anonymous readership of journals or the audience of a radio station implied the acceptance of the erroneous belief systems of the silent majority. At this point, Breton did not believe in the possibility of a genuinely popular art that would express the aspirations of the working class. This also meant for him the rejection of conventional rhyme and meter in poetry. Thus, in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second Manifesto</span>, Breton accused Desnos specifically of having used the alexandrine meter, typical of classical French poetry, arguing that Desnos's alexandrines were not only bad, but also an expression of his "ridiculous ambition and inexcusable incomprehension of contemporary poetic goals."<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> The dissidence of Desnos and his friends, then, can be read at least as much as a deviance from Breton's political credo as a difference in opinion with respect to their "avant-garde" position—or lack thereof—in contemporary French society. Desnos clearly wanted to be heard by a larger audience and did not mind using a variety of older and newer forms of poetry to express himself, whereas Breton was not interested in making himself understood to others except to those who formed part of his club.</p>
<p>Alejo Carpentier, on the other hand, had only had casual contact with the surrealists before signing "Un cadavre." Desnos had helped Carpentier to leave Cuba and escape the dictatorship of Gerardo Machado there. Carpentier, who because of his French father was bilingual, was introduced by Desnos to the surrealist group; together with his friend but did not end up contributing to Breton's journal <span style="font-style:italic;">La Révolution surrécliste</span> a short text in "Un cadavre." Carpentier became Desnos's closest companion in the following years until his return to Cuba in 1939. He would be one of the many Latin American correspondents in town who were regularly reporting back to their countries about Parisian culture, but he was also one of the few able to publish in France in avant-garde journals such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Documents, Bifur</span>, or <span style="font-style:italic;">Transition</span>, and probably the only Latin American at the time to work for the French radio. In his articles published in the Cuban society magazines <span style="font-style:italic;">Social</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Carteles</span> on the French avant-garde, Carpentier is enthusiastic about the vibrant and inspiring artistic and intellectual milieu in Paris that does not suffer from the same political oppression endured by intellectuals in Latin America. While aware of their inner conflicts, he emphasizes the achievements of the surrealists, and the candor with which they defend the idea of a revolutionary art. His friend Desnos, in turn, became interested in Cuban music, and involved in the protest against the dictatorship in Cuba. He, more so than Carpentier, helped to publish in Paris a pamphlet against the Cuban dictator Machado.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> In this way, the artistic and political agenda of both broadened with their travels and their contacts with different communication media and led to their refusal to obey Breton's views on politics <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and media. Yet, even though they had become dissidents of Breton's movement, they retained some of the lessons of surrealism.</p>
<p>Deharme took an interest in Carpentier knowledge of music. Back in Havana, Carpentier had organized concerts of contemporary classical music and had become close friends with the most renowned Cuban composers at the time, Amadeo Roldán and Alejandro García Caturla. Aside from his journalistic writing, Carpentier had written quite a number of librettos for his Cuban composer friends and in Paris for the Brazilian Hector Villa Lobos, as well as for Marius-François Gaillard and Darius Milhaud. He had developed his own theory on the relationship between music and language, explained in an interview given in 1932 for <span style="font-style:italic;">Carteles</span>.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>Desnos's first radio lecture for Deharme was on surrealism ("Initiation au surréalisme," broadcast on June 14, 1930, on Radio-Paris). Another one was soon to follow, this time on Cuban music, with the help of Carpentier ("La musique cubaine," broadcast on January 5, 1931, also on Radio-Paris).<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> From then on, the two worked for Deharme on a regular basis. When Deharme died in an accident in 1934, Desnos became the director of Phoniric, the advertising company founded in 1932 by Deharme, with Carpentier as his artistic director and sound engineer. The duo worked there until 1939, when Carpentier returned to Cuba, shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War. Desnos was arrested in 1942 for his participation in the resistance movement, and he died in 1945, shortly after his liberation from a concentration camp. He is remembered today as a surrealist poet and as a writer of a number of song lyrics. Carpentier, in turn, became a famous Latin American novelist. Their professional involvement with radio broadcasting is scarcely remembered today. But between 1933 and 1939 both Carpentier and Desnos almost completely stopped publishing in print while working full time for Phoniric. This occurred not because they lost interest in the avant-garde, but rather the contrary. Retrospectively, Carpentier states:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>If I wrote little between the publication of my first novel and 1939, this was simply due to the fact that in order to earn a living I had to spend 10 or 11 hours daily in a recording studio, where work-hours were unlimited. Also, in those years I believed in radio as a new art and was not unhappy to work together with Jean Louis Barrault, Antonin Artaud, and others . . .</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>[Si poco escribí entre la publicación de mi primera novela y 1939, esto se debió, simple y sencillamente, al hecho de que, para ganarme la vida, tenía que pasarme 10 u 11 horas diarias en un estudio de grabaciones de discos, donde los horarios de trabajo no tenían límites. Además, en aquellos años yo creía en la radio como arte nuevo y no me disgustaba la idea de trabajar con Jean Louis Barrault, con Antonin Artaud, etc . . .].<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In what way was radio a "new art," and what was it that attracted both Carpentier and Desnos to it or Barrault and Artaud, for that matter? There certainly was a fascination with the technology itself. From a technological point of view, the studio's equipment was cutting-edge. Phoniric had one of the first facilities in France to produce prerecorded programs, in contrast to other radio stations who were broadcasting live. The <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  first recorded radio-play held by the French National Institute of Audiovisual Arts is the 1932 recording of Paul Deharme's play <span style="font-style:italic;">Un incident au Pont du Hibou</span>, a radio rendering of Ambrose Bierce's short story "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Phoniric also owned an echo-chamber for special sound effects. More importantly perhaps, Phoniric was one of the first professional advertising companies in France at a time when all was permitted and radio workers were free to invent creative strategies to impress their audience. The company produced program blocks, in which a show was either framed by a slogan or the program itself consisted of a narrative created around a commercial product.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Today, most of these programs are lost, but we do have titles and some manuscripts of shows by Phoniric's radio team that give us an idea of how playful and at times extravagant the radio shows produced by Carpentier and Desnos were. There were everyday programs such as, for example, "La demi-heure de la vie pratique," a program of thirty-minute features in which a speaker presented a memorable event's anniversary or a famous character's birthday; there were music shows, such as renderings of Puccini's <span style="font-style:italic;">La vie de Bohème</span> and an anthology of French popular songs, "Chansons de l'Empire Français," which was framed by an ad for the drink Vin de Frileuse. But there were also programs with a clearly surrealist flavor: a series called <span style="font-style:italic;">Du coq à l'âne</span>, where Desnos and the poet Jacques Prévert would prompt each other for words or phrases over which they would improvise short nonsense poems; also a rendition of Walt Whitman's "Salut au Monde" (Poste Parisien, July 4, 1936), and dramatizations of pieces by Paul Claudel and Edgar Allan Poe were broadcast. Desnos's favorite program was one he made alone, "La clé des songes" (broadcast between 1936 and 1939). In it, he analyzed dreams sent in by the audience, and came to humorous conclusions about the state of the "collective unconscious."<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> "La clef des songes" was introduced by the following song:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Everyone, women cooks or poets<br>Businessmen or carpenters<br>Love lazing around,<br>Relaxing, sleeping and dreaming<br>Because dreaming is a show<br>It is a favor<br>Granted by the night to the dreamer<br>A fortune which we deserve<br>It is a daily miracle<br>A night without dreams<br>Or without love<br>Is lost</p></div></blockquote>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>[Cuisinière ou poétesse<br>Buss'nessman ou charpentier<br>Tout l'monde aime la paresse,<br>Le loisir, le sommeil et rêver<br>Car le rêve est un spectacle<br>C'est un billet de faveur <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <br>Dont la nuit fait cadeau au rêveur<br>Fortune qui nous est due<br>C'est un quotidien miracle<br>Une nuit sans rêver<br>Sans aimer<br>Est perdue.]<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Typical surrealist themes are combined here: dreaming is the center of life and, together with love and laziness, makes life meaningful. Interesting is also Desnos's use of regular meter—here the traditional French seven syllable verse. Desnos follows Deharme who was convinced that this type of meter was most easily remembered in radio and most pleasing to the ear.</p>
<p>The idea of radio as an organ of mass communication was powerful at the time and provoked several memorable but then aborted attempts at a radio theory. A notorious skeptic like Bertolt Brecht acknowledged in his short "Radio Theory" the potential of radio as an "institute of communication in public life" ["ein Kommunikationsapparat öffentlichen Lebens"].<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Similarly Theodor W. Adorno, while in exile in New York and ever critical of the rising mass media industry, became part of the Columbia University's Radio Research project and began work on a radio theory but never finished his manuscript.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Walter Benjamin produced several radio features and wrote two short essays on radio, but in his great essay, "The Work of Art in the Age of its Mechanical Reproducibility," he focuses instead on photography and film.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> The only well known book on radio in its early years is Rudolf Arnheim's Radio, published during his exile in England in 1936. Deharme's Pour un art radiophonique anticipates many of Arnheim's ideas, yet it differs in the precision of the radio-technique it announces.</p>
<p>Like Arnheim, Deharme in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Pour un art radiophonique</span> made an attempt at defining radio's unique potential and lay out the rules for a "radiophonic art." To Deharme, the radio's promise lies in its independence from vision and everything associated with it, particularly analytic reason. In his theory, the transmission of words through radio is more evocative to the listener than the written work. Radio-speech can even take on the role of a psychoanalytical dialogue, in the sense that the anonymity of the radio voice makes it an ideal way to elicit individual fantasies and traumas from each listener. However, it is necessary to offer simultaneously a controlling frame and to give shape to these radio sensations in order to force the listener to be actively involved in the process. In this way, radio was to become not so much a new aesthetic experience as a therapeutic medium, that is, a way of analyzing and stabilizing the collective unconscious.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>For Deharme, radio broadcasting's greatest asset was precisely the fact that vision was not available to the audience. The absence, in radio—and also in the surrealist automatic writing—of physical images would lead to the creation of increasingly powerful mental images in the listener. In this way, radio was superior to film or theater. Relying on the work of French psychologist Henri Delacroix and the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, Deharme put forth the argument that pure words were in fact always associated with "inner" mental images, and that the physical production of words <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  in combination with images in film or in the theater deprived the audience of their own mental images, creating "only" sensations and impoverished after-impressions of what should be a creative act. The radio experience, in contrast, was more stimulating because its mental images were sensations at the same time.</p>
<p>One problem with radio broadcasting, as Deharme saw it, was the short attention span of the listener. All of his professional know-how was invested in preventing it from becoming a background medium. Due to the absence of physical images, the radio listener's attention span is smaller; though the voice may seem real, the image associated with it has its origin only in the brain and is accompanied by a feeling of unreality (<span style="font-style:italic;">PAR</span>, 36). For that reason, music and sound effects are especially important to lend life and substance to the image—yet this liveliness should always appear to be dream-like, in a realistic yet artificial way.</p>
<p>The distinction between the dream-likeness of radio and the everyday reality of the listening audience was crucial to Deharme, for whom the main task of radio was to make the listener dream, as opposed to the producer-focused surrealist idea of using dreams to extract or generate words from the inspired artist (<span style="font-style:italic;">PAR</span>, 42). The problem with the surrealists, according to Deharme, was that they claimed to rely not on dream images but on the language of dreams, whose authenticity was generally to be doubted because it is extremely difficult to reproduce. The language produced during a period of half-sleep was not quite the same as the one that would originate from a dream (<span style="font-style:italic;">PAR</span>, 93). In short, Deharme contested the relevance of the surrealist automatic writing for a larger audience. He associated the ability to dream with the freedom to imagine alternate worlds, and did not find that surrealist poetry was effective at producing these worlds for the reader. This is why radio-fiction took a prominent place in Deharme's radio theory: the listener seemed to understand it and be provoked by it more easily than by poetry.</p>
<p>The desire to conjure alternate worlds for the listener is also what brought the Phoniric team in line with the popular culture of the gothic and the fantastic in three-penny literature, the comics, and the movies. In the years between 1923 and 1935, many French radio plays were set in an atmosphere of fantasy, mystery, or delirium.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Early radio-plays tended to depict situations of captivity or danger in which a purely internal thought process is played out. This emphasis on the "inner" voyage rather than on a more epic or action-based idea of radio plot was often paired with a preference for confessional voices or the voices of the dead. Deharme's most famous radio-play, <span style="font-style:italic;">Un incident au Pont du Hibou</span> , is a case in point: we hear the escape fantasy of a man with a rope around his neck waiting to be hanged. The man, a plantation owner during the American Civil War, is being hanged for treason; he imagines how he might be able to avoid his unfortunate demise and go instead to St Louis. The effect of extreme suspense lies here in the contrast between the brevity of the moment when the rope is tightening around the man's neck and the duration of the radio-play itself. This demonstrates one of the traits of radio lauded also by Marinetti and by Rudolf Arnheim, which is its suspension of the ordinary parameters of time: the time of the frame story contradicts the time of the inner story.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> While the listener follows into <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the imaginary escape of the man, he or she always knows of the inevitable outcome of the frame-story and is also aware of the fact that the story itself is a pure "fantasy" and not real. What kind of effect did Deharme wish to produce in the listener of this radio-play? If we follow his theory, the success of his play depended entirely on the cathartic reaction it would produce in his audience. Therefore, at the beginning of the radio-play, the stage was set carefully: a speaker had asked the listeners in a confidential tone to turn out the light, close their eyes, and imagine themselves to be a plantation owner. They were asked to write down their impressions after the play was over, and only after this brief announcement did the play open. A therapeutic setting was thus established, and seems to have provoked the desired reaction: Deharme received an overwhelming number of responses, some of which he reproduces in his book. Many listeners identified with the planter to a point that they complemented the spoken words with their own imagination, identifying at times with the soon to be hanged man, at times with the hangmen. Deharme calls their experiences "dreams" because they reveal the combination of manifest and latent content typical of Freud's definition of dreams. Furthermore, he quotes several listeners who, the night after listening to his play, dreamt yet another dream derived from the play which in this way duplicates and even triples its effect. He achieves this by creating a neutral or blank "scene" infused with sensations and open to any individual fantasy that might be triggered by the basic plot (<span style="font-style:italic;">PAR</span>, 51).</p>
<p>Desnos and Carpentier took up Deharme's insistence on controlling the dream experience of the audience by distinguishing clearly between frame story and dream. In their work, they underscored the difference between a containing frame and the actual story while exploring the general trend toward fantasy, crime, and science fiction. Desnos's and Carpentier's first radio collaboration in 1933, for example, was a commercial that presented a new sequel of the 1910s cult novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Fantômas</span>. The rhymed script by Desnos contained a medley of past episodes from the popular novel, introduced by a couple sitting in a bar and listening to the radio-broadcast of <span style="font-style:italic;">Fantômas</span>, remembering the years when they used to read the comic. This meta-referential frame reminded the listener constantly of his own situation in front of the radio set, so similar to that of the couple in the bar. The text was animated by music from Kurt Weill arranged by Carpentier. Carpentier also added background bar noises which helped to mimic the everyday life situation of the listener, who might also be sitting in a bar listening to the radio, and on the other hand emphasized the contrast with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fantômas</span> episodes, separated from each other by the Weill songs. The story of Fantômas itself is a variation of the Mackie Messer plot, but with a fantastic twist. It narrates the repeated escapes of a gentleman killer, who magically appears and disappears as he pleases. Some of the episodes present a quasi-surrealist mix of wonder and horror, as for example, when Fantômas kills one of his accomplices who has climbed onto a church bell to get his hands on some jewels hidden in it. When Fantômas kills the man, the bell starts to ring, and ruby-colored jewels, stained with blood, rain down onto the spectators.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> By presenting a frame story and a chorus who comments on each episode, Desnos and Carpentier emphasize the wondrous quality of the story as an offer to the audience to <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  not fear but transfer their anxieties onto the re of Fantômas. The ending couplet finally suspends the spell of Fantômas's crimes and concludes again with the reality of its audience: "For the people from here and everywhere / for the people from here and everywhere / I have written this song / On Fantômas whose name makes everyone tremble / Now live a long life / This I wish you, I am about to leave." ["Pour ceux du peuple et du monde / Pour ceux du peuple et du monde, / J'ai écrit cette chanson, / Sur Fantômas dont le nom / Fait tout trembler à la ronde. / Maintenant, vivez longtemps, / Je le souhaite en partant"].<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> In this way, radio produces desires and fears, only to enable the audience to overcome them in the same act.</p>
<p>Deharme, Desnos, and Carpentier thus defended radio as an art with a cathartic function similar to that produced in Greek tragedy: "Freed from the predicaments of the stage, radio-theater can make us relive in all their vehemence the cries of the heroes who are finally delivered from their comical disguises" ["Délivré des contingences des trétaux, le radio-théâtre peut faire revivre pour nous dans toute sa véhémence, la clameur des héros dépouillés de leurs oripeaux comiques."] (<span style="font-style:italic;">PAR</span>, 82). This catharsis, even when experienced by an individual listener in front of the set, also had a communitarian aspect, more so than film or theater. As an art form, radio broadcasts can impress their audience in the same way as a preacher's sermon in church. Since the ear is more impressionable than the eye, the voice has more power over the individual than vision:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>I don't know who has said that a sermon has never provoked a conversion. I am sure of the contrary, at least since sermons are transmitted by radio: there only has to be a tempest in the air, a moment of sadness, a newly surfaced letter, a mean act committed or remembered, and the preacher enters your place as if he were a burglar, without a habit, and without adornments, without provoking resistance and without being open to discussion. His word is then smartly emphasized by the artillery of sacred music which for fifteen minutes continues its effect in the most sensitive depths of human weakness.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>[Je ne sais qui a dit: 'Jamais un sermon n'a provoqué aucune conversion'. Je suis sûr du contraire depuis que des sermons se font par T.S.F.: il suffit d'un orage dans l'air, d'un instant de détresse, d'une lettre retrouvée, d'une mauvaise action commise ou remémorée, le prédicant entre chez vous 'comme un voleur', sans soutane et sans surplis, sans éveiller la défiance et sans se prêter à la discussion. Sa parole est sciemment soutenue ensuite par l'artillerie de la musique sacrée qui, pendant un quart d'heure, en prolonge l'effet dans les profondeurs les plus sensibles de la faiblesse humaine]</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">PAR</span>, 24).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">In a quasi religious way, the voice of the speaker discovers the listener's hidden feelings of guilt or of pain. Thus, the effect of radio relies on the interaction between the speaker's confidential and compassionate voice and the listener's remembrances and analysis of his own personal situation. This perception of the radio voice as being endowed with an almost magical power over the intimate life of the listener must have had to do with the newness of the medium still in the 1930s. Listening to a voice through radio (or through the gramophone) had only too abruptly replaced the other uncanny voices associated with religion or esoteric practices. Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht writes, "While <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  telepathy transforms the divine privilege of seeing the human soul from inside into a psychological method, technical devices based on wireless communication begin to transform the erstwhile divine privilege of omnipresence into everyday reality. Both developments seem informed by a desire for unrestrained immediacy in the sphere of human interactions."<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>Yet, in order to maintain the listener's fascination with the radio voice, Deharme proposed precisely to restrain this immediate reality effect of radio. Catharsis, as he conceived it, had to proceed in a regulated way. The act of listening had to be governed by a heightened consciousness that was able to make transferences and critically analyzing the listener's experience.</p>
<p>This assessment was close in spirit to Adorno's assessment of the haunting effects of a radio-voice that had become omnipresent, which made the audience yearn for a visible setting, whereas live music was received in abstraction of the space of sound production. According to an article of the time quoted by Adorno, the "shock" effect of radio was closely related to the unconscious fear of man feeling overpowered by technology. According to Adorno, the haunting effects of the radio voice, however, only continue to exist if the listener maintains a somewhat irrational attitude: "We may uphold the hypothesis that whenever the listener assumes an attitude to radio which is not fully rational, and moreover whenever he does not keep all the technical implications of radio in evidence, when he listens to radio, some of the shock elements mentioned by Mr. Stern may still hold good."<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In spite of all these arguments about radio's uniqueness and contrary to Marinetti, however, Deharme and his friends did not break with the other arts, and especially not with theater and film; rather they pointed out radio's dialogue with those already established arts. Their intention was to make the listeners identify with the protagonists as if in a drama and have them live an incessant "domestic catharsis," as Desnos put it.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> Or to recur to another metaphor that Deharme likes to use, the inner "radio-film" is supposed to promote a taste for everything contemplative and imaginative, especially for reading and music. As he puts it:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The radio-film, through the liberated preconscious, overwhelms the unconscious with verbal excitations that have been fabricated on purpose to serve as association knots; it thus provokes a partial development of repressed ideas. In this way it accomplishes an excellent psychic prophylactic and promotes in a mechanical way a taste for reading, for music, and generally for the pleasures of the imagination in those whose spirit is imprisoned in a dangerous material activity.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>[Le radio-film qui, dans le preéconscient dégagé, appâte l'inconscient avec des excitations verbales spécialement fabriquées pour servir de noyau aux associations, provoque l'épanchement partiel des idées refoulées, réalisant ainsi une excellente prophylaxie psychique et donnant mécaniquement le goût de la lecture, de la musique et généralement des plaisirs de l'imagination aux esprits emprisonnés dans une dangereuse activité matérielle.]</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">PAR</span>, 95) <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">This was Deharme's utopia: radio represented a counter-culture to the material world, in the sense that it stimulated everyone's individual imagination. This turn inward made the listener receptive also for older forms of entertainment and education such as reading and music.</p>
<p>In his reflection on mass communication media, Deharme is then surprisingly moderate; he does not conclude that radio broadcasting and other new forms of media are going to replace the book; rather he considers them as complementary and mutually enhancing.</p>
<p>Deharme's main contention against the surrealists is related to his didactic desire. In contrast to them, Deharme insists on there always being a controlling frame—a narrator or a choir who introduces and comments—in the process of free association, so that the threshold between the real and the imagined may be ultimately preserved. His theory of the radio is meant to replace what he considers the "schizophrenic" surrealist practice of automatic writing, where dream is considered not as a complement of reality, but as an alternate universe (<span style="font-style:italic;">PAR</span>, 95). Radio represents, if nothing else, a salvation from surrealism: "This is why I would rejoice in seeing the wireless established in the territory of the unconscious instead of the smoking torches of surrealism turned obsolete" [Voilà pourquoi je verrais avec plaisir s'installer l'électricité sans fil dans le domaine du subconscient à la place des torches fumeuses du Surréalisme, carencé] (<span style="font-style:italic;">PAR</span>, 98).</p>
<p>Deharme's position about radio as catharsis was by no means uncontroversial. For René Sudre, Deharme's radio method effectively did quite the contrary of what it claimed and transformed individual listeners into an unresponsive radio crowd. In his essay "La radio et le rêve," Sudre attacked Deharme for making his audience consume drama in small doses as if it were a vaccine in order to never be really affected.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Sudre argues for a more realistic radio-theater less intent on provoking emotions than analysis. Deharme's theory also stands in contrast to the questions raised by Walter Benjamin in his essay on the effects of reproducible art, even though Benjamin avoids explicitly referencing radio. However, when arguing about the distracted or concentrated experience of the mass-produced work, Benjamin is posing the same question as Sudre in a different way: how unique and cathartic can the radio experience really be, if plots and characters are reduced to generic silhouettes that are made to be understood by the widest possible audience? Deharme envisioned his audience as captivated by the apparatus and pending on its one-time performance. But how often was radio really able to capture completely its audience's attention when set in a domestic environment? How much of a shock value would the radio voice be able to retain in the future? As we can gather from Benjamin's discarding of radio broadcasting in his essay, the captivating effect of the radio voice was wearing down quickly.</p>
<p>Deharme and his team worked against those odds to attract and retain the radio audience's complete attention, and they developed an elaborate method while at it, described by Deharme in his book. In order to bring the speaker closer to the individual listener, announcers on the radio had to have a neutral voice and speak in a low, confidential tone. Also, the sound itself of the word and cadence of a sentence had <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to be carefully construed to make the listener remember what was said. Therefore, speakers were to liberally employ false or pure rhymes and alliterations (<span style="font-style:italic;">PAR</span>, 65). With respect to cadence, Deharme was unequivocal: the best way to shape sentences was to use classical verse meter: "The strict musicality of the poetic rhythm will only touch the larger public if the authors remain within the classic verse meters" [La musique plus sévère du rythme poétique ne touchera profondément le grand public que si les auteurs s'én tiennent aux mesures des vers classiques] (<span style="font-style:italic;">PAR</span>, 71). And indeed, Desnos, in his couplets for <span style="font-style:italic;">Fantômas</span> as elsewhere, uses the seven-syllable verse associated in French with La Fontaine's fables and also with the Renaissance poet Ronsard. This radio aesthetic was in open contradiction to avant-garde stylistic parameters; as we have seen, Breton felt revolted by Desnos's return in poetry to old verse meters even before he started to work for the radio. Deharme also offended the avant-garde preference for difficult metaphors when recommending proverbial expressions and the present tense in order to make the meaning of words instantly recognizable and draw the listener into the narrative.</p>
<p>The method worked well for the shows made at Phoniric. Desnos used it in radio shows as well as in his advertising slogans, as for example in the following one: "Joie certaine/toujours saine/Quand on boit l'Amer Picon/Un délice sans malice/Buvez de l'Amer Picon" [Joy for sure/always healthy/If you drink Amer Picon/ A delight without plight/You should drink Amer Picon] (<span style="font-style:italic;">Oeuvres</span>, 793). In this example, the musicality and rhythm of the phrase is striking as well as the use of simple words, extreme succinctness and false rhymes. There is an affected naturalness to this slogan, and its playful rhythm is unusual in written poetry. It is a piece of what we might call "situation poetry," something that accompanies the listener for a while and can then be forgotten. As Dumas states, Desnos's later poetry would be profoundly affected by what he learned while working for Phoniric.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>Deharme's team had their own ideas about the relation between words and music and used music in their programs to add expressiveness. This was mostly Carpentier's domain, as we have seen. His views regarding the musicality of the spoken word were similar to radio theorist Rudolph Arnheim, who, in his 1936 book <span style="font-style:italic;">Radio</span>, derives his enthusiasm for the medium from the enhanced importance of the sound of words in radio:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>In wireless the sounds and voices of reality claimed relationship with the poetic word and the musical note; sounds born of earth and those born of the spirit found each other; and so music entered the material world, the world enveloped itself in music, and reality, newly created by thought in all its intensity, presented itself much more directly, objectively and concretely than on printed paper: what hitherto had only been thought or described now appeared materialized, as a corporeal actuality.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Carpentier, while certainly subscribing to this organic view of word and music, is more pragmatic than Arnheim with respect to the way in which the spoken word can be manipulated. In his article on "El radio y sus nuevas posibilidades," written for <span style="font-style:italic;">Carteles</span> in 1933, he argues for using well known music as a way to make speech more meaningful: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>"I am not a proponent of using music as a value in and of itself in radio-theater; rather it should be an evocative element. We need to use fragments of well known works that help to instantly imprint an idea in the brain of the listener" [No soy partidario, en el teatro radiofónico, de utilizar la música como valor en sí, sino como elemento evocativo. Fragmentos de obras muy conocidas, que fijan una idea, inmediatamente, en el cerebro del oyente].<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> The same goes for background noise: "Neutral" sounds that manage to "illustrate" or "express" a certain event are preferred over the direct representation of particular noises.</p>
<p>Carpentier, Desnos, and Deharme indeed do not believe in radio as a representational or "realistic" medium. Already in the 1920s, while he was still with Breton's group, Desnos had written in a cinema review that despite the immediacy suggested by the camera, cinema was meant to be the domain of the fantastic, and could only in vain pretend to be realistic.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> In keeping with the separation between reality and its fictional representation, Carpentier's method of representing noise was not based on the identity of origin and sound, but on the idea of dramatic artifice: if someone was shot in a radio play, he wrote, it was not to be represented by an actual revolver shot, but by a harp glissando, for example.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Music and language became mere instruments to evoke an atmosphere; the listener was not to be deluded about the authenticity of what he heard in the radio. The voice was no warranty for truthfulness.</p>
<p>Carpentier and Desnos employed their radiophonic method indiscriminately for the news and for radio plays, music being at times an enhancement, at times an ironic counterpoint. In this way, Carpentier had a news broadcast of Andrew Mellon being the richest man of the United States accompanied by The Internationale.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>As many others, however, Carpentier became disillusioned with radio and from the 1940s returned to writing as his main occupation and ambition. Retrospectively, he came to regard the recourse of radio journalism to clichés and simple formulations as necessary in radio, but dangerous for ambitious writers. More than Desnos, he would be outspoken about the differences between radio broadcasting and the writing of literature. For him, as he states in an interview with Ramón Chao, the transition back from radio to writing was a difficult one, for which he had to literally undergo a detoxification cure.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Carpentier dramatized the manipulative power of the radio voice on the individual subconscious in several scenes of his later novels.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> But with respect to radio broadcasting's calibrating effect on society, Carpentier had turned skeptical. More so than Desnos, he came to think that radio inevitably tended to make the listener forget the mediation of the apparatus: the oral voice suggests a false intimacy that is not therapeutic but dangerous.</p>
<p>Criticism of the radio waves is already noteworthy in the early opera project entitled "The One All Alone" written by Carpentier together with Desnos and Georges Ribemont-Dessaignes between 1929 and 1931 for Edgar Varèse.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> The project was conceived as a "multimedia Gesamtkunstwerk," it was to incorporate theater, pantomime, dance, literature, electronic equipment and music.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> Unable to finish the music for the project, Varèse ended up incorporating parts of it into his piece <span style="font-style:italic;">Étude pour Espace</span> and dropped the opera. The opera project, however, is interesting not only because <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  it indicates the group's simultaneous experimentation with high-brow and low-brow media, but also because it goes to show their doubts about radio broadcasting's uncanny power almost from the beginning of their professional radio work on.</p>
<p>The setting is, here again, inspired by a certain surrealist taste for the esoteric paired with the Futurist fascination with new technologies: Varèse's idea had been to represent a cosmic struggle between two stars, Sirius and his Companion, which is intercepted by an astronomer with the help of a machine that emits radio waves. As the two stars approach the earth and threaten to destroy it, the multitudes, seeing how the astronomer communicates through instantaneous radiation with Sirius but forgets to communicate with them, panic and are about to sacrifice the astronomer in an improvised pagan ritual, when he is rescued at last from the earth and absorbed into the waves.</p>
<p>Carpentier's and his friends' version—Varèse commissioned librettos from several other noted writers but claimed to have been most satisfied with the one by Carpentier, Desnos and Ribemont-Dessaignes—emphasizes the split between a generic society and one technocrat—the "man in the tower" or "the one all alone," who is able to communicate through instantaneous radiation with Sirius.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> The story combines several archetypical plots: the master-slave conflict between Sirius and the Companion, the scapegoat ritual of the tribe that kills its king, and the Marxist theme of the alienation of modern masses from science. Instantaneous radiation represents the electromagnetic waves that have brought everything together and made cosmic communication possible, but that at the same time have created an ever increasing divide between the astronomer and society. By underscoring the mythic quality of the story, the authors emphasize the fact that this type of conflict is not new; it does not hinge exclusively on the new technology of radio waves but has to do with mass dynamics inherent in any civilization. The opening of the drama places particular emphasis on myth and tradition, beginning with ritual prayers in French and Spanish; here, Carpentier's Cuban background comes in and the Afro-Cuban deities Abacua and Obatalá as well as the Mexican god Quetzalcoatl are invoked. This first chant ends with the unison of the three voices who sing: "Nous voulons savoir" ["We want to know"]. Later, when the masses panic because the sun is not visible anymore, they again adopt a tribal behavior and begin to dance in the "genre of a voodoo dance." While the discovery of radio waves has enabled then the communication with other planets and allowed for the early recognition of an approaching catastrophe, it has increased the gap between those who understand the new technology and the majority of the society who remains ignorant. Contrary to what Deharme wrote in his book, radio communication in this piece is one-sided and implies a power increase for the few, and a complete voiding of representation for the many. The fiction of a dialogue established through radio waves is thus exposed as such, as the communication between the technocrat and the cosmos as well as between the technocrat and the multitudes fails.</p>
<p>"The One All Alone" can then be read as a commentary on the problematic dialogue between radio producers and artists at the time: the utopia of electromagnetic waves instantly connecting the entire world is countered by the fear of the increasing power and manipulation by anonymous technocrats. The public space created by radio is <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  perceived by these avant-garde artists as a chance to create a truly popular art, yet on the other hand they see that in practice radio broadcasting generally does not affect listeners in the ways they desire it. Furthermore, if radio has a privileged affective access to the individual at home, it often enough turns into a nightmare of disastrous news and a manipulator of anxiety instead of a therapeutic substitute for the psychoanalyst, as Deharme wanted it. What we see in "The One All Alone" is Carpentier's and Desnos's critical distancing from the technological myths implicit in futurism and surrealism alike. "The One All Alone" is a cautionary tale arguing that new access to the masses does not necessarily advance communication within a society, but rather activates its destructive tribal impulses.</p>
<p>It is significant, I think, that "The One All Alone" stands at the very beginning of Carpentier's and Desnos's radio years. Being dissident surrealists and radio professionals at once, they wanted to believe in radio as a privileged venue for a new popular art yet were torn between the surrealist hope of spiritual communication with the masses and their integration into an industry that turned them into mere sound engineers and program facilitators. Deharme's theory of radio nevertheless presents a noteworthy reflection on radio broadcasting as a mass medium as it examines in practice the arguments advanced by the early theorists of mass media (Benjamin, Adorno, and Arnheim). Finally, the radio plays and slogans produced by Deharme, Desnos, and Carpentier deserve to be included in our reading of the historical avant-garde today.</p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">Introduction</h1>
<p>Not many people know of Paul Deharme today, a French businessman and radio pioneer who died young in an accident in 1934. Deharme had been successful at professionalizing radio advertising, and he and his wife counted among their friends some of the better known members of the French and international avant-garde, such as Robert Desnos, Alejo Carpentier, Marie and Yves Goll, and James Joyce. But, in the years before he died, Deharme also wrote a theory of radio that combined an original analysis of radio language with an avant-garde positioning of the new medium. Convinced that surrealism could be brought to the masses through a smart use of the wireless, Deharme worked out the principles of what he called a "radiophonic art," which would combine entertainment and the analysis of the collective subconscious.</p>
<p>Deharme insisted on radio broadcasting as a medium of oral communication with its own formal requirements different from those of theater or film. He contested the claims of his predecessors in radio theory, Pierre Cusy and Gabriel Germinet, who in their <span style="font-style:italic;">Théâtre radiophonique</span> , had argued for the similarity of radio to theater, hoping in this way to lend more prestige to the new medium. Deharme claimed to the contrary that radio broadcasting's advantage lay in its difference, specifically the fact that it relied solely on the voice, not on vision.<a name="fi-text" href="#fi"><sup>i</sup></a> In this way, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Deharme was able to produce innovative radio plays such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Un incident au Pont du Hibou</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">L'île des voix</span> , as well as advertising spots.<a name="fii-text" href="#fii"><sup>ii</sup></a> He was indeed one of the most original personalities in radio at the time. The most intriguing French radio play prewar radio, <span style="font-style:italic;">La cité des voix</span>  is dedicated to the memory of Paul Deharme.<a name="fiii-text" href="#fiii"><sup>iii</sup></a> His legacy, however, would be quickly forgotten after the war. This is certainly due to the general neglect of the history of radio broadcasting before 1945, and to the inexistence or poor quality of radio recordings from the period. Already in a radio feature from 1944 dedicated to "Radiophonic art," Pierre Schaeffer, a founding re of French postwar radio who collaborated with Jean Tardieu and Louis Merlin in the Studio d'essai, claims that "there are no names attached to radio, no radiophonic works. There are no archives."<a name="fiv-text" href="#fiv"><sup>iv</sup></a> Historians of radio such as Cécile Méadel, René Duval, and Denis Maréchal have given detailed accounts of the organization of early French radio, its diversification into private and public stations, and the programming structure of the major stations Radio Luxembourg, Radio Paris, and le Poste Parisien. Several theoretical works on radio as well as radio plays of the time, however, remain unedited and uncommented by radio historians.<a name="fv-text" href="#fv"><sup>v</sup></a> This is why the translation of Paul Deharme's first programmatic article, "Proposition d'un art radiophonique," which presents a condensation of his later works, seems appropriate today.</p>
<p>Deharme published several articles and a book on radio theory. "Proposition d'un art radiophonique" was published in 1928 in the Nouvelle Revue Française, the leading literary journal of the period. In it, Deharme announces a theory of radiophonic art and offers a compendium of principles that he had found most useful for making the radio message reach not only the listener's ears, but his or her conscious and subconscious mind. His book <span style="font-style:italic;">Pour un art radiophonique</span> (Paris: Le rouge et le noir, 1930) significantly expanded on these ideas, adding references to contemporary psychological and psychoanalytic thought and to the surrealists, and offering a detailed discussion of the one radio-play that best exemplified Deharme's ideas, the 1929 adaptation of Ambrose Bierce's <span style="font-style:italic;">An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge</span>. In the magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Vendre</span>, Deharme also published a lecture originally given at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Association des Collaborateurs de la Publicité</span>, in which he defends radio as a medium to which advertisers should pay just as much attention as cinema or the written word.<a name="fvi-text" href="#fvi"><sup>vi</sup></a></p>
<p>Strictly speaking, Deharme always remained a businessman. While a student at the prestigious Parisian Lycée Louis-le-Grand, he had been drafted for the First World War and never finished a formal school education, beginning instead to sell vacuum cleaners. In 1922, Raoul Fernandez hired him to work for his advertising company Informations et Publicité, a member of the Havas group providing advertising and news coverage to private radio stations in France in the 1920s. From 1923 on, Deharme was in charge of producing programs for the most important French radio stations at the time: Radio Paris, the emblematic radio station that broadcast from the Eiffel Tower, le Poste Parisien, and later Radio Luxembourg.<a name="fvii-text" href="#fvii"><sup>vii</sup></a></p>
<p>From his early years on, however, Deharme also befriended artists and writers. In 1928, he married Lise Anne-Marie Hirtz, later known as Lise Deharme, who had been Breton's "dame du gant" in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nadja</span>, and was a surrealist poet and journal editor <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  in her own right.<a name="fviii-text" href="#fviii"><sup>viii</sup></a> Deharme's unique merit lay in attracting artists of great talent, such as the surrealist poet Robert Desnos and the Cuban writer and music journalist Alejo Carpentier, to radio broadcasting. From 1933 on, both worked full-time for the company he founded, Phoniric, and they eventually took it over at Deharme's death. Antonin Artaud and the actor Jean-Louis Barrault, together with German composer Kurt Weill, participated in the famous <span style="font-style:italic;">Fantômas</span> radio program, broadcast in 1933 under the direction of Paul Deharme. Others, such as Jacques Prévert or Paul Claudel, also collaborated from time to time. The company ceased to exist only in 1939 in the wake of the Second World War.</p>
<p>For Deharme, both advertising and art must primarily concern themselves with making the listener remember a product or argument upon the first hearing. According to Deharme, the spoken word is best remembered when it makes the listener an "unconscious interlocutor of the speaker," that is, it has the listener enter into a dialogue with the plot (<span style="font-style:italic;">Vendre</span>, 71). Fictional narrative with generic, stereotyped characters, with whom the listener identifies, is thus the best way to introduce him or her to a product. This is why in advertising Deharme preferred a format that was characteristic of early radio programming, the "programme patronné" or "sponsored program," where advertising spots did not frame or conclude a particular segment, but were built into the narrative. As Deharme puts it: "The sponsored program, like a snail, carries with it its house" ("Le programme patronné comme l'escargot, porte avec lui son emplacement"). <a name="fix-text" href="#fix"><sup>ix</sup></a> The "programme patronné" became Deharme's signature format, and spots such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Fantomâs</span> must be understood simultaneously as art and advertising. Robert Desnos considered the slogans and songs that he wrote for the radio in the 1930s to be veritable popular poetry, and thought that art in general had to follow suit and be "popularized" at all costs.<a name="fx-text" href="#fx"><sup>x</sup></a></p>
<p>His work remains crucial for those interested in the experimental phase of radio, when many thought of it simultaneously as a mass medium and an art form. Merging radiophonic art and advertising in 1930s France, Deharme created one of the many "minor" art forms that turned the time between the wars into a golden age not only for the literary avant-garde, but for French culture as such. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">Paul Deharme: "Proposition for a Radiophonic Art"</h1>
<h2 class="sec-headB">
<span style="font-style:italic;">La Nouvelle Revue Française</span>, vol. XXX : 413–23.</h2>
<p>Since the appearance of the wireless, everyone has predicted, albeit in fairly vague terms, the rise of a truly radiophonic literature and dramatic art. And so, in every country, radio stations have invited us to listen to the story of the lighthouse keeper driven crazy by a tempest where, alone and powerless in his lighthouse he can only report to the listener what he sees, accompanied by elaborate noise-effects and the sirens of ships in distress; or else there is the story of the scholar in need of silence for his research, who is constantly interrupted by the piano of his neighbor, the trumpet of the faucet-seller, and the cries of the new-born.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a><a name="fxi-text" href="#fxi"><sup>xi</sup></a> Today, however, it is no longer enough to shoot a pistol in the air in order to scare the audience or to pretend to be deaf, mad, or a stutterer in order to make them laugh. Why have we, in this new domain and public sphere, not yet come up with truly new forms of expression?</p>
<p>I am convinced that today's minds have a need for an imagination and lyrical transformation that cannot be satisfied by any conventional or even recent art forms, except by a radiophonic art. The taste for the unreal is part of this need, and it announces itself, among other examples, in the pleasure that an average audience, one not necessarily uneducated but young, takes in a film replete with special effects where human beings float in the air or turn into smoke, objects become animated and interfere in the action, and things refuse to abide by the rules that normally govern them.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> It seems to me that the waves of the wireless, remote and mysterious like the sources of our thought, can and should feed our imagination with the new inspiration that it deserves.</p>
<h2 class="sec-headB">The interior theater.</h2>
<p>Under the conditions that I am going to explain, the wireless will be enabled to evoke images in the spirit of the listener analogous to those of dreams.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The psychological importance of dreams can no longer be disputed. We can, however, make one observation easy to grasp for the reader: many times our memory of a dream <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  seems to our mind so plausible and real that we ask ourselves: "Have I really dreamt?" In those cases, we have to make an effort to remember everything correctly and free ourselves from the preoccupation or the joy provoked by that dream, exactly as if we had really experienced it. Similarly, after a slip of tongue or an involuntary gesture, prompted, as everyone knows, by a process similar to that of dreams, we exclaim: "Am I dreaming?" This familiar occurrence expresses an undisputable scientific truth.</p>
<p>It is therefore not absurd to hope that we are able to create inside ourselves a theater analogous to the theater of dreams.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a><a name="fxii-text" href="#fxii"><sup>xii</sup></a> We will categorically reject those who claim that these projects are related to hypnotism.<a name="fxiii-text" href="#fxiii"><sup>xiii</sup></a> Rather, we believe that tales, readings, landscapes, and music instruments can "cast a spell" on us. There is a spontaneous instinctual reaction in us when confronted with nature or with a work of art that makes us "close our eyes" and drift into a state of "absence," as we know. This is the tendency that interests us here. We won't listen either to those who object that this is an acoustic phenomenon whereas dreams are made of visual hallucinations. The hallucinations we have in mind can in fact be recreated by means other than optical ones. All of us have experienced the abyss that separates the impression produced by an anticipated performance from that of the same performance when we see it.</p>
<p>In order to move comfortably inside his imaginary world, the listeners will most likely have to undergo an education of the senses. But this should be an easy thing, as the wireless offers us the means to neutralize a given reality and balance it between the source of suggestions and the state of mind of the listener who plays his inner film, ideally with the aid of headphones.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Thus, in front of the loudspeaker or perhaps even wearing his headphones, the listener will close his eyes and not think of anything.</p>
<p>We have known silent art, now we have blind art. This project, in its spirit close to surrealism, should not be received by the public as unfavorably as the early literary manifestations of that doctrine were.</p>
<p>Surrealism owes its beginnings and really its life to the subconscious, as it is called today. And it is this same subconscious that we aspire to touch with the help of the wireless, but in a direct fashion, thus avoiding to awake the conscious mind and its disturbing actions.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> The first surrealist experiments, in contrast, were of an exclusively subjective nature; they focused on exploring the realm of dreams, yet their goal was <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to lend "literary" expression to these experiences. To make out of a highly personal experience the objective origin of art, which is always public, was as vain a project as it would have been to take a picture of oneself in a mirror.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> In a mirror, even if it is a magic one, one can only discover oneself.</p>
<p>In the future it must become possible, thanks to the collaboration and experience of the community of wireless amateurs, to allow the listener to decide the moment when he or she can "see" a suggested image. The listener will in fact have created for himself a mental balance, perhaps as difficult to obtain for some as to keep one's attention focused on external and visible objects, but with some exercise it will become mechanical.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Attempt at a technique</h1>
<p>Here are twelve rules that follow immediately from the preceding. They constitute a theoretical summary, a preliminary system. Experience will rule out some elements, correct others, and confirm perhaps a few of them: this list is only meant to open up a path of inquiry.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>1.   When prompted, each listener shall imagine that he is the principal protagonist of the comedy that he is going to hear. Likewise, we will introduce into our objective narrative <span style="font-style:italic;">prompts for subjective sensations</span> such as, for example, the following: "It is cold.—You are hungry.—Here are the ones you love.—Far away, there is a house; this is where you were born.—A car passes by; it is the one that you noticed the other day, etc…" This innovation is essential for our purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>2.   The "reciter" shall forget the art of reading aloud.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> It is necessary that the listener take in the text as if he were reading it by himself in silence (with closed eyes and his ears stopped, eliminating in this way all the risks of distraction from the outside that are run by the solitary reader). Therefore, <span style="font-style:italic;">grey diction</span> is recommended, arguably a difficult task for the speaker, but after a while he will be a specialist at it, a kind of phonograph.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> The idea is to obtain a narrative "chopped up" into separate images that are presented in succession.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>3.   Broaching now the issue of the background story (as if these were the words in brackets of a novel), <span style="font-style:italic;">instances of direct speech will be rare</span>. These few instances then should produce great effect and should be pronounced by voices other than that of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the speaker; for example: "Hands up!" shouts a new voice . . . and that of the speaker will continue <span style="font-style:italic;">tonelessly</span>: "a man appears to the left . . .", and give a description of how the character looks, what kind of personality it is, etc… When they appear for the first time in the comedy, these characters will be "introduced" in as much detail as desired in order to become similar to those who move in our dreams and <span style="font-style:italic;">who originate together with the imaginary memories related to them</span>. In other words, each character will, as if in a dream, come with his or her particular description attached. But the words of a given character can be spoken at times by one individual voice, at times by the speaker, as well as the character's deeds and gestures. The particular voice that, for a moment is at the character's service (see next section), will then become available to be used for other characters or on another occasion (see section 8).<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> This should not pose a problem for the balanced listener; does it not also happen in our dreams that a sentence begun by one person is finished by another person, or even by us? We are therefore led to create:</p></li>
<li><p>4.   <span style="font-style:italic;">Vocal masks</span> as the elements of a simple repertoire, like in the classical or Italian comedy—the young lead, a heavenly voice; the noble father, of short stature, etc… The nuances that are almost always prohibited for the reciter will be reserved for the characters.</p></li>
<li><p>5.   <span style="font-style:italic;">Background music</span>. Dream music, as easy as possible, the music of the old melodrama: this kind of music will "warn" the listener through tremolos or ritornellos; it will draw a character in short phrases, and his or her return on scene will then be announced by the repetition of that motif. This will make it possible to bend and complicate the action without endangering its clarity; in short, by using expressive phrases music will "illustrate" the comedy.</p></li>
<li><p>6.   Obviously, the <span style="font-style:italic;">present indicative</span> should be used at all times, just like in the legends of Épinal images.14 One exception can be made for the introduction of the characters (see section 3).</p></li>
<li><p>7.   C<span style="font-style:italic;">hronological order</span> should be adopted when recounting the action: in order not to interrupt the course of events, the listener should always be "on location;" one might want to lead him up to the heavens or cross a continent, but there shall not be leaps in place or in time. We believe that one must avoid saying: "Twenty years ago there was born in New York…" or "ten kilometers away from there, two travelers…"</p></li>
<li><p>8.   The <span style="font-style:italic;">repetition of certain parts of sentences</span> by different voices serves to emphasize an image and make it unforgettable. Important passages will be rhymed or set to music. The most subtle nuances of a text shall thus be rendered palpable to the audience.</p></li>
<li><p>9.   The noises of an action will not bear any trace of reality. Will a gun-shot appear as such? Most certainly not; the reciter may just slightly hit his finger against the table. Our ability to perfectly "translate" noises is revealed to us in our dreams.</p></li>
<li><p>10.   Often when reading a book, one relieves tension by glancing three lines or even three pages ahead. This is impossible in radio broadcasting and as a consequence, one has to "perform" time, that is, one has to plan for moments of complete silence on behalf of the speaker, possibly "furnished" or not with incidental music. For example: An explosion occurs, the voice of the speaker says: "One of the two enemies drops dead." Silence, then a slow resurfacing of the musical motif that is attached to the surviving character. (See section 5)</p></li>
<li><p>11.   <span style="font-style:italic;">Don't precipitate the action.</span> The imagination, in fact, is known for not retaining any notion of time when maintained in a dream-state by the voice of the reciter or by the music. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></li>
<li><p>12.   <span style="font-style:italic;">Chronometrics of representation</span>. This is what in film is called the montage technique. Use of the metronome: one has to determine the number of pulses of each silent, musical, or spoken passage.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Keeping in mind the observations and the advice of listeners, we should be able to set on its feet, in relatively short a time, a technique as rigorous as the one that helps filmmakers to make marginal indications in the pages of their scripts. A radio script, when prepared for the microphone will bear, just like a film script, the personal imprint of the script writer or the technician.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>While waiting to see original radiophonic works make their appearance, here is a selection of tales, all of them appropriate for adaptation according to the rules above.</p>
<p>One will find that fantastic literature, because of its relationship with our dreams, for now seems best suited for the microphone. But the experience of those who write adaptations for the radio is progressing fast, and an ever vaster domain will open up to writers.</p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f1" href="#f1-text">1. </a>Recently in Germany there was a competition of radiophonic dramas. The jury received 1,200 responses, but refrained from awarding a prize to anyone. Only one work titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Storm over the Pacific</span> received the recommendation to be aired (<span style="font-style:italic;">Le journal</span>, December 21, 1927).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f2" href="#f2-text">2. </a>Does not the success of film generally demonstrate the astonishing force of our unconscious power of transposition? We have immediately adapted to sequences of images <span style="font-style:italic;">without color</span>, projected over a screen <span style="font-style:italic;">without a profile</span>. A few fantastic films such as Max Fleischer's Clown Koko films, where real life characters mix with cartoon res, are quite admirably executed.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f3" href="#f3-text">3. </a>After listening to the radio version of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Blue Bird</span> by Maeterlinck in London, an English critic declared never having listened to anything so perfect. The microphone, he said, reinforced the "unreal" character of the work (<span style="font-style:italic;">Echo de Paris</span>, January 23, 1920). According to another English critic, the music of the 17<sup>th</sup> - and 18<sup>th</sup>-century harpsichord is especially appropriate for the microphone. He attributes this fact to a certain kind of immateriality rendered especially well in radiophonic art, as it lends a kind of faerie charm to the works of Rameau, Scarlatti, and Couperin (<span style="font-style:italic;">Radio Times</span>, February 3, 1928).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f4" href="#f4-text">4. </a>The place in the soul where dreams unfold is not the same as that of the representations of waking life (Fechner).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f5" href="#f5-text">5. </a>Is it not true that the darkness of the movie theater, greater than that of the theater hall, suppresses the distractions to which the spectator is prone, and encourages his receptivity? In Bayreuth, the orchestra is invisible. We should expect much from the illusionary power of a theater where the spectators are <span style="font-style:italic;">at home</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">alone</span>!</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f6" href="#f6-text">6. </a>These two terms of the conscious and the unconscious have served, as we know, to create a rudimentary spatial notion of our psychic domain, according to which they refer to two <span style="font-style:italic;">separate</span> zones. Here is a typical example of this classic theory: musical motifs are sometimes very clearly articulated <span style="font-style:italic;">on the bottom</span> of our memory, yet we are incapable of warbling them because we are often inhibited by the remembrance of other tunes that we know better and that lie, so to speak, <span style="font-style:italic;">on the surface</span> of our memory. It is this "border patrol" of the unconscious inhibiting, it seems, the exchanges between the outside and the inside that we hope to "cheat" and overcome by passing from the outside to the inside.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f7" href="#f7-text">7. </a>In contrast, music and the plastic arts are means that can suggest new surrealist dreams.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f8" href="#f8-text">8. </a>Reading aloud is a rudimentary instrument, as is a certain kind of theater, in clear contradiction with the art that we imagine. It is much less pure, because it only aims to touch our sensibility by way of <span style="font-style:italic;">imitating reality</span> instead of allowing for <span style="font-style:italic;">suggestion by a certain reality</span>. A sublime way to achieve this effect would be to use painting or music.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f9" href="#f9-text">9. </a>In order to touch someone's heart one usually speaks in a low voice and without bursts. Perhaps this is not the case in theater, but certainly in real life.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f10" href="#f10-text">10. </a>Theater itself has sometimes made use of such techniques. Without need to go back to the Greeks, the recitative speech of Stravinsky's and Ramuz's piece <span style="font-style:italic;">History of a Soldier</span>, for example, by virtue of its monotonous scansion, produces a similar effect in the listener. It is, in fact, a proceeding close to magic incantation or litanies, close also to the methods recommended by mystics to make the soul disposed for the gift of supernatural "raptures."</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f11" href="#f11-text">11. </a>"That terrible and clear voice of those people seen when one is asleep." (Kipling, <span style="font-style:italic;">The City of Dreams</span>).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f12" href="#f12-text">12. </a>One would have to begin by creating a "central laboratory" that classifies the instances where the majority of listeners sensed it was easy to develop a suggested image. As "primary material" one might want to choose the symbols most frequently appearing in dreams. On this topic an important body of Freudian literature can be consulted.</p></div>

<h1 class="sec-headA">Mew and Literary History</h1>
<p>Few modern writers have proved as hard to place, both culturally and historically, as Charlotte Mew (1869–1928), the English author whose faltering attempts at securing her literary reputation, which began in the mid-1890s, only came to fruition a generation later when her second, expanded edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span> —the only book she published in her lifetime—won plaudits on both sides of the Atlantic. While scholars have frequently drawn attention to the accolades that Mew's poetry received from both established res such as Thomas Hardy ("the greatest poetess I have come across lately") and younger authors such as Virginia Woolf ("very good and interesting and unlike anyone else"), they have reached little consensus about the period or movement to which Mew belongs.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> On the one hand, critics have categorized Mew as a distinctly fin-de-siècle re whose career remains firmly rooted in the literary ethos of the 1890s and early 1900s: the decades when most of her early publications were short stories and essays that appeared in a diverse range of late-Victorian periodicals, including Henry Harland's decadent <span style="font-style:italic;">Yellow Book</span>, W. E. Henley's imperialist <span style="font-style:italic;">Outlook</span>, and that bastion of middle-class taste, <span style="font-style:italic;">Temple Bar</span>. On the other hand, readers have claimed Mew as a female modernist whose poetic innovations developed in the 1910s, even if her revisions of conventional prosody were not of the kind that readily linked her with Imagism: the short-lived movement that for T. S. Eliot defined the "<span style="font-style:italic;">point de repère</span>" that marked "the starting-point of modern poetry."<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> Such commentaries support this observation <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  by pointing out that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Egoist</span>, the journal that gave greatest prominence to Imagism in Britain, took serious interest in Mew's idiosyncratic work.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The difficulty in locating Mew's literary-historical position is evident in several important feminist studies that have contributed to the scholarly recovery of women's writing of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In her significant assessment of women's poetry written between the 1820s and the 1910s, Angela Leighton asserts that "in spirit Charlotte Mew is one of the last Victorians," mostly because the "sensibility and imagery" of her writing "looks back to the women poets"—such as Emily Brontë, Christina Rossetti, and Alice Meynell—"who preceded her."<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Meanwhile, to Elaine Showalter, Mew fits more squarely within the group that she calls the "daughters of decadence."<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> This cohort of <span style="font-style:italic;">flâneuses</span>, New Women, and emergent suffragists produced sexually risk-taking stories frequently issued by John Lane, the publisher who supported Harland's journal. By contrast, Celeste M. Schenck expresses discontent at the manner in which modern readers, no matter how much they acknowledge Mew's originality, "tend at the same time to censure her for her small, unoracular formalism."<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> As a result, even feminist critics have been unable to "read beyond what they see as the rhythmical familiarity and rhyme to a strikingly unconventional content" whose insubordinate sexual politics makes Mew's output markedly post-Victorian.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> More recently, some researchers have sought to place Mew within an identifiable canon of modernist women's poetry (including work by Frances Cornford and Anna Wickham), one that, even if it does not break with fixed forms, is perceptibly—if not radically—"resisting femininity" of a conventional type.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Such discussions occasionally put pressure on the idea that Mew's modernism can also be heard through the echoes that several of her monologues supposedly make in T. S. Eliot's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> .<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>In many respects, Mew's inimitable poetry—the at first "unintelligible" verse in "irregular but rhymed meter" that struck the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times Literary Supplement</span> in 1916 as having the "grotesque inconsequence of dream"—creates problems for literary historians because it often dramatizes situations in which her speakers experience what it means to be out of sync with, if not out of place in, their worlds.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Although her comparatively slender body of poetry contains a number of fairly conventional sonnets, ballads, and lyrics dating from the early 1900s, the writings on which Mew's reputation rests are largely the dramatic poems she completed between 1912 and 1915. More often than not, these arresting works test the limits of fixed forms by expanding and contracting line lengths in a style that enables her characteristically distressed personae to express themselves in an urgent, impulsive manner. More to the point, the "extraordinary . . . indigenous originality" that Marianne Moore detected in this group of poems is unusual because Mew's disjointed, emotionally raw poetic voices also at times recall a fairly wide range of well-known nineteenth-century precursors.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Some of the works collected in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span> allude to famous lyrics and monologues by Robert Browning, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Alfred Tennyson, and they share much of these earlier writers' subject-matter, especially topics such as crises in religious faith, prostitution, and sexual infidelity. Concurrently, at the very moment when her speakers appear to be thematically linked with a literary ancestry that sometimes reaches back <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  even further to the High Romantics, her poetry takes pains to disrupt its formal ties with the outdated tradition that it references.</p>
<p>In her best-known poems, Mew presents an array of male and female personae that adopt retrospectives on their unhappy lives while imagining the impossibility of continuing their present existence. Although it is misleading to conclude that such writings anticipate Mew's decision, at the age of fifty-eight, to take her life (these are not poems in which her speakers plan to commit self-murder), it is difficult not to be struck by the visceral deathly notes that resound at the end of these poems: "I shall, perhaps, grow old and die" ("Pécheresse"), "I shall always, always be very cold" ("The Changeling"), "some day I <span style="font-style:italic;">shall</span> not think; I shall not <span style="font-style:italic;">be</span>!" ("The Quiet House"), and "I shall strike and tear / Mine [heart] out, and scatter it with yours" ("The Forest Road").<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> As these brief quotations suggest, her poetic voices emphasize the prospect of their own annihilation, and they do so because the position in which they speak remains burdened by harrowing past experiences. In other words, both in form and structure Mew's poems exert themselves in defamiliarizing, and thus modernizing, a well-established genre that her speakers have no further wish to inhabit. Given that Mew's personae are characterized by their categorical refusal to remain caught in, let alone be determined by, the dissatisfying experiences that haunt them, her writing often appears driven by a desire to step outside history, especially the literary history that her work embraces and repudiates at once. My present aim is to analyze the reasons why the distinctive poetics that Mew developed, after long delays, tend to confound the critical frameworks that seek to orient her writing to either the beginning or the latter part of the period (1894 to 1928) when she appeared in some of the most prominent publications that defined fin-de-siècle decadence, on the one hand, and emergent literary modernism, on the other hand. Furthermore, I suggest the reasons why Mew's poetry, whose irregular rhythms and rhymes direct attention to the disorderly modernity that both energizes her art and estranges her troubled speakers, draws into question critical and cultural imperatives that try to fix anyone or anything in time.</p>
<p>That Mew's personae emphatically wish not to linger any longer with troubling after-effects is evident in one of her most compelling writings: a twenty-four-line monologue that focuses on poetic success called "Fame," which first appeared in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New Weekly</span> in 1913. This poem provides a useful starting-point for exploring Mew's propensity for evoking a literary heritage that she is eager not just to undermine but escape. As its title suggests, this poem, which modulates between four- and sixteen-syllable rhymed lines, recalls John Keats's two 1819 sonnets that re "Fame" as either a gypsy-blooded "wayward girl" or a seductress who threatens to "rob" the male poet's "fair name of its maidenhood."<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Similarly, this monologue reminds us of William Wordsworth's reflections in 1820 on how "hasty Fame"—which has wrongfully "many a chaplet culled / For worthless brows"—left the eighteenth-century poet John Dyer "ungraced."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Mew's "Fame" follows this line of thought, by exploring, with comparable misgivings, the fickle nature of this alluring feminine re, whose seductive beauty later emerges as the personification that titles her poem—which begins as follows: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>Sometimes in the over-heated house, but not for long,<br>     Smirking and speaking rather loud,<br>   I see myself among the crowd,<br>Where no one fits the singer to his song,<br>Of sifts the unpainted from the painted faces<br>Of the people who are always on my stair</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 2).</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the implicitly (though not definitively) male speaker reveals that at times when he has indulged in his crowd-pleasing fame, he has also reminded himself of a past when he was more or less anonymous.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> As he reflects upon those days when he was just one among the many, Mew's poetic celebrity—who is now mobbed by people of fashion—recognizes that such fandom remains at odds with his art: "They were not with me when I walked in heavenly places" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 2). Simultaneously, however, he realizes that he cannot exist solely in this glorified artistic realm because his reputation is dependent on the "din, the scuffle, [and] the long stare" of the very people who throng around him (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 2). "[C]ould I spare" the "faces / Of the people," he asks, "If I went back" to this "heavenly" realm and found that "it" (his audience of devotees) "was not there" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 2)? The problem, it seems, is that he gradually sees that the nature that inspires his ostensibly Romantic poetry, such as "The folded glory of the gorse" and "the sweet-briar air," exists in a state of indifference to humanity: "the larks cannot praise us . . . knowing nothing of what we do," just as the "divine, wise trees . . . do not care" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 2). In his growing disillusionment, he eventually grasps that he can derive no satisfaction from either the acolytes in the "over-heated house" who praise him or the "old known things that are new" (that is, the things that keep reproducing themselves) in nature with which he cannot interact.</p>
<p>Little wonder that Mew's speaker decides that the time might have come to "leave Fame" behind, despite this female re's bewitching "eyes" and "bright hair!" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 2). Before he bids farewell to this enticing Romantic icon, however, his mind focuses on fulfilling one last ambition, and it is here that Mew's poem changes course. At last, he wishes to depart from "Fame" and "Take in her stead / To our tossed bed / One little dream, not matter how small, how wild" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 3). Just at the moment when he recognizes that this final wish might sound both eccentric and insignificant, he states that he thinks he has found it "in a field, under a fence—/ A frail, dead, new-born lamb, ghostly and pitiful and white" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 3). What might we make of the fulfillment of his desire to exchange the sensuality of "Fame" for this stillborn creature in the slept-in bed? Why should this poem end with the speaker's yearning to nestle with the corpse of an animal whose iconography points in divergent directions to the sacrifice made by Jesus Christ, on the one hand, and to the vagaries of natural selection, on the other hand? The fact that we learn that the creature is "A blot upon the night," as well as "The moon's dropped child" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 3) prompts additional thoughts about the ways in which it is both a welcome source of disration and one of the casualties of an unforgiving nature. As Leighton says, it is hard not to think of this "new-born lamb" as a "miscarried birth."<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> This striking conclusion shows that Mew's speaker embraces a creature whose premature demise makes the sexual excitement traditionally associated with the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  female icon "Fame" look pretentious, if not meaningless. By disclosing how the speaker finally wants to lie down with this dead lamb (in a gesture that echoes many parts of the Bible), Mew's poem suggests that her art finds value in thrusting aside questionable nineteenth-century aesthetic ideals in the name of treasuring what a far-from-benign nature has discarded. In other words, her speaker concentrates attention on giving artistic worth to a "frail" body, in a manner that might, like the biblical ration of Jesus Christ as the lamb of God, redeem poets from the "over-heated," egotistical ambition to receive praise from an unworthy, fashionably "painted" crowd.</p>
<p>In "Fame," however, no matter how Christ-like we might find the disring "blot" of the stillborn lamb, it remains the case that this perturbing image shows that the imaginative future into which Mew's speaker wishes to inscribe his fame-free identity is born dead on arrival. At the same time, the speaker exuberantly celebrates this "little dream" of finding a "frail, dead" creature through spirited deviations from fixed forms that destabilize, both visually and audibly, common aspects of the dramatic monologue: the well-established poetic genre, dating from the late 1820s and 1830s, in which Mew's contemporaries agreed she excelled. Yet it would be mistaken to assume that in "Fame" Mew simply amplifies the type of frantic monologist that Browning memorably featured in his early volume, <span style="font-style:italic;">Dramatic Romances and Lyrics</span> , where we see, for example, the hypocritical Bishop of St. Praxed's struggling to maintain his speech, couched in blank verse, on his death-bed. The bishop's famous wish is to have the last word on the gaudy, tasteless tomb that he wants his "Nephews" (his euphemism for his illegitimate sons) to build for him, when he knows in fact their only reason why they clamor around him is to grab whatever they can from his legacy.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Habitually, Browning's personae resemble the bishop in so far as they remain eager to delay and defer any event that might bring their often garrulous monologues to an unwanted end.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> By marked contrast, in "Fame" Mew's speaker hurtles, from one capricious line to another, toward a self-destructive climax: an implosion that occurs because he can at last obliterate the present moment in which he recognizes that his renown relies on his conceited "Smirking" and his self-important manner when "speaking rather loud." It is almost as if this ostensibly successful persona finally expresses a wish not to remain in literary history.</p>
<p>In many respects, "Fame" enshrines Mew's suspicion of the literary world that she found particularly tough to enter. Even then, when the expanded edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span> benefited from a very favorable reception (Conrad Aiken, for example, applauded Mew's "fine individuality"),<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> she had already run into difficulties in holding onto some of the contacts that brought her to public attention. To be sure, the fact that several important literary res made certain that she received a civil list pension of £75 in 1923 paid testimony to the considerable reputation that she had, in some quarters, established by that year. (Mew informed Hardy, one of the three well-known petitioners for the pension, of her "gratitude" as well as her feeling of "entire unworthiness" for this award.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a>) Furthermore, in 1921, after he provided an enthusiastic notice of the American edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span> (published by Macmillan as <span style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Market</span>), the well-known anthologist Louis Untermeyer helped strengthen <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Mew's profile for American readers, and by 1924, as a consequence of his and Mew's mutual acquaintance with Siegfried Sassoon, he was able to arrange a meeting with the poet, an event that turned out to be one of the most rewarding experiences during his visit to England. Betty Falkenberg has shown that, with each successive edition of Untermeyer's <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern British Poetry</span>, Mew received ever-increasing prominence (eleven of her poems appeared in the volumes he edited under this title in 1930 and 1936).<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> But few other critics sustained such attention in Mew's work.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why interest in Mew's poetry soon waned originated in the disheartening preface that Alida Klemantaski furnished for the posthumous volume, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rambling Sailor</span>, which appeared one year after the poet's death. Klemantaski, whose involvement in London's newly-opened Poetry Bookshop had brought her into contact with Mew in 1915, paints a dispiriting picture of Mew's life that did much to undermine the standing that the poet had belatedly enjoyed. Klemantaski comments on the trying circumstances that led to Mew's demise: "no sooner was the financial burden alleviated" through the civil list pension "than her mother died, and her own health broke down."<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> "Both these trials were overcome," she continues, "and all seemed ready for a return to a productive life when her beloved sister was stricken with a fatal illness and died after some months of agony." Klemantaski calls this loss the "last attack of Fate" on Mew, who "died . . . by her own hand, on March 24th , 1928." In his review of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rambling Sailor</span> in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bookman</span>, John Freeman concluded that the poet's career comprised "a story of discouragement and neglect."<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> What is more, as Freeman observes, Klemantaski's decision to include in this volume "earlier poems . . . published in half-forgotten magazines, such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Temple Bar</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Yellow Book</span>," made Mew appear even more even out of touch with the age. In any case, information about Mew's apparently grueling existence had already been circulated through the obituary that Sydney Cockerell, the curator of the Fitzwilliam Museum who made a great fuss of Mew when he befriended her in 1918, wrote for the London <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span>: "her whole life was a courageous battle with sorrows and adversities that have at last proved too much for her."<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Cockerell suggests that the civil list pension, "which was granted in the hope that it would enable her to do still better work," could not compensate for the "[i]ll-health and the cruel fate which never in her life released her from harassing and tragic cares" that "prevented" its "fulfillment."</p>
<p>Many years later, Klemantaski (now Alida Monro) did her best to give Mew renewed attention in a more expansive memoir in a fresh edition of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Collected Poems</span> that enabled a later generation to explore the works of a writer whose career up to that time seemed scarcely worth recording. Monro frames her recollections by giving the impression that what matters most about the poet was not so much her work as her eccentric style of dress and, noticeably, her small stature:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>She was very small, only about four feet ten inches, very slight, with square shoulders and tiny hands and feet. She always wore a long, double-breasted top-coat of tweed with a velvet collar inset. She always carried a horn-handled umbrella, unrolled, under her arm, as if it were psychologically necessary to her, a weapon against the world. She had very fine white hair that showed traces of once having been a warm brown. Her eyes were a <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  very dark grey, bright with black lashes, and highly arched dark eyebrows. Her face was a fine oval, and she always wore a little hard felt pork-pie shaped hat put on very straight. The whole time she was speaking she kept her head cocked at a defiant angle. When she came into the shop she was asked: "Are you Charlotte Mew?" and her characteristic reply was: "I am sorry to say I am."<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">From this carefully concocted picture, it is hard not to receive the impression that this petite, aging, and eccentric woman was battling against the odds with a world that tended to adopt (and often reject) her in a manner that made her feel that she did not have a proper or acceptable place.</p>
<p>Alida Monro's portrayal of Mew's diffident behavior and distinctive demeanor clearly aimed to repackage her for an audience who might otherwise believe that the poet was an unexceptional relic from the past. When Marianne Moore gave her endorsement to Macmillan of New York to issue an American edition of the British one that Alida Monro had prefaced, she observed that much of Mew's poetry was not "as Mrs. Monro seems to fear—out of style or 'dated.'"<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> The 1953 edition, however, hardly elevated Mew's work into the canon. Mary C. Davidow's 1960 doctoral dissertation, which provides a rich source of information for understanding Mew's career, did not make its way into print. By 1973, as John Newton remarks, the first <span style="font-style:italic;">Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry</span> contained none of Mew's poems.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> It took until 1981 before Val Warner gathered Mew's known writings together in one volume. In a notice of Warner's edition, English novelist Penelope Fitzgerald declared that Mew "changed very little for about thirty years of her life."<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> "She was," Fitzgerald added, "tiny, trim, curly-headed, and pale, wearing size-two boots—doll's boots."<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Fitzgerald elaborated the poet's almost timeless oddity in <span style="font-style:italic;">Charlotte Mew and Her Friends</span> : an attentive biographical study that left Brad Leithauser with an overall impression of Mew as a "patchy" but gifted writer who produced "some half-dozen lyrics of unique beauty and finish" that "ought to entitle her to a small share of enduring renown."<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Ever since the early 1980s, a growing body of scholarship has tended to follow Fitzgerald's lead in assuming that the task of Mew's biographer is "not so much to reconstruct her life as to account for what life did to her."<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> On this view, Mew's poetry bears witness to the emotional wreckage with which she had to contend because of the stressful circumstances of her seemingly claustrophobic home life, the mental illness that afflicted all but one of her surviving siblings, her repeatedly frustrated lesbian desires, and her halting efforts to establish her professional identity.</p>
<p>One of the consequences of the long-overdue recovery of Mew's poetry has been for critics to dwell on a dismal life story in the name of characterizing her as a victimized, marginal, and, from some perspectives, queer individual whose heartbroken death (which occurred after she lost the remaining members of her household) reveals that what success she had enjoyed, including a close friendship with Thomas Hardy and Florence Hardy, simply came too late.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> On occasion, readers have tried to fill the apparent vacuum that was Mew's career in the mid-1890s by assuming that she published under a pseudonym. Davidow maintains that the poet published two lyrics in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Yellow Book</span> under the name of Charles Catty, an English writer whose <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  collected works appeared in 1914.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> But this is nothing compared to her speculation that as a young woman Mew conducted an affair with Hardy, an idea that remains a bizarre component in Davidow's otherwise pioneering research.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> In the mid-1990s, Davidow's hunch inspired a novel that exploits first-person narrative to make this presumed liaison into a torrid affair that began in 1893, more than twenty years before Mew was invited to Hardy's home, Max Gate, in 1918: "Hardy took my left hand and began, with infinite care, to remove the glove. Lightly, he caressed each finger through the thin black leather, for several tantalizing moments."<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> As one might predict, in this clumsily handled scene the "second glove fell to the floor."<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> Yet once he has undressed himself ("his pupils hugely dilated"), Hardy inspires such fear in Mew that she has to repulse his charms: "I'm in agony, too. I'm trapped between a longing for love and an invisible something that forbids it."<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> (The "something," as this particular novelist has gleaned from Fitzgerald's biography, is Mew's lesbianism.)</p>
<p>If, however, we refrain from conjecturing about what happened during the evident hiatuses in Mew's career (as Warner notes, between 1906 and 1912 "nothing is known of her life except that she published [a] poem and had holidays in Dieppe and Boulogne"),<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> then a rather different understanding of her intermittent appearances in literary history can begin to emerge. Fitzgerald's observation that Mew is a "poet of delayed shock"<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> provides a helpful clue to what is arguably central to a small but distinguished poetic canon, which begins with traditional sonnets that involve dialogues with Christina Rossetti's verse, continues with ballads that in some respects echo writings by Rosamund Marriott Watson (whose poetry appeared widely in magazines of the 1880s and 1890s), and develops monologues—such as we have seen in "Fame"—that feature speakers who eagerly insist on their own disintegration. Throughout many of these poems, the present tense serves as the time for recalling disquieting events after a hiatus. While there might appear to be some correspondence between the periodic silences in Mew's publishing history and the experiential delays that preoccupy her writings, the more important point is that from the fin de siècle to the interwar period Mew remained fairly consistent in rehearsing scenarios in which her narrative and poetic voices address the repercussions of such temporal discontinuity. By looking at the sporadic instances when Mew made an impact on the culture of her day, we can see more clearly why her enduring interest in giving voice to characters that have an acute sense of historical dislocation forges a number of literary links, though far from seamless ones, between the 1890s and the 1910s.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Mew's Discontinuities</h1>
<p>Until 1901, Charlotte Mew came before the public as a writer of prose, and her first appearance in print, at the age of twenty-four, suggests that she initially wished to present herself as an avant-garde author who belonged to a distinctly fin-de-siècle generation. Her striking story, "Passed," was included in the second issue of Harland's <span style="font-style:italic;">Yellow Book</span>: the journal whose polemical life began, as Holbrook Jackson observed in 1913, as "a bombshell thrown into the world of letters."<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Not only did the hardbound <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  quarterly's yellow binding smack of decadent French fiction; Aubrey Beardsley's pro vocative cover image of a devilish-looking man leering at a busty partygoer at a <span style="font-style:italic;">bal masqué</span> was also designed, as its advanced publicity put it, "not to tremble at the frown of Mrs. Grundy." The journal aimed, as Harland's advertising stated, to depart "from the bad old traditions of periodical literature" and "have the courage of its modernness."<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Even though the London <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> acknowledged that the marketing of the periodical aimed to combine "English rowdyism with French lubricity," it nonetheless realized that the journal's claims to such insubordination were a little overstated.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> In its opinion, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Yellow Book</span>'s inclusion of established res such as Frederic Leighton and Henry James mingled rather oddly with representatives of the "New Art" and "New Literature" such as Walter Sickert and Arthur Symons.</p>
<p>Mew's presence in the July 1894 number was remarkable for an unheard-of writer. Her story sat next to not only respected authors such as Henry James ("The Coxon Fund") and Austin Dobson (famous in the 1880s for his <span style="font-style:italic;">vers de société</span>) but also individuals who had recently come to attention, including Kenneth Grahame, whose stories—notably "The Rural Pan" —prered the success he would later enjoy with his children's classic, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wind in the Willows</span> . Moreover, Max Beerbohm established his reputation as a satirist in the first two issues of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Yellow Book</span>. Similarly, Ella d'Arcy, who became an object of Mew's unrequited passion, contributed one of the tales that affiliated her writing with the pioneering New Woman authors, such as George Egerton, whom John Lane supported. In a memoir, d'Arcy, who became not only the journal's most regular contributor but also its assistant editor, recalled the liveliness of the evening parties that Harland hosted at his home on Cromwell Road. Mew's name appears in d'Arcy's illustrious roll-call of visitors, including Edmund Gosse, the Marriott Watsons, and George Moore.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> This is not surprising because Harland, after reading Mew's story, went so far as to inform her that he thought it "a highly remarkable piece of literature"; it was, he believed, a work eminently suited to the scandal that his journal had recently managed to generate.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> "[F]or that reason," he told Mew, "it is destined to meet with scant recognition from the newspaper reviewers; I think it destined to be violently abused; and the Yellow Book will be abused for printing it."<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a></p>
<p>It is worth pausing for a moment with "Passed" because it explores the kinds of experiential disconnectedness that Mew would transfer, much later, into a distinctive poetics that explores how modern subjects cannot but help recall past experiences that disturb them. The jarring modernity of this impressionistic story becomes immediately evident as the first-person <span style="font-style:italic;">flâneuse</span> begins by recounting a day when she impulsively laid down her sewing in preference for the "keen air" outdoors (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 65). As she unravels her memories of an unsettling chance encounter, she leads the reader on a directionless but ever-accelerating path through some of London's poorest areas. Unlike contemporaneous tales, however, that expose the city's working-class deprivation (the unflinching realism of Arthur Morrison's <span style="font-style:italic;">A Child of the Jago</span> [1896] is perhaps the most celebrated example from this period), Mew's narrator describes the "delirium of enchanting motion" that sets her on her way through an urban world in which she seems overwhelmed by the cityscape and the inhabitants that pass in a phantasmagoric <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  pageant before her eyes (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 65). Yet the "glamour" that initially enraptures her—whether in "a girl's uncovered hair" or the "illuminated twilight" that "transre[s]" the "dim res" that populate this shifting urban scene—soon begins to wane (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 66). Rapidly, in a series of events marked by abrupt changes of movement, the narrator discovers everything in her midst is "passing" in the double sense of both moving and dying. Moreover, she grows increasingly aware of the ways in which this transforming environment is filled with distracting images that aim to manipulate passersby. Especially important is her sudden glimpse of a "large chromo" in shop window selling "[p]ictures" that seems "scarcely more inviting"—though less "odiferous"—"than the fishmonger's next door" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 67). The print in question features a "girl at prayer . . . eyes turned upward, presumably to heaven": a pose, as Mew's narrator ironically remarks, that "left the gazer in no state to dwell on the elaborately bared breasts below" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 67). Semi-clad, this apparently holy re embodies a "pseudo-purity" that proves "sensually diverting, and consequently"—in this era of high capitalism—"marketable" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 67). Revolted by the manner in which such dressed-up pornography amounts to the "prostitution" of an aesthetic ideal (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 67), she immediately follows an initiative to seek an authentically holy place, a church built by an architect who passed in 1887, which she enters, only to be unsettled by the dark "obscurity" she finds inside.</p>
<p>Just at the point when the narrator feels frustrated in her efforts to seek some purifying solace in the church, she finds herself "arrested" by a re whose "attitude" contrasts markedly with the sexualized commercialism of the "large chromo." Unable at first to make out the woman whose "lines spoke unquestionable despair," she eventually detects "importunate strength of beauty" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 67, 68). "Her eyes met mine," she recalls, as if mesmerized by this woman's presence (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 78). No sooner has the narrator returned the woman's gaze than she appears to be under her unknown companion's spell. The woman grasps the narrator's hand, and they move "with unpitying speed" to "some blind alley out of the deafening thoroughfare" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 68). Once they have ascended the "unlighted stairs," they enter a candlelit "dazzling room," in which the unnamed woman shudders "violently" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 68, 69). Several small details, including a torn letter possibly bearing a coat-of-arms, imply that the woman who inhabits the "extreme poverty" of these surroundings has been betrayed in love (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 69). At this juncture, the woman begs her companion "to stop, to stay," and, with that, she lies, with her hair "unfastened," "like a broken mechanism" in the narrator's arms, making "incoherent exclamations" about some "recently wrung promise" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 69, 70). As the candles gutter, it appears that the occupant of the room has expired: "The dark eyes unwillingly open reached mine in an insistent stare" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 71). Nursing what she assumes to be a corpse, the narrator is besieged by "phantoms of despair" that push her to the edge of sanity (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 72). Only when she resolves to escape does her sudden movement bring the woman back to life. But once the woman cries aloud, "For God's sake, stay here with me," the narrator throws her to the floor and follows her "sole instinct" of "flight' (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 74), blocking out any memory of "the two lifeless beings lying alone in that shrouded chamber of desolation" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 74). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Yet this disconcerting event, no matter how much the narrator struggles to erase it from her mind, preys on her conscience so much that she later returns to the church, as if to make religious amends for forsaking the desperate woman. As she hears the "the grey-habited nuns . . . singing a long Latin hymn of many verses," she decides that she must "renew . . . her quest," and so she tries to locate the woman once more (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 76). But, try as she might to find the half-dead re, the narrator records that "[h]unger and weariness at length sent" her "home," with "an assortment of embellished negatives ringing in" her "ears" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 76). Only long afterward, when she is taking an evening stroll through a "notorious thoroughfare" in the fashionable West End, does she witness the woman, now dressed "entirely in dull vermilion," accompanying a man who is examining a "silver case" that bears a crest similar to the device printed on the torn letter (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 76, 77). To the narrator, the spectacle of this garishly clad, perfumed individual, whose "confusion of odours" is a "vile enticement" that "outrage[s] Nature," points to the clearest of conclusions: the woman is supporting herself as a prostitute (one of the "insatiate daughters of an everlasting king") who upholds a sexually degrading patriarchy (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 76. 77). No wonder when the "man and woman" meet the narrator's gaze "with a void incorporate stare" they appear as if they share "one avenging visage" that takes pleasure in relishing a "despoiled body" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 77, 78). As she watches the couple turn their backs on her, the narrator hears "a laugh, mounting to a cry," and she is left wondering if this final clamoring sound comes from "some defeated angel," "the woman's mouth" or herself (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 78). Whatever its origins, this grating noise articulates the idea that everyone—the narrator, the man and woman, and the spirit of God—is mocking each other.</p>
<p>In sum, "Passed" represents a series of random encounters and strange recurrences that carefully retraces noticeable patterns of exclusion and estrangement. To begin with, the story counterpoints the dimly-lit sanctity of the church with the "dazzling" features of the sexualized woman's room. Similarly, while the "grey-habited nuns" praise the "Sacred Heart," the kept mistress dons the red clothing linked with prostitution. At the same time, the narrative reveals how heterosexual desire continues to exist in a vengeful, "incorporate" form, while closeness between the two women amounts to a profoundly embodied, though death-like, experience. Even more starkly, there appears to be no institution of authority or form of sociability that might redeem this alienating situation. Neither the nuns' jubilant prayers nor the narrator's considerate care can ameliorate a world in which everyone and everything, including the clang of the carriage wheels that lead the man and the woman away into the distance, creates the same grinding noise that echoes senselessly in her ears. To be sure, the narrator recognizes that "Sabbath bells peal sweeter calls" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 78). But the fact that her own voice sounds as unpleasant as her opponents' accentuates that "Passed" hardly aims at advancing the type of consoling moral familiar to earlier Victorian fiction. Instead, the judgment that Mew's narrator makes on this succession of jolting episodes reveals that it remains impossible for her to find any aesthetic, spiritual, or sexual relief from the disaffecting conditions that characterize modern urban existence. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Mew is not known to have published anything for five years after she made her literary debut with "Passed" in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Yellow Book</span>. It appears that she submitted her Cornish tale, "The China Bowl"—a rather conventional tragedy about a man caught between his mother's and his spouse's jealous affections—to Harland, who declined it. Similarly, her story, "An Open Door" had no success at <span style="font-style:italic;">Blackwood's</span>, whose contents during this period included such distinguished works as Joseph Conrad's <span style="font-style:italic;">Heart of Darkness</span> . A work of fairly traditional realism, "An Open Door," however, warrants attention because it focuses Mew's marked interest in exploring the ways in which individuals can become alienated from each other when they strive to maintain control over the memory of the dead. Mew's narrator tells the story of the devastating ways in which the massacre of a young woman during her missionary work abroad ultimately divides both the lover she abandoned in the name of religion and the older sister who eventually believes that it is her prerogative to preserve her sibling's "sweetest memory" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 145). The older sister informs him that the deceased probably has a "way of coming back and talking over things" through "remembrance" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 145). It is as if she has come to believe that the dead sibling's spirit lives on in her consciousness. Once the former lover hears these words, he is indignant: "What if," he thinks, "the dead <span style="font-style:italic;">had</span> memories?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 145). If the dead, he concludes, can communicate with the living through memory, then surely he has the sole privilege to relate to the soul of the woman he adored. At the end of the day, the characters are left at odds with each other as they struggle to retain some control over a departed loved one that they sense might, in some supernatural form, coexist with them still.</p>
<p>"An Open Door" eventually found a home in <span style="font-style:italic;">Temple Bar</span>; this journal, established in the 1860s, helped spawn a group of magazines—such as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Argosy</span> (1866–1901), <span style="font-style:italic;">Belgravia</span> (1866–99), and <span style="font-style:italic;">Tinsley's</span> (1867–92)—that set out, as its first editor put it, "to inculcate thoroughly English sentiments—respect for authority, attachment to the Church, and loyalty the Queen."<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> For the most part, <span style="font-style:italic;">Temple Bar</span> served a diet of essays and stories to the on-the-rise fraction of the middle classes: those "resolute householders who," as Vincent C. de Baun observes, "had lately begun to acquire wealth and education and servants, who read Tennyson and Dickens and thought much about the state of their souls."<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> But by 1898, when the prestigious publisher Macmillan took over the periodical, sales had declined in line with changing literary tastes. Eight years later <span style="font-style:italic;">Temple Bar</span> ceased publication. In its final phase, when the journal shifted away from leaving many of its contents unsigned, it tried unsuccessfully to appeal to a post-Victorian readership. The magazine featured not only one of d'Arcy's more experimental stories but also included the work of up-and-coming writers, such as E. M. Forster and E. F. Benson.<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> Between 1899 and 1904, Mew joined this stable of authors by publishing there no less than six short pieces of fiction, five essays, and, noticeably, six poems.</p>
<p>Few of Mew's contributions to <span style="font-style:italic;">Temple Bar</span> suggest that she was the author of "Passed," and they hardly anticipate the kind of literary innovations that distinguished <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span>. Yet already it is possible to see that even in the formal conventionality of her earliest poems she had an interest in making an explicit break with her <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Victorian literary ancestors. Mew's "Song" ("Oh! Sorrow, Sorrow"), which appeared in 1902, is a self-conscious revision of poem "LIX" in Tennyson's <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memoriam</span> . In Tennyson's lyric elegy, the mournful male poetic voice apostrophizes "Sorrow" as a female personification that might comfort him in his grief. In the course of sixteen four-stress lines, he elaborates his wish to secure the greatest intimacy with her. "O Sorrow, wilt thou live with me," he asks, "No casual mistress, but a wife."<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> Bound by such fidelity, he also desires her to "rule" his "blood," ensuring that he remains "wise and good." As he imagines their life together, he confidently asserts "thou art mine," as if his betrothal to "Sorrow" had already taken place. As his cherished spouse, she will at times be "lovely like a bride," and in return she will appear before the world as the "creature of" his "love," with no one guessing what her true name is. In other words, Tennyson's elegist contemplates enjoying not just an affair but also soothing companionship with a womanly form that only he knows embodies his misery.</p>
<p>In the three eight-line stanzas of "Song," Mew copies the well-paced octosyllables (though not the envelope rhyme) of <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memoriam</span> only to repudiate the marital fantasy that Tennyson's speaker wants to fulfill. Mew's female voice addresses "Sorrow" as a threatening re whose poisonous "boughs of yew" only became apparent toward the end of her childhood (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 55). Although Mew's "Sorrow" never emerges as definitively male, the masculine power with which this re destroys both innocent and joyful relationships is implicit:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Was I so dear you could not spare<br>   The maid to love, the child to play,<br>But coming always unaware,<br>   Must bid and beckon me away? (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 55)</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Mew's poetic voice reveals that not only has "Sorrow" led her away from the pleasures of childhood and intimacy but now lies in her bed "toss[ing]" a "weary head," making it impossible for her to "slumber" with such a restless spouse (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 55). Not surprisingly, she finally exclaims: "For oh! I cannot sleep with you" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 56). By turning poem "LIX" from <span style="font-style:italic;">In Memoriam</span> on its head, Mew's "Song" articulates a critical voice that reveals she has been betrayed by the very form of companionship that Tennyson's man yearns to enjoy. "Song" therefore shows that the fulfillment of Tennyson's desires has amounted to Mew's despair. One might conclude that her short poem signals not only skepticism toward intimate company but also dissatisfaction with the poetic convictions cherished by an earlier generation.</p>
<p>Seven years passed before Mew's next published poem—a fine lyric with a Tennysonian title, "Requiescat"—was included in H. W. Massingham's Liberal weekly, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nation</span>. By this point, Mew was a forty-year-old writer with few contacts in literary London. She only gained a measure of renown some three years later when she placed "The Farmer's Bride" in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nation</span>. This impassioned dramatic monologue, in which a lovelorn husband recalls how he captured his runaway spouse, attracted the attention of several noteworthy res. The first was Catherine Dawson Scott, also known as <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  "Mrs. Sappho": the zealous patron of contemporary writers, and eventual founder of International P.E.N., who opened her home in suburban Southall to a circle of literary enthusiasts. No sooner had Dawson Scott persuaded Mew to read "The Farmer's Bride" and other unpublished poems to this suburban company than the poet came into contact with the highly regarded novelist May Sinclair. About a year after Sinclair became friends with Mew in early 1913, Ezra Pound—at the novelist's urging—accepted Mew's substantial monologue, "The Fête," in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Egoist</span>.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>Concurrently, another reader of "The Farmer's Bride" who helped bring Mew into the public eye was Alida Monro. In her 1953 memoir Alida Monro recalls that she was so impressed by "The Farmer's Bride" that she "committed" it "to memory."<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> After she came into contact with her future spouse, Harold Monro, at a meeting of The Poets' Club at the Café Monico, London, in March 1913, Alida Monro quickly shared with him her enthusiasm for Mew's work. Subsequently, as she became increasingly involved in the day-to-day operations of Harold Monro's recently opened Poetry Bookshop, located off Theobalds Road in Central London, she contacted Mew to see if the author had sufficient poems for the kind of chapbook that Harold Monro included in his own imprint, which began its list the year before the bookstore opened its doors. Moreover, after Alida Monro received a reply from Mew, she asked if the poet would like to attend a reading of her work, which would take place at six o'clock on a Tuesday evening in November 1915. Mew agreed to be there, and very soon Alida Monro and the poet formed a close friendship, which led in turn to the publication of first edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span> in 1916.</p>
<p>The book, at first, was not a commercial success, even though it received some positive reviews, including one from leading Imagist, H. D. in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Egoist</span>. There H. D. remarks that "Mew has chosen one of the most difficult forms in the language—the dramatic lyric," adding that this author "has grown a new bloom from Browning's sowing, has followed a master without imitating him."<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> Despite such supportive notices, at the end of 1916 Harold Monro—whom Dominic Hibberd claims "did more for the development of twentieth-century poetry" than anyone else in England<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a>—had 850 remaindered copies out of the 1,000 printed of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span>. To improve its prospects, Harold Monro tried to persuade Edward Marsh to feature Mew as the first woman writer in the series of <span style="font-style:italic;">Georgian Poetry</span> anthologies, which Monro had been issuing under the Poetry Bookshop imprint since 1912. But Monro learned that Marsh's advisor, Walter de la Mare, believed that "The Farmer's Bride" should be excluded because the rhythm was too irregular and the rhymes "rather doubtful"; moreover, he thought the speaker too changeable: "dialectical in the first stanza and literary in the last."<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a> As de la Mare no doubt sensed, Mew's poem eventually balks at the four-beat common meter that appears to lend regularity to its opening lines. Instead of adhering to the pattern of conventional ballads, this idiosyncratic monologue—voiced in the dialect of a West Country farmer whose bride at one time "runned away"—randomly expands its line lengths to as many as sixteen syllables while evolving a mixed rhyme scheme (<span style="font-style:italic;">abbacdcdd</span>) in which the slight discordance of "human" and "woman" also sounds a peculiar note (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 1). Fitzgerald remarks that Mew's exclusion from the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  fourth volume of <span style="font-style:italic;">Georgian Poetry</span> "was perhaps fortunate" because "in the new post war climate" this anthology, which enjoyed enormous sales, "was beginning to seem old-fashioned," and thus "it was less of a privilege to appear in it."<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a></p>
<p>At the same time, however, Mew lost what ground she had gained through her contact with Sinclair. While much has been made of Sinclair's disenchantment when Mew declared her love for her in May 1914 (Dawson Scott discovered from Sinclair that Mew was "evidently a pervert," and Sinclair herself reported that in response to Mew's moment of passion she "had to leap the bed five times"),<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> the tension that arose between them seems to have focused on their diverging attitudes toward poetic tradition, which came to a head the following year. Even though, in early 1915, Sinclair enthused in an affectionate letter about "the depths and depths of passion" that she found in Mew's poems, her advocacy of Imagism probably ended the close bond she had developed with Mew.<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> Suzanne Raitt suggests that the diminishment of the novelist's "involvement with Mew coincided with her increasing commitment to the definition and promotion of a poetics that, unlike Mew's, heralded the arrival of 'modern' poetry."<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a> In particular, Raitt observes that when Sinclair published one of her experimental poems in Aldington's "Special Imagist Number" of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Egoist</span> in April 1915, she was "identifying herself with an unpopular movement" that came under attack.<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a> Monro, even if he had issued Ezra Pound's anthology <span style="font-style:italic;">Des Imagistes</span> in 1914, found it difficult to sell this avant-garde kind of work, and in his dispiriting contribution to the debates about Imagism in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Egoist</span> he dismissed these early modernists for producing "petty poetry" whose "reticence denote[d] either poverty of imagination or needlessly excessive restraint."<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a></p>
<p>In response, Sinclair remarked that Harold Monro, "a man on a sharp fence trying to preserve a sane and dignified equilibrium," proved insensitive to the Imagists' radical innovations because he required emotional intensity where there need be none.<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a> "If you are sworn to admire nothing but Swinburne, or Rossetti, or Mrs. Browning or Robert Browning and their imitators for ever and ever," Sinclair adds, "you may reject" H. D.'s poetry "because there is no 'passion' in it."<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a> Raitt contends that Sinclair's espousal of Imagism (she championed its "direct naked contact with reality") undermined her earlier "allegiance to the Victorian cadences of Mew's verse."<a name="f63-text" href="#f63"><sup>63</sup></a> As a consequence, Mew accused Sinclair of making "stupid" comments when, in her own defense, Sinclair claimed she had been protecting H. D. against what she felt was "an unfair &amp; rather spiteful attack from a writer [i.e. Harold Monro] who isn't fit to lick her boots."<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> Immediately, it seems, their friendship collapsed. Thus at the very point when she had enjoyed some proximity to this modernist milieu, Mew grew estranged from a prominent writer who had turned against her because she appeared to be a remnant from a former epoch—an anachronistic re whom Sinclair's friends quaintly labeled a "lesbian poetess."<a name="f65-text" href="#f65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
<p>Yet, if, as Sinclair plainly understood, Mew was not a poet in the same mold as H. D., did that mean that Mew could not be in any respect "modern"? As one can tell from the events that divided Mew from Sinclair's embrace of Imagism and excluded her from Marsh's traditional group of Georgian poets, she could not maintain even <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  a marginal position in these circles. In any case, if Mew's appearance in the suffrage periodical, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Englishwoman</span>, is anything to go by, then it would seem that even by 1913 and 1914 when she made some seven contributions to this journal, she still remained to some degree divided about the formalities that she inherited from her Victorian forerunners. Of the four poems that she published there, the two that she chose to exclude from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span> indicate some ambivalence toward convention and innovation. The sonnet "P-érien Mer" ('Lost at Sea'), which is set in one of the French resort towns where Mew vacationed, features a ghost whose recollections of dying at sea echo some of Christina Rossetti's eeriest lyrics in <span style="font-style:italic;">Goblin Market and Other Poems</span> . Speaking as someone "newly dead," Mew's poetic voice, whose sex remains unspecified, recognizes that "the friends that stand" around the laid-out body and "speak . . . / Indulgently" have no idea how this individual perished. A storm, it seems, snatched this person's life: "suddenly the light / Of Youth went out, and I, no longer I, / Climbed home, the homeless ghost I was to be" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 61). Such lines reveals that the ghostly subject speaks, with full authority and knowledge, through the very pronoun "I" that death has necessarily negated in one sense, though clearly not silenced in another.</p>
<p>Then again, this traditionally structured sonnet that gives voice to the destitute specter is very aware of its home in literary history. If we turn, for example, to Rossetti's sonnet "After Death," then we can see immediately the ways in which "Péri en Mer" resuscitates an earlier poetic ghost, one who looks at a man gazing down upon her face in the coffin: "He leaned above me, thinking that I slept / And could not hear him." Even though the man "wept," his emotions were not deep, just as she had always suspected: "He did not touch the shroud" or "take my hand in his."<a name="f66-text" href="#f66"><sup>66</sup></a> In her deepening remorse, Rossetti's dead speaker states: "He did not love me living." Once she has acknowledged this fact, however, she turns not to despair but to the "sweet" thought that while "he is still warm" she remains, satisfyingly, "cold." Thus in both "Péri en Mer" and "After Death," the dead retain a critical perspective on those mortals who mistakenly assume that no spirit watches them. Together, the ghosts in these two sonnets create a poetic dialogue about the triumph of death over life, one that embeds Mew's work in that of a much-admired precursor.</p>
<p>Quite the opposite is the case in "The Call," which shares the irregular line lengths that eventually distinguished Mew's efforts to break with her poetic ancestors.<a name="f67-text" href="#f67"><sup>67</sup></a> In this short work, the speaker remains altogether less sure about maintaining any authority over the future. Here the poetic voice recalls a time spent recently drowsing "beside the fire" when "a call" made an unexpected "rattle on the window-pane" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 46). Like a ghost, it had both a "voice" and a "breath" that "Swept in and out and that was all" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 46–47). Exactly what this spirit was, "a bright or a dark angel,"remains unknown (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 47). But its presence has made an incontrovertible demand upon those who experienced it because they now know they "cannot sit here any more" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 47). In response to this unassailable higher power, the speaker says that the present company "must arise and ago" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 47). Yet where they are heading is unclear: "we do not know / Who called, or what marks we shall leave upon the snow" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 47). As <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  it moves from one irregular line to the next, "The Call" dramatizes the uncertainty of modern conditions in which one cannot languish in the rituals of domestic contentment. About to become homeless, this poetic voice is on the brink of venturing forth into a wasteland in which each and every mark seems likely to dissolve into oblivion. Here it appears that the interpellative "call" to produce a more modern kind of poetry (one that nonetheless clings to the vestiges of rhythm and rhyme) promises to erase, or at least diminish, the authority of the voice that inhabits such lines. In many respects, "The Call" points to the ways in which Mew's dislocated subjects express, with such death-driven energy, their own dissolution in many of the monologues that made <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span> a <span style="font-style:italic;">cause célèbre</span>.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Belated Fame: <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span>
</h1>
<p>By the end of 1915, Mew was working hard to ensure that Harold Monro issued <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span> not as a chapbook but as a full-fledged collection: a format that he knew would not be profitable because the only poetry that was attracting attention during the war (as Sinclair acknowledged) was "written from the trenches."<a name="f68-text" href="#f68"><sup>68</sup></a> In her correspondence, Mew stated that she wanted all seventeen poems to be set alongside each other in the volume because they "hang together . . . &amp; mark a period": a time in which she had been immensely, and unusually, productive.<a name="f69-text" href="#f69"><sup>69</sup></a> Yet one of the most widely noted of these works, the long monologue about a prostitute, "Madeleine in Church," did not make its way into print without difficulty, since Mew found it hard to complete. By early 1915, Sinclair was urging Mew: "Finish—finish your Courtesan. She's magnificent. The last verses are all there—coiled up in the lobe of your brain asleep and waiting to be waked."<a name="f70-text" href="#f70"><sup>70</sup></a> Mew ran into further problems when the monologue went to the typesetters because the Methodist printers whom Monro approached refused to handle its offensive subject-matter. When Monro finally secured a company that would set Mew's manuscript in type, she insisted that the length of her "abnormal lines" (many of which exceed twenty syllables) should sit, wherever possible, unbroken on each page.<a name="f71-text" href="#f71"><sup>71</sup></a> Although Monro could not keep all of the exorbitant lines of "Madeleine" intact, he agreed to issue <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span> in a format in which the pages were so wide that they looked, most distinctively, almost square.</p>
<p>One can see why "Madeleine in Church" caused some moralistic readers offense because its representation of a woman's sexually promiscuous past marks a shift away from the various Victorian poems—such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti's "Jenny,", Augusta Webster's "A Castaway," and Amy Levy's "Magdalen"—that addressed this widely debated but sensitive topic. Whereas this earlier generation of writers explored the ways in which society upheld a moralistic double standard toward the stereotypical prostitute, Mew's poem concentrates not on the sex worker's oppressive interaction with men but on her spiritual confrontation with Jesus Christ: the very re that exorcised the demons from the original Mary Magdalene. Madeleine may bear a name that sounds similar to "Magdalene" but as she stares at "in the darkness" at a crucifix, lit by "one small candle" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 22), she gradually recognizes that there are few similarities <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  between herself and the biblical woman who had a sexual history comparable to her own, as we can detect in this direct address to the Lord:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>          How old was Mary out whom you cast<br>    So many devils? Was she young or perhaps for years<br>She had sat staring, with dry eyes, at this and that man going past<br>     Till suddenly she saw You on the steps of Simon's house<br>      And stood and looked at You through tears.<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 26–27)</div></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Such inquiries hardly prove comforting, especially as the savior was "alive" to Madeleine years ago when she attended her convent school (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 28). She concludes that if Mary Magdalene had not had the good fortune to fulfill "the dream of Him"—that is, meet with the redeemer who saved the fallen woman's soul—it makes one wonder whether this biblical icon "could . . . have cared so much" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 27). Not everyone, Madeleine contends, has been as lucky as this saint to have been restored to grace. When she considers her own plight, Madeleine presumes that she will never count among the millions whom the Lord has saved. Even though "His arms are full of broken things," one question is for certain: "He has never shared with me my haunted house beneath the trees / Of Eden and Calvary" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 26, 28). Madeleine's acute sense that Jesus Christ cannot shelter her soul culminates in her lasting despair that he will offer her no revelation (a thought, she recalls, that in childhood did not trouble her): "I used to think it would not hurt me too, so terribly / If He had ever seemed to notice me / Or, if, for once, He would only speak" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 28). As these closing lines suggest, Madeleine is left confronting blank silence. Already, she has contemplated that she will soon pass into a "handful of forgotten dust" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 26). Now, having lost her religious convictions, she must contend with the fact that "He" is "dead" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 28).</p>
<p>If "Madeleine in Church" flatly refutes the idea that its speaker should be able to rise from shame to grace like the nineteenth-century Magdalene, then "Ken," a fine narrative poem that editors rejected on the grounds of taste,<a name="f72-text" href="#f72"><sup>72</sup></a> shows how another kind of stigmatized re, a man suffering from mental illness, not only experiences the denial of God's love but also expresses his anger at his irredeemable condition. The compassionate narrator of this poem observes that during his attendance at church (where he went not to pray but "to see the lights!"), Ken would remain after the service with "His eyes upon a crucifix" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 16). His intransigence discomfited his neighbors: "You could not move him from his chair—/You did not look at him as he sat there, / Biting his rosary to bits" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 16). Worse still, when Ken sought to make himself heard, his words and gestures expressed intense anger toward the godhead: "While pointing to the Christ he tried to say / 'Take it away'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 16). Yet if Ken inarticulately defied Jesus Christ, he nonetheless remained vibrantly responsive to the natural world. "Nothing" to him, the narrator says, "was dead": "He said 'a bird' if he picked up a broken wing" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 16).</p>
<p>Poignantly, this man who had such assurance in the continuance of life has been taken to "that red brick barn upon the hill": the asylum whose "twenty windows in a <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  row" ensure that his existence becomes a living death (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 16, 17). In some respects, this sterile institution resembles the church where Ken chose to remain immobile. But in the asylum, we learn, "They cannot move you from your chair" because, presumably, the patients have been heavily sedated (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 17). That the narrator touchingly employs the second-person singular provides a sympathetic point of connection with a mentally ill man whose humanity has been denied through this unjustifiable incarceration. Everyone, the narrator suggests, should understand that Ken's chair is also "your chair": a place where any human being, whether judged sane or insane, might sit. But at the very moment the poetic voice dwells on the need to express compassion for Ken's plight, it becomes impossible to utter the distress that his sequestration arouses, as we can see from the suspended note on which the poem concludes:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>     So, when they took<br>Ken to that place, I did not look<br>     After he called and turned on me<br>     His eyes. These I shall see—<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 17)</div></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">As Peter Howarth thoughtfully observes, here "[t]he poem breaks off, as if the speaker is choked, silenced and staring like Ken, who has also been taken away . . . by a world which claims to worship the re pinned on the crucifix."<a name="f73-text" href="#f73"><sup>73</sup></a> This unexpected ending is particularly unsettling because it voices anguish that in some ways evokes the helpless mumbling that has removed Ken from the social world.</p>
<p>Both "Madeleine in Church" and "Ken" plunge the protagonists into a void that evacuates the rhetorical resonances that Mew accumulates through her carefully manipulated distensions of rhythm and rhyme. The same can be said of many other poems in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span>, including "In Nunhead Cemetery," in which a bereaved young man stands next to the suburban grave of his deceased fiancée, dwelling on how her untimely death has destroyed his will to live. "Put me to sleep," he cries (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 10). His determination to "stay here," drenched in the rain with a "broken" flower in his hand, focuses attention on the insensitivity that Mew frequently associates with social and religious institutions (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 10, 8). After everyone else has left the burial site, the young man remains contemplating the impersonal conditions in which the gravedigger "fills in holes like this year after year," in one of the seven sprawling cemeteries that opened across London in the 1830s and 1840s to cope with the widespread problem of disposing of the dead (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 8). As we learn early in the poem, these vast burial grounds are usually viewed from a distance: "I have seen this place / From the windows of the train that's going past," he says (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 8). The only individuals who seem to make regular use of this public space are the mischievous "children hanging about" who poke fun at the "whole dreadful heap" of mud that needs to go back into the earth (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 8). That this isolated mourner is driven to remark that "There is something terrible about a child" undermines any hope in a rejuvenated future (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 8). Instead, the bleak drama that unfolds in "In Nunhead Cemetery" shows that the only thing that Mew's distraught modern subject desires is his interment. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Like many of her speakers, Mew could not bear any further delay in ensuring that their beseeching voices did not pass unheard. As she insisted to Harold Monro, she wanted to see <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span> published as soon as possible because she sensed that her work would become one of the many casualties of the war: "the times are so abnormal that no one with any imagination can practically consider the future."<a name="f74-text" href="#f74"><sup>74</sup></a> Yet if Mew urged Monro to publish her book in the face of what she called "the present chaotic conditions,"<a name="f75-text" href="#f75"><sup>75</sup></a> it is noticeable while many of the seventeen poems in her volume address death and dying, not a single one touches upon the hostilities. (She had in fact written two poems on the impact of the war. "May, 1915" and "June, 1915" did not appear until after her death [<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 42, 43].)</p>
<p>Mew's apparent indifference to publishing war poetry, even though she discussed some poems of this type that friends such as Sinclair had written, might encourage readers to assume that for the most part she remained, as one scholar puts it, "imaginatively tied to the symbols of the past age,"<a name="f76-text" href="#f76"><sup>76</sup></a> in so far as so much of Mew's poetry looks back on lives whose suffering originates in a former period. It is therefore significant that the only poem that Mew published during her life on World War One, a lyric elegy titled "The Cenotaph," focuses not on the 1914 to 1918 combat but on Edwin Lutyens's famous monument in Whitehall that memorializes the thousands of British lives whose remains were interred on foreign soil. By September 1919, when the poem appeared in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Westminster Gazette</span>, Lutyens's hurriedly erected painted wood-and-plaster mock-up of the Cenotaph had already attracted immense attention during the Peace Day celebrations for which it had been specially designed the previous July. In the following year, Lutyens's full-size model, owing to its popularity, was made permanent in Portland stone.</p>
<p>In his study of the poetic tributes to this monument, Alex Moffett suggests that its distinctly modern structure, with its flat, unadorned vertical planes, suited the nation's needs well. According to Moffett, since the Cenotaph was not designed as a tomb (it does not contain the remains of any bodies), its "effectiveness . . . as a conduit for grief" was "perhaps augmented by its status as an icon of displacement."<a name="f77-text" href="#f77"><sup>77</sup></a> On this view, this physically empty monument, one whose significance arose from the fact that its purpose was not to entomb the war dead, served "as a fractured symbol of a fracturing war"; as a consequence, the Cenotaph provided an outward representation of the lingering psychic wounds that in 1919 defined a profoundly "modernist moment."<a name="f78-text" href="#f78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>
<p>At the start of "The Cenotaph," Mew's poetic voice confidently dramatizes the overwhelming displacement between the bodies interred abroad and the need to memorialize the dead at home:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>  Not yet will those measureless fields be green again<br>Where only yesterday the wild sweet blood of wonderful youth was shed;<br>There is a grave whose earth must hold too long, too deep a stain,<br>Though for ever over it we may speak as proudly as we may tread.<br>But here, where the watchers by lonely hearths from the thrust of an inward sword have<br>   more slowly bled,<br>We shall build the Cenotaph. (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 35–36) <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">This finely executed opening moves through a series of lengthy (one is tempted to say "measureless") lines to impress the persistent, grievous losses of the war. The fact that the hostilities caused such a severe disruption becomes clear when we learn that even in the months after the Armistice the spring has not been able to regenerate the grass across such fields as those in Flanders where thousands of soldiers are buried. Assuredly, Mew's speaker knows that mourners will always be able to travel abroad to honor the dead. At the same time, however, her voice acknowledges the need for a monument that can give public form to private suffering at home: a location where the placing of wreaths of "Violets, roses, and laurel" can at least go some way toward compensating for warfare's brutal violation (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 56).</p>
<p>Yet, typically for Mew, the Cenotaph, no matter how much it serves a dignified purpose for mourning so that "God is not mocked and neither are the dead," will not retain the seemliness that the celebrations of July 1919 have afforded it (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 56). If anything, her poetic voice suggests, the monument will have a very different future: "this will stand in our Market-place" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 56). "Who'll sell, who'll buy," the poetic voice asks, contemplating a society where everyone is rapaciously "driv[ing] bargains," with no interest in paying their respects to those soldiers who have been buried on the battlefield (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 56). In such an exploitative world, these ruthless buyers and sellers will remain unaware that the dead shall stare questioningly into their faces, as the three memorable closing lines—all of which end with an identical rhyme—make plain:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>While looking into every busy whore's and huckster's face<br>As they drive their bargains, is the Face<br>Of God and some young, piteous, murdered face. (<span style="font-style:italic;">CPP</span>, 56)</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">By showing how the faces of the dead (including Jesus Christ's) remain etched on those of the living, Mew's haunting conclusion establishes a formal connection, by way of a deliberately strained rhyme, between the past and the present. Simultaneously, however, the fact that such a connection is likely to become undecipherable in the market-driven conditions of modernity points to the limited influence that works of art, whether in Lutyens's monument or Mew's poem, can have on the future. In other words, "The Cenotaph" implicitly suggests that her poetic observations about the complicated aftereffects of war will eventually go unrecognized.</p>
<p>And, for many years, they did. Soon after her posthumous volume <span style="font-style:italic;">The Rambling Sailor</span> appeared, Mew's work passed rapidly into obscurity, not least because that collection—with Alida Monro's dispiriting preface and the inclusion of a number of conventional poems dating from the early 1900s—suggested that she had always been out of step with her time. But once we acknowledge that the gloomy accounts of Mew's life are somewhat misleading (the poet, for example, died a wealthy woman),<a name="f79-text" href="#f79"><sup>79</sup></a> it becomes possible to see how the writer's greatest work—which took many years before it could innovate on a literary heritage that she sometimes held in skeptical regard—expresses misgivings about belonging to a specific moment, period, or movement. Attempts to categorize Mew as a Victorian, fin-de-siècle, or modernist writer cannot account for <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the defiant manner in which her best writings, with their unrestrained rhythms and overextended rhymes, reconre as far as they can the formalities of the literary past in the name of renewing her longstanding protest against modernity. Whether depicting the pornographic "chromo" in a London shop-window or the abuse that a noble monument will suffer in the market-place, Mew's writings show little interest in remaining in either the West End of the mid-1890s or the Whitehall of 1919. Maybe the most troubling result that we find in her unique poetry lies in many of her speakers' emphatic desire never to remember anything ever again. Because she insisted on giving voice to subjects that contemplate their effacement from history, it is not surprising that scholars have been divided on exactly where to place Mew in modern cultural memory. As Mew's faltering career makes plain, it took years before she could devise a distinctive poetics in which the disturbances of the past could be expressed in the urgency of the present in the name of ensuring that they should not continue to exist. Yet the negative ways in which those deferrals were presented at the time of her demise also had the unfortunate consequence of eclipsing for some time what is of lasting significance in her writing. Only now, after further critical delays, is it possible to understand that Mew was scarcely behind her age in anticipating an unwelcoming future, one in which an amassing body of writing about trauma would increasingly address the pressing need to contend with tormenting aftereffects.</p>

Jeredith Merrin contends that "Fame" features "a female speaker—in this case not a persona distinct from Mew herself—situated in a tawdry . . . contemporary version of the Chaucerian House of Fame" ("The Ballad of Charlotte Mew," <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Philology</span> 95, no. 2 [1997]: 213). I suggest that the speaker is probably male because the feminine re of Fame is traditionally the object of the male Romantic poet's interest.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f50" href="#f50-text">50. </a>In 1913, Sinclair urged Mew "to send something to the <span style="font-style:italic;">English Review</span>," which Austin Harrison had since the start of his editorship in 1909 opened to women writers ("To Charlotte Mew," 4 July 1913, in Davidow, "Charlotte Mew," 300). Later in the year, Sinclair sent five of Mew's poems to him for consideration, all of which were rejected. At the same time, Sinclair encouraged Pound to forward <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  three poems to Harriet Monroe's <span style="font-style:italic;">Poetry</span>, none of which were accepted. These documents show that Sinclair had decided to act as Mew's mentor (if not unofficial agent), and their correspondence reveals that Mew shared with Sinclair the stories that had appeared in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Yellow Book</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Temple Bar</span>. "I wish you'd do more short stories," Sinclair remarked in 1915 ("To Charlotte Mew," 22 April 1915, in Davidow, "Charlotte Mew," 311). Sinclair also gave Mew extensive advice on negotiating the terms under which Harold Monro at the Poetry Bookshop should publish <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer's Bride</span>.

<div id="body">
<p>The subtitle of this essay is "The Prosody of Joyce's Prose." What does it mean to talk about prosody in prose? Prosody, after all, is by definition a quality attached to poetry: the Oxford American Dictionary defines it simply as "the study of verse forms and poetic meters." Verse forms, poetic meters, and other aspects of versification are ways in which we understand the peculiar language of poetry, of verse.</p>
<p>Of course Joyce did write poems, and one can certainly discuss the prosody—the metrics, sound effects, and other prosodic qualities—of Joyce's verse. But any appreciative reader of Joyce's great fictional texts—<span style="font-style:italic;">Dubliners, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Ulysses</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake—</span>grows quickly aware of how striking and remarkable the sound effects and rhythms of Joyce's prose can be. Samuel Beckett's well-known comment about <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span> applies indeed to all of Joyce's prose: "[It] is not written at all. It is not to be read—or rather it is not only to be read. It is to be looked at and listened to. [Joyce's] writing is not <span style="font-style:italic;">about</span> something; <span style="font-style:italic;">it is that something itself</span>" (<a name="b2-text" href="#b2">Beckett 1972, 14</a>). Of course, much useful critical work has already been done on the presence and influence of music (opera, songs, and so on) in Joyce's works. Derek Attridge has written probingly on Joyce's use of onomatopoeia and aural imitation in <span style="font-style:italic;">Peculiar Language</span> (<a name="b1-text" href="#b1">Attridge 1988</a>). Such investigations tend to focus particularly on the "Sirens" episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, a chapter full of both musical imitation and striking sound effects—and a number of scholars have investigated the nuances and uses of sound and music in "Sirens."</p>
<p>But I want to focus specifically on the prosody of and metrics in Joyce's prose, to apply prosodic and metrical analysis not to a <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  poetic text but to Joyce's prose fiction. This is, to my mind, a fascinating and promising topic on which, to my knowledge, little (if any) published work has been done—and so there are many open avenues of inquiry. This essay is just one beginning, a small foray into one aspect or approach to the study of the prosody of Joyce's prose.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>In the opening pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, Stephen Dedalus thinks to himself, as he gazes at the sea beneath the Martello Tower:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of the dim sea. The twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking the harpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<a name="b9-text" href="#b9">Joyce 1986, <span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 1.242–247</a>)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Later in the morning, in the "Proteus" episode, Stephen, looking at the beach, will observe "Signatures of all things I am here to read" (<a name="b9-text" href="#b9"><span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 3.2</a>), suggesting that the world itself is a text—a beach full of signs to be read and decoded. Here, in the "Telemachus" episode, the surf Stephen is gazing at is a particular sort of text, a poem: not only is he quoting from a poem, Yeats' "Who Goes with Fergus?" (which contains the line "And the white breast of the dim sea"), but the image is one of whitecaps coming in metrically, with "lightshod hurrying <span style="font-style:italic;">feet</span>" (i.e., metrical feet), rhythmically twined by metrical stresses, two by two—indeed, the whitecaps are themselves words of a poetic (and alliterated) line, "wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide." Stephen, as we know from <span style="font-style:italic;">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</span>, is a prosodist (recall his villanelle); in "Proteus" he reminds us of that fact when he identifies the lines "<span style="font-style:italic;">Won't you come to Sandymount, / Madeline the mare?</span>" as an "Acatelectic tetrameter of iambs marching. No, agallop: <span style="font-style:italic;">deline the mare</span>" (<a name="b9-text" href="#b9"><span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 3.21–24</a>).</p>
<p>But this moment in "Telemachus" is, for Stephen, also a moment of pain: he has Yeats' poem in mind because Buck Mulligan has just reminded him of it (<a name="b9-text" href="#b9">"<span style="font-style:italic;">And no more turn aside and brood / Upon love's bitter mystery / For Fergus rules the brazen cars</span>" [<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 1.239–241]</a>), the very poem and song Stephen sang for his dying mother, leading him now to feel pain and guilt over his mother's death and over "love's bitter mystery." Typically, at a moment of pain or trauma, Stephen seeks solace in words, in poetry, turning the whitecapped waves into shimmering words and lines with metrical stresses. He engaged in this dynamic repeatedly in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Portrait</span>, when, feeling lonely and alienated, he turned to poetry and "repeated to himself the lines of Shelley's fragment . . . and he forgot his own human and ineffectual grieving" (<a name="b8-text" href="#b8">Joyce 1968, <span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> 96</a>). Similarly, later, under pressure to join the priesthood, Stephen paces back and forth, back and forth, between Byron's Publichouse and Clontarf Chapel, "planting his steps scrupulously in the spaces of the patchwork of the footpath, then timing their fall to the fall of verses" (<a name="b8-text" href="#b8"><span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> 164</a>). Indeed, contemplating the phrase "A day of dappled seaborne clouds," he is led to ask himself: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Did he then love the rhythmic rise and fall of words better than their associations of legend and colour? Or was it that . . . he drew less pleasure from the reflection of the glowing sensible world . . . than from the contemplation of an inner world of individual emotions mirrored perfectly in a lucid supple periodic prose?</p>
<div class="attrib">(<a name="b8-text" href="#b8"><span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> 167</a>)</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Stephen's greater interest in "a lucid supple periodic prose" (one recalls Beckett's comment that Joyce's writing "is not <span style="font-style:italic;">about</span> something, <span style="font-style:italic;">it is that thing itself</span>") reflects his awareness of the poetic qualities of prose rhythm. We know that Joyce read George Saintsbury, the author of the monumental three-volume <span style="font-style:italic;">History of English Prosody</span> and of the one-volume <span style="font-style:italic;">History of English Prose Rhythm</span>, published in 1912; Joyce owned the latter text and studied it during the writing of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> (<a name="b4-text" href="#b4">Ellmann 1982, 475</a>). In this <span style="font-style:italic;">History of English Prose Rhythm</span>, a study and survey of the rhythms and meters used in prose writing from the Classical Period to modern times, Saintsbury noted that even in Classical times theorists like Quintillian had argued that prose must be, above all, "varied in composition" and rhythm. It was Saintsbury's claim in this study that the principle of good prose rhythm seems to be the perpetual variation of the metrical foot: "As the essence of verse-metre is its identity (at least in equivalence) and recurrence, so the essence of prose-rhythm lies in variety and divergence"; he cites what he calls the "Universal Law of Variety" for prose, "where Variety itself is mistress and queen—the moon that governs the waves of prose, as Order is the sun that directs the orbit of verse" (<a name="b14-text" href="#b14">Saintsbury 1912, 450, 465</a>).</p>
<p>And it is indeed true that, in Joyce's writing, we find—especially at moments of dramatic or emotional intensity—striking examples of such "fine writing" in which the prose rhythms are supple, periodic, often paratactic, but rhythmically varied. Think of passages such as the end of "The Dead," with its paratactic repetitions of syntax but with varied rhythms that turn this way and that, refusing metrical identity and repetition:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Yes, the newspapers were right: snow was general all over Ireland. It was falling on every part of the dark central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and, farther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves. It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns. His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Or recall the description of the bird-like girl of Stephen's epiphany in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Portrait</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Her bosom was as a bird's soft and slight, slight and soft as the breast of some darkplumaged dove. But her long fair hair was girlish: and girlish, and touched with the wonder of mortal beauty, her face.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<a name="b8-text" href="#b8"><span style="font-style:italic;">P</span> 171</a>)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">One could come up with many more, equally striking, examples of Joyce's "lucid supple, periodic prose" rhythms. In passages like these, Joyce is showing himself to be very much involved in that modernist rapprochement between poetry and prose <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  that was also being practiced by writers like Ford Madox Ford, Joseph Conrad, and Henry James, whose "fine writing" and periodic prose styles often read very much like passages of carefully crafted free verse—leading to Pound's observation that modern "poetry should be as well written as prose."</p>
<p>But Joyce goes further than that, and I want to suggest that there are also, in Joyce's prose fiction, moments of very intentional, self-conscious, and careful use of strict poetic prosody and meter—that is, the actual meters of verse, of metrical identity. And in this essay I want to pursue one such instance, the use in Joyce's writing of the Old English alliterative, strong-stress meter. Anglo-Saxon strong-stress (or accentual) alliterative meter can be loosely defined as follows: 1) There are usually four (sometimes more) strong stresses in each line; 2) There is no fixed number of unstressed or weakly-stressed syllables (unlike, say, iambic pentameter), and so line length can vary greatly; 3) The line is frequently broken by a pause, a medial <span style="font-style:italic;">caesura</span>, dividing the line into two <span style="font-style:italic;">metrons</span> of two stresses apiece; 4) But the two divided <span style="font-style:italic;">metrons</span> are then twined and tied back to each other through alliteration of the strong-stress syllables. A typical example of the verse form are these lines from the poetry of Langland's alliterative revival:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>And <span style="font-style:italic;">h</span>émselve álso // súffren much <span style="font-style:italic;">h</span>únger,<br>And <span style="font-style:italic;">w</span>ó in <span style="font-style:italic;">w</span>íntertime // and <span style="font-style:italic;">w</span>áking on níghts.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Joyce was certainly aware of alliterative Anglo-Saxon style; early in the "Oxen of the Sun" episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> he uses it to suggest the linguistic roots of the English language: "Before born babe bliss had. Within womb won he worship . . . In ward wary the watcher hearing . . ." (<a name="b9-text" href="#b9"><span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 14.60, 80</a>). Indeed, Stephen's own line is both a perfect description and a perfect illustration of the Anglo-Saxon metrical line:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>The <span style="font-style:italic;">t</span>wíning s<span style="font-style:italic;">t</span> résses, // <span style="font-style:italic;">t</span>wó by <span style="font-style:italic;">t</span>wó</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Joyce had already earlier experimented with the use of alliteration as a way to tie together lines of prose at moments of dramatic and poetic intensity, as in, for example, the last lines of "Araby"—</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself<br>as a creature <span style="font-style:italic;">d</span>riven and <span style="font-style:italic;">d</span>erided by vanity;<br>and my eyes burned with <span style="font-style:italic;">a</span>nguish and <span style="font-style:italic;">a</span>nger.</p></div>

<p>By the time Joyce was writing <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, a number of well-known poets had already been experimenting with a return to this old, native, flexible verse form, the Anglo Saxon alliterative metric, from Gerard Manley Hopkins—</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">

<p class="continued">Yeats and Eliot both explored this metric extensively in their poems and verse plays. Yeats showed how versatile the line could be in his play "Purgatory":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>(Boy:)             Hálf-dóor, // háll-dóor,<br>    Híther and thíther // dáy and níght,<br>    Híll or hóllow, // shóuldering this páck,<br>    Hearing you talk.<br>(Old Man:) Stúdy that hóuse . . .<br>    Great péople líved and díed in this hóuse;<br>    Mágistrates, cólonels, mémbers of Párliament,<br>    Cáptains and Góvernors, and lóng agó<br>    Mén that had fóught at Áughrim and the Bóyne.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Much of Eliot's verse play <span style="font-style:italic;">Murder in the Cathedral</span> was written in this verse form, including its best-known lines:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>The lást <span style="font-style:italic;">t</span>emptátion // is the gréatest <span style="font-style:italic;">t</span>réason:<br>To <span style="font-style:italic;">d</span>o the <span style="font-style:italic;">r</span>íght <span style="font-style:italic;">d</span>éed // for the <span style="font-style:italic;">wr</span>óng <span style="font-style:italic;">r</span>éason.</p></div></blockquote>

<p>—and later also in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Four Quartets</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Tíme présent // and tíme pást<br>Are bóth perhaps présent // in tíme fúture.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Pound, of course, used these verse rhythms and meters not only in his translations of Anglo-Saxon poems such as "The Seafarer"—</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p><span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>ítter <span style="font-style:italic;">b</span>réast-cares // have Í a<span style="font-style:italic;">b</span> íded,<br><span style="font-style:italic;">K</span>nówn on my <span style="font-style:italic;">k</span>éel // mány a <span style="font-style:italic;">c</span>are's hóld,<br>And díre <span style="font-style:italic;">s</span>éa-<span style="font-style:italic;">s</span>urge, // and thére I oft <span style="font-style:italic;">s</span>pént<br><span style="font-style:italic;">N</span>árrow <span style="font-style:italic;">n</span>íghtwatch // <span style="font-style:italic;">n</span>igh the shíp's héad . . .</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">—but also in his own poems, such as the very first Canto:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>We set up mást and <span style="font-style:italic;">s</span>áil // on that <span style="font-style:italic;">s</span>wárt <span style="font-style:italic;">s</span>híp,<br><span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>ore shéep a<span style="font-style:italic;">b</span> óard her, // and our <span style="font-style:italic;">b</span>ódies álso<br>Héavy with <span style="font-style:italic;">w</span>eeping, // and <span style="font-style:italic;">w</span>índs from stérnward<br><span style="font-style:italic;">B</span>óre us out ónward // with <span style="font-style:italic;">b</span>éllying cánvas,<br><span style="font-style:italic;">C</span>írce's this <span style="font-style:italic;">c</span>ráft, // the trím-coiffed góddess . . .</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Clearly, then, a consciousness of this old verse form was very much in the air at this time among the modern poets. But all of the above are examples of a poetic form being used in actual <span style="font-style:italic;">poems</span>. What is arguably new and innovative about Joyce's usage, in this respect, is that he applies these meters directly to his <span style="font-style:italic;">prose</span>. We see him do so not only in lines directly describing poetic content—as in "The twining stresses, two by two—" but also quite frequently in everyday lines sprinkled throughout <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>dárk <span style="font-style:italic;">m</span>én // in <span style="font-style:italic;">m</span>íen and <span style="font-style:italic;">m</span>óvement</p></div>

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">and so on. (Such lines are mostly in Stephen Dedalus's stream of consciousness; Bloom does not seem to use such metrics in his thought, as if Joyce were reminding us that Bloom is much less prosodically / poetically educated and conscious than Stephen.)</p>
<p>But I also wish to suggest that, aside from occasional instances and individual lines such as these, there are moments when both Stephen and Joyce use this metrical pattern consciously, within a particular context and for specific purposes. I would like to bring up two passages for illustration. The first is from the "Nestor" episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, when Stephen and Deasy are talking and listening to the schoolboys outside playing hockey:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Shouts rang shrill from the boys' playfield and a whirring whistle.</p>
<p>Again: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley, the joust <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of life. You mean that knockkneed mother's darling who seems to be slightly crawsick?</p>
<p>Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock. Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men's bloodied guts.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<a name="b9-text" href="#b9"><span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 2.313–318</a>)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Here, the repeated use of alliterated stress words in a description of the game of field hockey creates a loud, harsh, and discordant noise level that suggests how hockey resembles, and trains boys for, bloody battles and warfare (much like the playing fields of Eton):</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Shouts rang shrill</p>
<p>a whirring whistle</p>
<p>their battling bodies</p>
<p>a shout of spearspikes</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">and so on. The particular phrase "Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock" is another singular example of the Anglo-Saxon metric, of "the twining stresses, two by two." My point is that the entire passage attempts, and succeeds, precisely at evoking the sort of battle description which the harsh, guttural sounds and stresses of Anglo-Saxon poetry are most often associated with, that is, the bloody battle scenes in <span style="font-style:italic;">Beowulf, The Battle of Maldon, The Battle of Brunaburgh</span>, and so forth—passages so full of "Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain, a shout of spearspikes baited with men's bloodied guts."</p>
<p>My second example occurs in a similar passage from the familiar opening of <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The passage is, of course, full of references to weapons (badelaires, catapults, assegais, and so on) as well as to famous battles (Catalonian Fields, Verdun, etc.). It is also full of the noise of battle, as Ostrigoths t Visigoths and oyster gods t fishy gods, with the noise, chaos, bloodshed, and tragedy of battle very strikingly and unmistakably suggested by the use of discordant alliteration and strong guttural stresses. The passage's din of battle is in the service of a pacifist message: "Sanglorians, save! Arms apeal with larms, appalling." In such an "appalling" setting, "arms" (that is, weapons) are "a-peal" with (full of the sound of) "larms" (noise: <span style="font-style:italic;">Lärm</span>, German for noise); and, in such an appallingly noisy and bloody scene, arms are stretched out in appeal, full of tears (<span style="font-style:italic;">larmes</span>, in French) and sobs <span style="font-style:italic;">(sanglots</span> in French), without the glory of war ("Sanglorians" and <span style="font-style:italic;">sans gloire</span>, without glory). The dreadful result of such "Killykillykilly" <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  is "a toll, a toll"—and "For whom the bell tolls" (or peals). Once again, the echoes of Anglo-Saxon alliterative verse are used here to suggest the brutal savagery and cost of battle.</p>
<p>The above are, thus, two passages in which, I would argue, Joyce intentionally uses an old alliterative verse metric he is very conscious of—"the twining stresses, two by two"—for particular purposes and effects in the rhythms of his prose. However, I would like to note that this form is also clearly something Joyce experimented with in other contexts, not having to do with the noise and blood of battle, and one which proved quite versatile—as in the other scattered lines from <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> I quoted earlier. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span>, the celebrated "Anna Livia Plurabelle" section even contains some metrically scannable passages of Anglo-Saxon meter:</p>

<div class="attrib">(<a name="b7-text" href="#b7"><span style="font-style:italic;">FW</span> 215.33–35</a>)</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="sectionBreak"><p>My modest goal, and initial conclusion, in this essay—as a first foray into the prosody of Joyce's prose—is to suggest that this is one metrical and prosodic form, the Anglo Saxon alliterative meter, that Joyce found particularly useful and versatile for his purposes, even in his prose fiction. There are others, too—but that is a topic for another time. More importantly, I want to suggest that—in terms of the rapprochement of poetry and prose—Joyce goes a lot further than other prose fiction writers like Ford, Conrad, or James, whose prose was often very poetic in their rhythm; and also further that those modern poets whose free verse often tended to approach the qualities and rhythms of fine prose. For Joyce, it wasn't a question of one becoming more <span style="font-style:italic;">like</span> the other, or vice versa: in his works, the poetic could be, and was, incarnate, manifest and contained (and functional) <span style="font-style:italic;">as poetry</span>, within the body of his narrative prose. This isn't rapprochement; this is generic miscegenation and incorporation.</p></div>

</blockquote>
<p>The explosion of bombs is an inescapable feature of the contemporary world. Marked by suicide attacks around the globe, and in the aftermath of a century which turned the bombing of civilians into the norm for warfare, our era seems unthinkable without such destruction. In the nineteenth century, by contrast, dynamite explosion represented an entirely new form of violence, as Alfred Nobel's invention of 1866 helped to sweep the world into its modern shape. From the moment of its inception, dynamite violence became an immediate and ever-escalating sensation, with its stunning ability not only to kill and maim, but within seconds to level an entire landscape.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> The violence of dynamite reverberated in every sensory register as something novel (hence sensational in that way, too), from its chemical smell, to its shattering sound, to its extreme tactile effects, and it held pronounced political associations, quickly becoming associated with terrorism. It shattered, exploded, ripped, and tore; it created its own palpable and recognizable form of wreckage; and its employment for radical causes suggested a future with unknowable and potentially frightful contours. In sum, dynamite violence added a potent new element to the modern imaginary. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Its literary and cultural legacy in England in the last decades of the century, and into the modernist period, is the subject of this essay.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Dynamite's violence might be wide and indiscriminate, but its users were very particular: revolutionaries, and above all, anarchists, who were red incessantly and in near-caricature as bomb-wielding maniacs.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> "In late-nineteenth century America," the historian Margaret Marsh writes, "the mention of the word 'anarchist' brought to the minds of most people a particular image: an unkempt, bushy-bearded man, swarthy and dirty, lurking in a dark alley with a bomb hidden under his coat."<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> The bomb and the anarchist were partners; to understand the cultural significance of one is to permeate the world of the other. In addition to conjuring a typology of violent actors, the presence of dynamite made for complex, often flamboyant plots and styles, and its effects on the body created exceptional challenges that literary works both engaged and elided. Despite the excess attaching to this complex story—or perhaps as a consequence of it—to resurrect both the cultural and literary history of anarchism in this period is to draw a variety of conclusions about how the imagining of political violence and literary form did and did not cooperate.</p>
<p>For anarchists themselves, dynamite held highly idealized associations: it offered new vistas of power, not solely for its potential to wreak destruction, but also for its ability to terrify a wide public. The connotations of dynamite for radical politics are hard to overstate. It was the ultimate weapon of the one against the many, of any individual with only a smattering of training, or connection to other revolutionists, and a will to kill. The dynamite bomb seemed tiny in proportion to its capacity to do harm; it could fit easily into a small bag, or even a pocket. Above all, as the historian Paul Avrich argues, dynamite had virulent class connotations, and this is why its association with anarchism and with other kinds of radical threat was so profound:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Dynamite, in the eyes of the anarchists, had become a panacea for the ills of society. They saw it as a great equalizing force, enabling ordinary workmen to stand up against armies, militias, and police, to say nothing of the hired gunmen of the employers. Cheap in price, easy to carry, not hard to obtain, it was the poor man's natural weapon, a power provided by science against tyranny and oppression . . . Just as gunpowder had broken the back of feudalism and made way for the rule of the bourgeoisie, so dynamite would bring down capitalism and usher in the reign of the proletariat.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>If anarchists hailed dynamite for its equalizing properties, the broader culture was equally infatuated. The re of the anarchist bomber (the "dynamitard" in contemporary parlance), his violent acts (referred to as "outrages" or "<span style="font-style:italic;">attentats</span>"), his favored technology (especially dynamite bombs), and his uncertain aims (total destruction, according to most accounts) together presented the British public with a nexus of problems and images which, for three decades, were explored in journalism and in fiction.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Not surprisingly, popular novels that invoked the specter of anarchist violence flourished in this period, in a subgenre—the dynamite novel—which freely employed elements common to such nineteenth-century genres as the detective novel, the industrial novel, (proto)science fiction, fantasy novels of invasion and/or world war, and melodrama.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  These texts—with such titles as <span style="font-style:italic;">A Modern Dedalus</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">For Maimie's Sake: A Tale of Love and Dynamite</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">Dynamiter</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">Hartmann the Anarchist</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Angel of the Revolution</span> —helped to conre the anarchist as type, and also lingered on the physical quality of dynamite, with villains inevitably designated as chemists and the smoke of detonated bombs a feature of the ever-threatened landscape. Many of the more lavish dynamite novels, in which imagery of revolutionary violence reaches feverish proportions, feature hyperbolic uses of the substance, such as anarchists raining fire on London by dropping dynamite bombs out of fantastical airships.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> In these works, the unrestrained power to destroy offers the guiding principle in ring political and social change. Indeed, the most salient and consistent characteristic of dynamite, as it was imagined and represented in fiction and elsewhere, was the hyperbole and excess it generated—in a word, its melodrama.</p>
<p>To call the representation of dynamite violence "melodramatic" is not so much to invoke the specific genre of melodrama (a nineteenth-century stage phenomenon), as to suggest a general emotional and gestural framework, what Peter Brooks has dubbed "the melodramatic imagination" and Elaine Hadley "the melodramatic mode."<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> The standard features of melodrama, which saturated Victorian literature and continue to demarcate a swath of literary and popular culture, are familiar: "the indulgence of strong emotionalism; moral polarization and schematization; extreme states of being, situations, actions; overt villainy, persecution of the good, and final reward for virtue; inflated and extravagant expression; dark plottings, suspense, breathtaking peripety."<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Such hyperbolic and polarizing structures belong to a popular imaginary that rehearses in secular form many Christian themes, and works to create in readers or viewers heightened responses commensurate with the tantalizing content. Melodrama can be highly political in purpose—one need only think of <span style="font-style:italic;">Uncle Tom's Cabin</span> —with a politics that necessarily conforms to its own language conventions, sustaining and perpetuating its logic of good/virtue versus evil/vice. Like the Gothic, with which it overlaps, melodrama has often been tied in the public mind with the feminine, the un-theorized or unconscious, and above all the lowbrow. With rising interest in these categories, however, melodrama has emerged as a distinctly interesting category, and for good reasons: first, because a great variety of texts (canonical and forgotten, by men and women) relied for their sensibility on a melodramatic point-of-view; second, because persistent structures of thought and action like the melodramatic are frequently rendered in complex conrations, producing interesting generic mixtures and shifts; and, most importantly for our purposes, because there are certain topics that are invariably red in melodramatic terms. Dynamite violence is melodramatic in this last sense. The very idea of "explosion" suggests polarity and excess, and the connection between bombs and revolution made for a dizzying affective register, conjuring a sense of threat that held highly moral connotations (hence rewarding melodramatic treatment). By the end of the nineteenth century, in short, melodrama and anarchist violence had both become bywords for sensational events, overwrought emotion, and schematic plots, and thus their yoking has about it an inescapable logic. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The most canonical rendering of anarchist violence in English literature comes in Joseph Conrad's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span> , and a reading of that novel forms the crux of my discussion. But Conrad's work points outward towards a variety of intimately related issues, including the popularization of the anarchism theme in varying literary media, the intractable question of sensationalism in relation to the envisioned threat of anarchism, and the thicket of contradictions surrounding the re of the anarchist himself. Most central for this investigation are the questions of genre that extenuate from these topics. As I will suggest, the overlapping of the generic qualities of melodrama with representations of anarchists and dynamite reveals a paradox in the literary imagining of political violence: politics all but disappears, leaving behind an aporia, which is quickly filled by the ready-at-hand genre of melodrama. Or, to put it slightly differently, the mutual attraction between melodrama and dynamite violence tended to overwhelm and drown out the kind of political critique propounded by anarchists and other revolutionaries of the period, but it promoted a vivid capacity for rative meaning-making and a flourishing of literary outcomes.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In Conrad's novel, however, we can point to one re, the bomb-making Professor, who slips out of the melodramatic frame altogether to incorporate and instantiate a new phenomenon, one just developing in the public imagination of the early twentieth century: the terrorist as urban threat. Though "terrorism" and "anarchism" were not synonymous in this period, they were closely allied, and the new icon of the terrorist—a term used by some as a pejorative and by others as an honorific—developed largely out of the fascination with the anarchist bomber. For Conrad, as for many others, terrorism became a marker for a threat of violence that was virtually defined by its ability to disappear. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>—a novel that delves deeply into the nature of secrecy, deconstructing it at every turn—propounds a logic of increasing invisibility with regard to the specter of violence. The novel registers a triple move: from reckoning with the attacked flesh (violence enacted), into melodrama (violence as theatricality), and ultimately towards an image of modern violence as pure, endlessly-suspended potential. Violence, we might say, goes underground in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, much as anarchists taking refuge in London were forced to do by the beginning of the twentieth century; or, better, Conrad traces a wider phenomenon of the period that spans from the events of the novel  to its publication thirteen years later, whereby the <span style="font-style:italic;">spectacle</span> of theatrical violence mutates into the threatening yet obscure <span style="font-style:italic;">possibility</span> of attack. That this latter condition tracks both Foucault's definition of modern cultures (as discipline internalized) and the general condition of the terrorist threat up to the present time (recognizing the possibility of explosion at any moment) suggests that for all its satire and excess—and despite its generally conservative politics—the novel has something exceptionally astute to say about the intertwining of violence and modernity.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">I. Imagining Revolutionaries and their Acts</h1>
<p>The last two decades of the nineteenth century might well be called the era of anarchism. The period was marked by a string of sensational acts of violence against <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  individual leaders and representative targets—bombings, shootings, and assassinations that riveted the public and were heavily reported by the press in England, America, and across Europe. To give just a few of the most notable examples: In 1881, Czar Nicholas II was ambushed on the road and assassinated by a nihilist<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a>; two German anarchists, Franz Rusch and Friedrich Reinsdorf, attempted to kill the German emperor in 1883 by blowing up his carriage; in Chicago in 1886, a bomb was thrown at the police as they broke up a labor gathering—the infamous Haymarket case—for which five anarchists were wrongly executed (the actual bomb-thrower was never identified); the anarchist Alexander Berkman shot the steel magnate Henry Clay Frick at close range in 1892, injuring but not killing Frick; in 1894, the anarchist Émile Henry threw a bomb into the Café Terminus in Paris, wounding twenty people, killing one, and generating a frenzy of press attention; in the late 1890s, the leaders of France, Spain, and Austria were all killed by revolutionaries with anarchist affiliations; and in 1901, President McKinley of the United States was shot and killed by a Polish man with loose anarchist ties. In England, no lethal bombing of a public place or prominent leader was ever carried out, the only person to be killed by an anarchist attack in England being Martial Bourdin, the bomber whose accidental self-immolation at the Greenwich Observatory forms the basis of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>. Yet a slew of attacks and attempted attacks received intensive coverage in the press, including attempts to blow up London Bridge , Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament , and Greenwich Observatory ; multiple plots to assassinate Queen Victoria; the arrest and sentencing of a group of anarchists in the city of Walsall for bomb manufacture ; as well as international anarchist incidents and trials, such as those listed above.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Indeed, in the public eye, anarchism always spelled violence, "a bloody and smoking chaos, a heap of ruins of all existing things, a complete loosening and severance of all ties that have hitherto bound men together: marriage, the family, the Church, the State, unbridled men and women no longer held in order by any authority, and mutually devouring each other," in the words of one fictional commentator of the period.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Notwithstanding the hyperbole of such terms, the sense that the political movement of anarch<span style="font-style:italic;">ism</span> signaled the unleashing of anarch<span style="font-style:italic;">y</span> became a persistent misconception in the period, one that has never fully abated.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> In fact, anarchism embraced violence as a means to a peaceful end, in which the state and its oppressive mechanisms would have melted away, replaced by a harmonious world order. Nevertheless, the anarchist ideal of the destruction of the state, when yoked in the public mind with high-profile assassinations and bombings, invited a fervent, dystopic response. "'To destroy everything,'" is the avowed aim of the movement, according to an anarchist character in Émile Zola's <span style="font-style:italic;">Germinal</span> , "'Set fire to the four corners of the town, mow down the people, level everything, and when there is nothing more of this rotten world left standing, perhaps a better one will grow up in its place.'"<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Or, in the words of one revolutionary from the forgotten <span style="font-style:italic;">Hartmann the Anarchist</span>, "'Violent diseases often demand violent remedies . . . Regard us anarchists as excising the foul ulcers of Humanity and as forced to perform that duty with no anaesthetics [<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>] to aid us."<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>What was anarchism?<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> The word "anarchy" means "against authority," and it is the opposition to all forms by which one person can hold power over another that most succinctly characterizes the philosophy. Anarchism comprises different branches and emphases, but in every case it opposes the defining institutions of formal power and authority: government, the Church, and the legal system.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> It stands absolutely against the state—any state, worker or bourgeois, post-revolutionary or capitalist—which it believes inevitably institutes inequality and injustice.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> The theory of anarchism developed in the early 1860s, largely out of the writings of the French philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the activities of the Russian Mikail Bakunin, whose life in exile involved the creation of several notorious secret societies. It entered what we might call its heyday from the early 1880s until the end of the century, when anarchist movements flourished across England, America, and the Continent, and when public fascination was at its apogee. In the twentieth century, anarchism had sporadic life in many parts of the world, with perhaps its most significant manifestation in Spain, where anarchist groups were central actors in the Civil War, ting against Franco's fascist army (1936–39). In England, however, the anarchist movement began its decline around the turn of the century, as aggressive tactics of police suppression, including the shuttering of anarchist journals and the tightening of immigration and deportation laws, eventually eradicated any serious presence. Up to then, England's relatively lenient laws had provided refuge for anarchists exiled from more repressive parts of the world. Historically, anarchism emerged side by side with other radical political movements of the mid-nineteenth century, a response to the egregious injustices of the industrial revolution, in a movement which reached out, especially, to the most disenfranchised among the poor, whom Marx called the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lumpenproletariat</span>. Proudhon famously claimed that "property is theft," yet anarchism was not, for all its attack on private property, entirely a workers' movement. It took its membership from all classes, and it had high-profile embodiment in the persons of Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin, early and late leaders of the movement, both Russian aristocrats.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best moniker for depicting how anarchists and their bombs were imagined in their own time comes in the term anarchists coined to rationalize and explain their mode of violence: "propaganda-by-deed."<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Propaganda-by-deed became canonized as allowable violence, and, as such, it partially underwrote the movement. Clearly, there is something seductive for revolutionaries in the act of violence, and anarchists often invoked a rhetoric of purity and fertility in destruction. As Bakunin wrote, "Revolution requires extensive and widespread destruction, a fecund and renovating destruction, since in this way and only in this way are new worlds born."<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Thus anarchists at times called for "a clean sweep" of the entire social order as a necessary preface for a revived, better world.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> If rebuilding the world required that it first be destroyed, then the technology of destruction must be cultivated. The science of bomb making became a central feature in anarchist ideology and literature from the early 1880s, the most notorious instance being Johann Most's <span style="font-style:italic;">Revolutionary War Science</span> , a bomb-making tract that circulated widely and clandestinely throughout Europe and America for decades, and made the German-born author one of the most feared anarchists in the world. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>It is not only the theory of propaganda-by-deed that caught people's attention, but the term itself, which was used ubiquitously. At the literal level, the term stresses the revolutionary message ("propaganda," a word whose negative connotations post-date this period) over the violent "deed." In a similar vein, theorists of terrorism in our own, contemporary context have argued that terrorism is best understood as a form of (wildly excessive) communication.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Without minimizing the often horrendous facts of terrorist violence, this theory emphasizes that the act of violence is meant to send a message, to utilize highly spectacular and news-garnering violence as a form of language—what Émile Henry, the Café Terminus bomber, called "the voice of dynamite."<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Or, as Vladimir declares of anarchists in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, "bombs are your means of expression."<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> Propaganda-by-deed is a principle of action that assumes interpretation, under the premise that those reacting from the outside will see a clear and causal relationship between the destruction at hand and an already-known political message. It thus demands an unlikely cohesion, at the level of signification, between perpetrators and the public.</p>
<p>All of this has the ring, moreover, of the theatrical, highlighting the act of a single protagonist, as he stands, momentarily, apart from the broader movement; it seems ready-made for vilification, but also for tragedy. So Oscar Wilde, in his first play, <span style="font-style:italic;">Vera, or the Nihilists</span>  creates in his melodramatic heroine an embodiment of idealistic purpose married to self-sacrificing energy—propaganda-by-deed in its most unblemished guise. Vera is pure of heart and irreproachable in her motives (though she does help to assassinate the Czar); if she could carry out the revolution on her own, she certainly would.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Such an image differs in important ways from the other central formula for radical violence in the period, the General Strike ("direct action"), in which the individual actor is submerged by the group, and the violence of sheer numbers replaces the individual bomb-thrower as locus of destruction. Or perhaps it is best to see these two distinct modes as contributing together to a broad conceptualization of radical violence in the period, where direct action conjures the image of vast organized (or perhaps dangerously disorganized) masses, while propaganda-by-deed suggests the supremely motivated individual. With the theatricality of propaganda-by-deed, the central actor is red in hyperbolic, gestural terms, as one who understands himself to be engaged in performance, and the whole enterprise radiates with an exuberantly aesthetic quality.</p>
<p>A hybrid of revolutionary self-representation and equally vivid reactionary portrayal, the person of the anarchist bomber was typically red in stylized terms—a repository, we might say, for a certain literary zeal. For instance, the question of what kind of person would or could become an anarchist and how to amalgamate him into an understandable frame of reference, came wreathed in intriguing contradiction. As the narrator of Conrad's "The Informer" remarks, "anarchists in general were simply inconceivable to me mentally, morally, logically, sentimentally, and even physically."<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> On the one hand, it was unsurprisingly the case, as Haia Shpayer-Makov notes, that the anarchist "was greeted [in the press] with the stock rhetoric and imagery commonly applied to the Irish, the socialists, and other 'deviant' groups . . . The anarchist <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  was associated with revolutionism and violence, and as such stood in opposition to the self-image of British society as an orderly and law-abiding community."<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> On the other hand, for all the invective directed towards anarchists and other "degenerates," there was an appealing mystery about this re. In popular dynamite novels, anarchists were often surprisingly likable, their motives laudable, even as they tapped into a reservoir of anxiety about revolutionary madness and extremity.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the anarchist was imagined as a destroyer, unconstrained by ordinary ethical norms, single-mindedly driving the revolution via the commission of "outrages." The historical names attached to this image come thick and fast: Sergei Nechaev set the tone, authoring a chilling tract (some believe in collaboration with Bakunin<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a>), entitled "Catechism of the Revolution," which spelled out the image of the terrorist in cool, calculated detail. Johann Most, the maker of bombs, offered an image of science gone horribly wrong, as he willingly dispersed the technology of killing, seemingly indifferent to human life.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> The exuberantly self-righteous and famous Ravachol was a French anarchist who became something of a folk legend, after being guillotined in 1892 for a series of dynamite attacks; his song, "La Ravachole," (a revamping of the Revolutionary anthem <span style="font-style:italic;">La Carmagnole</span> and the epigraph for this essay) remained as an echo of his fiery views, with lines like "Let's blow up all the bourgeois/ We'll blow them up!", and its refrain, "Long live the sound/ Of the explosion!"<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Then there was Émile Henry, who declared to the judges at his trial for the Café Terminus bombing, in which he was sentenced to death, that "the bourgeoisie must be brought to understand that those who have suffered are tired at last of their sufferings," and that anarchism "will end by killing you."<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Alexander Berkman, as unapologetic at his trial for shooting Frick as Henry was at his, depicted the attempted assassination, in a widely-read prison memoir , in riveting, moment-by-moment narration. The list goes on, but what seems most notable in each case is the sense of drama, sensation, and narrative possibility around each of these (in)famous res, who seem as much like literary creations as historical personages.</p>
<p>Nechaev's landmark "Catechism," written in 1869 as a statement of revolutionary methods and creeds, and garnering long-lasting status as underground dogma, provided an image of the terrorist that was in every sense literary: it both derived from and inspired fictional characters, it very self-consciously imagined the terrorist as a persona or model, and it carried a strong sense of aura or mood.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> The first line, "The revolutionary is a doomed person," establishes its ethics of insurrectionary violence primarily as a matter of the commitment, courage, and ultimate selflessness of the terrorist himself:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>There exists only one contentment for him, one consolation, reward and satisfaction—the success of the revolution. Day and night he must have only one thought, one goal—merciless destruction. Striving cold-bloodedly and tirelessly to this goal, he must be always ready to die himself and to kill with his hands all that prevents its accomplishment.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The rebel of the "Catechism" holds intimately with death: he not only kills, but does so with his bare body, his "own hands." A complete loner, the anarchist-as-terrorist <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  is enjoined to foreswear all ties of personal affiliation, indeed to relinquish his very humanity in the name of the cause: "All tender or softening feelings of kinship, love, gratitude and even honor itself must be suppressed in him by the only cold passion [<span style="font-style:italic;">sic</span>] of the revolutionary task." This ideal of a revolutionary with an absolute and dominating purpose reached far and wide within radical circles. John Henry Mackay, in a semi-autobiographical novel about London anarchism in the 1880s, sums up the influence in creating one of his characters as a disciple of Nechaev:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>At the age of twenty-four he is a terrorist. He has learned them by heart, those mad eleven principles "concerning the duties of the revolutionist to himself and to his fellow-revolutionists" . . . He journeys from city to city. Everywhere he tries to undermine the existing order of things . . . He trusts only in the revolution henceforth.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Restless and itinerant (another hallmark of historical anarchists, a result of frequent deportations and threats of arrest), the anarchist of the "Catechism" seems to be everywhere and nowhere, a subversive agent of the modern world, relentlessly working to carry out his mission of total destruction.</p>
<p>Yet for all the asceticism and grim determination in these portrayals, we also find in many works a streak of joy and pleasure in the act of violence, viewed as revenge-taking against deserving exploiters—the <span style="font-style:italic;">jouissance</span> of the deed, we might say. Berkman, for one, saw in reprisal killing the germination of his own manhood: "Could anything be nobler than to die for a grand, a sublime Cause? . . . And what could be higher in life than to be a true revolutionist? It is to be a <span style="font-style:italic;">man</span>, a complete MAN. A being . . . who has emancipated himself from being merely human . . . " (emphasis in original).<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Readers attuned to postcolonial discourse might note the affinity between this language and a postcolonial model of generative violence, such as that invoked by Franz Fanon in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wretched of the Earth</span>, which imagines a virile, colonial masculinity emerging from the t against European oppressors. Both of these radical positions, in turn, gain momentum from a Christian rhetoric of martyrdom and self-sacrifice, as the revolutionary investment in the body aligns itself with other mystical and masculinist traditions. In Berkman's language, two different sacrificial bodies are suggested: that of Frick, who stands in for all exploiters, and that of the incarcerated or executed revolutionary, whose expendable body is subsumed in the cause.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> The dualist underpinnings of Western sacrificial logic, the apotheosis accorded to the person who gives his body in the name of some larger commitment, the Christian promise of a glory that disdains bodily pleasure and rewards bodily privation—such conventions are perpetuated in radical conceptions of the revolutionary hero.</p>
<p>Indeed, a central tenet in many representations was an almost-religious fervor defining the anarchist. Zola's Souvarine in <span style="font-style:italic;">Germinal</span>, a novel focusing on a massive mining strike, is one such re. Souvarine's affect is one of ironized detachment in relation to the industrial action at the center of the novel's plot (nothing more than "foolery," as he repeatedly terms it), but he becomes powerfully animated when he describes his vision of the destruction of the world: "As he talked, Souvarine grew terrible. An ecstasy raised him in his chair, a mystic flame darted from his pale eyes, and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  his delicate hands gripped the edge of the table almost to breaking" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Ger</span>, 254). Such mystic transformation is as powerful as it looks, moreover, for Souvarine's ultimate act of terrorism overshadows the many local, grisly, often frightful scenes of violence the novel catalogues. The anarchist's form of destruction, mirroring his feverish power, is on an entirely different order from even the most feared forms of revolutionary rampaging. "He had vitality enough in him to bring the dead to life, passion enough for a hundred men," is how one sympathetic novelist depicted the leader of the Haymarket anarchists.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Or, again, the London-based anarchist Stepniak wrote of "The Terrorist" that, "he is noble, terrible, irresistibly fascinating, for he combines in himself the two sublimities of human grandeur: the martyr and the hero."<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> In all of these portraits, the anarchist is portrayed as a person powerfully motivated to change the world. It is on the future, and perhaps on the past, that he fixes his gaze ("he will march onward . . . certain that justice will be rendered to him in his tomb," in Stepniaks's language), the present will always be the object of destruction, and contemporaries will be the least likely to embrace the terrorist himself.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> There is drama (or melodrama) here, emblazoned on the terrorist's features. Yet this re, with his dreamy qualities and exaggerated characteristics, also lends himself to parody, or to a charge of inefficacy and fantasizing. As the decades of anarchist activity began to wane in England and other European countries in the early twentieth century, the icon of the lone terrorist out to change the world with his bombs was ripe to become a ludicrous image of narcissistic self-delusion.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>Whether efficacious or ridiculous, anarchists in the British imagination were always understood as foreign. There is some legitimacy to this stereotype, for anarchism was not a British-born phenomenon and was fundamentally international in spirit. Its roots ran deepest in Russia, though foundational thinkers came from all over the continent; there was a great deal of itinerancy among anarchists, so that a typical anarchist meeting in London might include Russians, French, German, American, and other Eastern European participants; and Jews made up a robust complement of the movement, especially in London and in large American cities like New York and Chicago, where Yiddish-language anarchist journals flourished alongside those in English, French, German, Italian, and Russian.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> The anarchist's canonical foreignness cut in a variety of directions. The question, for instance, of what might attract an English person to the cause became the subject for speculation. Dynamite novels often red an English protagonist who finds himself immersed, for one reason or another, in an anarchist organization created and dominated by foreigners. Henry James's Hyacinth Robinson, at the center of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Princess Casamassima</span> , is the most famous such character. Less canonically, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Angel of the Revolution</span>, a novel featuring the total overthrow of the world order by a band of idealistic Russian insurrectionists, the protagonist is something of a regular English type—a public-schoolboy bachelor and unlikely candidate for anarchism—who eventually becomes a leader in the movement. Robert Louis and Fanny Stevenson, co-authors of a strange little pastiche of a novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Dynamiter</span>, portray a series of English male dupes seduced by beautiful, snake-like revolutionary women. And in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Girl Among the Anarchists</span>, an autobiographical novel by Helen and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Olivia Rossetti (nieces of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and cousins of Ford Madox Ford) the authors take up the question of how a middle-class Englishwoman becomes entangled in the anarchist movement. Detailing the protagonist's experience as a convert to anarchism and the eventual editor of an anarchist journal (and hence at the very center of the London scene), it offers a lively inside look at anarchism from the perspective of a sympathetic middle-class woman.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> These English-born anarchist characters each raise the question also posed urgently by the historical bombings on English soil, one which points straight to the heart of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>: what does it mean for dynamite violence to lodge right here, at home?</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">II. Explosion and Melodrama: <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>
</h1>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span> accords with many works of the three preceding decades in simultaneously taking seriously the political violence of anarchism and relentlessly denuding it of its most prized qualities. Its darkly comic tone and hyperbolic parody powerfully debunk the movement and its personae, and have led some commentators to see it primarily as a reactionary fable. Yet what makes <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span> especially rewarding as a reflection on the culture of political violence at the turn of the century is that it plunges headlong into the material realities of dynamite violence, even as it capaciously incorporates nearly all the tropes and strategies for representing terrorism that circulated in the contemporary culture. Above all, Conrad considers the nature of dynamite's sensation: how dynamite violence registers ethically as a subject for fiction, what its shock-value means for characters and plots. In Conrad's novel, we find the four key terms brought vividly together—dynamite, anarchism, sensation, melodrama—and out of this jostling quartet of historical and literary phenomena emerges a new and eerie image of the future. The literary flamboyance of sensationalism and melodrama are given a moment of triumph in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, before they are eroded by an insinuation of ongoing and insidious dread.</p>
<p>We might note, at the outset, a distinguishing feature of Conrad's tone with respect to his subject matter: his insistence on the meaninglessness surrounding the Greenwich bombing, and his stress on the contrast between motive (obscure and cynical) and outcome (gruesome and extreme). In an author's note appended to the 1920 edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, Conrad describes the Greenwich explosion in terms of its unfathomability. The affair, he declares, was:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>. . . a blood-stained inanity of so fatuous a kind that it was impossible to fathom its origin by any reasonable or even unreasonable process of thought. For perverse unreason has its own logical processes. But that outrage could not be laid hold of mentally in any sort of way, so that one remained faced by the fact of a man blown to bits for nothing even most remotely resembling an idea, anarchistic or other</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 5).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">If the underlying precept of propaganda-by-deed is interpretive—that there is, in fact, an idea at the basis of every terrorist act—Conrad dismisses this premise, supplying his <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  own ethical and literary standards. The expression of violence and the expression of motive are thoroughly disengaged, Conrad suggests, and it is in this gap that the literary interest arises. Dynamite explosion thus brings to the fore such Conradian features as ambiguity and unknowability—a disjunction between horrendous realities in the world and obscure signifying practices—or, as he repeatedly res it in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, the specter of insanity. "'Madness alone," as Vladimir puts it, "is truly terrifying'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 31). The evasive and yet ratively rich possibilities glimpsed in the gulf of meaning surrounding extraordinary (or insane) violence make dynamite explosion particularly resonant for Conrad, drawing him to consider its cultural and bodily expressions, and leading him into commensurate generic directions.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>And Conrad knew a great deal about anarchism.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> He may have declared himself, in personal letters and in the author's note to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, to be uninformed about the workings of anarchists, which he brushed off as only of vague interest, and about the Greenwich bombing of February 1894, which he claimed not to have followed in the papers at the time or to have researched in any detail when composing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>. But critics have taken these statements to task and shown quite conclusively that Conrad was highly educated on the topic of anarchist violence.<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> He had access, through Ford, to the London anarchist scene and to insider accounts of what may have actually transpired in the Greenwich case; there is every reason to believe he had, in fact, followed the reportage of the Greenwich explosion at the time and read further about it in later years; his personal and familial history gave him a special interest in the workings of European revolutionaries—all of this is amply evident.</p>
<p>In fact, even without scholars chasing him down, Conrad gives himself away in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, as well as in the author's note. There, over a decade after composing the novel, his prose is still inundated by the journalistic language of anarchism (he uses terms like "outrage" in double and triple senses; repeatedly employs "anarchism" as both a philosophy and a form of meaningless destruction; is still consumed with the sensationalism of dynamite explosion). The novel itself, composed, it should be stressed, well after the period it depicts, is so replete with characters and plots out of that earlier period as to read like a handbook of late-Victorian conventions for construing the anarchist scene. So, for instance: the idea that anarchism and violence are inescapable partners is writ into the saga as a premise; the presence of dynamite is the lynchpin of the text in several respects; the anarchists in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span> fall into typologies as they so often did in the literature of the period, each portraying some aspect of the terrorist persona; semi-fictionalized events like the Rome conference to which Vladimir refers have historical counterparts<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a>; and the novel returns incessantly to a number of themes that dominated the late-Victorian rendition of anarchism, such as the emphasis on bombs as the inevitable tool of anarchists, the freighted relation between words and deeds, and the international quality of the movement. Moreover, Conrad mirrored in his novel the reportage of the Greenwich bombing in many particulars. The newspaper coverage of the bombing was detailed, wide-ranging, and often gruesome, as, for instance, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Times</span>' initial report of the scene: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The first [park keeper] to arrive found a man half crouching on the ground. His legs were shattered, one arm was blown away, and the stomach and abdomen were torn open. [new paragraph] As the keeper came up to him the man faintly besought help and then fell forward on his face, unconscious, in a great pool of his own blood.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Such reportage would have been hard to miss, even for someone without Conrad's particular interests and connections. All of this reminds us, in part, of how directly the discourse of one's surroundings gives shape and intelligibility to historic events. In the case of anarchism, it was the sensational news-worthiness of the topic that provided its essential, guiding principle.</p>
<p>Less obviously, Conrad's ambivalent position about writing what we might call "historical fiction" suggests a central orientation of his novel: an oscillation between an attention to the materiality of both history and the body and a recourse to generic forms like caricature and melodrama that reduce the pointedness of such efforts. We might look, for instance, to the novel's first page, to see how this dynamic gets established:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>The window contained photographs of more or less undressed dancing girls; nondescript packages in wrappers like patent medicines; closed yellow paper envelopes, very flimsy, and marked two and six in heavy black res; a few numbers of ancient French comic publications hung across a string as if to dry; a dingy blue china bowl, a casket of black wood, bottles of marking ink, and rubber stamps; a few books with titles hinting at impropriety; a few apparently old copies of obscure newspapers, badly printed, with titles like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Torch</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gong</span>—rousing titles. And the two gas-jets inside the panes were always turned low, either for economy's sake or for the sake of the customers.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 9).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Conrad's realism here is oblique, since it gives a detailed and evocative sense of setting precisely through a language of evasion ("more or less," "nondescript," "like," "as if," "hinting at," "apparently," "obscure," "either . . . or"). When we do get a concrete detail, in the names of the two anarchist journals, Conrad's method becomes even more elusive: one of these, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Torch</span>, was an actual journal (edited by the Rossetti children), while the other the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gong</span>, is a fictional take-off on such real "rousing" periodicals as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Alarm</span>. Why mix the historical detail with the facsimile, the exact with the parodic? The answer, I think, is that the novel wants simultaneously to offer a harrowing account of the visceral and precise materiality of anarchist violence, and to evade that materiality via the ruses of genre, to wit via caricature and melodrama. Conrad is not so much toying with history as developing an accordion-like movement in and out of history, which in turn also implies a movement closer and further from the body. The novel makes these counterpointing moves—in the direction of and away from an embodied sense of history—from the novel's first paragraphs through to the author's note of the next decade, but it is in the text's crisis event that this structure takes most powerful form.</p>
<p>I have said that dynamite explosion in this period signified the violence of anarchism. Nowhere is such an explosion more vividly imagined than in the destruction of Stevie in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">Stevie's story embodies real pathos, from his beginnings as the victim of paternal brutality, to a life marked by scant affection and by frustrated attempts to imagine and promote social justice, to his hideously violent demise. Chief Inspector Heat perhaps speaks for all of us when he surmises about the effect of the bomb's "ruthless cruelty" at the moment of Stevie's death: "The man, whoever he was, had died instantaneously; and yet it seemed impossible to believe that a human body could have reached that state of disintegration without passing through the pangs of inconceivable agony" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 71). It is crucially important for the novel's reflection on violence, as well as its meditation on time, that Conrad jumps over the bombing itself, giving us only its remnants, yet insisting that to contemplate these remains is to step imaginatively back in time to the moment of their ghastly creation. It may simply be impossible, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, to bracket the moment of explosive violence—hence the Professor's feverish labor to create the perfect detonator, one which would somehow eliminate the fateful twenty seconds between detonation and explosion.<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>Stevie's empathy for suffering brings him closer than anyone else in the novel to the social vision of the period's revolutionaries. If the novel's four anarchists —Yundt, Michaelis, Ossipon, and the Professor—are eviscerated of any real humanity and represent something like an amalgamated and distorted portrait of actual and imagined terrorists, Stevie-as-representative lurches in the opposite direction, embodying a generalized empathy for suffering of the sort that animated historical anarchists to an important degree.<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> Or we might put it this way: Conrad very self-consciously sets out to caricature the anarchists at the same time that he gives us a version of anarchism's message in the person of Stevie, who functions as a whirling vortex of impressions stamped by the sadistic world around him. Stevie's sense that life is marked by pain and cruelty, and his status as the whipping boy for life's brutality, make him especially responsive and susceptible: literally, as he is physically destroyed by violence, and ratively, as he reacts to the suffering he envisages around him. Dogged by a "morbid horror and dread of physical pain," Stevie visualizes physical suffering in others with precision, as, for instance, when he responds to Yundt's vivid depiction of the ruling classes as cannibalistic torturers: "Stevie knew very well that hot iron applied to one's skin hurt very much . . . it would hurt terribly" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 42). Where Yundt's language <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  dwells with evident relish on the misery of exploited flesh ("'Can't you smell and hear from here the thick hide of the people burn and sizzle?'"), Stevie's response is visceral, personal, and direct—in a word, humane (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 41).<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> And we are told, moreover, that the fourteen-year-old Stevie, riled to fury at the mistreatment of fellow workers, had set off fireworks in the office where he was employed as an errand boy, in the hopes, apparently, of destroying the place. Such an event quite clearly refers to a type of anarchist "outrage," in marked contrast to the novel's Greenwich bombing, whose social and political meaning is entirely contrived by cynical operatives, working in the interest of their own power.<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>Stevie the anarchist even has a slogan of his own, developed in his sputtering way, in response to his interaction with a one-armed cab-man and his decrepit horse: "'bad world for poor people'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 132). "Bad world for poor people" is certainly an accurate description of the state of poverty in urban London, and it also mirrors the kinds of messages about social injustice that anarchists and other revolutionaries worked to disseminate. The scene in which this lesson is learned, however, is a tour de force of comic writing (a simultaneous satire and enactment of the classic industrial novel, and a blistering riff on Raskolnikov's dream in <span style="font-style:italic;">Crime and Punishment</span>), and it would be difficult to take Stevie's moral encapsulation of the social drama witnessed there as the novel's own unironic credo.<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> Indeed, as a spokesman for social justice, the well-meaning Stevie is nevertheless a caricature, just as the image of him as modern artist is equally satiric: ". . . the innocent Stevie, sitting very good and quiet at a deal table, drawing circles, circles; innumerable circles, concentric, eccentric; a coruscating whirl of circles that by their tangled multitude of repeated curves, uniformity of form, and confusion of intersecting lines suggesting a rendering of cosmic chaos, the symbolism of mad art attempting the inconceivable" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 40).</p>
<p>If Stevie's status as artist and anarchist is at once constructed and denied, his physical being remains shockingly visible. More generally in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, the flesh of humanity has an inescapable and ubiquitous presence. Conrad seems unusually repulsed in this novel by the body, which appears outsized, a stifling physical cage to match the claustrophobia of the urban scene. And these are not incidental suggestions of disgust: the critic James English, for one, has located the crux of Conrad's political intervention in his creation of such res as the fat anarchist, an irony that encapsulates a variety of contradictions in the political imaginary of the period. For the anarchist to be fat is to inhabit precisely that which he is supposed to destroy (the fattened bourgeoisie being a stock image for the hated status quo, as in my epigraph from Ravachol) and to embody a whole series of ironies about their (in)efficacy and belatedness.<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> All of this attention to the flesh reaches its apex in the person of Stevie, whose quivering body reacts to the felt reality and to the mere prospect of pain. When Stevie is blown up, his dripping, shattered remains seem like a confrontation to any form of conceptual or literary accommodation. Stevie is now all flesh, his chaotic artistry the abstraction of a body whose contours have been entirely fragmented and erased. In this scenario, his body's radical fleshiness loses its status as satire and becomes, instead, an unbearable burden. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>This notion of burden is literalized in the object that comes to symbolize Stevie's decimated state: the shovel. The shovel that they use to scrape up his scattered body parts—the shovel that is a part of every reference to his death—becomes the metonymical trace of a physical situation almost too gruesome to contemplate. The novel pulls back from Stevie's death—the thought of what kind of agony he might have suffered in the instant of explosion left as a haunting question—but it repeatedly returns to the shovel. A rustic and primitive implement, a distinctly humble object, the shovel is associated not so much with the urban scape of London as with the ground in general, the site of agriculture and also of burial. It is strikingly an object; with its simple form and universal recognizability, it is completely visually available. When pain becomes unimaginable, it seems, the imagination turns to what it knows. In the passage where Stevie's remains are initially described, this crystallizing of affect into the shovel takes two forms: first, it is the sound of the shovel (rather than the sight of Stevie's exploded body) that induces the keeper's vomiting, and second, the invocation of the shovel immediately follows two metaphors ("what might have been an accumulation of raw material for a cannibal feast"; "which seemed to have been collected in shambles and rag shops"), both of which are jarringly incongruous, and which, in a sense, are replaced by this much more vivid image. The shovel works metonymically: more than any metaphoric solution (cannibal feasts, rag shops), by holding and touching the body's remains, it stands imaginatively for their terrible reality. Metonymy nudges out metaphor, bringing us closer to the body, but that metonymy immediately works too well, generating a vivid return to the body (in the form of the keeper's reaction).</p>
<p>The descriptive quality of language thus reaches an impasse with the fragmented body of Stevie, an impasse that will call up a variety of responses. But the first response is to linger on the shovel. Winnie, for one, returns instinctively to it:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>That's where the boy was killed. A park—smashed branches, torn leaves, gravel, bits of brotherly flesh and bone, all spouting up together in the manner of a firework. She remembered now what she had heard, and she remembered it pictorially. They had to gather him up with the shovel. Trembling all over with irrepressible shudders, she saw before her the very implement with its ghastly load scraped up from the ground.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 195–196)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Though Winnie's structures of thought may not be exactly normative—her susceptibility to journalistic phraseology, for instance, approaches the pathological—her response to Stevie's body in ruins does function paradigmatically. An excess of violence, here, pushes the imagination not towards any given political meaning (as the principle of propaganda-by-deed would suggest) but towards a kind of imagism that exists at the opposite end of the intelligible spectrum. There is no "idea" to associate with the shovel; its work seems to belie the very notion of interpretability.</p>
<p>Such spare imagism, a reaction to the exploded body, must nevertheless confront dynamite's other central attribute: its sensationalism. I have said that dynamite violence was sensational almost by definition, incorporating its key components of graphic violence, the threat of escalation, and mystery. Sensationalism, one of modernity's endlessly self-fulfilling vices, represented a central pivot point in late-Victorian conceptions of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  modern crime. Over and over, the culture asked itself whether and how the media (especially newspapers and fiction) influenced criminal behavior, seeming to indict some of its most basic impulses, such as the dissemination of information and the abhorring of violence. The never-solved Ripper murders in London's East End , to take the most notorious case, spawned its own textual industry, in a lavish display of interest, fascination, anxiety, and seemingly endless hand-wringing with respect to responsibility.<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> The mutuality linking horrific crime with an ever-broadening news media thus represents a rich topic in Victorian cultural history; with respect to our specific themes, the history of anarchism and the theatricality of dynamite violence were always thoroughly intertwined with sensationalism. The notion of "propagandaby deed," for instance, depended on a sensationalist-minded press, which would spread word of anarchist outrages far and wide, and would help to stir public fear and interest. More generally, what makes a crime "terrorist" in structure is its determination to send a message, and for this print journalism was the central organ of communication.</p>
<p>When fiction takes up these subjects, it almost inevitably slips under the rubric of sensationalism, and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, which makes the proximity between the novel and the newspaper visible at every turn, is especially interested in confronting its own relation to news in general and to sensationalism in particular. Conrad presents the language of the press as ubiquitous and insidious, its formulae encased in the mind, and also in a relation of adjacency (as with the shovel and the body). So, for instance:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>It was a raw, gloomy day of the early spring; and the grimy sky, the mud of the street, the rags of the dirty men harmonized excellently with the eruption of the damp, rubbishy sheets of paper soiled with printers' ink. The posters, maculated with filth, garnished like tapestry the sweep of the kerbstone. The trade in afternoon papers was brisk, yet, in comparison with the swift, constant march of foot traffic, the effect was of indifference, of a disregarded distribution.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 65).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Layers upon layers of proximity: the ink rubs against the papers (an interesting form or writing), the city's grime against people and advertisements, the papers against the passing multitudes, who are all the more receptive for their obliviousness and indifference.</p>
<p>"Rubbing off" seems the appropriate re for the uneasy relation of the news media to political violence, both within <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span> and in the contemporary understanding more broadly. The question of what effect journalism had on the escalation of anarchist attacks was always a thorny one. If journals of all sorts made hay out of the specter of anarchist violence, there was also an uneasiness as to whether their saturation coverage might contribute to the celebrity, and hence, in a certain way, success, of the revolutionaries. Not surprisingly, Conrad offers a variety of viewpoints on this question.<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a> On one hand, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, he suggests that the grimy printers' ink has rubbed off on the populace to such a degree that they can only think in terms of journalistic formulations. So Winnie is driven mad by the journalistic phrase "the drop given was fourteen feet," and Tom Ossipon, for all his self-serving callousness, is also haunted by the language of the newspapers, in this case the melodramatic account he <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  reads of Winnie's death: "<span style="font-style:italic;">An impenetrable mystery seems destined to hang for ever over this act of madness or despair</span>" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 228, italics in original). The suggestion here is twofold: that people learn how to read their own interior lives by what they read in the papers (a familiar postmodern insight), and that the nature of this particular "simple tale," as Conrad subtitled the novel, is so entwined with the kinds of events covered in newspapers and journals as to make it almost emanate from the press. It is highly appropriate, then, that when Winnie learns about her brother's death, her first response is to rip a newspaper down the middle.</p>
<p>Yet if the novel critiques the insidious power of the press to construct human interiority, it also succumbs to the general infatuation with anarchist violence, as understood and imagined by journalists at the time of the Greenwich bombing. Though the shovel appears to have been Conrad's innovation, and though Bourdin was actually alive when first discovered (quite unlike Stevie), the novel remains true to contemporary newspaper accounts, which returned ineluctably to the bomber's body. The degree to which Bourdin was mangled, the image of his torn body in what appeared to be a kneeling position, the speculation about where and how the explosion occurred and what the effects must have been on his person—all of this was subject to intense speculation. For journalists in the 1890s, and for Conrad ten years later, it was that exploded body which provided the animating core of the story. Indeed, Conrad's decision to write a novel about the Greenwich bombing at all testifies to his attraction to sensational news, since no "outrage" generated more coverage in England than this one. As Vladimir—Conrad's strange alter-ego in the novel, who plots its course and explicates its mysteries even before they exist—muses, "Every newspaper has ready-made phrases to explain such manifestations [as political assassination] away," but an outrage like the Greenwich bombing would be sure to rise to new levels of sensation (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 30).</p>
<p>More generally, Conrad was concerned both with the problem of how the press reports violent events, and with the way such reportage correlates to the imaginative capacities of the citizenry. In "Autocracy and War" , an essay he wrote as he was composing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, Conrad worries about the availability in England of authentic accounts of the Russo-Japanese war, then underway. The war, he writes, "has been made known to us, so far, in the grey reflection of its terrible and monotonous phases of pain, death, sickness; a reflection seen in the perspective of thousands of miles, in the dim atmosphere of official reticence, through the veil of inadequate words."<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a> The problem, for Conrad, is not so much the bad faith of the newspapers (as suggested in the phrase "official reticence") as the deep limitations he feels hamper ordinary human faculties for apprehending violence in its fullest materiality. The real crux lies in the narrowness that Conrad believes to characterize the imaginative range of those reading from the safety of home.</p>
<p>In fact, for Conrad, what differentiates the situation of the victims of modern war from the kind of suffering which is capable of moving English citizens—the example he gives is of an "over-worked horse falling in front of our windows, [or] a man writhing under a cart-wheel in the street"—is that the former is infused with politics and the latter with melodrama (<span style="font-style:italic;">NLL</span>, 112). Journalism can do justice neither to the richness <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of history nor to the magnitude of a human crisis. "There must be something subtly noxious to the human brain in the composition of newspaper ink," Conrad reflects:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>. . . or else it is that the large page, the columns of words, the leaded headings, exalt the mind into a state of feverish credulity. The printed page of the Press makes a sort of still uproar, taking from men both the power to reflect and the faculty of genuine feeling; leaving them only the artificially created need of having something exciting to talk about</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">NLL</span>, 121).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">As in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, where the newspaper is red in terms of its materiality, here, too, the physical paper—its ink, style, format—seems to determine its content. That format, in Conrad's view, transforms a story of both physical and historical magnitude into a catalyst for inauthentic feeling. Heightened emotion of a comfortably familiar variety elbows out the more difficult reckoning with political violence.</p>
<p>And this is exactly what happens in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>: it turns from the unendurable reality of Stevie's body and the shovel to the melodramatic story of Winnie's revenge and suicide. In doing so, it moves from a form of violence whose contours are unfixable, as the body itself becomes fragmented beyond recognition, and whose roots are sunk in political intrigue, to a kind of violence that can be understood because it can be attached to firm literary traditions (sentimentalism and melodrama). Or, we might say that the novel shifts from political violence to domestic violence—"from a certain point of view," the Assistant Commissioner notes, "we are here in the presence of a domestic drama" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 168)—and in this movement, it taps into available narrative conventions.<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> The characterization of the tale as a "domestic drama" highlights the novel's central, overdetermined location of the home—a home that, in Winnie's case, is anything but protective.<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a> For Winnie's background, like her brother's, has been a life-long story of spiraling and shifting violence. Like Stevie, she has a visceral empathy for victimization, born of her own terrified childhood. Despite her placid exterior, that is, Winnie's is the interiority of "the potential violence of tragic passions," and she feels her brother's death as "a white-hot iron drawn across her eyes" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 160, 182). Conrad treats Winnie's and Stevie's family background allusively, by suggestion more than detailed narration, but his representation of the traces of domestic violence in their persons nevertheless suggests something important about how violence operates. Conrad, like the nineteenth-century industrial novelists who preceded him in considering an endemic social violence, presents this brutal background as a matter of exposing the violence that attends the lives of the working classes ("bad world for poor people," to recall Stevie's formulation), and also as a kind of metaphor or originating point for the ensuing violence that sweeps through the novel.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, with domestication, violence in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span> becomes conceivable; it can find its conventions. The first killing in the novel—the destruction of Stevie—was one which, again, Conrad claimed "could not be laid hold of mentally in any sort of way." By contrast, the second murder, when Winnie kills Verloc, bears the hallmarks of a kind of sensationalism that can be considered amenable to a reading public, indeed to those very readers of grimy newspapers with bold headlines of whom Conrad had <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  despaired in "Autocracy and War." Though both bodies inspire their discoverer to vomit (the keeper in the case of Stevie, Ossipon for Verloc), the spectacle of Verloc's body is quite different from the "sort of mound" that marked Stevie's lumped remains:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>It was the handle of the domestic carving knife with nothing strange about it but its position at right angles to Mr Verloc's waistcoat and the fact that something dripped from it. Dark drops fell on the floorcloth one after another, with a sound of ticking growing fast and furious like the pulse of an insane clock. At its highest speed this ticking changed into a continuous sound of trickling. Mrs Verloc watched that transformation with shadows of anxiety coming and going on her face. It was a trickle, dark, swift, thin . . . Blood!</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 199).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">What a striking contrast divides the defining object that touches Verloc's body—the carving knife—from the shovel that bore Stevie's remains. If the latter suggested a challenge to metaphor, along with an imaginative return to rusticity and the fundamental mortality of the body, the carving knife brings us back to the realm of fiction, and particularly to sensational crime fiction. As a talisman, the carving knife promotes itself as the signifier for a popular literature that stands in the same relation to Conrad's ironized tales of political intrigue as the "sea life of light literature" read by a young Lord Jim stands to Conrad's fractured imperial tales.<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a> And just as <span style="font-style:italic;">Lord Jim</span> ultimately enfolded its own romantic narrative, seeped in orientalism and exuberant as a generic getaway, so <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span> eventually presents the dripping blood of a thriller. It becomes, at least for a while, a familiar kind of suspense story. Or perhaps it is more accurate to say that both implements, the knife and the shovel, signal the promise and the problem of sensationalism in their own forms: the shovel by way of self-critique, pointing to the novel's concern with its own adjacency to journalism, the latter by way of inaugurating a style within a style, a popular tale of sentiment within an ironized account of the brutal, modern city. Conrad himself described <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span> as "a sustained effort in ironical treatment of a melodramatic subject," but it is perhaps more accurate to see irony and melodrama in something of a competition.<a name="f63-text" href="#f63"><sup>63</sup></a> In terms of violence, irony gives way to melodrama, as the conventions enabling the representation of violence as melodrama supercede the murky and uncertain linguistic possibilities that obstruct the approach to Stevie's decimated body, the victim of dynamite.</p>
<p>If we return to Winnie's "pictorial" response to her brother's death, we will find the movement from inconceivable explosion to literary accommodation encoded in her structure of thought. Winnie at first conjures the shovel, as we have seen ("Trembling all over with irrepressible shudders, she saw before her the very implement with its ghastly load"). What follows is a move away from that object and into a more frenzied pictorial panorama:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Mrs Verloc closed her eyes desperately, throwing upon that vision the night of her eye-lids, where after a rainlike fall of mangled limbs the decapitated head of Stevie lingered suspended alone, and fading out slowly like the last star of a pyrotechnic display. Mrs Verloc opened her eyes.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 196). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The garishness of Winnie's vision of her brother's head floating in the sky suggests an entirely different imaginative system from the grounded realism of the shovel. In fact, that realist moment fell in the middle of this sequence, momentarily freezing the working of her fervent vision, making her shudder (like Stevie himself), but she circles back, as her eyes close, to the fireworks where she began, which recall Stevie in a double sense, since his exploding of fireworks was the early sign of his anarchist tendencies.</p>
<p>As Winnie's imagination indicates, explosive violence ultimately calls for rative hyperbole, not imagism but imagistic overload—indeed the supplanting of the unimaginable body by the concrete object makes the first such move. At one level, the simple shovel with its material load would seem to offer the kind of image that literature especially rewards, in comparison with the bizarre fireworks that surround it in Winnie's vision. But, in fact, when the night of Winnie's eyelids descends, what emerges is the flamboyant image, the extreme metaphor, the flaunting of rative language. The mangled body, with its tell-tale implement, stops short the imaginative process; it returns Winnie to her own body, as she shudders irrepressibly. When her vision of fireworks resumes, the exuberance of the rative capacity reasserts itself. This showcasing of an extreme literary flair, I am suggesting, mirrors, encodes and propels the novel's wider transformation from ironized political drama, where the reality of dynamite violence ferociously cuts through the text, to a melodrama which continues the thematics of violence, but within a more theatrical, derealized mode. It is a mode that makes room for open-endedness ("<span style="font-style:italic;">an impenetrable mystery seems to hang forever over this act of madness or despair</span> . . .") via the language of melodrama, and where the sensation of an invisible suicide has all the pathos missing from the awful remains of an unknown—and, for Conrad, ontologically unknowable—anarchist. The unfathomable nature of exploded bodies and political crime thus gives way to another kind of mystery, one kind of madness to another.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">II. Dynamite and the Future</h1>
<p>When dynamite explodes, it leaves behind total fragmentation; but it also creates gashes and tears in the landscape, and these imprinted patterns lead us to the final re I shall discuss, the Professor in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>. Let us consider, in a brief side-tour, the novel Conrad wrote immediately before <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent, Nostromo</span>, which has more in common with its follower than might immediately be evident. <span style="font-style:italic;">Nostromo</span>, after all, has its own dynamite. The San Tomé mine—at the epicenter of the novel's plot, and providing Sulaco with cultural capital in every sense—is the product of a neat dynamite blast. Described as a "re-opened scar in the flank of the mountain," it provides a visual reminder of explosion.<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> More importantly, the mine's life and productivity are safeguarded by the promise of yet more detonations: "'I have enough dynamite stored up at the mountain to send it down crashing into the valley,'" the novel's <span style="font-style:italic;">uber</span>-capitalist Charles Gould explains, "'to send half Sulaco into the air if I liked'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Nos</span>, 170). Or again, "He was prepared, if need be, to blow up the whole San Tomé mountain sky-high out of the territory of the republic" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Nos</span>, 294). Charles <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Gould's use of dynamite as prophylactic against political upheaval represents a brilliant re-imagining of the contemporary infatuation with dynamite as the material, <span style="font-style:italic;">par excellence</span>, of anarchism and revolution. By surrounding the mine, dynamite creates a safety wall around it; by promising to explode the mountain completely, it leaves the partial explosion (the gash) intact, thus continuing to yield its many treasures, material and cultural, in the interest of the English and their allies.</p>
<p>Gould's trick is spectacularly successful. It also spawns a surprising imitator: the Professor in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, who safeguards himself from arrest by carrying a bomb on his person at all times, ready to explode himself (and his potential arresting officer) at a moment's provocation. As he explains it, the police "'know very well I take care never to part with the last handful of my wares. I've it always by me.' He touched the breast of his coat lightly. 'In a thick glass flask'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 55). In <span style="font-style:italic;">Nostromo</span>, the dynamite is kept at a slight remove from the mountain, just as the gash remains only analogous to the body. But in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, the bomb is nestled on the body, and the hand remains vigilantly on the India rubber ball. The masturbatory image of the Professor grasping the ball in his pocket is no doubt comic, but it is also menacing, crude, and precise. By lodging the device on his body, the Professor indissolubly links protection with annihilation, the prophylactic of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nostromo</span> combined with the immense destructive (and self-destructive) force of popular accounts of anarchism, the ultimate mechanism of survival with a material vision of explosion—"a dreadful black hole belching horrible fumes, choked with ghastly rubbish of smashed brickwork and mutilated corpses" is how Ossipon expresses his vision of the effects the Professor's bomb would have were it to explode (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 56). It is as if, in the re of the Professor, Conrad has distilled the dispersed political imaginary surrounding anarchist violence into the tightest of spaces, the "frail" little being of this destructive agent (one of the few characters in the novel who is not fleshy and obese), folding into itself a generalized image of violence that, in the case of the mine, was instead <span style="font-style:italic;">ex</span>foliated—political violence as productive because always held at bay.</p>
<p>The Professor is, of course, what in contemporary parlance we would term a "suicide bomber," or at least he holds out that possibility as his final card to play; in this role, he assumes a new kind of power in the text, what he calls "force."<a name="f65-text" href="#f65"><sup>65</sup></a> It is the power of the weapon become the person, of a complete intertwining of the man himself with an explosive device. In an early discussion with Ossipon, the Professor credits his effectiveness ("'I am deadly'") to "'force of personality,'" a sheer will to destruction, which matches his desire for "a clean sweep and a clear start for a new conception of life,'" language which gestures in the direction of Nietzsche, and which closely echoes actual and fictional anarchists from the period (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 57, 56, 61). Monomaniacal in his search for a perfect detonator, indifferent to any form of human attachment, ascetic in his habits, the Professor has much in common with Nechaev's terrorist from the "Catechism of the Revolution," and, as in Nechaev's treatise, this combination suggests an image of disproportionate power. The Professor is no man of the people—indeed his detestation and horror of the masses signal his most notable weakness—a preacher less of revolution than of simple violence. In his opening colloquy with Verloc, Vladimir had <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  fantasized about the perfect dynamite attack as one lodged <span style="font-style:italic;">into</span> "pure mathematics," but we can also see such a logic extended to the person of the Professor, who represents something like the potential for an attack <span style="font-style:italic;">of</span> pure mathematics (<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 31). Conrad seems to agree with the professor's own arrogant sense of his destructive reach, yielding the novel's final paragraph to him and, perhaps surprisingly, given what many critics take to be an attitude of contempt for all the anarchists in the text, using the ambiguities of free indirect discourse partially to echo his self-assessment:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>And the incorruptible Professor walked, too, averting his eyes from the odious multitude of mankind. He had no future. He disdained it. He was a force. His thoughts caressed the images of ruin and destruction. He walked frail, insignificant, shabby, miserable—and terrible in the simplicity of his idea calling madness and despair to the regeneration of the world. Nobody looked at him. He passed on unsuspected and deadly, like a pest in the street full of men.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SA</span>, 231)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">For all Conrad's diminishment of the Professor here, the bomb on his body nevertheless transforms London's citizens into his potential victims, a condition that virtually defines the state of terrorism. "He was a force": the term, used repeatedly by and about the Professor, stresses something new in the novel's conception of violence. The very idea of force is sweeping and overpowering, and, in this case, also invisible. This is what gives force its charge, its "terrible . . . simplicity." Indeed, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span> is a "simple tale" not only for its focus on the bare dynamics of familial revenge, but because it culminates in the "simplicity" of a violence that is propelled by a politics-free lust to annihilate.</p>
<p>The Professor may himself have "no future," but he offers, quite precisely, an image of the future for the rest of modernity's citizens. It is a future defined by dynamite's hidden presence, by the invisible threat of a single individual, a mere speck amidst "the multitude of mankind," with an excess of violent will. "He was going over there, to the unknown. He was going tranquilly to extermination, wherever there might be dynamite to blow up towns and men. He will be there, without doubt, when the middle class in agony shall hear the pavement of the streets bursting up beneath their feet": not the Professor this time, but Zola's Souvarine, this agent of future destruction is another member of the pantheon of terrorists who were imagined, in a sense, as survivors of their own era, hurtling forth into a dystopic futurity (<span style="font-style:italic;">Ger</span>, 504–505). If the general melting of anarchism into melodrama seems to suggest a comfortable eclipsing of its threat, the preserving of the terrorist bespeaks quite a different reckoning with violence in the future. In the end, the structure of anarchist violence seems to come down to two poles: the exploded body (Stevie's physical decimation) and the menace of the Professor (endlessly seeking a form of total annihilation). What differentiates them, of course, is agency: the body whose obliteration represents an insane crash of force from nowhere and for no purpose, and the body whose self-construction as bomb represents the potential explosion of force from a single point and in a surfeit of pure purpose. In between falls a complex state of horror, empathy, uncertainty, fear, and ultimately, imaginative possibility, whose other name, perhaps, is modernity. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<h1 class="fn-head">Notes</h1>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f1" href="#f1-text">1. </a>A number of the most inflammatory anarchist works, which have always circulated in clandestine form, are only readily available online. For these, I use web addresses in my citations. For "La Ravachole," see <a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/ravachol/la-ravachole.htm" target="_blank">http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/ravachol/la-ravachole.htm</a></p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f2" href="#f2-text">2. </a>The OED defines "sensational" as follows: "Of works of literature or art hence of writers: Dealing in 'sensation', aiming at violently exciting effects. Also of incidents in fiction or real life: Calculated to produce a startling impression." As these terms ("violently exciting effects," "startling impression") indicate, it appears to be endemic to the very definition of "sensational" to consider the personal, social, and ethical consequences of its effects. The term entered usage in the early 1860s, alongside the literary phenomenon of the sensation novel. For discussion of some of these issues, see Patrick Brantlinger, "What Is 'Sensational' about the 'Sensation Novel'?", <span style="font-style:italic;">Nineteenth-Century Fiction</span> 37, no. 1 (June 1982): 1–28; Ann Cvetkovich, <span style="font-style:italic;">Mixed Feelings: Feminism, Mass Culture, and Victorian Sensationalism</span> (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1992); and D. A. Miller, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Novel and the Police</span> (Berkeley: University of California Press,1988).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f3" href="#f3-text">3. </a>My interest in this paper centers on the extensive, public ramifications and representations of dynamite violence. Hence I discuss works, for the most part, which circulated beyond the immediacy of radical circles: published fiction, essays, and manifestoes; journalistic accounts from the mainstream press; and anarchist memoirs. For analysis of the way anarchism was represented in the mainstream press, see Haia Shpayer-Makov, "Anarchism in British Public Opinion 1880–1914," <span style="font-style:italic;">Victorian Studies</span> 34, no. 4 (Summer 1988): 487–516.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f4" href="#f4-text">4. </a>Dynamite was also associated with Fenians, who preceded anarchists in their usage of it. But over time, and in a broader international context, it was anarchists who became most closely and completely associated with dynamite violence.</p></div>

A large majority of the works I will be discussing take the masculine gender of the anarchist for granted. However, women were present in the anarchist movement to no small degree—Emma Goldman in America being the most famous—and dynamite fiction of the period often had a marked gender theme (with beautiful women anarchists, for example, featured as seductresses). For discussion of women and radical movements of the period, see Marsh, <span style="font-style:italic;">Anarchist Women</span>, Paul Avrich, <span style="font-style:italic;">Anarchist Portraits</span> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1988), 214–228, and on Goldman in particular, Candace Serena Salk, <span style="font-style:italic;">Love, Anarchy, and Emma Goldman</span> (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1990) and Bonnie Haaland, <span style="font-style:italic;">Emma Goldman: Sexuality and the Impurity of the State</span> (Montreal: Black Rose Books, 1993).</p></div>

Berkman's masculinism is not unique among male anarchists. Despite anarchism's opposition to social codes and laws, and its affinities with nihilism—a movement with a strong feminist tenet—anarchists often look conventional when it comes to gender.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f39" href="#f39-text">39. </a>In later works, we might note, Berkman attempts to mute this furor, and to place violence in a more balanced position with respect to anarchism's goals and methods. As he writes in 1926, "You have heard that Anarchists throw bombs, that they believe in violence, and that Anarchy means disorder and chaos . . . No, my friend, it is capitalism and government which stand for disorder and violence. Anarchism is the very reverse of it; it means order without government and peace without violence" (Alexander Berkman, <span style="font-style:italic;">What is Anarchism?</span> [Edinburgh: AK, 2003], 138).</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f53" href="#f53-text">53. </a>Conrad may have been thinking here of a notorious essay published in 1892 in the primary anarchist journal in England, <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonweal</span>, with the suggestive title "An Anarchist Feast at the Opera." The essay gleefully imagined the probable effects of a bomb being exploded in the London opera house, including reflections on the smell of bourgeois flesh burning and the like.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f54" href="#f54-text">54. </a>It seems likely that Conrad came upon the narrative of the Greenwich bombing as the brainchild of the Russian embassy, frustrated with Britain's lax laws and hoping to goad public opinion, from Ford Madox Ford, who appears to have heard such rumors from his anarchist connections. More generally, the problem of <span style="font-style:italic;">agents provacateurs—</span>of identifying and punishing them, and of continuing to function despite their infiltration of the movement—became a preoccupation among anarchists in the 1890s and beyond.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f60" href="#f60-text">60. </a>A number of critics have observed the split quality of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>. In an oft-cited critique, Irving Howe argues that the turn to Winnie's drama in the second part of the novel catalyzes a form of parody that turns the whole panorama into a kind of grim urban puppet show (Howe, <span style="font-style:italic;">Politics and the Novel</span>). More recently, two excellent feminist critiques have worked from the observation of a fundamental shift in the novel, in both style and thematics, as the detective novel cedes to the domestic novel. See Wendy Moffat, "Domestic Violence: The Simple Tale within <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>," <span style="font-style:italic;">ELT</span> 37, no. 4 : 465-489, and Rishona Zimring, "Conrad's Pornography Shop," <span style="font-style:italic;">MFS</span> 43, no. 2 : 319-348.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f61" href="#f61-text">61. </a>Conrad opens <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span> with the issue of protection; as Verloc walks out for his morning interview with Vladimir, he thinks complacently of his own role in protecting the citizens of London. Conrad's irony is palpable in this sequence, yet the notion of "vigilance," which is repeatedly invoked in the novel's opening chapters, taps into a wider Victorian preoccupation with policing, both within the confines of "home" and in the imperial domain. For discussion of these issues, see Miller, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Novel and the Police</span>, David Philips, <span style="font-style:italic;">Crime and Authority in Victorian England: the Black Country, 1835-1860</span> (London: Croom Helm, 1977); Bernard Porter, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Origins of the Vigilant State</span> (London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1987); and Philip Thurmond Smith, <span style="font-style:italic;">Policing Victorian London: Political Policing, Public Order, and the London Metropolitan Police</span> (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1985). With respect to the question of foreignness within the national space, one might point to the scene in the novel in which the Assistant Commissioner wanders through Soho, dining at an Italian restaurant. For discussion of this sequence, see Joseph McLaughlin, <span style="font-style:italic;">Writing the Urban Jungle: Reading Empire in London from Doyle to Eliot</span> (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 2000), 133-167.</p></div>

He writes, for instance: "The narrative . . . goes against the melodramatic grain of the subject matter. The course of action does not resolve the conflicts but makes them more complex and ambiguous; instead of simple contrasts we are faced with manifold deceptions, misunderstandings and ambiguities." What is missing in Najder's generally astute argument is a sense of generic mixture: the search for pure melodrama, or pure irony for that matter, seems quixotic.

<p>"Ineluctable modality of the visible": when Margaret Anderson first read these opening words in Joyce's manuscript of "Proteus," she cried, "This is the most beautiful thing we'll ever have."<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Even newcomers to <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, fearful of those big words that make us so unhappy, find the music of these fourteen syllables entrancing. The opening paragraphs of "Proteus" encompass Stephen's famous philosophical experiment, in which he closes his eyelids to test whether the world continues to exist when he cannot see it. "Shut your eyes and see," he tells himself, perhaps in reminiscence of Tiresias, the prophet who could see more clearly for being blind.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> Stephen's feet provide the answer to his metaphysical doubts: "Stephen closed his eyes to hear his feet crush crackling wrack and shells" (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 3:10–11). Although Stephen's eyelids possess the power to blink the visible away, he has no earlids to resist the "crackling" of the audible. Is sound therefore more ineluctable than sight?</p>
<p>Many critics argue that the ear predominates over the eye in Joyce's work, although Sara Danius has recently contended that sight prevails over the other senses in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> This critical debate re-enacts a struggle waged in Joyce's works themselves, in which the rival modalities of ear and eye are constantly competing for supremacy. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> this struggle is played out by Stephen and Bloom, who tend to be aligned with sound and sight respectively. Stephen's ears are sharper than his eyes, whereas Bloom takes refuge in the realm of sight in order to escape the din of Irish masculinity. My contribution to "The Sounds of Joyce" examines how Joyce, in both <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span>, plays with the opposition between voice and writing, sight and sound. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  In particular, Joyce draws our attention to the noises of language, the acoustic detritus that cannot be assimilated into meaning or intention.</p>
<p>Returning to the opening words of "Proteus," note that it is not the visible as such, but its modality, its form or structure, which Stephen describes as "ineluctable." The visible, he muses, is "thought through my eyes" (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 3:1–2). In this context "thought" could be understood as either a noun or a past participle, which opens up a range of possible interpretations: I think with my eyes; my eyes think; or thought enters through my eyes. In any case Stephen endorses the Kantian premise that seeing is predicated on thinking, specifically on the mental forms of time and space. "My eyes do not see it: they think it rather than see," Joyce wrote in the earliest extant version of the passage.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Yet Stephen must also be aware that Aristotle attributes the capacity for thought to the ear rather than the eye. Vision is the superior sense for "the primary wants of life," Aristotle affirms, but hearing "contributes most to the growth of intelligence."</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>For rational discourse is a cause of instruction in virtue of its being audible . . . since it is composed of words, and each word is a thought-symbol. Accordingly, of persons destitute from birth of either sense, the blind are more intelligent than the deaf and dumb.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Putting this premise to the test, Stephen shuts his eyes to find out if he is smarter in the dark.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is un-Aristotelian of Stephen to salute the visible before he even begins to contemplate the audible. In the sequence of his reverie, seeing precedes hearing as lightning precedes thunder, and it is only when his eyes are shut that the ear begins to reassert its claims. This sequence associates the audible with the wake, the afterwards, the echoes that reverberate with each of Stephen's belated, quotation-laden thoughts. Thus the audible is relegated to the second sense; but it is worth remembering that the modality of the visible must be painfully obscure to the myopic Stephen. There is no mention of his spectacles in "Proteus," and without them he is liable to be pandied by every obstruction in his path, to knock his sconce against unseen impediments. Stephen's ashplant "sword," like Joyce's walking-stick, is more than a dandyish accoutrement; it works as an antenna to ascertain the ground beneath his feet. "Tap with it; they do," Stephen counsels himself as he shuts his eyes, thinking of the blind who tap their way with canes, "getting on nicely in the dark" (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 3:16–17). For Joyce himself, growing blinder with every year, the modality of the visible was far from ineluctable.</p>
<p>While Stephen hears better than he sees, Bloom enlists the visible as a defense against the audible. Throughout Bloom's odyssey, the world of sound is monopolized by noisy men: the songsters of "Sirens," the orators of "Aeolus," the hectoring Citizen of "Cyclops" with his snarling cur and foulmouthed commentator.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Time and again Bloom is lured to shipwreck by the sirensong of Dublin's drunken vainglorious louts, who are already drowning in noise and alcohol. In "Sirens," the male barflies indulge in a singing contest, their voices "soaring high, high resplendent, aflame, crowned, high in the effulgence symbolistic." Ben Dollard's "base barreltone" voice earns the notorious <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  tribute from Simon Dedalus: "Sure, you'd burst the tympanum of her ear, man . . . with an organ like yours."<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> While the singers in "Sirens" compete for vocal prowess, the newsmen in "Aeolus" compete for the heights of rhetoric, culminating in John F. Taylor's high-flown account of Moses's ascent of "Sinai's mountaintop" (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 11:747–8; 7:867). Incidentally it was this oration that Joyce chose for his own performance of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, recorded in 1924.</p>
<p>In both "Aeolus" and "Sirens," Bloom resists the phallic temptations of the rising voice by resorting to the modality of the visible, specifically by fixing his attention on the alphabet. In "Sirens" he eludes the voices of the singers by writing a letter to Martha Clifford, in which he signs his pseudonym Henry Flower with inaudible Greek E's. In "Aeolus" Bloom's thoughts turn "orthographical" as he watches the typesetter lining up the letters backwards on the printing press, the action reminding Bloom of his Jewish father reading Hebrew right to left (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 7:164; 203–7). In the noisy world of Dublin journalism, Bloom's reverie of reading backwards offers an escape-route from the forward thrust of the phallic voice.</p>
<p>By choosing writing over voice, Bloom behaves like a deconstructionist <span style="font-style:italic;">avant la lettre</span>, his silent Greek E's anticipating the inaudible "a" that Derrida interpolates in "<span style="font-style:italic;">differance</span>." Bloom resists the singers' "fiddlefaddle about notes," which he discounts as a failed "attempt to talk," by championing words over music (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 11:1195–6). But the heroic fart with which he crowns his getaway subverts the opposition between voice and writing, since the fart is itself a kind of voice, the voice of "peristalsis," whose rude noises alert us to the flatulence of speech itself.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Transliterated as "Pprrpffrrppfff," the fart reminds us of the puffing, spitting, wheezing, spluttering obscenity of voice, the slurp, gurgle, smack of breath, lips, tongue, teeth, saliva (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 1292).</p>
<p>Such noises represent the bodily remainder of the voice that cannot be assimilated into speech or song; they neither make sense nor gratify the ear, nor do they "go up in smoke" when the message or the music has been taken in.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Bloom's fart exposes the stuff that voice is made of, the visceral noise that both facilitates and interferes with the communicative function of speech. That noise is the "dangerous supplement" of speech, the excess that conceals the "gap" or lack implicit in the voice itself. In a characteristic ruse of self-defense, Bloom projects this gap onto women's voices: "Gap in their voices. . . Fill me. I'm warm, dark, open. . . Play on her. . . Body of white woman, a flute alive. . . Three holes, all women."<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>"Three holes," however, is an understatement in "Sirens," given the chapter's fascination with the unprotected portals of the ear, two orifices that raise the score of holes from three to five. Of mermaids Bloom wonders, "Why do they hide their ears with seaweed hair?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 11:941). Perhaps they do so to protect these holes against the voice that bursts the tympanum of the ear. This voice creates gaps by deflowering the channels of the ear, and it also issues from a gap—the warm, dark, open cavity of the mouth. This is the gap that gapes in Caravaggio's open-mouthed <span style="font-style:italic;">Medusa</span>, Munch's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Scream</span>, or Francis Bacon's screaming popes, paintings in which terrifying oral cavities threaten to swallow the spectator. Furthermore, the voice hollows out a gap between speaker and speech, severing the latter from its source. Speech and speaker <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  never fully coincide: there is always an element of ventriloquism in the voice that we hear ourselves uttering.</p>
<p>This disjunction between voice and speaker is exaggerated in the cinema, which splits narrative into visible image and audible soundtrack, thus deepening the gap between these two modalities. Film theorist Michel Chion uses the term "acousmatic" to describe the voice whose source one cannot see, a voice whose cinematic paradigm is the dead mother's voice in Hitchcock's <span style="font-style:italic;">Psycho</span>. Similarly, the Old Testament God manifests himself as an acousmatic voice; a trait he shares with many other deities, for the voice that comes from nowhere seems to come from everywhere, conferring omnipotence on its unseen source (Dolar, 60–6). In the "Nestor" episode Stephen confirms this link between the acousmatic voice and the divine when he defines God as "a shout in the street"—but with the caveat that Stephen is alluding to the offstage voices of schoolchildren at play; a demotic rejoinder to Jehovah's acousmatic monologue (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 2:386).</p>
<p>When the sacred voice is "disacousmatized," as Chion puts it, or pinned down in a body, the deity loses his charisma. Witness the Wizard of Oz, whose voice is disacousmatized when Toto knocks over the screen, revealing a little old man with a bald head and a wrinkled face, begging Dorothy and her companions not to hurt him. Chion describes disacousmatization as a vocal striptease that culminates in the revelation of the orifice from which the voice proceeds, the open mouth. Yet the voice that emanates from this black hole cannot be assigned to the lips, tongue, teeth, or oral cavity; or to the hidden organs of the larynx or the lungs; or even to the sea-surge of the blood that Bloom contemplates in "Sirens."<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> The voice, as Mladen Dolar has contended, "ties language to the body, but the nature of this tie is paradoxical: <span style="font-style:italic;">the voice does not belong to either</span>" (Dolar, 72). Munch's painted scream, which silences the voice and thereby deafens the spectator, reveals the poignant truth that the scream cannot be answered because we never really know where it is coming from.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> Bloom's odyssey begins with Molly's disembodied sleepy grunt, an acousmatic "Mn" emanating from an unseen bedroom. Just before this noise is registered, Bloom overhears his own voice as if it belonged to someone else:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>He said softly in the bare hall:<br>—I'm going round the corner. Be back in a minute.<br>And when he had heard his voice say it he added:<br>—You don't want anything for breakfast?<br>A sleepy soft grunt answered:<br>—Mn.</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 4:52–7)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Molly's "Mn" is only reunited with her "full lips" after Bloom returns from the butcher with his kidney (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 4:315). Her last words in "Calypso," when she welcomes the cat (as opposed to her husband) into bed, are also presented acousmatically: "Listening, [Bloom] heard her voice:—Come, come, pussy. Come" (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 4:471–2). On first reading, "her" voice seems to belong to the cat, rather than to Molly, since this female cat has <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  just been mewing plaintively at Bloom. The pronominal confusion underscores the ghostly independence of acousmatic voices from their speakers.</p>
<p>A propos of cats, an intriguing exploration of the acousmatic voice may be found in May Swenson's poem "The Secret in the Cat" , in which the speaker takes her cat apart to see what makes him purr.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Stanza by stanza she opens up his throat, chest, skull, and belly, to find the source of the elusive sound, but finds no wire, humming throttle, whisk or rattle. In Kleinian terms, the cat's dismemberment could be interpreted as a rampage on the mother's body in search of the treasures it contains, specifically the maternal voice, a voice whose source the infant cannot see, and hence "the mother of all acousmatic voices" (Dolar, 66). When Swenson cannot find the purr inside the cat, she wonders if the sound is coming from outside, the cat vibrating like "a tuning fork?—amplifier?—telegraph?" and picking up "some radar code" or unseen frequency.</p>
<p>The same questions pertain to the human voice. Does it come from inside or outside? Is it secreted from the body, or is it poured into the channels of the ear? Is the body nothing but an empty vessel resounding with the words of others? "Empty vessels make most noise," Bloom quips in "Sirens."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> The answer to these questions is that the voice is both too inside and too outside: too inside, because it erupts out of the viscous depths of corporeality, like the voice of the corpse in Poe's 1845 story "The Facts of the Case of Monsieur Valdemar" ("the voice seemed to reach our ears . . . from a vast distance, or from some deep cavern within the earth . . . it impressed me . . . as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress the sense of touch"); but also too outside, because the voice ventriloquizes the body rather than belonging to it.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Thus the voice is doubly obscene: not only is it belched out of the entrails, but it signifies "a hidden intimacy to the Other," exposing our consenting violation by the voice that bursts the tympanum of our ears (Dolar, 80).</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span>, the modalities of the audible and the visible are personified by the brothers Shem and Shaun. These brothers are forever morphing into other twins, including the Ondt and the Gracehoper, insects aligned with the eye-world and the ear-world respectively. The ballad of the Ondt and the Gracehoper is Joyce's riposte to Wyndham Lewis, who lumped Joyce together with Pound, Eliot, and Gertrude Stein as "revolutionary simpletons" besotted by Bergson's time-cult, with its celebration of "<span style="font-style:italic;">elapse</span>" over "<span style="font-style:italic;">extense</span>," of duration in time over extension in space.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Despite their rivalry, however, Ondt and Gracehoper remain inseparable:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>A locus to loue, a term it t'embarrass,<br><span style="font-style:italic;">These twain are the twins that tick</span> Homo Vulgaris.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">A locus (locust) of space, a term (termite) of time; these are the ticks that make man tick, his clockwork set in motion by the vulgar tongue. Among a bewildering array of denotations, the verb "to tick" may mean to click, to tap, to mark, to scold, to anger, to run up debts, or to deliver a telegram by ticking. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The Ondt and the Gracehoper, together with swarms of other insects in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wake</span>, embody what the French call "parasitage," the interference or frustration endemic to audiovisual technology.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> In English the term "parasitic oscillations" is used in electronics to refer to "strays" or "atmospherics," such as the ticks in a telephone receiver, which usually involve a loss of energy. In linguistics the term "parasite" designates an intrusive sound or letter not originally present in a word, but added to or developed from an existing phonetic element. Examples given by the <span style="font-style:italic;">OED</span> include the "e" in flower and the "d" in thunder. (With regard to thunder, Joyce was not content with the addition of a single parasitic "d"; instead he renders thunder—the acousmatic voice of God as well as a celestial fart—with neologisms of a hundred letters.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a>) The Ondt and the Gracehoper, as "<span style="font-style:italic;">the twins that tic</span> Homo Vulgaris," represent the parasites (ticks) that disrupt any direct communication of the message, creating ticks like those in the telephone receiver, or verbal tics like HCE's incriminating stammer. The very pun on "tic" demonstrates the principle of <span style="font-style:italic;">parasitage</span>, the interference with the message by the medium.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span> these ticks besiege the hero's ear: "Ear! Ear! Weakear!" Earwicker's weak, defenseless ear is constantly pierced by <span style="font-style:italic;">perce-oreilles</span>, the earwigs and earworms of modern audiotechnology.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Unlike the eye, the ear is always open, and hearing therefore tends to be characterized as a passive sense, in contrast to the supposedly active, penetrative sense of vision. In hearing, the world bears in upon the self; we cannot "listen away," nor can the ear blink to defend itself from violation. To make matters worse, human beings do not hear well compared to many so-called lesser species. In particular Homo Vulgaris has difficulty judging the distance and location of the source of sound, a defect one feels acutely when hearing the crescendo of a siren without knowing where the police are coming from.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> For this reason, sound is "a ringing, clanging scandal," according to Emmanuel Levinas. "Whereas, in vision, form is wedded to content . . . in sound the perceptible quality overflows so that the form can no longer contain its content. A real rent is produced in the world . . ."<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>This rent produces "schizophonia," the separation of sound from source, which Murray Shaffer identifies as the distinctive feature of the modern soundscape, with all its mechanical extensions of the voice: the radio, the soundtrack, the hifi, the PC.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> This rampant schizophonia means that ventriloquism—in which the voice appears to emanate from somewhere other than its source—is the precondition of modern life, rather than a trivial, amusing sideshow. Derrida has emphasized the loss of origin inherent in the act of writing, but ventriloquism demonstrates that speech is equally susceptible to dispossession. As soon as we hear ourselves speak, we split into two warring twins, a speaker and a hearer, and it is the hearer who puts words into the speaker's mouth, as a ventriloquist projects a voice into a dummy.</p>
<p>Ventriloquism goes back to the beginning of Joyce's writing: it features, for example, in the phenomenon that Kenner calls "the Uncle Charles principle," or free indirect discourse, in which the narrative voice is hijacked by the voices of the characters.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> The most spectacular example of ventriloquism occurs in "Circe," where voices ricochet from every surface of Bella Cohen's brothel, as well as from parental ghosts, abstractions, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and hypotheticals such as "The End of the World." The "Circe" episode could be seen as a trial run for the pan-ventriloquism of <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span>, in which voices emanate from rocks and stones and trees, as well as from the hitherandthithering waters of the Liffey. Joyce's professed intention in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wake</span> to "liberate all sounds from their servile, contemptible role" implies that the sounds become the masters rather than the servants of the speakers, while the speakers are transformed into the dummies of the sounds.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>During the years that Joyce was writing <span style="font-style:italic;">Work-in-Progress</span>, as James Connor has pointed out, "radio air was full of noises, wandering signals, high altitude skips, and super-heterodyne screeches, and [those] who listened to it had to gradually attune themselves to a cacophony of voices all speaking at once." Many voices require many readers: it is difficult to read the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wake</span> alone, and by demanding group reading the novel resurrects the oral tradition of group listening. The familiar image of a 1930s family gathered around a massive radio, struggling to decipher sense from noise, preres the reading groups that now assemble around the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wake</span>, readers having discovered that four ears are better than two, not to mention several hundred eyes, for navigating these uncharted waters.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Joyce's writings restage Stephen's philosophical experiment in "Proteus" by pitting the visible against the audible. The visible is the modality of space and writing, whereas the audible is the modality of time and voice. While writing necessarily escapes the writer to embark on independent odysseys, like the verbal flotsam that meanders down the River Liffey in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, speech tends to be regarded as inseparable from the speaker. Joyce, however, fractures speech from speaker, song from singer, by drawing our attention to the noises in the voice, the parasitic interference in the utterance. As we have seen, the voice that erupts out of the body cannot be identified with any of its organs—tongue, teeth, mouth, lungs, vocal cords—although these organs taint the voice with burps and slurps and other viscous intimations of mortality. Nor can the body protect the voice from the incursions of ventriloquism, or from the strays and atmospherics of the modern soundscape. In the schizophonic racket of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wake</span>, the voice functions as a radio-receiver, transmitting ticks from all the imagined corners of the globe. As readers, we become gracehopers, channel-hopping between sight and sound in search of a stable frequency amidst the noise.</p>

<div id="body">
<p>Although the past two hundred years have witnessed a host of efforts to conceptualize the extraordinary intensity and scale of military operations in the post-Napoleonic era, no agreement has been reached about whether the distinctiveness of modern warfare should primarily be regarded as a product of economic, political, or technological change. Nor has a consensus emerged as to what is at stake ideologically in treating modern conflicts as inherently more devastating than earlier ones. In these discussions, the First World War has consistently enjoyed paradigmatic status as a world-historical event of unparalleled consequences. Heralded as the original industrialized slaughter in which the boundary between the military and the civilian was all but completely dissolved, the "Great War" has also been accorded enormous cultural significance as "the moment in which the new sensibility of English—and international—modernism comes fully into existence."<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> For different reasons, the Cold War has come to be viewed as uniquely formative, as well. Characterized by the efforts of its central protagonists to avoid a full-blown confrontation, this new form of permanent strife impacted every sector of society; yet it was a war based not on sustained hostilities, but on the mutual ability of the US and the USSR to maintain the threat of a nuclear exchange that neither could survive.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>At first glance, these two models of "all-pervasive" conflict appear to be diametrically opposed. The former depicts modern warfare as omnipresent, unrestrained violence, whereas the latter presents us with the constant menace of imagined violence, a possibility that can never be permitted to become a reality. In both cases, however, war is distinguished by its unlimited, and potentially interminable, nature. The thesis of this essay is that a better account of the far-reaching, often paradoxical influence <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of these two archetypes of combat is essential for understanding how major military events have shaped and continue to shape the cultural and historical consciousness of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. One of the only authors to have grasped the full implications of these dynamics, I argue, is William Faulkner. In his novel <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>, set in Western France late in World War One, Faulkner reflects on the interplay between totality and permanence that defines the experience of a world continuously at war, offering a new vantage point from which to reconsider the ideological legacy of 1914–1918 as both the "war to end all wars" and the founding of modern military culture.</p>
<p>It is by no means clear that <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> is primarily concerned with the war it overtly depicts. In proposing that nations depend on a deadlocked stalemate with their foes for their very existence, the book, written between 1944 and 1953, situates itself within the political climate that emerged in the US following the Second World War, when the interdependence of military and industrial interests became quasi-official government policy. As Noel Polk has argued:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Though set during World War I, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> is really a meditation on the state of the world following World War II—it is a Cold War novel which dramatizes the inextricability of the military hierarchy from the political and economic and cultural hierarchies that run the world's nations, hierarchies that know no political boundaries and often connive with each other to insure their own survival, no matter the cost in blood to the expendable grunts who form the teeming masses of those whose lives are in their control.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">This interpretation is persuasive when one considers the regularity with which the soldiers in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> identify an abstract entity termed "greed" as the controlling force in their lives. Human combatants are repeatedly presented as existing solely in order to serve the war machine, which in turn obeys the injunctions of a military-capital logic that rapaciously demands ceaseless conflict. At the same time, the thematic prominence of World War One in Faulkner's corpus rivals even his interest in the Civil War.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> In neglecting to ask why the First World War has been chosen to stand in for the Cold War, Polk overlooks a major concern of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>: How and why does the capacity to generate fictional visions of wars not yet waged become a central feature of the modern war machine? In what follows, I show that in representing the ultimate "non-shooting" war with the ultimate "shooting war," Faulkner reveals that the real legacy of the Great War lies not in its status as the standard of pure destructiveness against which all subsequent clashes must be compared, but in the way it alters the judging of military achievements such that future triumphs or defeats have to be assessed with reference to a hypothetical "super conflict" that may never come to pass. This shift in the evaluation of military ventures comes to fruition in the Cold War, where visions of apocalyptic scenarios become the medium of combat itself. By juxtaposing a period of relatively indirect conflict with the full-blown slaughter of World War One, Faulkner brings to the fore the degree to which military praxis is always as much a virtual as an actual struggle. Carl von Clausewitz's claim that the theory of warfare always leads to extremes thus finds a twentieth-century parallel in the perceived need for all war machines to establish a vision of what the ultimate war would look like.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> also suggests that uncertainties about what is meant by a modern war's "finality" unsettle the paradigm of agency on the basis of which military campaigns can be characterized as the deeds of individuals or groups. The novel's challenge to traditional conceptions of military praxis is crystallized in its re of the Unknown Soldier, who is presented as the exemplar of wartime subjectivity, as if the modern combatant were best understood with reference to an indefinite, ultimately unidentifiable entity. In this way, Faulkner offers an important alternative to the proto-fascist conceptions of the warrior-soldier that came to predominate in European military theory after 1918. Written at the height of the Cold War, his book thus seeks to articulate critical resources with which to combat ideologies of total and permanent war while at the same time casting new light on the extraordinary cultural influence of the First World War, asking how and why it invited a rethinking of both aesthetic representation and historical agency.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>The singularity of the First World War has been characterized in a host of different ways. Scholars have described the "war to end all wars" as a watershed event because of the sheer scale of the human suffering it caused and the "unprecedented levels of financial and industrial mobilization" it precipitated.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> For the first time, no inhabitant of a warring nation lived or worked outside the war effort. Of course, such absolute claims beg for qualification. Many of the elements that appear to make World War One unique were already present in nineteenth-century conflicts. The Boer, Crimean, and American Civil Wars have frequently been identified as key forerunners because they saw the deployment of industrial technology for mass slaughter and unparalleled risks for civilians. If one looks prior to the second half of the nineteenth century, it can be argued that the Napoleonic Wars witnessed a greater expansion in the scale of battle than the First World War, and the religious wars of seventeenth-century Europe offer a still earlier example of the dissolution of the distinction between military and civilian life.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Turning to events after 1918, the Second World War would appear to overshadow its predecessor. At least thirty million civilians died between 1939 and 1945 as numerous nations had their infrastructures crippled or obliterated, whereas World War One was largely a rural conflagration that left Europe's cities standing and its populations intact.</p>
<p>Debates about the cultural significance of the First World War have followed a similar pattern. Some scholars have championed the formative role of the Great War in modern aesthetics, while others have maintained that it was merely one stage in a larger developmental process. What is indisputable is that no major conflict before or since has prompted as much discussion of the relationship between a military operation and its influence, or lack thereof, on the aesthetic production of an era. For many, modernism <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> a reflection on the events of 1914–1918. As Allyson Booth has recently argued in <span style="font-style:italic;">Postcards from the Trenches</span>: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>[E]ven at moments when the spaces of war seem most remote, the perceptual habits appropriate to war emerge plainly; the buildings of modernism may delineate spaces within which one is forced to confront both war's casualties and one's distance from those casualties; the dislocations of war often re centrally in modernist forms, even when war itself seems peripheral to modernist content.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Even if one accepts this account of the radical scope of the First World War's influence, the precise contours of its legacy are far from self-evident. The claim that the war impacted the artists and writers who lived through it is presumably uncontroversial. At the same time, it is easy to observe that a number of what are today regarded as the most significant works of modernist literature were written well before the onset of major hostilities on the Continent, just as cubism, abstract expressionism, and atonal music were underway long before the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. From here, it is only a small step to suggest that World War One was merely a phase in the rise of modernism, not its formative moment. In this vein, it has been argued that the very notion of a rupture in aesthetic paradigms at the beginning of the twentieth century has been overstated and that despite the social upheaval of the war, the literary and artistic practices of the time did not exhibit the radical break with traditional forms sometimes attributed to them.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> If militarily the First World War can be said to continue longstanding trends, its supposed impact on culture can also be viewed from the standpoint of broader dynamics.</p>
<p>Whatever one's position on the First World War's historical or cultural singularity, these disputes clearly turn on the coherence of developmental models of change. In this regard, Roger Chickering has criticized modern military scholars for relying almost exclusively on a romantic coming-of-age story in which the maturation process of "total war" begins with the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Era and culminates in Hiroshima, each of the key features of total war—the size of armies, the mobilization of entire economies for the war effort, improvements in killing technologies—gradually becoming manifest.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> If there is much to applaud in Chickering's critique, it is essential to recognize that the discourse on "total war" itself only comes into its own in the wake of the horrors of 1914–1918. The real question, then, is not whether World War One was the first military event to realize a new standard of destructiveness or whether it was uniquely influential for the artists and writers who reflected on it, but why it was this war that served as the impetus for the modern theorization of total war. In other words, what cultural, political, or military dynamics dictated that in the twentieth century it would become necessary to pursue state conflict in the name of "total," or "less-than-total," war?</p>
<p>The most prominent theorist of total war after 1918 was the German general Erich Ludendorff. Ludendorff did not publish his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Der totale Krieg</span> until 1935, but as early as 1919 he wrote that "it was impossible [in the First World War] to distinguish where the sphere of the army and navy began and that of the people ended."<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Ludendorff's concern in reflecting on the recent struggle was to show that the German war effort—which he had largely directed from 1917–1918—had not been absolute enough; and he sought to make the case for a still broader mobilization of Germany's <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  human resources if the next war was to end in victory rather than defeat.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> The term "total war" thus came to serve as a name for a missed opportunity rather than a conflict that had actually transpired. Ludendorff presented past failures as the impetus for conceiving of something more extreme.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Ludendorff's vision of a truly "total" military clash was paralleled by other theorists of the interwar period, most notably the Italian advocate of airpower and strategic bombing Giulio Douhet. In 1921, Douhet proposed that "the prevailing forms of social organization have given war a character of national totality—that is, the entire population and all the resources of the nation are sucked into the maws of war. And since society is now definitely evolving along this line, it is within the scope of human foresight to see now that future wars will be total in character and scope."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> These sentiments were echoed by Ernst Jünger, who in his 1930 essay "Total Mobilization" declared that "in this unlimited marshalling of potential energies, which transforms the warring industrial countries into volcanic forges, we perhaps find the most striking sign of the dawn of the age of labor."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Jünger's remarks reveal that the nascent discourse of total war was informed by the notion that in World War One soldiering had been normalized as a routine, day-to-day economic activity, while factory and farm work had become forms of soldiering. Jünger writes:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>[F]ollowing the wars of knights, kings, and citizens we now have wars of <span style="font-style:italic;">workers</span>. [T]he image of war as armed combat merges into the more extended image of a gigantic labor process. In addition to the armies that meet on the battlefields, originate the modern armies of commerce and transport, foodstuffs, the manufacture of armaments—the army of labor in general. In the final phase . . . there is no longer any movement whatsoever—even that of the homeworker at her sewing machine—without at least indirect use for the battlefield.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The manner in which Jünger underscores the everyday quality of war is striking. In his terms, "total war" is the name for a situation in which labor in the service of international conflict is no longer perceived as an exceptional activity; it has acquired a permanence that makes it the norm. From this perspective, the legacy of the First World War is not its extraordinary degree of destructiveness, but the way in which it enshrined the mass support of state-sponsored struggles as a feature of the modern workplace. At the moment warfare became unspeakably horrific, the complete militarization of existence became a commonplace.</p>
<p>The point is not that between 1914 and 1918 the boundary between combatant and non-combatant disappears for the first time. In the military-economic ideologies that emerge after the Great War, the paradigm of the soldier-laborer transcends any particular manifestation of work such that the material praxis of war comes to supersede the very opposition between production and destruction. One consequence is that war can no longer be distinguished from peace by the presence (or absence) of violence. The idea of total war established in the wake of the First World War thus preres the Cold War by establishing a conceptual field in which possible and actual combat, threatened and realized aggression, are equally important dimensions of the war effort.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The question is whether this challenge to the very distinction between war and peace is an inherently regressive development, or if it can in fact prove to be the basis for a more progressive model of individual or collective agency. Precisely such a reflection on the ideologies of military praxis is at the heart of Faulkner's <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>, which begins by asking whether inactivity in war is as crucial as the most systematic forms of killing. The novel, which takes place during a week in France near the end of the First World War, focuses on the circumstances surrounding a mutiny and its unexpectedly drastic consequences. The narrative is punctuated by a series of conversations between combatants who ponder the loss of individual volition within the broader military-industrial dynamic that governs their existence. At first glance, the characters appear to affirm the idea that clashes between nations are driven by the overarching interests of wealth. Guided by greed, war takes priority over the people who t it, the ideals they may hope to protect, and even the notion of a foe itself. As one officer explains: "It's not we who conquer each other because we are not even ting each other. It's simple nameless war which decimates our ranks."<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Cast in these terms, war is not an act of destruction but the perpetuation of life: "'The Boche doesn't want to destroy us,' said the Corps Commander, 'any more than we would want, could afford, to destroy him. Can't you understand: either of us, without the other, couldn't exist?'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FA</span>, 24). This delicate balance between mutually assured survival and mutually assured destruction conditions the plot throughout, forcing us to ask whether the most important events are the ones that happen or those that do not.</p>
<p>Whether he is writing about the American Civil War or later conflicts in Europe, it has been argued that Faulkner is more interested in the repercussions of war on the home front and in war's aftermath than in the travails of modern ting.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Consistent with this observation, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> has relatively little to say about the horrors of machine guns or poison gas attacks. Scenes set on the front lines unfold as if they are taking place in a stable, almost sterile environment, and even the depictions of artillery fire raining down on infantrymen assume a rather abstract tone. Given the totalizing nature of the war economy that the book examines, there is no reason to expect that it would focus exclusively on the miseries of battle, yet in fact the story does center on a bizarre turn of affairs in the day-to-day combat. On the first day of the tale, a solitary French regiment refuses orders to leave the trenches and charge across no-man's land, and as a consequence of this decision, the entire Western front comes to a standstill. "By simply declining to make an attack," one soldier explains, "one single French regiment stopped us all" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FA</span>, 62). The realization that armed combat can stop—that is, that the constant ting that is the very essence of perpetual war can be interrupted—shocks all the characters, not least because this unexpected event seems to occur effortlessly and instantaneously. Officers and enlisted men alike struggle to come to terms with the uncanny event by attempting, alternatively, to punish the mutineers, to celebrate or repeat the original ceasefire, or simply to recount what has transpired in new ways in an effort to situate the act within a teleological schema they can respond to or dismiss. Ultimately, Faulkner's characters are unsure whether the soldiers' non-attack should be considered an act at all. "At dawn yesterday," one officer relates, "a French regiment <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  did something—or failed to do something which a regiment in a front line is not supposed to do or fail to do, and as a result of it, the entire war in Western Europe took a recess. . ." (<span style="font-style:italic;">FA</span>, 65). In declining to follow the instruction to attack, the soldiers seemingly undermine the very distinction between heeding orders and ignoring them, and their behavior proves contagious, spreading to encompass the entire army. In this fanciful fashion, a group of soldiers institutes a local strike that becomes the grounds for a general strike, fulfilling, at least for a moment, the pacifist dream of a declaration of war that no one obeys.</p>
<p>If this impromptu strike would seem to suggest that the rank and file have the power to interrupt the business of killing, it is nonetheless far from certain that their mutiny is disruptive of the dynamic of permanent war, regardless of the degree to which this recess in battle may unsettle any simple opposition between combat and a ceasefire. On an historical level, there are several analogs in the First World War for the central event of Faulkner's tale, none of which appears to have prompted a dismantling of the war machine, either from within or without. In the so-called "Christmas Truce" of 1914, soldiers from both sides spontaneously met in the no-man's land between the trenches to exchange gifts and drink toasts. This pause in ting is said to have spread from its original manifestation near Ypres to other areas along the front, famously culminating in friendly soccer matches between British and German troops.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> This story may to some extent be apocryphal, but whatever the case, the unplanned truce clearly did not precipitate a lengthy cessation of hostilities or prevent politicians and generals from continuing their campaigns. The underlying provocation of Faulkner's version of a wartime recess, then, is the suggestion that the inactivity of the mutinous regiment is so infectious that one unit could affect the entire front, and possibly the course of the entire war. It is this logic of transmission, the communicable quality of the paralysis that emerges rather than the failure to act per se, that suggests that in this novel something fundamental has gone awry in the dynamics of military agency.</p>
<p>The possibility that the mutiny may be symptomatic of a more profound disruption of wartime praxis is reinforced by the book's depictions of crowds. In the opening pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>, townspeople gather to view the captive mutineers prior to their execution.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> In light of Jünger's remarks about soldiers and workers, we might expect a novel about the First World War to dwell on the degree to which individual action has been superseded by a new form of collective agency in which particular civilians or combatants no longer enjoy privileged status as victims or heroes. Yet far from offering a reflection on mass formations and mass experience, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> seems to move in the opposite direction. In this scene and on each subsequent occasion that a crowd is on the verge of acquiring decisive energy or purpose, the group's momentum stagnates, and it winds up serving as a backdrop for the distinctive volition of a single character.</p>
<p>In this context, it is also notable that one of the first things we learn about the bizarre mutiny is that if the refusal of one regiment to attack could paralyze the entire Western Front, this was not due to the crucial part played by this unit in the campaign. According to their commanding officer, the rebels' mission was "a sacrifice already planned and doomed in some vaster scheme, in which it would not matter either way, whether the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  attack failed or not: only that the attack must be made" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FA</span>, 19). With the empty nature of the operation in mind, the commander chooses his most expendable regiment for the task, knowing that the enemy will repel them almost immediately. The mutinous soldiers' crime is not their refusal to do anything vital, but their rejection of an act that will be worthwhile only insofar as it is a sham. What those who defied orders have unwittingly declined to do is to <span style="font-style:italic;">simulate</span> an attack; they have opted out of a plan that did not rely on their ability to meet or to fail to meet a goal. Neither a "real" thrust nor a real "feint," their decision to stay put when given the order to go over the top unsettles the opposition between war as activity and war as inactivity, if not the very distinction between action and mock action, as well. The regiment is called on to sacrifice itself, but in going on strike rather than striking out against their foes, the soldiers sacrifice their own ability to serve as a sacrifice—whether a sacrifice in the name of their own interests, the army's interests, or the extra-human demands of the war machine.</p>
<p>To grasp the status of this event within Faulkner's conception of the paradoxes of military agency that arise with permanent war, we must recognize that the initial mutiny only gains its full significance at a point much later in the book when other soldiers try to repeat Monday's bizarre act of resistance but instead bring about a bloodbath. As troops from both sides venture unarmed into no-man's land, believing that they are restaging the spontaneous truce of a few days previous, they are blown to pieces by artillery set in place by the powers that be. Throughout the novel, both the illegal act of the mutineers and the unexpected consequences of their crime prompt an extraordinarily efficient response on the part of the army commanders. As if, one character notes, the top brass had been anticipating the crisis for years, immediately after the unscripted pause in ting the shells at the front lines are replaced with duds so that a German general can safely fly over for a conference with his French, British and American adversaries in which they consider how best to continue the war, laying the groundwork for the annihilation of the soldiers who will subsequently attempt to repeat the ceasefire. In disrupting the relationship between military action and its simulation, the spontaneous truce among the rank and file exposes a further level of dissimulation in which the dueling military hierarchies are foes in name alone. In the larger logic of this permanent war, genuine combat, "real" killing, can continue only after a failed effort has been made to repeat the original inaction (the "non-act") of Monday. For Faulkner, this fundamental discord between act, agency, and telos is central to the legacy of the First World War. The events of 1914–1918 force us to consider the "totality" or "permanence" of conflicts not simply in terms of ammunition expenditures and body counts, but as a dynamic in which any given act—active or passive—is consequential only once it has been shown to have gone beyond the limits of what was possible when it occurred. An act becomes part of a <span style="font-style:italic;">total</span> war by embodying an idea of conflict that is not yet conceivable, hence, the Monday mutiny becomes significant only with the failed effort to repeat it that reveals that the original was merely the semblance of a ceasefire all along.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>This basic sequence—(dis)simulation, faux repetition, destruction—dominates the novel on all levels, from local scenes to the broader chapter-to-chapter trajectory. One <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  consequence is that each major re in the story is accompanied by an imperfect counterpart, a pseudo-double who supplements the incompleteness of the original subject. The most notable example concerns the two leaders who are punished for Monday's mutiny. The Division Commander who was nominally in charge of the disobedient regiment is shot, although in a typical rehearsal of the book's dynamic of dissimulation and destruction, he has to be shot twice, once in the back and once in the front. (In between, the first bullet wound is covered up to make the execution look more honorable.) The second leader to be punished is named the Corporal. <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>, an overtly allegorical work that contains very few proper nouns, leaves no doubt that this young man is Jesus Christ. After he has finished scrounging up wine for a wedding and raising money to heal a blind woman, the Corporal and the band of twelve mutineers he heads are executed in a ritual that follows the Gospels to the letter, including a barbed-wire crown of thorns. Since the novel is set in the week before Easter Sunday, we correctly anticipate the Corporal's resurrection. Crucially, however, this occurs through a series of mishaps whereby his corpse is lost in the process of being buried and reappears when it is by chance picked up by some soldiers who have been sent to find an anonymous body that can be interred in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.</p>
<p>Tombs of the Unknown Soldier first appeared in a number of nations directly after the First World War, initially in France and Britain, then later in the US, Italy, Belgium, and Portugal.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Their emergence at this time was due to a number of different factors. The Great War had brought unprecedented casualties and the corresponding impossibility of keeping track of the fallen bodies; but it had also witnessed a new degree of bureaucratic efficiency in the form of records listing names and deployment information for each soldier. For every field littered with unidentifiable remains, there was likely to be a precise paper trail detailing who should have been there to be found.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> The impact of this disjunction was intensified by what Allyson Booth has described as the stark divide in World War One between the combatants' experience of death in the form of a landscape of omnipresent corpses and the civilian experience of death as the absence of any traces of the fallen.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> In England, newspapers were largely forbidden from publishing pictures of dead bodies, and in 1916, the British government decided that deceased combatants would not be returned for burial in the United Kingdom.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Following the Armistice, the result was a host of innovations in public mourning, all designed to cope with these new forms of absent loss. In addition to inspiring the construction of Tomb of the Unknown Soldier memorials, the First World War marked the first time that entire cemeteries were devoted solely to fallen soldiers such that the act of commemorating those killed in battle was overtly separated from the memorialization of other kinds of death. In this manner, we might say that the "Great War" became the exemplar of the war of wars because it necessitated novel social exercises in the management of mortality.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>, the Unknown Soldier is an emblem for the disruptions in military praxis that emerge in a time of permanent war. In a personal letter, Faulkner explained that some friends in Hollywood suggested to him that a story about the Unknown Soldier might be useful material for a film script.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> In a seminar with students at the University <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of Virginia, he went on to describe the evolution of what was to become the central plot detail of the novel:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The notion occurred to me one day in 1942 shortly after Pearl Harbor and the beginning of the last great war: Suppose—who might that unknown soldier be? Suppose that had been Christ again, under that fine big cenotaph with the eternal flame burning on it? That He would naturally have got crucified again, and I had to—then it became <span style="font-style:italic;">tour de force</span>, because I had to invent enough stuff to carry this notion. That's right, that was an idea and a hope, an unexpressed thought that Christ had appeared twice, had been crucified twice, and maybe we'd have only one more chance. . .<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">As melodramatic as this scenario may sound, Faulkner's comments about the novel's construction raise a number of interesting issues. His reference to "the beginning of the <span style="font-style:italic;">last</span> great war" points toward the way in which any account of a war after the "war to end wars" must confront the curious irony that every modern war presents itself as a kind of corrective to the conflicts that have preceded it, yet no war has convincingly brought the implied developmental sequence to a close. In other words, each modern war poses as the crowning achievement of a trend toward ever-greater destructiveness, but somehow the trend is never complete. In this regard, it is crucial to note that Faulkner ends the remarks cited above not with the proposal that a second opportunity to recognize the Messiah has been missed, but with the suggestion that although this second chance was not recognized, there could be "another" one. The pattern of repetition is explicitly open-ended. If there is always another "last" war, there is potentially always one more savior, or rather, one more chance to miss the savior. We have seen how total war theorists after the First World War called for the formulation of increasingly horrific scenarios of decimation. From the perspective of Faulkner's "other chance," however, a total war is distinguished by the way in which it both avers its own absolute character and implies that the acts that constitute this absoluteness may at some future point prove to be repeatable.</p>
<p>With the introduction of this unorthodox Messiah logic, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> upends a crucial feature of the iconography governing the burial of dead soldiers during the First World War. As George L. Mosse has argued, "the basic design of the English war cemetery brought to life the link between the fallen and Christian sacrifice with its hope of resurrection."<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Indeed, Mosse, continues, "the design of the war cemeteries of most countries symbolized this relationship [between the fallen soldier and Christ] just as it is shown in the wall painting that . . . depicts a fallen soldier literally sleeping in the lap of Christ."<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> In <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>, it is not possible to rely on the re of Christ as the salvation for every fallen man because Christ Himself is lost, although nobody knows that this has happened. When Faulkner's Corporal leads a mutiny, is executed, and then reappears as a corpse randomly chosen to be <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> Unknown Soldier, we witness not the return of the repressed, but the return of the unrecognized. In this drastic reversal, the leader of the people—this nobody who becomes known throughout the entire army as somebody who led a mutiny for everybody—is reborn not as the Son of God who ascends to the heavens, but as the material exemplar of the unidentified, as <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the body in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Once again, we encounter the book's insistent sequence of simulation, faux repetition, and destruction; but in this case, the destruction occurs first, that is, we have only the simulation of a non-identity and the repetition of a negation. Far from shedding his status as mortal in being resurrected as the Son of God, the Corporal Messiah returns—or quasi-returns—as an unknown man, or better, as the archetype of the unknown, as any nameless man. This strange turn of events cannot be characterized as a movement from a general term to a particular one, or vice versa. Neither everyman nor no-man, the Corporal is not really <span style="font-style:italic;">a</span> man at all, and yet, he is no more than <span style="font-style:italic;">a</span> man, either, much less <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> man.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>In Faulkner's novel, the disruption of subjective agency effected by permanent war turns Christ, the ultimate re of salvation for the fallen warrior, into a generic emblem, the Unknown Soldier, someone with whom everyone can identify precisely because nobody knows who He/he is. In this respect, the Corporal distinguishes himself as a paradigmatic agent only insofar as he functions as a re for a permanent flight from his own status as unique or ideal. In this "Great Cold War," everyone—combatants and non-combatants alike—unwittingly works toward the goal of making the Unknown Soldier the model of military agency. It is therefore not enough to say that the symbolic sacrifice of the Corporal, the heroic leader of the resistance to war, is itself sacrificed. His loss becomes the memorialization of another kind of loss, the loss of individuality wrought by war. The failed sacrifice of the Corporal to the idea of subjectivity becomes a memorial to the collapse of symbolization, and the very plan of dealing with death by making monuments to the unnamed dead becomes a testament to the radically incomplete form that military agency has assumed. In this way, the novel suggests that modern war is unique because it undermines the illustrative function of exemplarity and the very idea of using a standard—e.g., of heroism—to judge particular instances of human praxis. The most pernicious "achievement" of total war may be that it hinders the ability of any individual agent to assume a representative status for agency as such.</p>
<p>In focusing on a curious interruption in battle, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> demonstrates that war negates rather than affirms the status of the human being as an entity capable of evaluating the parameters of its own historical existence. War interpellates people as agents who have lost the ability to reflect on their own mortality, agents without a capacity to come to terms with loss. If the First World War generates unique mediums of memory—military cemeteries and Tombs of the Unknown Soldier—it also unsettles the structures of self-determination that would allow such memorials to facilitate a social engagement with the dead or with death as such. In Faulkner's vision, the monuments to the fallen mark the loss of an unknown loss (the missed Messiah) rather than the catastrophic annihilation of millions of soldiers. In this respect, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> is first and foremost an allegory of a collective failure to mourn. Far from inviting us to take the horrific conflicts of the First World War as an opportunity for individual redemption or as a warning of the greater destruction that humankind may inflict upon itself in the nuclear age, Faulkner reveals that wars are characterized as much by breakdowns in the symbolic logic of cultural self-insight—e.g., our failure to recognize Christ ("again")—as by a <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  loss of control over the exercise of violence. In <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>, total war—whether in the form of the First World War or the Cold War—is not principally a folly of politicians, generals, or businessmen; it is the moment when subjectivity itself goes on strike. If we do not learn from our mistakes in war, it is because war is an assault on our systems of self-understanding.</p>
<p>Psychoanalytic studies of the human experience of loss have suggested that it is only through pathological, and ultimately failed, forms of mourning that we can do justice to an absent Other without simply forgetting it or transforming it into a version of ourselves. In other words, a "successful" mourning is precisely a mourning that does not culminate in completely "getting over" what has been lost.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> Only by <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> coming to terms with death can we treat the demise of an individual or a group as something other than a by-product of our fantasies of our own immortality. This is not, however, what happens in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>. Insofar as the Corporal's body is interred in the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, the failure to identify the Messiah does become the grounds for a memorial to anonymous loss; but this event is neither the end of the book, nor, structurally speaking, a scene of climax, resolution, or closure. Continuing with its insistent presentation of quasi-doubles, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> ends with a ceremony for a corpse that is far from anonymous. Its final scene is the funeral, ten years after the Armistice, for the Old General, the Supreme Commander of the Allied forces during the war—and, it happens, the father of the mutinous Corporal. In echoing the interment of the son, the burial of the father makes it clear that the decisive confrontation in the novel occurs neither on a battlefield nor in a cemetery, but in an officer's chambers, when the Corporal, just prior to his execution, is brought to a hearing with his father, whom he has never met. In the book's lengthiest meditation on the long-term viability of human agency in the face of permanent war, the Old General insists to his offspring that it is folly that will save man:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>[I]t's not I but you who are afraid of man, not I but you who believed that nothing but a death can save him. I know better. I know that [man] has that in him which will enable him to outlast even his wars; that in him more durable than all his vices. . . the quality-mark and warrant of man's immortality: his deathless folly.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">FA</span>, 298)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The suggestion that human survival will be ensured by thoughtless excess or extravagance rather than by rationality or a capacity for sympathy is intriguing, but it is far from obvious precisely what this means. The Old General continues by describing a future war in which machines will take over as man retires from the field, too weak to continue to participate in battle:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>It will not be someone firing bullets at [man] who for the moment doesn't like him. It will be his own frankenstein which roasts him alive with heat, asphyxiates him with speed, wrenches loose his still-living entrails in the ferocity of its prey-seeking stoop. So he will not be able to go along with it at all, though for a little while longer it will permit him the harmless delusion that he controls it from the ground with buttons. Then that will be gone too; years, decades then centuries will have elapsed since it last answered his voice; he <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  will have even forgotten the very location of its breeding-grounds and his last contact with it will be a day when he will crawl shivering out of his cooling burrow to crouch among the delicate stalks of his dead antennae like a fairy geometry, beneath a clangorous rain of dials and meters and switches and bloodless fragments of metal epidermis, to watch the final two of them engaged in the last gigantic wrestling against the final and dying sky robbed even of darkness and filled with the inflectionless uproar of the two mechanical voices bellowing at each other polysyllabic and verbless patriotic nonsense. Oh yes, he will survive it because he has that in him which will endure even beyond the ultimate worthless tideless rock freezing slowly in the last red and heatless sunset, because already the next star in the blue immensity of space will be already clamorous with the uproar of his debarkation, his puny and inexhaustible voice still talking, still planning; and there too after the last ding dong of doom had rung and died there will still be one sound more: his voice, planning still to build something higher and faster and louder. . .</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">FA</span>, 299)</div>

<p class="continued">There is nothing original about the suggestion that technology will inexorably supplement human powers to the point that the human species will be unable to experience the violent events it has set in motion.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> It is equally common to designate World War One as the moment in which industrialized warfare evolved such that "men now battled machines."<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> More than thirty years before Faulkner's novel, Thomas Edison wrote that "if the United States engages in [this war], it will be a war in which machines, not soldiers, t. . . [T]he soldier of the future will not be a soldier, but a machinist . . ."<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Beyond simply replacing human combatants with mechanical surrogates, the aesthetics of the modernist era regularly describe a fusion between the physical and the automated. As Klaus Theweleit has written, modernism's "new individual" is "a man whose physique had been mechanized, his psyche eliminated—or in part displaced into his body armor."<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> In stark contrast to this familiar model, Faulkner presents a future in which the <span style="font-style:italic;">corps humain</span> remains profoundly fragile. Hardly cyborgs, the human beings envisioned by the Old General are even less mechanized than at present. These denizens of the future do not change in response to technocratic forces they no longer control; they simply hide. Far from facilitating a refashioning of the human physique, technical know-how threatens to replace people entirely.</p>
<p>In the extended exchange between father and son that follows, it is often difficult to discern who is saying what, and at times, the two even finish sentences for one another, as if some grander script were being played out in which they were merely reciting their lines. In this vein, the Old General's "two mechanical voices bellowing . . . polysyllabic and verbless patriotic nonsense" can be read as a description of his encounter with his illegitimate child. In fact, the General's image of mechanical voices arguably characterizes most of the conversations in the novel: military men of various ranks bully and bluster their way through debates that sound as rote and pro forma as the names of the book's characters. On the basis of this scene, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> begins to sound like a story of machines rather than people, as if the military economy of 1918—much less 1954—were already at risk of becoming too complex to be left in the hands of human beings.</p>
<p>At the start of this essay, I proposed that Faulkner's novel explores the conflicting paradigms of permanent war offered by the First World War and the Cold War. In <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the Messiah as Unknown Soldier and the Old General's critique of military nonsense, we have seen two approaches to the fundamental crisis in agency effected by modern war and its assaults on the representational logics of the human being. We have yet, however, to consider precisely what the Old General means by man's "folly." Exactly where in this monstrous mechanical din is one to hear the "enduring inexhaustible" human voice "planning still to build something higher and faster and louder"? In 1950, six years after he had begun working on <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>, Faulkner accepted the Nobel Prize in Stockholm, proclaiming:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>I decline to accept the end of man. It is easy enough to say that man is immortal simply because he will endure: that when the last ding-dong of doom has clanged and faded from the last worthless rock hanging tideless in the last red and dying evening, that even then there will still be one more sound: that of his puny inexhaustible voice, still talking. I refuse to accept this. I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance. The poet's, the writer's, duty is to write about these things. It is his privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past. The poet's voice need not merely be the record of man, it can be one of the props, the pillars to help him endure and prevail.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The Nobel address and the Old General's speech are clearly in dialogue with one another. At first glance, one might assume that the novel inverts the address's original meaning simply by citing it, turning the voice of soul and spirit into a mouthpiece of folly. The real target of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>, however, is the inexhaustibility of voice celebrated in the Nobel acceptance speech, particularly the claim that the poet's voice can be both "the record of man" and "one of the props . . . to help him endure." Faulkner's Corporal, the Messiah, the spokesman for the faceless masses who long for nothing but the end of the war, becomes a "prop"—a cornerstone of a memorial—only through a gross mistake that in a bizarre anti-transubstantiation converts his body into something to be commemorated as forgotten. In this way, the book shows that in wartime the sacred and the singular (e.g., Christ) cannot be referred to as more or less than an anonymous corpse. Moreover, in challenging the supposedly unlimited quality of human discourse, the novel also casts doubts on its own verbal capacities. The Nobel address's "inexhaustible voice" is what the Old General would call "folly." It is a voice that mistakes itself for something more foundational than it can actually be. It is a voice that is forever divided from the image it projects of itself and yet that does not thereby become a medium for memorializing loss.</p>
<p>According to the total war theorists who emerge in the wake of the First World War, the principal task of the modern warrior is to be victorious in the trenches <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> the imagination, to rule both actual wars and the visions of more horrible ones yet to come. In <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span>, such a power appears to be won only at the price of giving up on the ability to distinguish a singular event from one that is fated to be repeated again and again—be that the return of the Messiah or the killing of a nameless, faceless <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  infantryman. Does this mean that the novel offers an alternative to Jünger's fantasy of total mobilization in which the "surging forth of the masses" reveals "a new form of armament . . . one which strives to forge its weapons from purer and harder metals that prove impervious to all resistance"?<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Or should this blurring of the generic and the unique be viewed as a confusion that renders society vulnerable to the emergence of precisely the kind of collectivity Jünger or Ludendorff would celebrate?</p>
<p>Alternatively, is <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> ultimately no more than an endorsement of bourgeois individualism, its presentation of the Messiah Corporal serving as a reminder that war's fundamental horror is its disruption of the dynamics of the liberal self? In fact, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> is much more. By challenging the idea that humankind's best defense against total war is its "inexhaustible voice," the novel warns that a critique of our militarized society has to go beyond simple condemnations of the permanent war economy of the status quo if it is to avoid becoming just one more mechanical outlet babbling "verbless, patriotic nonsense." The modern war machine wages material struggles to control bodies and machines and phantasmagoric struggles to articulate visions of unthinkably destructive conflicts. In response, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> asks us to conceive of humanity's future without laying claim, like a cold-war general, to sovereignty over imaginative prophecies of impossible battles yet to come. To combat the discourses of permanent war, we must recognize that a search for "total" conflict structures our models of subjectivity just as much as it sets the agendas of our military and industrial planners. In calling on us to realize that military ideologies have as much to say about who we are as we do, Faulkner offers a glimpse of what an alternative to our thoroughly militarized culture might be.</p>

Shortly before the close of the Second World War, Charles E. Wilson (later Eisenhower's Secretary of Defense) used his stature as president of General Motors to call on American business to avoid a return to a peacetime production program, arguing that it was necessary to maintain a "permanent war economy." Today, military spending is frequently acknowledged to be a source of enormous profit, zealously protected and nurtured by politicians and captains of industry. The cooperation between governments and multinational corporations characteristic of the "military Keynesianism" of our era ensures that business interests are furthered irrespective of whether the wars pursued by states are clashes between countries or conflicts between nation-states and extra-state entities or "networks."

Thomas W. Laqueur has argued that one of the crucial innovations of the First World War was that common soldiers were no longer buried in mass graves, and elaborate efforts were made to identify their remains: "in January 1915—one can date this remarkable change with a precision not usual in cultural history—a new era of remembrance began: the era of the common soldier's name or its self-conscious and sacralized oblivion. Common soldiers ceased to be 'buried where they fell—in the fields, in the roadsides, sometimes singly, sometimes together'; it became his and his colleagues' job, writes a member of a British Red Cross unit in his war diary, 'to search for graves, identify soldiers, mark them with a cross, register their position'" (Thomas W.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f31" href="#f31-text">31. </a>The traditional understanding of the Unknown Soldier is that the re's lack of identity allows for a multiplicity of identifications that facilitate national unity through their transcendence of class and race distinctions. As G. Kurt Piehler has argued: "Why did American venerate the Unknown Soldier? In one sense, his very lack of an individual identity permitted almost everyone to claim the Unknown Soldier as his or her own" ("The War Dead and the Gold Star: American Commemoration of the First World War," <span style="font-style:italic;">Commemorations: The Politics of National Identity</span>, ed. John R. Gillis [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994], 173). Laqueur goes even further in stressing the flexibility of the re: "While the names and markers that gird the battlefields of France and Belgium cry out in their specificity, their one-to-one correspondence with a body at, or near, the place of the sign, the unknown warrior becomes in his universality the cipher that can mean anything, the bones <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  that represent any and all bones equally well or badly" ("Memory and Naming in the Great War," 158). Hannah Arendt offers a slightly different account: "The monuments to the 'Unknown Soldier' after World War I bear testimony to the then still existing need for glorification, for finding a 'who,' an identifiable somebody whom four years of mass slaughter should have revealed. The frustration of this wish and the unwillingness to resign oneself to the brutal fact that the agent of the war was actually nobody inspired the erection of the monuments to the 'unknown,' to all those whom the war had failed to make known and had robbed thereby, not of their achievement, but of their human dignity" (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Human Condition</span> [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998], 181). It is in this vein that Arendt suggests that <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fable</span> "surpasses almost all of World War I literature in perceptiveness and clarity because its hero is the Unknown Soldier" (181 n.5).</p></div>

<p>"[M]aybe the most beautiful extant recording of an unaccompanied speaking voice." That is how Douglas Wolk in a January 21, 2004 article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Seattle Weekly</span> describes the famous 1929 recording that James Joyce made of a section of "Anna Livia Plurabelle." He goes on to say, "For eight minutes, a liquid-voiced Joyce impersonates the sound of the world talking to itself: Two washerwomen chat on the banks of a river as night falls, and they turn into a tree and a stone. His Irish accent, in fact, is so thick that it's hard for an American, 75 years later, to hear the crackling recording as language, rather than as water and music."<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> This description of Joyce's prose language as sonic, as simulating the sound of music, has, of course, inspired a huge number of composers to transform it into musical compositions. Scott Klein in a superb essay on "James Joyce and Avant-garde Music" points out that Joyce's influence, as an author, on the world of modern music may be unprecedented.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> The early works, especially Joyce's poems, stimulated tonal and Romantic arrangements, and Klein cites Myra Russell as counting 140 composers who have set the poems to music. Samuel Barber not only set such poems as "I Hear an Army" to music, but in 1947, eight years after the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span>, he produced <span style="font-style:italic;">Nuvoletta</span>, inspired by the sounds of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wake</span>. However, as Klein discusses at length, <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span> chiefly influenced avant-garde composers, and John Cage's <span style="font-style:italic;">Roaratorio, An Irish Circus on 'Finnegans Wake'</span> produced in 1979, is clearly the most famous of these productions. But I would like to point to a different feature of that beautiful <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span> passage Joyce recorded in his thick Irish accent in 1929, and relate its aural qualities to an entirely different set of early twentieth-century <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  poetic practices and aesthetic concerns. Like Molly Bloom's famous soliloquy at the end of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, the dialogue of the washerwomen in "Anna Livia Plurabelle" underlines the aesthetic qualities of ordinary conversational speech, that is, the beauty of vernacular language. And in its heavily accented Irish tones, this female speech is inflected with a working class idiom and with Irish ethnicity. This semantic aspect of the sonic quality of the vernacular speech in Joyce's later work may be fruitfully related to a poetic consciousness and a poetic practice occurring across the Atlantic in Joyce's day, in the poetry of the Harlem Renaissance.</p>
<p>Modernist studies in the last decade or two have begun to attend to the importance of looking at high modernism in relation to vernacular discourses. A 2004 University of Pennsylvania dissertation by Matthew Hart titled "Synthetic Vernacular Poetry and Transatlantic Modernism 1922–2002" treats twentieth-century vernacular poetry with its attention to race, region, and nation as a response to the privileging of the internationalist current in high modernism.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> And Michael North's 1994 study <span style="font-style:italic;">The Dialectic of Modernism: Race, Language, &amp; Twentieth Century Literature</span> draws attention to the "linguistic mimicry and racial masquerade" already in practice in the discourses of high modernists such as Eliot, Pound, Stein, and William Carlos Williams.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> These studies complicate T. S. Eliot's problematic positioning of vernacular speech—and particularly of its class markers—in the famous pub passage in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>. "When Lil's husband got demobbed, I said—/I didn't mince my words, I said to her myself [. . . .] Now Albert's coming back, make yourself a bit smart./ He'll want to know what you done with that money he gave you/ To get yourself some teeth" . Although the passage is generally thought to evoke Cockney, it reproduces little of the sonic quality of a Cockney accent and marks its class chiefly in marred syntax—"what you done" rather than "what you did." The degradation of vernacular implied in this passage is reflected both in form—particularly the speaker's "un-minced" or un-sculpted words—and in its content of debased fertility and sexuality. Michael North, however, finds in high modernism traces of formal address to issues of race and vernacular culture, noting the possible influence that Joyce may have exerted on some of the Harlem Renaissance writers. Claude McKay, for example, found "a possible model in Joyce , who had transformed Irish linguistic !
 disposse
ssion into a comprehensive refashioning of English fiction" (North, 117). And in his 1999 study, <span style="font-style:italic;">Reading 1922: A Return to the Scene of the Modern</span>, North also unearths the extent to which <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> was criticized by modernist purists like Clive Bell for producing a species of jazz that turned Joyce into a kind of "ragtime" artist.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> .</p>
<p>To what extent does Joyce's prose present vernacular language as a form of musical poetry that offers an address to class, gender, and regionality in his work? And to what extent are these markings produced by sounds? The expression of regionality may seem irrelevant to a contemporary non-Irish audience, but it serves to dispel any notion of Joyce's Ireland as a monolithic culture by introducing nuances of internal diversity and specificity into Irish speech. Some of these nuances have a political significance that is capable of sonic expression in the form of the <span style="font-style:italic;">accent</span>. As early as <span style="font-style:italic;">A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</span>, Stephen Dedalus derides in his mind an Ulster classmate <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  whose Belfast accent causes him "to pronounce the word <span style="font-style:italic;">science</span> as a monosyllable."<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> And the washerwomen in the ALP chapter of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wake</span> make fun of the protean quality of HCE's pretensions and the vernacular forms they take. "And the cut of him! And the strut of him! How he used to hold his head as high as a howeth, the famous eld duke alien, with a hump of grandeur on him like a walking wiesel rat. And his derry's own drawl and his corksown blather and his doubling stutter and his gullaway swank."<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> (197.1). This recognition of regional inscription in speech on the part of the washerwomen raises the question of their own accents. Terence Killeen comments on the extent to which Joyce's mimicking of their voices in his 1929 recording either positions, or fails to position, the washerwomen regionally. According to Killeen, Joyce's accent clearly places the women in the country rather than in the city, marking them as rural but otherwise regionally ambiguous. He writes, "The accents are in fact impossible to pin down to a particular region—they are not distinctively Dublin, Cork, or Kerry, for instance. They are generalised Irish ru!
 ral acce
nts, the intonation of Galway being perhaps the closest to the voice on the recording."<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Considering that the resolutely urban character of Joyce's fictional geography set him apart from many of his contemporaries in the Celtic revival, the accents of the washerwomen may have moved Joyce's last work closer to their poetic project of regional and national language recovery. John Millington Synge discovered his Irish voice by listening to "the nuances of Aran speech" during his summers on the Aran Islands at the turn of the century, as Richard Ellmann reports.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> But although Joyce initially disparaged Synge's work, he later cast his wife Nora in Synge's <span style="font-style:italic;">Riders to the Sea</span> and encouraged the other actors to imitate "the Aran speech rhythms" in her voice (Ellmann, 440).</p>
<p>But if the Irish revival attended to the music of Ireland's diverse regions, Joyce in addition listened to the sounds of gender and class in language. The melody of Molly Bloom's thoughts in "Penelope" convey the inflections of a specifically female idiom, but one with only vaguely middle-class markings. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span>, in contrast, Joyce also inflects female speech with the markings of both class and labor. Much of the washerwomen's conversation concerns their work, exhorting each other in an alliterative idiom to do a good job—"Wallop it well with your battle and clean it" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FW</span> 196.16)—and complaining about its cost to their bodies: "My wrists are wrusty rubbing the mouldaw stains" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FW</span> 196.17). In this respect, "Anna Livia Plurabelle" borrows from the genre known as the "working song," a type of expressive vernacular composition that foregrounds the music of working class speech. This genre plays a conspicuous role in African American folk literature, and Sterling Brown in his essay on "Negro Folk Expression: Spirituals, Seculars, Ballads, and Work Songs" traces its origin to African American work songs in the field or in work on the rails.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> But the genre is also indigenous to Irish culture whose folk traditions include a specifically female variant of the working song as Nóirín Ní Riain discusses in her essay "The Female Song in the Irish Tradition."<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Like Langston Hughes, who published "Song to a Negro Wash-woman" in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span> in 1925, Joyce too celebrates this humble variant of female domestic labor, the washing of dirty linen. But unlike Hughes, who has the poet see the washerwoman singing without hearing her song,<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Joyce has his res <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  give voice to their gestures of spreading the washed linens out to dry. "Will we spread them here no!
 w? Ay, w
e will. Flip! Spread on your bank and I'll spread mine on mine. Flep! It's what I'm doing. Spread!" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FW</span> 213.21). Not only the women's conversation, sprinkled with alliteration and repetitions, but the sound of the sheets being flipped and spread is made audible in this passage. The repetition of the word "spread" spreads itself throughout their discourse.</p>
<p>The washerwomen's work song is also a song of misfortune and complaint. "Amn't I up since the damp dawn, marthared mary allacook, with Corrigan's pulse and varicoarse veins, my pramaxle smashed, Alice Jane in decline and my oneeyed mongrel twice run over, soaking and bleaching boiler rags, and sweating cold, a widow like me, for to deck my tennis champion son, the laundryman with the lavandier flannels?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">FW</span> 214.22).<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> This comic plaintive recital of troubles and exploitation is again marked by alliteration—"damp dawn," "varicoarse veins," "bleaching boiler rags," "the laundryman with the lavandier flannels," and so on. But in his book, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sound of 'Finnegans Wake</span>,' Peter Myers finds additional poetic strategies at work in passages such as this. "Perhaps the strongest single musical characteristic of 'Anna Livia' is its interplay of the interrogative, indicative and imperative moods," he writes.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> The question and answer format, even when the question is rhetorical as in the above sentence, creates its own tonal alterations, variations, and repetitions. At the same time, the washer-women's recitation of woes also groups itself into reiterated cadences—"my pramaxle smashed, Alice Jane in decline." Peter Myers points out the poetic consequence of this tendency of the discourse to divide itself into two parts joined by what he calls a "pivot." "If we read through it we shall notice that there is no simple metrical account which can explain why we should group them together. In metrical terms the phrases differ considerably; yet they create the effect of one musical motif" . At the end of <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span>, however, Joyce goes still further to invest the vernacular of the female complaint with a performative quality. At the end of the book, an old woman is out walking and talking to her silent husband about the hardships of her life. As she speaks, her!
  speech 
becomes increasingly labored with the effort, as she appears out of breath and continues only with difficulty:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>I've lapped so long. As you said. It fair takes. If I lose my breath for a minute or two don't speak, remember! Once it happened, so it may again. Why I'm all these years within years in soffran, allbeleaved. To hide away the tear, the parted. It's thinking of all. The brave that gave their. The fair that wore. All them that's gunne. I'll begin again in a jiffey. The nik of a nad. . . I only hope whole the heavens sees us. For I feel I could near to faint away. Into the deeps. Annamores leep. Let me lean, just a lea, if you le, bowldstrong bigtider. Allgearls is wea.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">FW</span> 625.27)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Joyce here conjures up the weariness of old age in the broken sound of the woman's voice, unable to finish its sentences. "Let me lean, just a lea, if you le," she says, too weak to pronounce the word weak itself—"Allgearls is wea." Yet if this is vernacular speech, performing its sense through its sound, it nonetheless manages to produce poetic tonality in the repetition of consonant and vowel sounds. "Let me lean, just a <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  lea, if you le" picked up again in "Allgearls is wea." As Peter Myers points out, "Every auditory detail, and in fact every form of repetition, whether of sound, image or anything else, can reinforce a rhythm" .</p>
<p>I would like to end by conceding a problem dramatized when any of us read Joyce's <span style="font-style:italic;">ALP</span> speeches out loud. My own poor reading of these Joyce passages—in a female, non-Irish accent—clearly violates the sonic quality that the words are intended to convey. This difficulty helps to foreground a final principle attached to the gender, class, and regional valences of Joyce's vernacular as sonic music—and that is their ultimately and paradoxically nonmaterial quality. Terence Killeen's point about the ambiguous regional inflection of the washerwomen's voices is an inference drawn from Joyce's reproduction of their sound, rather than an inference drawn from the graphological representation of written accent on the page.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Insofar as Joyce's voice is male, not-withstanding his attempted mimicry of a female voice, it necessarily fails to do sonic justice to his written vernacular text. But if even the seemingly authoritative exercise of James Joyce's own reading necessarily falsifies the imagined sound of "Anne Livia Plurabelle," then is the sound of his vernacular writing audible at all? James Joyce may give the regionality of the dialogue expression but not its gender, whereas my American female voice can produce neither the general Irish accent evoked by the piece, let alone its indeterminate rural variant. Even SiobhAn McKenna's recording of the dialogue reproduces an Irish female voice but arguably without the rural inflection of the Joyce recording. Perhaps Joyce's vernacular embeds such a layering of minority inflections into his English text that the language produces no more than a construct of speech both familiar and irrevocably marked by the difference of otherness. The elusive materiality of its sonic quality marks the barrier to our desire to imagine ourselves into the lives of these fictional creations. We can imagine the trials and pains of the washerwomen's lives as conveyed in their speech, but our empathy is reduced to a!
  crude mimicry when we try to embody it with our voice. In the end the music of Joyce's vernacular voices reminds us that throughout <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span>, what we hear is the voice of the other.</p>

<div id="article-title">A Preface to Futurism (on the 100 year anniversary of the publication of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Foundation and Manifesto of Futurism</span>)</div>
<div class="contrib"><a href="#back">Jeffrey T. Schnapp</a></div>
</div>
<div id="body">
<p>When the founding manifesto of Futurism first appeared in the Saturday, February 20, 1909 edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span>, a brief preamble was tacked on by Gaston Calmette, the managing editor:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Mr. Marinetti, the young Italian and French poet endowed with a remarkable and fiery talent [1], known throughout the Latin world thanks to his stirring performances [2] and followed by a constellation of enthusiastic disciples [3], has just founded the School of "Futurism" [4], the boldness of whose theories exceeds that of all prior and contemporary schools [5]. The <span style="font-style:italic;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">ro</span></span> has provided a platform for many of the latter [6] (and not the least outstanding among them). So, today, it presents its readers with the manifesto of the "Futurists" [7]. Needless to say, the manifesto's author assumes full responsibility for his singularly daring and extravagant ideas [8] and for their often unjust attack on eminently respectable and universally respected things [9]. Yet it seemed worthwhile to grant our readers an exclusive first look [10] at this document, irrespective of one's views regarding its merits [11].<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Properly speaking, the moment of Futurism's birth had occured four months earlier, when the following article appeared in <span style="font-style:italic;">Corriere della Sera</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>This morning, a bit before noon, F. T. Marinetti was heading down Via Domodossola in his car. The vehicle's owner was at the wheel accompanied by a 23 year-old mechanic, Ettore Angelini. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Although the details of the incident remain sketchy, it appears that an evasive maneuver was required by the sudden appearance of a bicyclist, and resulted in the vehicle being flipped into a ditch.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Within a few short weeks the event had been reworked as the foundation myth of the century's first cultural political avant-garde, initially literary but soon encompassing the full spectrum of the arts, whose eleven-point platform weds advocacy of "the habit of energy and fearlessness," "aggressive movement, feverish insomnia, the race pace, the mortal leap, the slap and the punch" to the exaltation of the beauty of speed. The prose is telegraphic, the message time-sensitive; the manifesto is news from the future. Marinetti sought to publish it immediately (and there were leaks and pre-releases). But the news pipeline was so clogged with reports on the simmering Bosnian crisis, soon to be followed by the Messina earthquake, that three months would pass before backstage lobbying by a family friend led to the text's appearance on the Parisian newspaper's front page.</p>
<p>As the artfully crafted prose of the preface reproduced above suggests, the three month delay may also have been motivated by other considerations. Authored by Calmette, <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span>'s managing editor since 1903 and the older brother of the noted bacteriologist Albert Calmette, it was strategically placed before the manifesto in order to vaccinate the newspaper's readership against Marinetti's breach of the then-conventional decorum governing cultural debates. Such prefaces were infrequent even in a daily that courted controversy as recently as the Dreyfus affair, carrying no less than four of Émilie Zola's fiery polemics in the run up to the publication of his no less incendiary <span style="font-style:italic;">J'accuse</span> on the pages of its republican socialist rival <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Aurore</span>.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Though omitted from subsequent editions of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Foundation and Manifesto of Futurism</span>, Calmette's preface marks the inaugural moment in the reception history of the 20<sup>th</sup> century's first avant-garde.</p>
<p>The commentary that follows tracks Calmette's attempts to comfort and contain even as he acknowledges the manifesto's disruptiveness. The tone is self-assured. The aim is to push Futurism back into the mold of prior literary-artistic schools: to frame its rhetoric of rupture, however incendiary, in a manner that conveys continuity. Yet, in so doing, Calmette cannot resist the temptation to traffic in two of the mainstays of the emerging public sphere of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century: sensationalism and the claim that this is a <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span> exclusive. Five years later, the editor himself would fall victim to one of the era's most sensational crimes when he was murdered by Henriette Caillaux, wife of the French Minister of Finance, Joseph Caillaux, who had been under attack by the paper.</p>
<p>The French original follows, accompanied by a brief commentary.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>M. Marinetti, le jeune poète italien et français, au talent remarquable et fougueux [1], que de retentissantes manifestations ont fait connaître dans tous les pays latins [2], suivi d'une pléiade d'enthousiastes disciples [3], vient de fonder l'Ecole du "Futurisme" [4] dont les théories dépassent en hardiesse toutes celles des écoles antérieures ou contemporaines [5]. <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span> qui a déjà servi de tribune à plusieurs d'entre elles [6], et non des <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  moindres, offre aujourd'hui à ses lecteurs le manifeste des "Futuristes" [7]. Est-il besoin de dire que nous laissons au signataire toute la responsabilité de ses idées singulièrement audacieuses et d'une outrance [8] souvent injuste pour des choses éminemment respectables et, heureusement, partout respectées [9]? Mais il était interessant de réserver à nos lecteurs la primeur [10] de cette manifestation, quel que soit le jugement qu'on porte sur elle [11].</p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[1]</span> Thirty-two years old at the time of the manifesto's publication, Marinetti's reputation as a "remarkable and fiery" poet in his pre-Futurist period was based upon the dramatic flair demonstrated in his public readings of hyperlyrical symbolist works such as <span style="font-style:italic;">La Conquête des étoiles—Poème épique</span> (Paris: Éditions de "La Plume," May 1902), <span style="font-style:italic;">La Momie sanglante</span> (Milan: Édition du Journal "Verde e Azzurro," Jan. 1904), <span style="font-style:italic;">Destruction—Poèmes lyriques</span> (Paris: Librarie Léon Vanier, 1904), and <span style="font-style:italic;">La Ville charnelle</span> (Paris: Edward Sansot et Compagnie, July 1908), all written and published in French. Many of these works contained dialogical poems, including so-called <span style="font-style:italic;">petits drames de lumières</span> ("short dramas of light"). Marinetti's play, <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Roi Bombance—Tragédie satirique</span> (Paris: Societé du Mercure de France, June 1905), remained unperformed at the time. The poet had experimented with musical stagings of early poems such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Carillon de Nöel</span> as early as 1907, of which there exist several period recordings (sung by Laura del Lungo and Elisa Petri, always with piano accompaniment). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[2]</span> The "stirring performances" in the Latin world surely included the poetic declamations alluded to above, but the word <span style="font-style:italic;">retentissante</span> emphasizes noise, which suggests that Calmette had a more recent clamor in mind: that which accompanied the January 15, 1909 debut of <span style="font-style:italic;">La donna è mobile (Poupées Électriques)</span> at Turin's Teatro Alfieri, performed by the Compagnia Drammatica di Spettacoli Storici e Popolari "Città di Milano." Reacting to the audience's whistling, Marinetti appeared on stage at the end of the second act, deliberately provoking an upheaval in the auditorium. The resulting uproar made the front page of <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Un geste d'audace vient de valoir à F. T. Marinetti les honneurs de la caricature dans les principaux organes humoristiques d'Italie. Comme il advint souvent à son illustre compatriote d'Annunzio, Marinetti n'a pas eu le don d'être compris du public devant lequel se représentait pour la première fois à Turin sa pièce <span style="font-style:italic;">Souvent femme varie</span>. Ce n'est pas impunément, en effet, qu'un talent aristocratique comme celui du poète de <span style="font-style:italic;">La Conquête des etoiles</span> en appelle aux intelligences médiocres. On le lui fit bien voir. Dès les premières scènes, les sifflets et les bruits les plus invraisemblables saluèrent l'oeuvre nouvelle. Les partisans de Marinetti ripostèrent par leur enthousiasme. Il y eut des bagarres et des corps à corps, si bien que l'auteur, poussé à bout, parut soudain à la rampe pour exprimer son mépris à la foule hurlante. Ce geste crâne fut aussitôt le motif de nouvelles querelles parmi les spectateurs; des pugilats s'en-suivirent, si bien que par mesure d'ordre public, la pièce fut interrompue à Turin; mais aussitôt trois nouvelles compagnies ont demandé à l'auteur l'autorisation de la monter, ce qui prouve qu'un beau four est parfois plus glorieux et plus profitable qu'un succès médiocre.</p>

<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>[A courageous gesture just earned F. T. Marinetti the honor of being caricatured in Italy's main satirical reviews. As happened often to his illustrious compatriot d'Annunzio, Marinetti proved unable to win over the audience assembled for the Turin premiere of his play <span style="font-style:italic;">La donna è mobile</span>. It is not with impunity that an aristocratic talent like that possessed by the poet of <span style="font-style:italic;">La Conquête des étoiles</span> reaches out to appeal to mediocre intellects. The result was plain to see. Whistling and unimaginable noises greeted the play right from the opening scene. Marinetti's defenders responded with enthusiasm. Tussles and shoving matches broke out, so much so that the author, pushed beyond the pale, suddenly appeared on stage in order to express his contempt for the screaming mob. This brave gesture prompted renewed conflict among the spectators and fistts rerupted: so much so that the forces of order interrupted the Turin performance. But, as soon as this was done, three new theater companies asked for permission to stage the play, proving that a boiling cauldron is sometimes a greater source of glory and gain than a modest success.]</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The reference to the enthusiasm of Marinetti's partisans is, of course, echoed less than three weeks later in Calmette's preface to the founding manifesto where he describes the poet's disciples as <span style="font-style:italic;">enthousiastes</span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[3]</span> Calmette's choice of the term <span style="font-style:italic;">pléiade</span> is polyvalent. The word alludes to a cluster of six—or, to follow ancient astronomers, seven—stars found in the constellation Taurus: stars that become identified with the seven Alexandrian poets and tragedians who would serve, in turn, as models for two classical revivals—the Toulouse Pléiade of the 14<sup>th</sup> century and the Renaissance Pléiade of the 16<sup>th</sup> century, formed by Pierre de Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay, and Jean-Antoine de Baïfe, whose "manifesto" was <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Du Bellay's <span style="font-style:italic;">La Défense et illustration de la langue française</span> . Accordingly, in 1886, Rodolphe Darzen selected <span style="font-style:italic;">La Pléiade</span> as the title for his Symbolist review, the immediate predecessor to <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercure de France</span>. In all of these cases, the implications are clear and intended as reassuring: despite the manifesto's identification of the <span style="font-style:italic;">we</span> who speaks not only with incendiary poets but also with "large crowds agitated by labor," "the destructive gesture of anarchists," and "the polyphonic tides of modern revolution," Marinetti's disciples will remain a small, aristocratic cohort, not an avant-garde with aspirations to reach out to the working masses. Futurism may not be classicizing like the <span style="font-style:italic;">pléiade</span> of Du Bellay, Calmette suggests, but it will prove but another school in a long lineage of literary currents. The Futurists may hurl their defiance at the stars, but they will remain within the known contours of the galaxy of literary history.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[4]</span> Nowhere in the Futurist manifesto's text is there any indication that the concept of the literary <span style="font-style:italic;">school</span>, a defining feature of the French 19<sup>th</sup>-century literary scene, remains the appropriate vehicle for the revolution propounded by Marinetti. But Calmette is deliberate in his presentation of Futurism as yet another school: a school cast in the familiar mold of predecessors as Parnassianism, Symbolism, or Naturalism. His reading finds support in the manifesto to the degree that it repeatedly asserts that Futurism is a movement of poets (the turn towards painting, sculpture, music, and architecture would come soon thereafter).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[5]</span> The key distinguishing adjective is <span style="font-style:italic;">hardiesse</span>, derived from the same root as the English <span style="font-style:italic;">hardness</span>, with insinuations of both insolence and novelty. The emphasis is tonal. Jean Moreas's <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Symbolisme</span>, published on September 18, 1886 in <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span>'s literary supplement, was anything but <span style="font-style:italic;">hardi</span>. It begins: "Like all the arts, literature evolves: a cyclical evolution with strictly regulated cycles that are complicated by the changes imposed by the march of time and cahnges in context. It would be superfluous to note that each new evolutionary stage corresponds with precision to old age, to the inexorable decline of the immediately preceding school. [...] A new expression of art was thus expected, necessary, inevitable." For Moreas, there was no need to rush into the next century.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[6]</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span> had indeed hosted the leading res of 19<sup>th</sup>- and early 20<sup>th</sup>-century French literature, counting among its contributors, Gerard de Nerval, George Sand, Charles Nodier, Guy de Maupassant, Théophile Gauthier, Émile Zola, and Marcel Proust (who dedicated the lead volume of <span style="font-style:italic;">À la Recherche du temps perdu</span> to Calmette). It was identified in particular with Naturalism and Symbolism, having commissioned Moreas ("one of the most visible of these literary revolutionaries") to formulate "the fundamental principles of this new expression of art" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro, Supplement Littéraire</span>, Sept. 18, 1886).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[7]</span> The word "manifesto" generally bore political connotations when employed by the newspaper, though Moreas's <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Symbolisme</span> was indeed presented under the editorial title <span style="font-style:italic;">un manifeste littéraire</span> (albeit on the second page of <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro's</span> weekly literary supplement, whereas the Futurist manifesto appeared on the front page of the actual issue). Among the other literary manifestos associated with <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span> was the <span style="font-style:italic;">Manifeste des Cinq (Le ro</span>, Aug. 18, 1887), signed by Paul Bonnetain, J.-H. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Rosny, Lucien Descaves, Paul Margueritte, and Gustave Guiches, a group of young naturalists disgruntled with Émile Zola (another <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span> contributor). This so-called manifesto, however, was published under the title <span style="font-style:italic;">La Terre</span>, in keeping with the title of the Zola novel that was being invoked as proof of the naturalist master's inexorable artistic decline.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[8]</span> The key word in this section of Calmette's preface is <span style="font-style:italic;">outrance</span>: a literal transgression of boundaries, a going beyond that which is reasonable or licit, always with a hint <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of immorality, as in the juridical phrase <span style="font-style:italic;">outrance aux bonnes moeurs</span> (the violation of public morality). This was the standard crime of which licentious writers were accused during the period (among them Barbey d'Aurevilly and Flaubert).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[9]</span> The "eminently respectable and universally respected things" that the founding manifesto of Futurism heaps scorn upon, thereby eliciting Calmette's disapproval, were most likely the museums, libraries, and academies whose destruction was called for in point ten of the manifesto and reprised in its concluding pages. <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span> surely had little use for Marinetti's celebration in point nine of "the destructive gesture of anarchists," given its rightward leanings –it had opposed the 1871 Paris Comune—its sympathies for positivism, and belief in progress. N.B. the phrase in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Foundation and Manifesto of Futurism</span> is, in French, "le geste destructeur des anarchistes," in Italian, "il gesto distruttivo dei libertarî." In neither case is the translation "freedom-bringers," proposed by R. W. Flint in various English editions, accurate or acceptable.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[10]</span> The emphasis placed upon the value (<span style="font-style:italic;">interessant</span>) and freshness of the document, reserved for the readers of <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span> alone, suggests exclusivity inasmuch as the term <span style="font-style:italic;">primeur</span> evokes produce that is harvested before its naturally occurring moment of ripeness and wines consumed immediately without undergoing even a modicum of aging (<span style="font-style:italic;">vins nouveaux</span>). So, in spite of his caveats, Calmette is promising his upper and middle class readers a heady, volatile brew whose delivery has been rushed to market.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[11]</span> Calmette assumes that the court of public opinion –or, at least, <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span>'s bourgeois readership—will be composed not of "mediocre intellects" like those who rioted at the inaugural Turin performance of <span style="font-style:italic;">La donna è mobile</span>, but of thoughtful and critical citizens. His readership will see beyond the manifesto's incendiary hype and attribute its <span style="font-style:italic;">hardiesse</span> to the extravagant lyrical sensibilities of an artist endowed with an "aristocratic talent." Yet in the backdrop of the preface hovers the specter of a public sphere, that, instead of fulfilling the values of Enlightment reason, has the potential to become a theater where forms of irrationality regularly trump and triumph over critical reason: a theater of scandal and thrill like that enacted by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Foundation and Manifesto of Futurism</span> itself.</p>

<div id="body">
<p>In the fall of 1933, the avant-garde scene in São Paulo was abuzz with talk of the new Teatro da Experiência, trumpeted as the most radical theater experiment the country had yet seen. On the program for the inaugural event was <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> (Man and the Horse), a "Spectacle in Nine Tableaux" by the notorious poet, novelist, and provocateur Oswald de Andrade. It was an ambitious undertaking for a group of amateurs: the dramatic action ranged from St. Peter's pearly gates to a Soviet tribunal, while its huge cast of characters included Cleopatra, talking horses, Madame Jesus, the Voice of Stalin, Fu-Man-Chu, and a Poet-Soldier who casually announces Hitler's imminent genocide of the Jews. As fate would have it, the author failed to finish the script in time, and the theater opened instead with <span style="font-style:italic;">O Bailado do Deus Morto</span> (Dance of the Dead God), a ritualistic performance piece composed by director Flávio de Carvalho and performed by a cast that included black actors and musicians. On 17 November 1933, the day after an entire battalion of police officers showed up uninvited for the third performance, the premises were shut down and placed under armed guard. The Teatro da Experiência became a mere anecdote in avant-garde lore, <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> never made its debut, and the might-have-been revolutionary masses never got their chance to witness the grand spectacle of world history on a small São Paulo stage.</p>
<p>What exactly did they miss? The eminent theater critic Sábato Magaldi echoed a sentiment shared by many latter-day critics and theater practitioners in Brazil when he wrote that <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> represented Oswald de Andrade's most ambitious attempt <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to create a kind of "total theater"—a visionary project that, "by virtue of being at the forefront of its era, doesn't even seem to belong to the reality of Brazilian theater."<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> From the vantage point of the present, Oswald's drama appears to be the harbinger of a theatrical revolution that never happened, the missing piece of an avant-garde movement that shook the foundations of literature, music, art, and architecture but left the nineteenth-century stage intact. Magaldi and others insist that Oswald's unrealized plan for a "stadium theater" that would bridge the gap between art and action betrays many of the same aesthetic and political preoccupations as Max Reinhardt's expressionist experiments, Erwin Piscator's TotalTheater, and the constructivist montages of Vladimir Mayakovsky and Vsevolod Meyerhold. Invoking a discourse that remains endemic to critical accounts of the European and Euro-American avant-garde, they celebrate <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem</span> as a valiant effort to mobilize the masses by blending popular performance traditions with the erudite genres of the elite and opening up the hallowed halls of bourgeois theater to new artistic media such as film to create a performance that would be nothing less than "total."</p>
<p>In what follows, I reverse the terms of this interpretation by examining the elusive ideal of total theater through the optic of Oswald de Andrade's ill-fated spectacle and the events that led up to its non-performance. My reading situates <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> in the local and global political landscape of the 1930s, placing it at the juncture of a triangular relationship formed by the new media of mass culture, the expansion of the modern state, and the appearance of ideological rifts within a group of intellectuals who were identified as the artistic avant-garde. At the outset, it is important to clarify a point that discussions of total theater all too often obscure: not all totalities are alike. Indeed, I argue that in bringing the aesthetic paradigm of total theater head-to-head with a historical narrative of imperialism, <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> redeploys many of the formal processes associated with the avant-garde—the reconration of scenic space, abstraction, technological mediation—in order to posit a very different model of art and its relationship to political agency. One of my aims in this essay is to show how the representational dilemmas that anti-imperialist artists faced at this crucial historical juncture can illuminate the possibilities and potential pitfalls of current attempts to theorize the avant-garde as a "transnational" or "global" phenomenon; another is to demonstrate why the theater of the Brazilian avant-garde is a good place to begin such an endeavor, precisely because there is so little of it.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Total Theater, Mass Culture, and the Modern State</h1>
<p>Few ideas are so closely tied to the vagaries and contradictions of European modernism as total theater and its more comprehensive cousin, the total work of art. In his insightful overview of the latter, Matthew Wilson Smith identifies the total work of art as a re for "un-reconciled dialectical struggles performed under the sign of aesthetic totality": struggles that involve art's relation to the emergence of mass culture, new technologies, and the expansive designs of the modern nation-state.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Smith takes a long (and perhaps <span style="font-style:italic;">too</span> totalizing) view of his subject, painting cyberspace as its new <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  frontier while tracing its roots all the way back to Schiller's ideal of the aesthetic state, a utopian realm of beauty and culture in which social divisions can be imaginatively overcome by art. Like every other genealogy of the tradition, however, his revolves around Wagner's concept of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gesamtkunstwerk</span>, a performative synthesis of music, poetry, and dance in which each achieves its ultimate expression through the formation of an organic unity. Wagner's "theater of the future" evoked the public festivals that had propelled the movement for German unification in 1871 and reflected the convergence of nationalism and popular politics that George Mosse has referred to as the "nationalization of the masses."<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Man's mind, like the bourgeois public sphere, had been "fragmented" by the mechanization and commodification of modern life; Wagner's own art (liberated from the demands of the market by royal patronage) proposed to heal these rifts by crafting absorptive illusions through the use of elaborate stage mechanics, all carefully concealed so that "the public, that representation of daily life, forgets the confines of the auditorium, and lives and breathes now only in the artwork, which seems to it as Life itself, and on the stage, which seems the wide expanse of the whole World."<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Wagner's <span style="font-style:italic;">Gesamtkunstwerk</span> cast a long shadow over the avant-gardes of the early twentieth century, and critics as well as later generations of artists who have claimed the vanguard legacy often use "total theater" as a rubric for a wide array of theatrical endeavors from this time: projects such as Antonin Artaud's metaphysical "theater of cruelty" and the Soviet Meyerhold's attempt to create an "October in the theater," both of which sought to break through the fourth wall by taking a page from <span style="font-style:italic;">commedia dell'arte</span> and the circus, though each envisioned totality in different terms. The most explicit elaboration of a total theater ideal was the TotalTheater project developed during the late twenties in Weimar by the director Erwin Piscator and members of the Bauhaus school. The Bauhaus's emphasis on craft and design was a socialist-inspired attempt to wed functionalism and beauty, but it also gave the school a pipeline to industry and thus a degree of autonomy from unreliable state funding. Piscator's "proletarian theater" drew on elements of popular musical revues, the mass pageantry of early Soviet theater, and technological innovations including mobile footways and stages, loudspeakers, and film projections. A key component was the reconration of theatrical space: architect Walter Gropius drew up plans for a monumental hall for nearly two thousand spectators seated on movable blocks of chairs, an arrangement intended to facilitate performances that would spread throughout the entire auditorium and incorporate the spectators. Like its predecessor, this radicalized version of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gesamtkunstwerk</span> was conceived as an organic whole, though its constitutive elements were manifestly mechanical and the object of its impact was the intellect; according to Piscator, his goal was to "dematerialise the stage by means of a total technique, to make it a light and flexible instrument destined to serve mind and not sentimentality."<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Jeffrey T. Schnapp explains that for Piscator, "the revolution was embedded somewhere in the real itself. The theater's task was simply to strip away all externals and to place that rough and ready reality directly onstage." Totality, in other words, meant an immediately perceptible "totality of effect."<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The 1929 stock market crash put a halt to construction plans, and as the 1930s wore on TotalTheater became a fraught strategy for the Left. Even before Hitler became chancellor in 1933, the Nazis laid claim to the legacy of Wagner and the infrastructure of civic performance to develop their own mass rituals, open-air theaters, and choreographed parades—aspects of the "aestheticization of the political" that Walter Benjamin identified as the <span style="font-style:italic;">modus operandi</span> of fascism. In his essay "Border Crossings: Italian/German Peregrinations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Theater of Totality</span>," Schnapp follows the TotalTheater model's migration to Fascist Italy, where it was embraced as kindred in spirit to Mussolini's proposed "theater of masses" and as theoretical confirmation of Futurist experiments as well as state-sponsored traveling pageants involving hundreds of performers and up to 15,000 spectators. His narrative ends in Rome in October 1934 at a conference held by the Italian Academy and attended by such diverse res as Edward Gordon Craig, Jacques Copeau, Alexander Tairov, Filippo Marinetti, W.B. Yeats, and the special guest, Walter Gropius himself, all speaking a shared language of total theatricality. Noting the "ideological drift and blurring" that facilitated surprising "cultural convergences" across national boundaries (<span style="font-style:italic;">BC</span>, 83), Schnapp argues that artists on opposite sides of the political divide responded to a perceived crisis of bourgeois theater by creating new forms of mass spectacle that fueled what he calls a "modernist politics of immediacy" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BC</span>, 89).</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Absence of a Brazilian Theatrical Avant-Garde</h1>
<p>Schnapp attributes the search for "total" aesthetic solutions among revolutionaries of all stripes to a postwar milieu in which religion was on the wane and the new technologies of war and peace were calling humanist assumptions into question. And yet these phenomena were themselves bound up with a profound shift in the modes and mechanisms of global imperialism. Across the Atlantic and south of the equator in Brazil, debates over how to overturn the cultural legacy of colonialism drove the development of the avant-garde movement known as <span style="font-style:italic;">modernismo</span>, which took shape during the Semana de Arte Moderna, a festival of art exhibitions, poetry readings, music recitals, and lectures held in São Paulo in February 1922. Although most modernistas came from the elite, they cultivated an interest in the cultures of their darker-skinned compatriots while giving an occasional nod to the vast numbers of Italian, German, and Japanese immigrants who were flocking to São Paulo during this period. It was Oswald de Andrade who invented modernismo's most enduring motif, the tonguein cheek inversion of European primitivism that has become the hallmark of a paradoxical Brazilian nationalism: cannibalism. In his 1928 "Anthropophagist Manifesto," he invoked the culinary rituals of the region's original inhabitants as a model of how Brazilians could critically digest their enemies' culture and escape the trap of cultural dependency and heralded the practice of eating the Other as both the sign of Brazilian difference and "the world's single law": "We want the Carib Revolution. Greater than the French Revolution. The unification of all productive revolts for the progress of humanity."<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Oswald played up the fact that Montaigne's "noble savage" was inspired <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  by the egalitarian customs of Brazil's Tupinamba tribe and shrugged his shoulders at the more recent advances of European civilization, declaring, "we already had Com-munism. We already had surrealist language. The Golden Age."<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>But Oswald was not the only <span style="font-style:italic;">modernista</span> putting a new spin on the old ethnic standbys of nationalist iconography; his manifesto was a response to a rival group of modernistas known as the <span style="font-style:italic;">verde-amarelistas</span> (an homage to the green and gold colors of the Brazilian flag) that openly advocated fascism. Because the majority of the masses and the historical origins of the nation were clearly not "white," the connections between race and fascist representation were rather different in Brazil than in Europe and relied on a strategy of symbolic inclusion coupled with social exclusion. Members immersed themselves in indigenous mythology and sought to declare Tupi the national language, even as they argued that the destiny of the indigenous race was to disappear and leave nothing but "spirit"—i.e., culture—behind.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> These fractures in the avant-garde front turned into open rifts following the crisis provoked by the 1929 stock market crash and the subsequent Revolution of 1930, which overthrew the weak central regime and set the stage for the rise of Getúlio Vargas, a re whose legacy continues to loom large over the country's political scene. Brazil's "Father of the Poor" was a populist of sorts: his government granted women's suffrage, instituted retirement pensions for workers, and consolidated federal control over the regional oligarchies that had run the show during the Old Republic (1889–1930); he also beefed up the military, subordinated unions to the authority of the state, and endorsed the torture of political opponents by the secret police. In 1932, the São Paulo elite led a three-month "Constitutionalist Revolution" in an attempt to regain the privileges they had enjoyed under the liberal oligarchic regime; in military terms they failed, but the upshot was a détente and eventual alliance between Vargas and the old elite, leading to a new constitution in 1934 that consecrated him as the legitimate executive. Legal order, however, would prove to be short-lived: in 1935, following a failed "communist conspiracy," the State suspended civil liberties and ordered thousands of arrests that dealt a crippling blow to the Left; in 1937, Vargas abandoned democratic pretenses and declared the Estado Novo, a corporatist dictatorship that lasted until shortly after World War II.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>More than five decades after his second stint in power ended with his suicide in the face of a military coup, Vargas continues to be an object of collective ambivalence and even affection, in no small part because his regime is closely linked to the genesis of cultural icons and repertoires that still set the parameters of national identity today. It was during the 1930s that the notion of Brazil as a "racial democracy" began to take shape; it was also the era when soccer, once the preserve of the elite, became a popular obsession while racially coded genres such as samba shed their stigma to become transnational commodities and emblems of national identity. As the historian Daryle Williams has underlined, the state did not initiate these complex processes, nor did it attain the degree of control that some of its ideological cousins in Europe enjoyed; instead, the administration's strategy was to "ma(k)e cultural management its official business" by creating an extensive network of patronage in order to bring artists and intellectuals under the purview of the state.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> In 1933, the federal government became <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the official sponsor of Rio's annual Carnival parade. In the increasingly important arena of radio—in which the state's ability to intervene was constrained by limited resources and the interests of foreign capital—it crafted corporate-friendly legislation while requiring stations to broadcast official propaganda and devote a large percentage of programming to "national" themes. But it was <span style="font-style:italic;">modernismo</span> whose fortunes underwent the most drastic shift under the "revolutionary" state. The <span style="font-style:italic;">verdeamarelista</span> Plínio Salgado, who founded the fascist Integralist party in 1932, was not the only one to benefit from the new political conration; <span style="font-style:italic;">modernistas</span> of all political stripes were given positions in the new Ministry of Education, while government agencies generated outwardly apolitical, "cultural" journals that succeeded in drawing in writers who had long lamented the dearth of forums for their work. In a speech delivered in 1951, Vargas aptly summed up the avant-garde myth his own government had helped create, claiming that "the collective forces that provoked the revolutionary modernist movement in Brazilian literature . . . were the same ones that precipitated the victorious Revolution of 1930 in the social and political field."<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> The state recast <span style="font-style:italic;">modernismo</span>'s experimental ethic as an authentic expression of the popular and prescient precursor to political change, even as it circumscribed it to the realm of "literature" in order to harness its iconoclastic edge.</p>
<p>When the <span style="font-style:italic;">modernistas</span> parted ways, Oswald de Andrade veered to the left and, in 1931, began a fraught relationship with the Brazilian Communist Party, which had been founded in 1922—the same year as the Week of Modern Art. The erstwhile dandy bid a public adieu to his former cohorts in the preface to his experimental novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Serafim Ponte Grande</span>, completed in 1928 but left unpublished until 1933. In the brief text, he lambastes <span style="font-style:italic;">modernista</span> bohemians for masquerading as agents of social revolution, recalling that in the heady environment of the 1920s, "the modernist movement, culminating in the anthropophagic plague, seemed to indicate an advanced phenomenon . . . It even looked like the coffee boom might set the semicolony's <span style="font-style:italic;">nouveau riche</span> literature on a level with costly imperialistic surrealisms."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Those illusions crumbled in the face of the economic crisis, "just as almost all Brazilian 'vanguardist' literature crumbled, being provincial and suspect if not extremely impoverished and reactionary" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SGP</span>, 5). It was a harsh judgment, one that the writer would later qualify. Yet it was not a rejection of stylistic experimentation as such. Rather, Oswald's critique takes aim at what Frankfurt philosopher Herbert Marcuse would refer to only a few years later as the "affirmative" nature of bourgeois culture, which may entertain the possibility of an alternative to the existing order but ultimately legitimates the status quo by offering "spiritual" progress and "ethical" freedom as consolation for oppression and material lack.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> The author derides his own novel for proposing the facile solution of "transnational nudism" to the structural inequalities produced by economic imperialism and announces that, having tired of being an "upper-class clown," he will henceforth aspire to be, "if nothing else, a circus roustabout in the Proletarian Revolution"<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a>—a kind of stagehand, in other words, who would rearrange the set and fashion props to facilitate the working class in performing its own creative feats in the political ring. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>As was true of other Latin American avant-gardists during the 1930s, Oswald's political radicalization did in fact prompt a turn to theater. In an article published in 1935 and subsequently adopted as the preface to a second edition, the author explains that <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span>, his first full-length play in Portuguese, "is a piece of high fantasy in which I place man in the transition—between the war horse and the turf horse (bourgeois society) and horsepower (socialist society)." As such, it "is a book that is of interest to the masses," though the limited print run effectively circumscribed its audience to a small group of intellectuals.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">O Rei da Vela</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">A Morta</span>  met a similar fate. It was not until 1967, under another "modernizing dictatorship," that a landmark staging of <span style="font-style:italic;">O Rei da Vela</span> would help give birth to the counterculture movement known as Tropicália.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Teatro Oficina's controversial production pioneered an Artaud-inspired "theater of aggression" while establishing Oswald's reputation as a visionary playwright who, as one of the actors wrote, "opens a path toward a national theater, a total theater, which is only now properly understood."<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> More recently, the director José Celso has sought to build a stadium theater that would provide a proper stage for <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem—</span>a play he describes as the "total surmounting" of Russian constructivism "blended with the Great Rituals that shape the Brazilian Mixed Races culture."<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> In 2003, after years ting a local developer, Celso announced a deal: the developers would build their mall, but alongside it they would construct a 1,000-seat theater inspired by Walter Gropius's design for the TotalTheater in Weimar, complete with a ceiling made of retractable movie screens that opened up to the tropical sky. Like its forebear, this project has since fallen through.</p>
<p>But on what grounds is Oswald's theater identified as the missing piece of a national avant-garde? The justification for such claims does not lie in detailed analyses of the texts or the events surrounding their non-performance, of which there are surprisingly few—or perhaps not so surprising, given that total theater aims to render both text and stage obsolete. Instead, most artists and critics who advocate this interpretation do so on the basis of Oswald's "Do Teatro, Que É Bom," a humorous dialogue published in a daily newspaper in 1943. The dialogue begins with an unnamed speaker's defense of an amateur group engaged in what his partner derisively refers to as "chamber theater." Speaker number one insists that such efforts should be applauded, if for no other reason than that "they give us a break from the cinema, that growing stupidification by means of the screen with which the United States flooded the world in order to take it over without resistance." Voicing an Adorno-esque critique of the culture industry, he scoffs that "when they spoke against the opium of the people, they should have made it plural and added cinema and soccer."<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> His interlocutor, however, takes issue with this extrapolation from Marx and contends that what is needed is a "theater of shock," a "stadium theater" that, along with the radio, the sports arena, and the silver screen, will educate and entertain the growing masses. Tracing the history of theater from its inception in ancient Greece, he claims that in the nineteenth century, with the rise of bourgeois individualism, what was lost was "the religious character of the theater, the collective festival, festival of the masses, festival of the people" (<span style="font-style:italic;">DT</span>, 90). His list of exemplary res includes Ibsen, Jarry, Cocteau, and in particular Meyerhold, whose <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  "ethic of spectacle" is lauded as the pinnacle of modern theater. This leads into a discussion of "the war-like image of fascism" cultivated by the acolytes of Stalin and "the petty-bourgeoisie of Mussolini, nursed by bureaucracy and the confessional, wanting to live dangerously in a sensational release of inhibitions" (91–92). His proposed antidote to this attack on the "Hegelian progression of the spirit" is not primarily a playwright (though Oswald may have in mind his famous Pageant of the Paterson Strike): it is the journalist and globetrotting radical John Reed. The text concludes with the first speaker, who has long since tempered his enthusiastic embrace of chamber theater, declaring that "John Reed's soldier fulfilled his mission on the living stage of contemporary history" . Art and history merge, on-stage and off-stage become one, and thesis and antithesis are resolved in the total transformation of reality.</p>
<p>Or are they? The dialogue's self-mocking tone calls into question the ease with which the final synthesis is achieved, while the references to contemporary political realities hint at a more serious subtext: Oswald, always unorthodox, had distanced himself from the Communist Party by this time and would break away two years later, in 1945; Stalin, denounced in the dialogue as a "villain," had executed Meyerhold three years earlier for his refusal to tow the social realist line; in Brazil, meanwhile, Getúlio Vargas was paying popular musicians to sing his praises. The use of the dialogue form is significant, then, because it enacts an unresolved debate in leftist circles and indicates that the outcome is not a done deal. At one point, for instance, the speaker who sings the praises of "chamber theater" points to advances in stage design and cites the work of the French director Louis Jouvet, who spent the early forties in exile in Brazil; calling it an "admirable reaction against the corruption brought about by the cinema," he explains that "sensing itself under attack, the theater improved," producing intimate theaters that provided a refuge for "the spirit of that fabulous Paris, which that forest ranger Hitler's filthy boot is unsuccessfully trying to crush." Rather than refuting this implicit equation of mass culture with fascism, his partner brings up Meyerhold and a long list of earlier playwrights-of-the-people, ending with the comment that "one day, perhaps soon, we may be able to add, in an honest sense, Wagner and Oberammergau . . ." (<span style="font-style:italic;">DT</span>, 87). The argument for the revolutionary nature of mass theater thus leads to two disturbing counter-examples that signal its potential as a vehicle for reaction: a composer celebrated by the Nazis as an icon of German nationalism, and a Bavarian village famous for its centuries-long tradition of a massive, day-long Passion Play—famous, too, for the anti-Semitic nature of the pageant and Hitler's ringing endorsement of it.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Only by turning a blind eye to these apparent impasses that trail off into ellipses is it possible to read this pseudo-Platonic dialogue as a programmatic manifesto for total theater; its relation to O Homem e o Cavalo becomes even more complex when one realizes that "O Teatro" was written nearly a decade later, at a time when, after several frustrated attempts to stage his own plays, Oswald was no longer writing theater at all. Even if we take the advocate of stadium theater to be the unequivocal mouthpiece for the author, his pedagogical injunction to "educate the world" is light years away from the contumacious circus laborer of the Serafim preface. The two speakers define <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  their framework as international, but the specter of the nation is impossible to escape because a stumbling block stands in the way of the dialectic's progression: not just the historic wax and wane of fascism, but the concurrent rise and reification of Brazil's own corporatist state.</p>
<p>Historians and sociologists have been drawing attention to the political and institutional shifts that fostered the flowering of the Brazilian avant-garde for several decades now. But this knowledge in itself is not a sufficient solution to the methodological problem of how to <span style="font-style:italic;">interpret</span> modernismo's formal innovations, nor is the recent turn toward "transnationalism" a quick fix to the nation-state's hold over culture, as evidenced by Fernando J. Rosenberg's recent study <span style="font-style:italic;">Geopolitics and the Latin American Avant-Garde</span>. The book makes the claim that whereas the European avant-gardes simply rered imperialist assumptions, their Latin American counterparts "explored the limits of a national, culturalist response to crisis of the universality of civilization" by creating "narratives of space" that undermined the linear narrative of progress.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> The author explicitly endorses this practice of "embodied universality" as a model for dealing with the cultural politics of our own age—a disturbing suggestion given that he avoids any discussion of Latin American avant-gardists who espoused fascism, dismisses any overtly polemical work as a "repression of critical consciousness," and devotes two chapters to the Brazilian <span style="font-style:italic;">modernista</span> Mário de Andrade without noting that some of the writer's most exemplary work was facilitated by his position as a cultural administrator under Vargas.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> This kind of affirmative criticism replicates the very dynamic at work in the institutionalization of Brazilian <span style="font-style:italic;">modernismo</span>: it redefines "politics" as an ethico-aesthetic category and delegitimizes political engagement, privileging a specifically <span style="font-style:italic;">literary</span> form of "cosmopolitanism" that was canonized by a politically repressive, nationalist regime. Such analyses might broaden their geographical scope, but their critique is a red herring because they define cultural nationalism as a particular style that can be (un)written on the page.</p>
<p>Rosenberg's recognition of space as a critical category in the study of the avant-gardes is on point. Yet if he, like most critics of the Latin American <span style="font-style:italic;">vanguardias</span>, bypasses a discussion of theater, perhaps it is because solutions crafted within the closed confines of poetic or narrative space don't always hold up when space becomes something more than metaphorical and actual bodies are involved. Although no genre or medium is immune from the sort of disciplinary operation that abstracts an artistic object from the process of its production in order to craft the illusion of absolute autonomy, theater tends to present greater obstacles to redemptive modes of interpretation that attribute a progressive function to works of art on the sole basis of their symbolic <span style="font-style:italic;">representation</span> of social relations. Because it requires the presence of a collective audience, as well as a <span style="font-style:italic;">social</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">material</span> space in which to perform, theater's autonomy from the existing socio-political order is always, in the words of Loren Kruger, manifestly "impure." It is for this reason, Kruger argues, that theater is often a key site of struggle among competing attempts to define the proper articulation of art and society. She concludes: "At once more and less than art, theater straddles the disputed border country between the aesthetic state and the political and provides the stage on which the contradiction between them can be enacted."<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The tenuous nature of theatrical representation may be one reason why the Vargas government chose not to subsidize the dramatic arts for most of the 1930s, while it was still battling open opposition from the oligarchic elites and consolidating control over the fractious urban labor sector. As in Germany and Italy, regional divisions ran deep and there was little historical precedent for a strong central government; Brazil, however, was on the receiving end of the mass exodus of immigrants that allowed many European nations to externalize evidence of capitalism's growing contradictions. The origin myths that underpinned the aesthetic politics of Europe's fascist regimes also had a more precarious foundation in a country whose historical roots lay in colonialism. In 1888, Brazil had become the last country in the world to abolish African slavery; less than fifty years later, the country's new ruling forces were attempting to redefine race as an axis of national unity. The notion of a shared "Brazilian" culture, in other words, was a fragile fiction that threatened to collapse in the theater, where the gap between the real and the ideal was marked by the presence of the stage.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why the police felt it necessary to make such an extravagant display of force in shutting down a small theater like the Teatro da Experiência. The space in which Man and the Horse was to have had its debut was a far cry from the grandiose, stadium-like structures that Gropius planned for the TotalTheater project; it had a relatively modest number of seats (around 275) and was housed in the basement of the Clube de Artistas Modernos (CAM), a social club founded in November 1932 by Antônio Gomide, Carlos Prado, Emiliano di Cavalcanti, and Flávio de Carvalho, a group of "modern artists" dedicated to defending what they called "the interests of the class."<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Teatro da Experiência was the brainchild of Carvalho, a wayward scion of the local aristocracy who was an architect, visual artist, and early performance artist of sorts.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> Much like Piscator, Carvalho conceived of his Teatro as a "laboratory" that would "function with the impartial spirit of laboratory research"; as he explained it in his application for a permit, the purpose was to explore "the world of ideas" by experimenting with "settings, modes of diction, mimesis, the dramatization of new elements of expression, problems of lighting and sound, conjugated to the movement of abstract forms," all in order "to form a practical base for the psychology of entertainment."<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<p>Such a proposal might have aroused little suspicion at some other time or in some other place. But as it happened, the Teatro opened its doors toward the end of a pivotal year in the course of modern history. In Brazil, 1933 was dominated by the lengthy lead-up to the inauguration of a Constituent National Assembly that would draft a constitution and return the country to legal rule even as it paved the way for the authoritarian Estado Novo by legitimating Vargas's power. The Assembly's inauguration fell on 15 November—the very same day that Carvalho's <span style="font-style:italic;">O Bailado do Deus Morto</span> made its debut.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Meanwhile in Germany, Hitler became chancellor on 30 January 1933, the Reichstag burned on 27 February and by the end of March the legislature had granted the federal government dictatorial powers; in July, Trotsky pointed to the German Communist Party's rapid disintegration as an indication that Stalin's "bureaucratic centrism" had reached a point at which the Left opposition had no choice but to break from the Comintern. Japan unleashed its imperial ambitions in Manchuria <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  while Franklin Roosevelt spelled out the New Deal and Good Neighbor policy in his 4 March radio address, signalling a shift (in theory) away from armed intervention into Latin American affairs toward economic penetration and an intense campaign of cultural propaganda.</p>
<p>These distant events all resonated loudly within the small artists' club out of which Carvalho's theatrical "experience" emerged. One of the most frequent performers at the Clube dos Artistas Modernos was Elsie Houston, a classically trained "mulatta" soprano who would later gain fame in the nightclubs of New York City for a repertoire featuring what the press referred to as Afro-Brazilian "voodoo songs"; she was also the wife of the French surrealist Benjamin Péret, who had recently been expelled from Brazil for his Trotskyist activities. In June of 1933, CAM held an exhibition of paintings and lithographs by the German Käthe Kollwitz, which opened with a lecture by the prominent Trotskyist and art critic Mário Pedrosa, who had studied in Berlin and fought in early street battles against the Nazis (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>). In July, the club unveiled an exhibition of Soviet poster art brought back from Russia by the modernista painter Tarsila do Amaral, drawing considerable attention from the press. And yet nothing could top the talk by Caio Prado Junior, a rising star in the Brazilian Communist Party whose landmark <span style="font-style:italic;">Evolução Política do Brasil</span> appeared this same year. Prado Junior's presentation on his recent trip to Russia drew six hundred people to CAM one evening in September; loudspeakers were placed outside so that the long line of people who were unable to squeeze into the hall could hear his favorable account of the new Soviet society as well as the debate that ensued. Other events included lectures on subjects ranging from modern China to "Brazilian folklore" and the Ingay Amazonians; a demonstration of Japanese dances; and a talk by David Alfaro Siqueiros, the Mexican muralist who would attempt to assassinate Trotsky in 1940.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>What the countless newspaper articles that document the development of the Clube dos Artistas Modernos and the Teatro da Experiência's debut do not always reveal is who attended these events. For this, one has to turn to the archive of the Delegacia Estadual de Ordem Política e Social (DEOPS), Brazil's notorious political police. The DEOPS opened a file on the club in July of 1933 and assigned the task of surveillance to an informant identified by the code name "Guarany." The agent's reports offer intriguing glimpses into a unique and ultimately ephemeral milieu where left-leaning artists, anarchists, Trotskyists, Communist Party faithfuls, and those who refused to be pigeonholed into any one of the left's proliferating factions formed contingent alliances and often engaged in tense disputes. One such re was Oreste Ristori, an old timer from the heyday of anarco-syndicalism who had acquired quasi-mythic stature after being kicked out of his native Italy and Argentina before arriving in Brazil (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>). In a defiantly detailed declaration Ristori gave to the police a few years later before being deported to Italy, where he would be shot by the German army during World War II for his role in the antifascist resistance, he stated that he had begun frequenting the Clube dos Artistas Modernos because he "had the desire to meet various [<span style="font-style:italic;">diversos</span>] intellectuals."<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> He was not the only one. Throughout the file on CAM, the club's unknown mole voices concern about the intermingling of intellectuals and "foreign <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>In his account of the club's activities (written after the declaration of the Estado Novo), Carvalho echoed his unidentified observer's remarks, taking pains to state his disapproval of the "extreme leftist elements, some having nothing to do with art" that "infiltrated" the club and allowed political passions to overwhelm the pursuit of rational beauty.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> And yet it was his theater that led to the club's downfall—perhaps because its "entertainment" appeal threatened to bring yet another element into this already suspect mix. Carvalho's main collaborator on <span style="font-style:italic;">O Bailado do Deus Morto</span> was Henrique Costa (Henricão), a black chauffeur who would become a successful samba composer; Costa composed the music and performed in the piece, which drew a "diverse" crowd with twice as many spectators as there were seats. Its success helps explain the authorities' insistence that not just <span style="font-style:italic;">O Bailado</span> but the theater itself constituted a "Communist" threat—indeed, the script contains a few risqué references to the anatomy of a primitive god, but it remains resolutely abstract and it is impossible to discern any direct allusions to contemporary events. Race was never explicitly mentioned as a cause, of course, because the state's ideological project depended on disavowing the political dimension of skin color even as it celebrated blackness as an integral element of national culture. In such a context, the likely mix of people in the audience and the presence of black actors on an experimental stage where generic conventions were less fixed would have raised a red flag.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> (<a name="4-text" href="#4">. 4</a> and <a name="5-text" href="#5">5</a>)</p>
<p>A few days after the long arm of the law put an end to the fun, as the police perused scripts of the Teatro's forthcoming works (including his own) and deliberated on its ultimate fate, Oswald gave a reading of scenes from <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> upstairs in the club. In an article announcing the event he expressed confidence that the theater would prevail and spoke of plans to stage his own play. His optimism turned out to be misplaced: the case went to court, where a judge affiliated with the Integralists decided in favor of the police, provoking an outcry from prominent intellectuals as far away as Buenos Aires and a fiery speech in the national constituent assembly by an opposition delegate who decried the suppression of a valiant attempt to form a "completely independent theater."<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> The club quickly lost members and closed soon after, leaving a would-be audience to speculate as to what <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem</span> might have looked like onstage. "The Teatro da Experiência's task is going to be enormous," Oswald had said, because it would be "attempting to reduce, for a stage four meters in size (doubled in <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the auditorium, it's true), a play for a stadium or the cinema, with forty-five characters, a dog, and a horse."<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>"A play for a stadium or the cinema." Critics who link <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> to the total theater trend, then, are not entirely without reason. The play does indeed share many formal features with projects that aspired to this ideal: it incorporates elements of popular genres such as <span style="font-style:italic;">teatro de revista</span>, or musical revues; the theatrical action occasionally spills off the stage and into the audience; and although the text does not indicate that film projectors were to be used, the principle of mediation is foregrounded through the use of loudspeakers, which transmit the voices of offstage characters. The title—<span style="font-style:italic;">Man and the Horse—</span>calls to mind the "abstract man" who is the quintessential hero of all total theater projects, while the narrative, derived from the medieval mystery, evokes a messianic sense of time that will presumably culminate in the fusion of the spiritual and the material on Judgment Day.</p>
<p>The moment of sublimation never occurs, however, because <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> insists on placing itself in the uncomfortable crux between the nationalization of mass politics and the emergence of a global mass culture.

<p class="continued">quote makes clear, the play's work is to <span style="font-style:italic;">reduce</span> the all-encompassing spectacle of mass society, to cut it down to human size in order to magnify the political, cultural, and material processes that are at stake in representing "the whole." The play attempts to redraw the connections between art, mass culture, and anti-imperialism by harking back to a moment when the left and the artistic vanguards appeared to be in step: its structure of nine, loosely-connected tableaux featuring an international cast of characters who t vile capitalists all across the globe seems to be modeled on Mayakovsky's <span style="font-style:italic;">Mystery-Bouffe</span>, a reinvention of the medieval mystery genre first produced by Meyer-hold shortly after the triumph of the Russian Revolution. The Russian play, however, is an unambiguous celebration of an unprecedented revolution, and it employs the conventions of medieval mysteries as a way of inserting itself into a tradition familiar to its popular audiences. <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem</span> presents a more troubling picture, one that is structured by the historical and ideological contradictions that had emerged in the fifteen years since the Mayakovsky play was written. By 1933, these kinds of cultural appropriations had become more questionable in light of the newly forged links between "popular" or "folk" cultures and repressive states, and in Brazil they were doubly vexed due not only to the Church's close ties to Vargas and the Integralists but also the historic role of religious drama in the process of colonization. The extent to which these two plays diverge is evident in their treatment of the holy hero himself: whereas <span style="font-style:italic;">Mystery-Bouffe</span> turns Christ into a secular Redeemer who champions the cause of the proletarians, Oswald's play exposes the troubling role of popular culture in mass society by portraying Hitler as a perverse, modern-day incarnation of the Son of God.</p>
<p>But <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem</span> does not simply discard market-driven forms of art and entertainment. In fact, many of the innovations that can be interpreted as adaptations of the medieval mystery also coincide with the conventions of teatro de revista, a genre that was quintessentially "Brazilian" in its depictions of topical events and social customs but also, as a local variant of revue theater, heir to a geographically expansive genealogy of urban mass culture. Introduced to Brazil in the 1870s, the <span style="font-style:italic;">revista</span> had long been derided by the elite as a symptom of the country's inability to produce a "legitimate" national theater, and in the first few decades of the twentieth century many <span style="font-style:italic;">revista</span> musicians and actors also worked in radio and film. <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista</span> shows aimed to attract spectators of all classes, and while the plots often reinforced social hierarchies, the industry was more open than most to employing light-skinned mulatos (less often blacks) and was an important vehicle for the popularization of genres such as samba.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Getúlio Vargas's ties to <span style="font-style:italic;">revista</span>, radio, and film went back to 1926 when, as a federal congressman, he sponsored a bill establishing the first legal oversight of commercial entertainment that was widely perceived as favoring the interests of authors and performers.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> As president, he not only frequented the theater but was also known to steal the show. A Brazilian director, writing in 1945, recalled that</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>. . . Never was a head of government so prominent on theater stages as the victor of the Revolution of 1930. The re of Getúlio Vargas was always the main attraction in all the revues, and he was depicted in the most sympathetic manner, incarnated in the most <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  popular types of the masses, once dressed as a <span style="font-style:italic;">gaúcho</span>, another time as a worker, a hunter, a revolutionary, a farmworker, a teacher, a macho, and even a tramcar driver! His re, cause for the heartiest laughter, lingered in every spectator's heart after the laughter, touching and conquering all in the most intelligent campaign a governor could merit.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>The very multiplicity of these onstage incarnations contributed to Vargas's construction as the ideal populist subject; his serialized image (farmworker, teacher, revolutionary) confirms what Michael Warner has said of public res in mass-mediated societies, which "take on the function of concretizing that phantasmatic body image, or, in other words, of actualizing the otherwise indeterminate image of the people."<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> In its opening tableau, <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> plugs in to this "popular" tradition by adopting its stylistic conventions while turning its representational logic on its head in order to foreground the affinities between fascism and capitalist mass culture. The scene takes place in the "universal" sphere of heaven, where the far-from-angelic denizens include St. Peter, who claims that his celestial domain is Einstein's fourth dimension; the Four "Graças" (Graces), who are transposed into singing "Garças" (Hussies) and are immediately recognizable as the obligatory chorus line of scantily-clad girls from a revue; and the Divo, a flamboyant opera singer accused by the others of having lost his "moral sense" onstage. St. Peter warns his squabbling followers, "If we destroy this stronghold of eternal change, the world will plunge into historical materialism!"<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> . The venerable patriarch's very words, of course, run counter to his intention. The play reverses the usual terms of reference by placing the "ideal" directly onstage. What we see is a distinctly bourgeois afterlife in which the Garças practice phrases in English, titter over off-color jokes, and embroider handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>Into this mind-numbingly insipid bliss marches the Poet-Soldier, proclaiming the need to "regenerate humanity" and chastising the Garças for being "damned pacifists! Society of Nations!" . Although the text gives no cues as to costuming, the Poet Soldier quotes Marinetti's mantra ("War is the world's only hygiene!"), and his strident, exclamatory style is a dead give-away. This is not Italy, however, but the no-man's-land of nationalist ideology. The Poet-Soldier is surely a stand-in for the Italian Futurist, but he is just as surely Plínio Salgado, leader of the Brazilian Integralist Party, whose slogan "God-Country-Family," is parodied in the legend that adorns the set of this tableau: "God-Country-Brothel-Hymen." Here, as throughout the play, Oswald exploits the capacity of a single theatrical image to signify multiple referents in order to draw connections between belief systems and national imaginaries that have been safely ensconced from one another by political and epistemological borders. Rather than multiple manifestations of a single president/people, we see a puppet-like Poet-Soldier raging about the need to "resolve the unemployment crisis of the furies and lightning bolts," a re who could easily be Brazilian, Italian, German, Portuguese, or Argentine . The parallels are not just formal, and the scene is not just about fascism as style. Marinetti, after all, had visited Brazil in 1926; Nazi organizations funded by the German embassy flourished in the south of Brazil; and while Mussolini invoked the sacred homeland, Italian immigrants were struggling to build new lives in São Paulo. By staging the rise of fascism in the realm of the "spiritual," the scene undercuts the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  territorialization of nationalist representation, revealing it to be a phenomenon shaped by historical and material forces whose scope is in fact global.</p>
<p>The ribaldry is cut short by the tableau's surprise ending, the arrival of a giant "aluminum balloon" bearing a black man who proclaims "What a lovely little people!" . What we have here, it seems, is a futuristic reversal of the conquest scenario. But colonial domination is predicated upon the impossibility of its own reversal—a black man cannot step in to the conqueror's role and remain unscathed. In the following tableau, which takes place inside the spaceship, we learn that its inventor Professor Icar has been "disembodied" by the Poet-Soldier. When the Garças protest that Icar was just a harmless "chocolate Aryan" who got burned by flying too close to the sun (a wink to his Greek predecessor Icarus), the Poet accuses them of having illicit desires that could "damage the race"; he goes on to explain that "if you'd talked to him before about the need for white people to subdue, exploit, and humiliate people of color, maybe he wouldn't have understood. Now he understands. Now we can converse about Civilization, Culture, Imperialism, Capital, Race, and other white subjects" .</p>
<p>Both mass culture and fascist idealism purport to offer this brilliant black bourgeois the "rhetorics of disincorporation" that Michael Warner identifies as necessary to gain access to mass subjecthood.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> But for the black man, rhetoric is <span style="font-style:italic;">either</span> purely false <span style="font-style:italic;">or</span> all too real, and so the learned Professor is now nothing but speech: he is the invisible pilot guiding the vessel through the ether, present only as the Voice of Icar which interrupts the action on occasion to alert the passengers to planets, stars (Greta Garbo is the name of one) and other landmarks along their route. Icar hasn't been disembodied so much as turned inside out: the tableau is titled "The Interior of the Ícaro," and even the Poet-Soldier grudgingly acknowledges that without the black man's novel invention and navigational skills they would all disperse into the nothingness of the stratosphere. Although Ícar(o) is both the protective vessel and the labor that keeps the operation afloat, he cannot take his place as an individual subject onstage because, having been deprived of flesh, he can only play the role of the anonymous mass or the purely symbolic. His Voice is an aural signifier of race around which the others members of this mini-society converge, not unlike the voices of samba stars that were transported over the Brazilian airwaves, where they were redefined as the expression of an "authentic" popular identity available to all.</p>
<p>If, as I argue, radio (and mass media more generally) is the invisible "outside" of the first part of this tableau, it becomes the explicit focal point of the final scene. When the device around which they have gathered begins to emit inchoate noises, the Poet Soldier and the Garças are alarmed—it seems that something is afoot "down there," in South America: "THE RADIO: Oooooooooo! The people are invading, they respect nothing!" The Radio goes on to speak of "police," "disorder," and the firing of "shots." Could it be Revolution? the characters wonder. As it turns out, it is just a Brazilian soccer game. "We can rest easy," the Poet-Soldier announces. "The deluded masses are still amusing themselves with that business." But when he turns on the radio again, he picks up a "Bolshevik station" whose announcer is rousing listeners to take up arms in the struggle against capital. Radio, like the mass public it hails, is not reified as a <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  transparent medium of identity but is instead represented as an apparatus that is both the means <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> the object of a struggle whose outcome is not yet certain.</p>
<p>In the following tableau, the spaceship descends to earth and we are presented with a "fascist incarnation": a rapturous apocalypse at the Epsom Derby that involves every power-driven leader and his equestrian sidekick of the past several millennia, both real and fictional. Among the multitudes are Dom Sebastião and Alfonsito V, who expanded Portugal's territories in Africa; Incitatus and Bucephalus (the steeds of Caligula and Alexander the Great); the fourteenth-century Tartar conqueror Tamerlane (known for his love of the arts); Nietzsche and the Wagnerian hero Parsifal, who have decided to mend fences ("Nietzsche converted in the struggle!"); and even Rocinante and Sancho Panza's burro. The Divo has attempted to penetrate the body of one of the jockeys but missed his mark and ended up as a horse talking out of its ass; the real power behind the operation is the Poet-Soldier, the "hero of all homelands" and self-proclaimed embodiment of "Spirit" who rouses the global masses to a feverish passion with bellicose demagoguery, conjuring up a host of mythic symbols that culminates in the car of Juggernaut—"the steamroller of capital"—and a nude Valkyrie wearing a gas mask who runs across the stage and through the audience to the music of Wagner's <span style="font-style:italic;">Lohengrin</span>.</p>
<p>This is a nightmarish version of total theater—described as a "thrilling spectacle," it is the moment when art and reality become one. Or rather, it would be, if the mayhem were seen onstage. Instead, the audience is not allowed to see the horrific sight; the desire for immediacy is denied because all of the action, up until the Valkyrie's mad dash, is said to be taking place behind a wall at the back of the stage. The audience hears the shouts and stampedes, the roar of thunder and cannons and cacophonous speech, including an anonymous voice of resistance crying out that the idealization of war leads the young to "mutilation and death" . Meanwhile, the action is described to us by St. Peter and Icar, who are peering over the wall. As a black bourgeois and a saint who was born a Jew, these two res have no place in the paradigm of identity underlying this fascist, imperialist fantasy; unable to perform the feat of self-abstraction, they possess an inassimilable "positivity" (in Warner's terms) represented in this scene through the use of scenic space. The Voice of the Divo proclaims, "I am the pathos of destruction! For the white race! For the rich class! For cretinous morality! . . . Heil! Duce! Heil! Duce!" and Icar ironically notes, "Luckily I'm no longer black" . The ontological status of St. Peter's body is also in doubt, given that in the previous tableau the Poet-Soldier explained to the Garças that he was secretly leading the saint to his death on earth, where "two days ago in Hitler's Germany the death campaign against the Jews began" .</p>
<p>But how does one <span style="font-style:italic;">perform</span> disembodiment? The text provides no clues, and there is no indication that high-tech resources would have been used to conjure up a convincing illusion. What is clear is that the actor is onstage, because the character is no longer described as a Voice. Icar's dematerialization is not a demonstration of technological power, nor does it show the ability of thought to sublimate the material; the point of the performance is that it fails. The quest for the missing black body becomes <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  a recurring theme that functions as a counterpoint to the overarching narrative of revolutionary triumph—Icar's "widow" eventually shows up with a femur that has been identified as her husband's, though by the end it is no longer certain whether it belongs to Icar or to St. Peter, the converted Jew. As the only characters that reappear throughout the play, Icar, his wife, and St. Peter fulfill the role of onstage spectators through whose lens the audience's view of the epic struggle between fascism and Red revolution is refracted. The audience's attempts to identify with them, however, can only be incomplete and discontinuous, because they are not coherent characters but rather multiplex prisms whose changing nature is defined more by its liminal status in relation to the dominant discourse of the moment than by any inherent qualities. Although they are sympathetic res and are given some of the play's wittiest lines, they are hardly exemplary. Icar, for example, is often subject to the nostalgia of the petit bourgeoisie, but at other times he is the voice of lucidity. His name is the Portuguese acronym for the Roman Catholic Church (<span style="font-style:italic;">Igreja Católica Apostólica Romana</span>), yet during the fascist incarnation, he objects to the injunctions delivered by the Voice of Job and points out, "But it's propaganda for temerity and servility" . During the Revolution, when an international crowd of insurrectionary sailors takes over St. Peter's Ship (a metaphor for the church represented as the Vatican on a raft, which serves as a dance floor presided over by Cleopatra), St. Peter the Jew tries to reassert his role as benevolent patriarch of the Christian faith and convince the masses that they are not prepared to take power. The Red Soldier replies, "all men are prepared to eat and <span style="font-style:italic;">trepar</span> ("to climb," but also a colloquial term for sex) . Icar and St. Peter always seem to be on the cusp of this recognition, but none of the play's contending discourses are capable of incorporating them.</p>
<p>This poses interpretive difficulties, particularly when it comes to the play's treatment of the Soviet Union. Even sympathetic critics have felt it necessary to concede that <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem</span> is marred by a naïvely optimistic view of Communist society and several seemingly propagandistic tableaux, including one called "Industrialization," which features the Voices of Stalin and Eisenstein proclaiming the glories of the utopic society they have created. Sábato Magaldi, for instance, finds it "almost unbelievable" that a humorist of Oswald's nature "let himself be led by political passion" to commit such a lamentable "literary slide."<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> In response, he simply omits any analysis of these tableaux. This refusal to consider that the scenes might indeed have something to do with "art" has its political corollary in the myth of a monolithic left, a distortion of history that is belied by the debates that were taking place at the Clube dos Artistas Modernos when <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem</span> was written. Magaldi's judgment is hardly equivalent to the repressive power that shut down the stage where these tableaux were to have been performed, but it does rely on and reinforce distinctions that this earlier police action helped create. It reinscribes a mirror-like opposition between politics and aesthetics that leaves the limits of literary-critical discourse safely intact—by erasing the mediating factor of theatrical representation.</p>
<p>In fact, what is most notable about "Industrialization" is that the "ideal" world the Soviet leader and the filmmaker claim to have created can only exist outside the space of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  scenic representation; their disembodied voices boom out across a stage that represents "the monumental entrance to the biggest factory in the socialist world" . Standing at the door, watching the happy workers entering and exiting, are representatives of the past ("we are the end of a world"): Icar, St. Peter, now playing a <span style="font-style:italic;">sanfona</span> (a type of accordion from the rural northwest of Brazil) and Madame Icar, who wears her husband's femur around her neck (looking, perhaps, like the stereotype of an indigenous savage). Once again, they are slapstick res whose rhetorical inversions draw attention to the bodies we continue to see, though they no longer exist:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>ST. PETER: I was the eyes of the blind…now I'm a blind man with no eyes.</p>
<p>ICAR: I was the legs of the legless…now I have no legs.</p>
<p>MADAME ICAR: I used to have a husband and a home.</p>
<p>ICAR AND ST. PETER: Now you have two husbands and no home!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As they listen to the invisible Voice of Stalin speak of the new world that is emerging out of the "pathos of construction" , the three characters scoff at his hubris. "Can man, even when he possesses a consummate science, possibly compare himself to God?" asks the pious Madame Icar. The fact that they invoke a religious creed that is also an object of critique does not mean that the audience is intended to discount their words. St. Peter once again takes on the role of prophet: "They'll be forced to condemn their own madness. Their confidence is like a spider web in the hands of the Lord! They'll rest upon their work and it won't have consistency. They'll want to maintain it and it won't hold up!"  One has to wonder: if the purpose of the scene is nothing more than propaganda, what are these naysayers doing here?</p>
<p>Standing in stark contrast to their humorous dialogue is the Voice of Eisenstein, which comes at the end of the tableau and is followed by nothing but "Silence." His lengthy speech is a laundry list of the gains won by the agricultural revolution, phrases that could have been pulled straight from the Soviet posters that adorned CAM's walls: (<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>)</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Fertilizing manure, herds, agricultural machines, all raising the statistics. Neither the fire of revolt nor the great revolutionary struggle. But, after the struggle, the daily life of those who work and build a better life . . . the herds that are organized, the seed selection maps, the diagrams of progress . . . Model farms. Laboratories, schools. The worker-student, the peasant-student. The conscious, selected reproduction of animal species. The end of magic. The tractor . . .</p>
<div class="attrib"></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">What we hear is a representation, not of the style of Eisenstein's avant-garde films but of their social function. This is art that has been thoroughly instrumentalized and placed in the service of the state, art that is no longer distinguishable from political power. Without <span style="font-style:italic;">necessarily</span> undermining the theoretical validity of the ideal to which Eisenstein gives voice (such a judgment must remain contingent on the play's performance), the tableau very conspicuously refuses to realize it onstage. The happy, productive workers go through the door and out of sight; the people they leave behind are those who, as <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Oswald said of himself, stand "outside the revolutionary axis of the world."<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> But imperialism is the axis on which this play's world turns, and it is fitting that this tableau is at its center given that Stalin's declaration of the need to build "socialism in one state" formalized a historic split between the struggle for socialism and the struggle against imperialism. Over the loudspeakers and through the giant factory door we get a glimpse of what lies on the outside of the play—the move to enforce a social realist aesthetic and what Boris Groys has called the "total art of Stalinism."<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> In contrast, what takes place within this scene is not a reflection but, in Trotsky's words, a "deflection, a changing and a transformation of reality in accordance with the peculiar laws of art."<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem</span> gives us neither politics as a total work of art, nor total theatricality, but a theatrical vision of totality—rather than "dematerializing" the stage, as was Piscator's <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  aim, Oswald materializes it, juxtaposing and superimposing historical and cultural references from around the world and across two thousand years. What we get is not Wagner, despite his characters' frequent appearances; rather, <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem</span> takes Benjamin's analysis of the Trauerspiel, the Baroque "mourning play" composed of dialectical images, fragments, and ruins, and returns it to the stage. <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem</span> makes a mock-heroic effort to gather together Christianity, Capitalism, Imperialism, Art, Mass Culture, and Fascism, to overcome the contradictions of history by embodying them onstage and in the colloquial language of 1930s Brazil. The Marxist theory that several of the characters cite serves a didactic function, and the teleological impulse is by no means abandoned. But the play's raucous humor, as well as its critical insight, is a result of the tension between its own aspirations and what is actually achieved onstage.</p>
<p>This becomes evident in the second instance of "total theater," which occurs after the socialist revolution, on Judgment Day, when Christ himself is brought to trial for a series of heinous crimes that include colluding with Roman Imperialism, serving as an agent of the reformist Second International, and, in the guise of the Emperor Constantine, coining the favored motto of all "historic fascisms"—"Let's make the revolution before the people do it" (a quote whose real author was a Brazilian ally of Vargas).<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> The tribunal is held in the former hall of the Nobel Prize, though the backdrop depicts two crosses at Golgotha. Here, at the moment when history itself is to be transcended, the stage and the audience are joined together and numerous characters are seated in the audience, among them biblical res, artists, fictional characters and anonymous spectators who weigh in on the trial while shouting the slogans of political parties in Brazil. For the theatrical audience, the effect would surely be one of immediacy and excitement; what is immediately experienced, however, is how capitalism divides the world in the very process of making it whole.</p>
<p>What drives this sprawling tableau is the attempt to capture the process through which what was once revolutionary comes to serve the cause of reaction. In the first scene, we see the biblical character Veronica (the "true image"), now a photographer and proponent of state cinema, who holds up a large ID photo of Christ that shows Hitler crucified on a Swastika—"the final incarnation of anti-Semitism" . <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem</span> thus takes the core of the medieval mystery, its most troubling aspect and the one that led Hitler to celebrate the production at Oberammergau as an expression of the Aryan spirit, and turns it on its head. Instead of the Jews killing Jesus, Jesus is the killer of Jews. Yet there is also Barabbas, the sidekick of Mary Magdalene (now a cubist) and leader of the Jewish "nationalist" resistance against the Roman Empire, whom the people chose over Jesus when given the chance to save one prisoner from death; once a revolutionary, he is now "Baron Barabbas Rothschild," a reference to the French capitalist who sponsored Jewish settlement in Palestine in order to establish large plantations that relied on cheap Arab labor.</p>
<p>Of particular concern throughout is the way in which both high art and popular culture are used to serve the interests of the state. In one encounter Fu-Man-Chu, the pulp fiction and film character known as the Yellow Peril, rises up out of a hole in the floor from among the spectators and shouts that he had started life as a Taoist, wanting <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  to transform the world without bloodshed; instead, Imperialism has transformed him into a "cagey beast." He gets into a scuffle with D'Artagnan, whom he calls a "Lackey! Product of the domestication of the masses!" and in response, D'Artagnan hurls racist epithets at him while bragging, "today I'm a mass phenomenon! Hitler! Mussolini! Gustavo Garapa!" (This last name is a derisive allusion to Gustavo Barroso, president of the Academia Brasileira de Letras and one of the most fiercely anti-Semitic Integralists.) D'Artagnan pursues the Chinese man backstage, though the English Novelist assures the audience, "Oh! They'll end up reconciling offstage" . Rather than a move to transcend politics theatrically, we get a reminder of what is <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> seen or transformed onstage and in the presence of the audience. The aim is not to create a "totality of effect" within the theater's four walls; on the contrary, it is to uncover the totality of social relations that defines the spectators' position in a global system that cannot be revolutionized by "art" alone, precisely because of the integral role that art plays within it.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> does not end with the grand apotheosis that typically capped off revistas, or with the merging of actors and audience that comes at the end of <span style="font-style:italic;">Mystery-Bouffe</span>. Instead, the final tableau brings us back to the strange ménage-àtrois of St. Peter, Icar, and his wife, who are in a waiting room of the Interplanetary Railway, which connects the Socialist Earth (now the Red Planet) to Mars (home of reactionaries and boyscouts) by means of the spaceship invented by Icar. These marginal res have been reduced to begging for coins under the watchful eyes of the GPU, the secret police of the Soviet state. "We are Marx's impoverished proletariat," Icar sighs . In one of the play's oddly prophetic moments, they mention that a radio announcer has just broken the news of Hitler's suicide—a path that Getúlio Vargas, too, would take in August 1954 when faced with a military coup. Icar plunges into space, shouting that in death he can be the "hero of Wagner, of Jules Verne." St. Peter offers, "I'll play our funeral. The funeral of a world" and cranks out Siegfried's funeral march on his accordion. His last words, arms raised toward the heavens, are: "We have been judged!" </p>
<p>The critic Sábato Magaldi was correct when he stated that this sprawling spectacle "doesn't even seem to belong to the reality of Brazilian theater." To this I would only add that Brazilian theater is itself an idea whose reality would not come to seem self-evident until sometime after 1937, the year Vargas declared the Estado Novo dictatorship and, a month later, created the Serviço do Teatro Nacional. The wanderings of St. Peter, Icar, and the Missus confirm the necessity of considering the avant-garde as part of a global totality; indeed, the play insists that from the very beginning the avant-garde was a "transnational" phenomenon. Yet the play also reveals that it was in the act of being integrated into a single system that the deepest divisions within the vanguard were sown. If <span style="font-style:italic;">O Homem e o Cavalo</span> is difficult to understand within the contours of Brazilian theater, and if it leaves the few critics who discuss the play struggling to contain it within the limits of literary discourse, it is because it lies in the middle of a critical split—a "transition" between "the war horse and the turf horse (bourgeois society) and horsepower (socialist society)"—that was never realized on the world stage. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>Sapere, December 15, 1937</p>
<p>"At the height of his power," said Paul Valéry, "Louis XIV did not possess one one-hundredth of the dominance over nature and the means to entertain himself and exercise his own mind with the sensations that people of rather modest means possess today." The gramophone has transformed our home into a sumptuous hall where it is possible to hear the world's most beautiful concerts. Radio brings the setting and voices of public events, stadiums, and the opera stage into our living rooms. Tomorrow, television will allow us to enjoy at home what we see today on the movie screen: adventures, pleasant heroes, and faraway places.</p>
<p>The social and cultural impact of these new media is unprecedented, despite the many adversaries who defend their hostility by marshalling an array of plausible objections and who would condemn the machines we are so proud of to burning at the stake. But if idolatry of progress is a commonplace—we cite Valéry again—so is the idolatry of progress qua curse. Every new development, be it material or of the mind, is to some degree dangerous because it tends toward uncontrolled generalization. It is therefore necessary, for practical reasons among others, to define the boundaries within which a new medium can yield benefits that couldn't be attained without it, and the limits beyond which it remains inferior to traditional means.</p>
<p>No one would find it odd to praise the light bulb. But how can one deny the calm serenity that dim light brings to an absorbing conversation? The typewriter is extremely convenient. But surely we wouldn't want to see the disappearance of something as significant and personal as handwriting. Appreciating transport by car doesn't necessarily mean renouncing the joys of a stroll on foot. If the truth be known, it is not new media in themselves that are tyrannical, but rather our minds, tending as they do to reduce everything to a single formula in the name of a natural but hardly commendable idleness.</p>
<p>Something in the nature of progress seduces us to betray the values of the past. We don't know if gramophones are already playing lullabies alongside cradles. Hopefully not. Even the voice of the soprano Toti dal Monte couldn't replace a mother's voice. This is what is essential: to recognize the irreplaceability of a maternal lullaby, even as we recognize the gramophone as unprecedented.</p>
<p>So the gramophone, radio, and television require discipline and their very efficacy as instruments depends upon economical use. They are media for the concentration and elevation of the mind, reserved for rare and precious hours. For this reason, their use should remain more limited than, say, that of eye-glasses or zippers. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The gramophone, for example, requires special care in order to fulfill its capabili ties. It is not enough simply to change the needle after each record and to release the spring each time the device is shut down. First, one needs to be meticulous in the choice of records: not only because few pockets are deep enough to allow for wasteful spending, but because, like a rotten pear forgotten cast among healthy pears, the mediocre, when mixed with the good, spoils it. If we prefer Beethoven interpreted by de Sabata, why purchase a recording with a different conductor just because the salesperson recommends it? If you like Louis Armstrong's jazz music, don't take home a Jack Hylton album. Be insistent. Don't buy any album of which you aren't 100% convinced: the range of choices is so large that it is certainly always possible to find "your" album. Those who choose quickly or in a room in which four people are listening to four different records simultaneously will regret it immediately and every time they catch a glimpse of the album thereafter.</p>
<p>Never tolerate any object in your home that doesn't wholly correspond to the demands of your mind! This said, it is also important to avoid dogmatism: the inertia that often limits the choice of records to determined genres even when our personal receptive capacity could accommodate a much wider range. To embrace the facile mania and fury of the collector-purist who collects all the records belonging to a given genre and nothing else, is in fact a poor choice. Those who prefer opera singers should also have the courage to try chamber music; the jazz fanatic should be prepared to listen also to beautiful folk songs.</p>
<p>But selectivity is not enough. If the inspiration to sing or whistle a melody seizes you, the song that will most often come to your lips is one appropriate to the "atmosphere" of the moment. The record, however, is not a product of the moment and, for this reason, it has the potential to become unbearable when played in a different time and place. Wagner's <span style="font-style:italic;">Tristan</span> is not for summer mornings. And when your guests have become giddy from drinking wine, it would be unsuitable to play the Palestrina Chorus; just as it would be indiscrete and even useless to interrupt an animated and perhaps too lengthy philosophical discussion with a new song by Ginger Rogers. Turn to the gramophone when the conversation falls silent and choose a record that suits your guests and their mood. Never impose a record, even an excellent one purchased the day before, at all costs. Once the gramophone is playing, however, you must offer it the same courtesy owed a human being: when the music speaks, others should be quiet and listen—a practice it is important to communicate to children. This of course becomes possible only when every now and then, instead of playing the gramophone for hours on end, people are discretely allowed to chat, to sing, and to pull out an old violin—if there is one –from the cabinet, or a good book from the library.</p>
<p>The gramophone requires an act of choice; radio allows for choice but doesn't demand it. If you are so inclined, you can simply rotate the dial through a sequence of random stations until you decide to stop. There are those who turn on the radio just after returning home from the office and do not turn it off until the last station goes off the air for the night. There are those who are no longer capable of reading the newspaper without words, songs, or laughter from the radio. This is a symptom of mental laxity and nervousness that destroys every possibility for genuine attention and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  artistic enjoyment. Used in this way, the radio becomes a tyrant that suffocates every form of human activity and spontaneity.</p>
<p>Radio, however, can become a precious instrument when we take full advantage of its unique and irreplaceable features. There is no faster way to bring the latest news home than electric waves. But editorials are better suited to newspapers and essays to magazines, because one can read more attentively as a function of one's speed of comprehension, which varies from reader to reader. When a speech by an important person is broadcast on the radio, you very quickly make his acquaintance. Listen to his voice and, for the rest of your life, you will understand his works and actions more adequately. The radio allows you to learn languages: take advantage of this opportunity, since no manual will allow you to hear accent and pronunciation. But you must not listen distractedly as you perform other actions. He who becomes accustomed to half listening fools himself into believing that he has lived his life in full when has only half lived, as it were, through a single ear. It is precisely the radio's tolerance for all sorts of distraction, which is only rarely punished, that underscores the need for self-discipline.</p>
<p>Just as your record collection is an expression of your tastes, let radio programs be a place for experimentation. You will probably never buy a record of Japanese music. But if the radio offers you a concert from Tokyo, listen to see if your spirit is open to this unfamiliar experience. A lecture on an issue in which you've never taken an interest could provide you with an unexpected perspective. If the lecture engages you, go on to deepen your knowledge through books, for it is an illusion to believe that radio programs, limited as they are to presenting diverse topics in quick succession, can offer more than an introduction. Having a superficial knowledge in all fields does not mean possessing encyclopedic knowledge: rather, it characterizes the type of person who talks about everything but knows nothing.</p>
<p>Radio programming cannot be "organic" like a concert or a magazine. It offers a classical music concert followed by a sequence of dance music, not because these two genres go together but because while you listen with pleasure to Casella, a listener on another floor is waiting to dance. Don't forget your neighbors. Radio offers the possibility for a magnificent apprenticeship in demonstrating due respect to those around you. Blasting the speaker so loudly that it shrieks like a jungle full of wild beasts shows a lack of consideration, for there are those who would prefer to have their rugs and jewels stolen in silence, which is a necessary precondition for rest, reflection, and work. Furthermore, it is erroneous to believe the louder the volume, the sharper the sound. Physiology teaches us that past a certain threshold, acoustic sensations become painful and that continuous noise fatigues the nerves. If the human voice is over-amplified, it loses its character, and music loses its meaning. And a man who lives only through the superlative becomes poor because he no longer has the crescendo at his disposal.</p>
<p>The time has come to also briefly mention the telephone. Like a voice on the radio, a phone voice also emanates from afar and, for this reason, one who calls can't always be certain they'll be well received. Nevertheless, it is always possible to demonstrate a certain "respect" accorded to the recipient of the call. On this subject, radio, addressed <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  as it is to all, must follow common sense rules: for example, not broadcasting the latest news at three in the morning. But when one calls a friend whose daily routine, character, and current circumstances are more or less known by the caller, one can at least avoid calling during the hours of work, sleep, or meals. Living with others presupposes that each person be allowed a few hours of discrete solitude. Because the telephone has rendered the walls of our houses invisible and the doorman's obstinacy useless, it should for these very reasons be used sparingly.</p>
<p>Still, there are those who cannot resist the ring of the telephone, shrill as it is, even in the moments least appropriate for phone calls. A device that could temporarily suspend all calls, somehow informing the caller that the recipient would welcome the call at another time, would surely make a profit. But a partial remedy can be imagined without any special recourse to technology: keeping telephones far away from desks, dining rooms, or beds. At home, phone calls should always be answered by the person who is least busy at the moment, and no one should be offended by the polite request to postpone a call. Only in this way can the possibility of communicating at a distance at any time and with anyone be considered an genuine advancement. In some cases, it might be nice to be able to exchange words with a far-away friend every half hour. In others, it might be pleasurable for both speaker and listener to have a lengthy conversation, whether practical in nature or not. But there can be little doubt that finding a line continually busy when one needs to make an urgent, practical, necessary call can drive somebody crazy. The truth of the matter is that telephoning is a delicious vice: not so delicious, however, that one can't schedule an appointment between two businessmen, or pack a twenty-minute conversation and all the preambles of a formal letter into a few moments. Using a telephone may appear self-evident. But there are those who in the span of their lifetime are fated never to learn.</p>
<p>Within a few short years, we will be able to sit before the television screen and witness political meetings, horse races, and film projections in the privacy of our homes. In some respects, the discipline required by the medium of television will be greater than that required by the radio, because the former will engage not only our hearing but also our vision (which, currently idle, can busy itself with other distractions, drawing our attention away from the act of audition). In others respects, much like its counterparts, this new medium will prove valuable only when approached with discretion. The gramophone and the radio rely on hearing; they employ abstract means, such as language and music. Television allows the direct witnessing from home of the scope and scale of things and events. It will give rise to the same criticisms once leveled at the cinema. Everyone recognizes film's contributions to culture and the arts. But it is no less obvious that the cinema can also seduce us with crude and frivolous amusements.</p>
<p>Radio programs contain very little in the way of immediately palpable reality or raw material. Consequently, radio—as a more restrictive medium dominated by the concepts that accompany words and by the indeterminate emotions prompted by music—is endowed with a higher spiritual character than are films. Will radio lose ground when image and sound are combined in our homes? Undoubtedly, such a danger can't be excluded. It is precisely for this reason that we must anticipate the <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  future need to discipline this new instrument so as to exalt its positive and eliminate its negative effects.</p>
<p>Like Goethe's sorcerer's apprentice, man, the ruler of space and time, whose voice now crosses oceans and whose ears now enjoy the songs of artists buried long ago, runs the risk of losing sovereignty over the great minds that have been placed in his service unless he exercises his will against the seductions of inertia and passivity. The freedoms associated with these most powerful tools of our times can be achieved only though the rigorous disciplining of our needs and desires. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>
	The final page of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>, the breakthrough 1935 novel by Indo-Anglian author Mulk Raj Anand, contains a two-line paraph: “Simla—S.S. <span style="font-style:italic;">Viceroy of India</span>—Bloomsbury” reads the first of these lines. “<span style="font-style:italic;">September–October</span> 1933” reads the second.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> A flourish below the novel’s main text, these lines inscribe place and date on its outer threshold in the place of the author’s signature. The novel’s placing describes the arc of a hyphenated international trajectory. It is a novel on the move. Simla: Himalayan summer capital of the British empire; S.S. <span style="font-style:italic;">Viceroy of India: Peninsula and Oriental</span>’s ultra-modern flagship ocean liner of the 1920s and 30s on the Bombay to London line; Bloomsbury: heart of the British literary avant-garde, and a milieu to which Anand was, more or less ambivalently, attached.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> The itinerary moves from the clubbish leisure-spaces of the colony’s center to the artistic heart of the metropolis, via a vehicle appropriately carrying the title of the representative of sovereign power in the subcontinent.
      </p>
<p>
	The date puts the book in relation to the notorious White Paper on proposals for Indian constitutional reform of 1933, which was to become the basis of the 1935 Government of India Act. The White Paper was regarded in India as a continuation of autocratic British rule in the guise of a concession of (semi-) autonomous federated democratic structures for India.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> In  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Letters on India</span> , his epistolary critique of the imperial regime, Anand himself gave a ferocious account of the semblance of “democracy” inaugurated by the 1935 Act.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Anand tabulates the “checks against the intrusion of democracy” incorporated into an Act that claimed to introduce constitutionality.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> The White Paper and the India Act came in the wake of the Gandhi-Irwin pact, the mysterious compromise made by Gandhi in 1931 during the Round Table negotiations with representatives of the British government. In 1931, Gandhi called off the powerful Civil Disobedience campaign which had held the promise of wresting real concessions from the British. “Towards the end of 1930,” writes Sumit Sarkar,
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  A contradiction was emerging at the heart of Civil Disobedience: certain forms of struggle more definitely in the control of the bourgeoisie or its dependent allies . . . were definitely weakening, while there was a possibility that other, less manageable forms (like no-rent, or tribal outbursts) might gather strength. It was at this point that bourgeois pressures for a compromise became insistent.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Sarkar goes on to detail what may have determined these “bourgeois pressures,” including the Indian middle class’ international economic ties with the metropolis, and suggests the extent to which a whole series of alternative possibilities (“like no-rent or tribal outbursts”) was thereby closed off.
      </p>
<p>
	Although Anand had completed a manuscript of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> well before 1933, he chose to inscribe that date on the last page.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> The wager of this gesture is not merely that of tying the novel to a specific year. The paraph rather lifts the novel out of an empirically indeterminate earlier time of writing, reflecting also a desired trajectory (not “homewards,” as in the novel’s final line, but rather colony-to-metropolis), as well as the necessity of that trajectory’s errancy.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> The novel’s journey can never be contained by place and date; it will not necessarily “arrive” in Bloomsbury. Moreover, the printed text of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> is framed by <span style="font-style:italic;">two</span> dates: 1935, the date of publication at the beginning, and the 1933 of the paraph at the end.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> This possibly inadvertent framing emblematizes the errancy of the novel’s travels, allowing us to read <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> as an alternative narrative filling-out of the time it took for the 1933 White Paper to become the 1935 Act. While this was the time it took for the strange compromise of Gandhi-Irwin to become institutionalized as law, the timing of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> tells a different story of those years. Anand, in trying to establish a counter-connection between colony and metropolis, charts a route which ultimately seeks to reveal what was left out in the 1931 pact between Gandhi and Irwin. For example, some of the metonymic res of Sarkar’s “tribal outbursts,” and the varied subaltern hopes and desires invested in the image of Gandhi, reappear in the untouchables of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>, and specifically in connection with the appearance of Gandhi as both icon and written text.
      </p>
<p>
	1935 also marks the founding date of the All-India Progressive Writers’ Association (PWA) in the heart of Bloomsbury. Anand was a key founding member. The events commemorated by the novel’s frame thus put it in relation both to the high politics of imperialism and to diasporic anti-colonial activism. The PWA would seek to t  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the anti-colonial t in India on the terrain of popular culture. In this context, harsh critics of the novel have claimed that Anand’s Marxism enters into a fatal conjunction with inherited class/caste superiority to produce an example of the “paternalist elitism” of a detached vanguard; or that <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> “makes no place for . . . oppositional activity,” denies “power and agency” to the subaltern protagonist, and ultimately masks the political activities of the “untouchable leadership” in 1930s India.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Alternatively, critics have praised <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> for its “photographic fidelity” of realist representation, for placing “a certain previously invisible population of Indian society on the map.”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> This essay concerns itself with how the language and representations of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> both address its 1933/1935 frame and exceed it. How are a) the subaltern movements indicated by Sarkar, and b) the hopes of the PWA, reflected in the language and rhetoric of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> as it takes aim at Bloomsbury?
      </p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>’s final paraph confirms what the novel has been telling us all along: it marks the desire to carry the periphery to the metropolis so as to inscribe and make visible the unknown, excremental abjection of the colonial margin in the aesthetic heart of the center. “I had to journey away from the Bloomsbury literary consciousness to the non-literary worlds” writes Anand subsequently, but it is this journey away that makes possible the turning, troping movement of a literary return.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> The gesture of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> is one of connection, of undoing the symbolic opposition between colony and metropole, and the first movement of its gesture is a staging of a parallel relation of dis/connection within the colony itself: a topography of an “outcastes’ colony” both outside a town and supplementary to it, necessary for its functioning (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 9). <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>’s opening paragraph shockingly depicts the outcaste colony as an abject, stinking pile of excrement and refuse on the margins of the town and the military cantonment, “outside their boundaries and separate from them,” as the extradiegetic narrator of this passage tells us (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 9). The colony is “under the shadow both of the town and the cantonment,” and these latter, like some rative pair of buttocks suspended above the untouchables’ colony, squeeze out their waste products onto it (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 9). Anand is, almost as a matter of course, accused of being a “bad” writer by his critics, and this particular image has itself been singled out for its “inexacti[itude].”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Shit writing indeed. These opening motifs (and the jolting style), which recur throughout the novel, summarize the relation of the untouchables to the society whose waste they clean up. They also allegorize, for the implied Bloomsbury reader, a relation between metropolis and “colony.” Yet by depicting the (untouchable) “colony” as an internally partitioned space <span style="font-style:italic;">within</span> the (Indian) “colony,” the novel carefully undoes the possibility of making excrementality a common point of identification for the subjects of British imperialism. “Indians” are internally divided <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> divided as a whole from the metropole, but these fissures are not symmetrical. It is this complex relation of separation and articulation that weaves together the novel’s language, its representations of subalternity, and its eccentric relation to the literary project of the PWA.
      </p>
<p>
	The lotus in the dung heap of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> is the main protagonist Bakha, the generically eponymous untouchable latrine cleaner of the title. But in spite of its experimental and didactic exposé of the conditions of the marginalized in the colony,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> does not fulminate against colonialism. At first glance, it is the rigidities of the caste system and its ancient taboos on contamination that the book seeks to stage and criticize. As in the previously quoted passage, the narrator pulls back from focalizing Bakha’s thought-world in order to name a problem, here the “six thousand years of racial and class superiority” oppressing him (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 16). The colonial military system becomes, for Bakha and his friends, the promissory re of a desired equality unattainable in the caste Hindu world. Indeed this cathexis of military equality, the narrator tells us, cuts across the lines of caste, so that “[t]he consciousness of every child was full of a desire to wear Western dress” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 101). Towards the end, the novel focalizes a Brahmin babu’s young son during a hockey match. The child wishes he too could take part and “wear shorts . . . And he would look like a real sahib because he was not so dark” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 114).
      </p>
<p>
	Bakha’s work on the British barracks puts him in contact with the white soldiers. “The Tommies had treated him as a human being and he had learnt to think of himself as superior to his fellow-outcastes” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 9). This non-sequitur asks to be read as a species of anacoluthon—a particular type of shift in rhetorical register, or a break in the expectations set up by a syntactical or semantic pattern. Universalist equality (“human being”) is conjoined with hierarchical ranking (“superior”). The conjunction “and” suggests a weak logical causality between the first and second sections of the sentence. Indeed, the particular and ironic quality of the anacoluthon in this case hinges on the coordinating conjunction. Rather than being deployed, as one expects, to articulate two <span style="font-style:italic;">equal</span> units, the coordinator “and” is here itself used to signify a logical hierarchy (in the manner of an “if—then” construction). Bakha feels superior because he is treated as a human being. In the ideology of liberal humanism, the feeling of superiority to other human beings is not supposed to be the consequence of being treated like a human being. This semantic and logical abyss warns the reader from the very outset that the colonial promise of universalism is a lie, and is not a viable solution to the predicament of untouchability. A good part of the novel is spent in unraveling this particular double bind through the narrative construction of Bakha’s subjectivity.
      </p>
<p>
	The lesson of colonialism is thus presented from the novel’s opening page as profoundly paradoxical: it is a matter of both equality <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> superiority. <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> anticipates what historian Partha Chatterjee will later call the “rule of colonial difference,” the production of the colony as the “exception” which paradoxically vindicates the metropolitan’s own theory of itself as a representation of the universal.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Bakha can only join this “universal”—become a human being—by reimposing a law of hierarchical difference upon the other untouchables, by ratively taking the first step in becoming a colonial sub-oppressor.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> The narrative does not stage Bakha taking the road of sub-oppression, but rather treats his “mimic man” tendency with pathos and humor.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> He accedes to an awakening consciousness of shared humanity as well as expressing contempt for the abjectness of his untouchable fellows. It is a real historical paradox that colonialism did have an emancipatory aspect for India’s lower castes, and the novel acknowledges this. But it also, from the start, writes in the aporia that the humanist expression of equality comprises when transposed into colonial space.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	This aporia is emblematized by Bakha himself, the bricoleur who pieces together a version of a British army uniform. Its “clear cut” lines and “stark simplicity” ring for him a desired superiority to the abjection of the untouchable’s world, something better than the “formless,” the “greasy,” the “dense,” the “thick,” the “discolored” and the “patched” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 10–13). Bakha’s colonial transvestism echoes and displaces that found in earlier literary works such as Rudyard Kipling’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Kim</span>  and Rabindranath Tagore’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Gora</span> . In <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> though, there is no commentary on the anglo-Indian hybrid as the real Indian, as there is in Kipling and Tagore. It is rather through the fantasmatic appearance of Gandhi at the very end of the novel that the <span style="font-style:italic;">non</span>-caste (the outcaste) will eventually be depicted as <span style="font-style:italic;">failing</span> to accede to national or representative Indian-ness, even as Gandhism alienates him from his identification with the whites. It is with the appearance of Gandhi that the novel’s knot connecting high imperial politics, diasporic activism, and the novelistic representation of subalternity will become clear.
      </p>
<p>
	But before this point, it is in the motif of Bakha’s transvestite attire that contact with the colonial army is depicted as bringing Bakha’s subalternity to crisis. The subalternity of the urban untouchable passes through the aporia in a particular way, and in so doing it overflows itself into another semiotic: clean cut military lines displace the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lumpen</span>, the rags and tatters, of subalternity. This is the point at which the novel depicts the colonially engendered possibility of human equality for the lowest castes in India based on a coding of the outward signs of the body. Colonialism as <span style="font-style:italic;">pharmakon</span>—both poison and cure—is acknowledged by the novel’s narrator, expressing the work’s powerful insight into the destabilization of the protagonist’s subaltern status: “He was a pioneer in his own way,” says the narrator of Bakha, “although he had never heard of that word, and was completely unconscious that it could be applied to him” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 78).
      </p>
<p>
	The staging of Bakha’s admiring imitation of the British soldiers also articulates a haphazard parallel with the language of the novel itself, English. Right from the start of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>, the novel’s English is ironized as a kind of self-defeating, transvestite medium, for the moment precisely <span style="font-style:italic;">un</span>-suited to the task of accessing and giving voice to subaltern consciousness and idiom. Indeed, Anand underlines this connection by dramatizing Bakha’s own desire to speak English: “he had felt a burning desire, while he was in the British barracks, to speak the <span style="font-style:italic;">tish-mish, tish-mish</span> which the Tommies spoke” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 39). The novel represents a displacement of the sound of English (the language in which it is written) as meaningless onomatopoeia, and thus as a lingual space as yet inaccessible to the very subaltern whose consciousness is being depicted in that language. The few pages around the “<span style="font-style:italic;">tish-mish</span>” quotation become a constellation of references to literacy, and the desire for it, and thus a cathexis of literacy (not simply of English) is also made a signifier of the crisis of subalternity (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 38–46).<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> is part of what, in the space of a few years, would be the emergence of the second wave of Indo-Anglian fiction: <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> , R.K. Narayan’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Swami and Friends</span> , Anand’s own <span style="font-style:italic;">Coolie</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Two Leaves and a Bud</span> , and Raja Rao’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Kanthapura</span> , to name the best-known examples. <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>’s imaginative relationship to the vernacular it mimes is deliberately awkward, wrenching,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> embarrassing: “You lover of your mother,” shrieks Bakha’s father; “You annoy me with your silence, you illegally begotten! You eater of dung and drinker of urine!”; “May the vessel of your life never float in the sea of existence,” yell two angry women of different caste and class positions at different moments (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 10, 25, 71). Anand could not have put “motherfucker” (i.e. what “lover of your mother” must more literally be intended to translate) into the mouths of his characters, but the many techniques he uses to render the vernacular make the reader painfully aware of the lack of fit between the various levels of street Hindi or Punjabi and English.
      </p>
<p>
	A digest of these fascinating techniques would include: insertion of untranslated fragments of Punjabi (“I don’t know what the <span style="font-style:italic;">kalijugs</span> of this age is coming to” [<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 48]); Punjabi sentences or phrases cited with translations in parentheses (“It is on account of this that the goras white men call them <span style="font-style:italic;">kala log zamin par hagne wala</span> (black man, you who relieve yourself on the ground)” [<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 19]); literal translations of Punjabi (“<span style="font-style:italic;">why do you eat my head?</span>” [<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 32]); simulation of Punjabi syntax (“You sweepers have lifted your heads to the skies, nowadays” [<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 72]); explanatory footnotes (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">passim</span>); and mispronounced English words, such as “gentreman” for “gentleman” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 16). All of the above are set in a consistent extradiegetic narratorial voice written in “normal” English prose.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Indo-Anglian novels of this second, pre-independence wave have a complex variety of relationships to the various Indian languages they engage in English.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Both <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> and Rao’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Kanthapura</span> anticipate in different ways the spectacularly staged appropriation of English as an Indian(ized) language in G.V. Desani’s <span style="font-style:italic;">All about H. Hatterr</span> . But such an appropriation is not really the agenda of either of these two earlier, pre-independence novels. While <span style="font-style:italic;">Kanthapura</span> lovingly simulates the Kannada language as a lost object, miming its rhythms and syntax, <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> experiments with “bad” writing, with awkward stiltedness and interruption, to make vivid a problem of disarticulation between two languages and two spaces. Bakha’s thought-world, however, is represented in a language continuous with that of the narrator:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	  He didn’t like his home, his street, his town, because he had been to work at the Tommies’ barracks, and obtained glimpses of another world, strange and beautiful; he had grown out of his native shoes into the ammunition boots that he had secured as a gift.
	</p>
<div class="attrib">
	  (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 78)
	</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  This quasi-prosopopeic narration of states of affect and thought is perhaps another gesture toward the paradoxical (un-)representability of a shared humanity under colonial conditions.
	</p>
<p>
	  It is at the level of the imagery and philosophy of the subaltern orality of gossip and rumor that the novel presents a different kind of discursive discontinuity with such apparently smooth representations of consciousness. At a crucial moment in the narrative, to which we return in the final sections of this essay, the novel breaks with the continuity between the narrator’s voice and the language used to represent Bakha’s thought world. In the other awkward experiments with idiom, <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> depicts the transnational medium of English as being inadequate to the task of reaching the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> subaltern. Thereby, the very vessel being used to carry the horrors of the colony to the heart of the metropolis is ironized, in a double bind which the novel’s closing scenes will attempt to cut. It will be the task of the final pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> to show that Anglophile transvestism is, in fact, <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> a way out of caste oppression, even as it is the sign of the crisis of subalternity.
	</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Engaging Modernism</h1>
<p>
	  We have seen that <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> is neither addressed to the subaltern nor to a popular Indian readership, but is rather written in English so that it will speak to the metropolis. Moreover, it is an experiment with and on modernism. Its desire is both to “write back” the colony to the British metropolis’s exemplary modernist space, as the final paraph suggests, and to find an expression for the common humanity of India’s most marginal res. As Anand wrote in 1972, about himself and Raja Rao in the 1930s, “The English writing intelligentsia of India was . . . a kind of bridge trying to span, symbolically, the two worlds of the Ganga and the Thames through the novel . . . having to transcreate certain human beings into the as yet small third world of international men.”<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> It is a powerful, albeit gender-fixed, argument (though Raja Rao put the story of <span style="font-style:italic;">Kanthapura</span> into the mouth of an elderly, Brahmin, female raconteur). In this 1970s lecture, Anand can invoke the “third world,” the post-Bandung image of a postcolonial international collectivity. He can there inscribe himself and Raja Rao—the other literary example of his essay—as the historically determined precursors of the humanism of Bandung’s third way internationalism. Yet before any available public image of the third world, Anand practiced a transgressive and eccentric modernist idiom in <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>, an idiom that perhaps occupies a more difficult place in the canons of “modernism” than the Joycean colonial modernism which was one of its most profound influences. The capital “U” of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> is readable as an intertextual tribute to <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>—both as a claim on it and an inscription within its discursive space of a re of the untouchable boy “Uka” (another “U,” and one of the res from which Bakha was elaborated). Uka had, in Anand’s words, been the subject of a “simple” and “austere” article by Gandhi in the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Young India</span>, an article which perhaps provoked “a sudden fit of revulsion against my existence, in elitist Bloomsbury” (“Why,” 250).<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Moreover, Gandhi’s article/speech on Uka is quoted almost verbatim at the end of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> as a representation of part of Gandhi’s speech to the crowd (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 146–7). “Uka” thus appears multiply displaced within the fiction of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> itself: as “Bakha,” as a re with whom Bakha identifies during the speech, and as an element of activist documentary reterritorialized and folded back into novel-prose.
	</p>
<p>
	  According to his own account, Anand had set out to transpose what he calls the “stream of consciousness” staged in <span style="font-style:italic;">Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> into a different colonial context and into a subaltern re who would be “the very opposite of Joyce’s” (<span style="font-style:italic;">R&amp;F</span>, 23; 21). Anand attempted to translate Joyce’s deconstructive intervention within novelistic representation into a voiced restitution of a fragmented  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> subalternity: “I would rescue from the obscure slums of the British Indian cantonment, a man of real flesh and blood . . . I would include all the contradictions of his temperament” (<span style="font-style:italic;">R&amp;F</span>, 22). The desire is to show and voice (to focalize) the colonial everyday— “the hell . . . the truth of his subhuman life” (<span style="font-style:italic;">R&amp;F</span>, 23)—not from the position of the colonist, nor from the position of the caste Hindu, but from the “contradictory” and inherently multi-voiced, textualized place of subalternity: “reminiscence, instinctive awareness, and intuition indicated in certain phrases, symbolic words and truncated thoughts” (<span style="font-style:italic;">R&amp;F</span>, 23). The positions of colonial English or caste Hindu are representable as having “contradictions,” too, of course, but Anand’s position is that in fact the subaltern is usually denied this complexity if, indeed, it enters literary representation at all.
	</p>
<p>
	  An Indian <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> could not be written, and to explore the reasons for this would take us too far afield.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> It must be noted that Anand does not simply transpose aspects of Joyce’s technique back into a more obviously “realist” idiom, but hybridizes at both ends. These paradoxes are reflected in the technical dilemmas Anand had writing <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>. His report of the historic visit to Gandhi’s Sabarmati Ashram in 1927 contains a passage describing how his overwrought novelistic discourse is criticized, and then, after a rewrite, validated, by Gandhi himself. On arrival at Sabarmati, Anand showed Gandhi the extant manuscript. As Anand reports Gandhi’s words, “The next day he told me, ‘I have looked at your novel. You seem to use big words. Harijans sigh, moan, groan! They do not use such heavy words. Write in a simpler language and transliterate what they say.’”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> This marks the symbolic passage from <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>’s being an “artificially concocted” work to its being one of “sincerity” (“Why,” 250–1). Gandhi instructs Anand to align the ventriloquist desire for prosopopeia to a more correct mimesis, to voice the subaltern with more accuracy. We have seen the interesting results of this effort as far as the novel’s language goes, where the attempt, in “translation,” to produce a more “realist”-type mimesis of the object imposes “bad” writing, jarring interruption, and reflection on the matter of representation. Any simplistic opposition between “modernism” and “realism” is called into question here, as a consequence of the attempt to capture colonial subalternity in a literary representation. <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>’s ending will register yet another level of subaltern discourse, and, perhaps not coincidentally, introduce a powerful representation of Gandhi himself.
	</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Progressive Writers’ Association</h1>
<p>
	  While <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> was being written “to” London, a group of radicalized Indian graduate students <span style="font-style:italic;">in</span> London was meeting to discuss the possibility of an activist writers’ association for India. Mulk Raj Anand was key among their number. These meetings, and the subsequent organizational activities, laid the groundwork for the formation of the PWA, which held its first conference in Lucknow in 1936. An association explicitly aligned with the Third International’s 1935 project of a Popular Front, the PWA was conceived at the start as part of an internationally articulated cultural movement  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> against fascism. Its locus of operation was primarily in the domain of culture, broadly conceived at the national level, and practically split into regional and linguistic units. The PWA considered the national level of cultural work to be a metonymic part of an international whole, though its early programmatic statements are almost exclusively concerned with national and regional questions.
	</p>
<p>
	  The PWA worked on many fronts, and arguably came into its own in the 1940s with its experiments at the level of popular culture, in cinema and with the Indian Peoples’ Theatre Association (IPTA). As Gayatri Spivak has said of the IPTA’s performances during the Bengal Famine of 1943, “They took performance as the medium of protest . . . What they were performing was the famine and how to organize against it . . . A relationship between aesthetics and politics was being deployed by people who were taking advantage of the fact that aesthetics had been officially defined as autonomous by colonial ideology . . . using the enemy’s definition of aesthetics as having an autonomous sphere and sabotaging that in order to bring back the relationship between aesthetics and politics in a very direct way.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> It is arguable that a work such as Anand’s, which takes transgressive colonial material and tries to make it legible within the colonial definition of an aesthetic sphere, helped pave the way for the IPTA’s more activist deployment of aesthetic autonomy. E.M. Forster cannily acknowledges Anand’s claim to occupy an aesthetic, and therefore “clean,” territory in his preface to the first edition. Forster, trying to forestall the reader’s revulsion at a novel about shit, writes that <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> has “gone straight to the heart of its subject and purified it” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, v). For Forster, literal excrement – the novel’s most shocking motif – is not the same as aesthetic impurity or morally reprehensible “filthiness” in representations. An intervention such as that by the IPTA had thus been enabled by the early PWA’s general project of, in the words of Sajjad Zaheer, a PWA founder, “<span style="font-style:italic;">creating</span> [the] <span style="font-style:italic;">conditions</span> for our writers which would help them in their work . . . a suitable <span style="font-style:italic;">milieu</span> was to be created for the new literature of India to grow and to flourish.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Anand’s work cannot occupy the more directly activist space claimed by IPTA performance, but by breaching new kinds of matter for representation it helps to enable the staging of the “aesthetic” as a site of the “political.”
	</p>
<p>
	  In the India of the mid-1930s, the PWA’s culturalist Popular Front anti-fascism was necessarily inflected by anti-imperialism, and Indian intellectuals such as Anand were among the first to perceive at first hand the connection between fascism and imperialism. Anand wrote in 1939, “[W]e saw the ugly face of Fascism in our country earlier than the writers of the European country, for it was British Imperialism which perfected the method of the concentration camp, torture and bombing for police purposes.”<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> By his own account, Anand seems to have made this connection between fascism and imperialism while in England through his experience of the suppression of the 1926 General Strike which “reminded me of the Seven Stripes I had got in the Martial Law days in Amritsar.”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Here I focus on only one aspect of the PWA’s activity during the formative early years. An important feature of the early PWA project is its mission to prepare a new kind of national readership—a new “public” subject for the new literature. The PWA’s amorphous collective endeavor did not attempt solely to think about the making of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> new literary forms. Besides a new kind of art, one that will be written “in the language of the ordinary people” as Premchand put it in 1936, we need, he says, to create “a new atmosphere,” a new space in which to “prepare” to write.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> In 1939, looking back on the first few years of the PWA’s activity, Anand will write of “the popularization of culture,” registering a necessary educative dimension of the organization’s work going beyond literary innovation, techniques of mass contact, or mere distribution. “The latent genius of the masses enslaved for thousands of years will, through education, enlightenment, and the organization of that enlightenment, liberate our nation.”<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> This is put in the language of its day, but it points to a question that has not gone away. The PWA clearly recognized the problem (later developed by res such as Frantz Fanon and Amilcar Cabral) of its own educative relationship to the “people” and “masses” it wished to touch.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> For Aamir Mufti, the stake of realism as it was transposed to India by the PWA amounted to more than “telling the truth of society in fiction,” as it took on the task of “narrating the emergence” of the consciousness of an “abstract and secular citizen-subject.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> “National realism,” as it is now termed by Mufti, turns upon the didactic endeavor of “narrating the (national) passage from primitivism to modernity,” and in <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> the “totality that is the nation is concretized as the formal tension between the universalist and secular consciousness of the narrator and the subaltern protagonist Bakha” (<span style="font-style:italic;">EC</span>, 184). The colonial “realist” novel appears in this argument as an allegory of a specifically nationalist vanguardism. While the contours of the 1930s “realist novel” are indeed re-shaped by their transposition to a colonial context, I am less sure that this particular novel’s “object” is a “secular nationalist consciousness” (<span style="font-style:italic;">EC</span>, 183). As I will show, Anand rather pursues his ironic and circuitous strategy of writing in English so as to open up a space where the prevailing representations of a national popular subject (from both the PWA and the Gandhian movement) may be guarded against a premature collapse into representations of the popular as a “secular nationalist consciousness.” This is surely why <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> is focused on a subaltern re in crisis.
	</p>
<p>
	  The “people” spoken of by the early PWA are by definition imagined as being above the level of the subaltern. If the PWA conceived its new audience at the level of a national (though regionally differentiated) “people,” Anand’s focus on a subaltern-re-in-crisis for his first novel becomes particularly interesting. <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>’s Bakha represents, as it were, the subaltern as potential “people,” as becoming-people, not-quite people, public-to-come. He is separated by “an insuperable barrier . . . the barrier of caste,” from the novel’s image of the people—“the crowd” that gathers to see Gandhi in a counter-public nationalist manifestation (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 137). In considering the PWA, we must add to this caste “barrier” the question of class separation (which is also the invisible line between Bakha and the novel’s narrator), a line that intersects at a jagged and discontinuous tangent with that of caste.
	</p>
<p>
	  These were vital issues for the emergent PWA. How will we touch or create a public? This question sounds through the key statements of the PWA in the pre-independence years. Again, by potential public the PWA does not quite have the subaltern in mind. Anand’s novel, focused as it is on the subaltern, is thus written at a peculiar tangent to  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the desires of the PWA which he led in its first few years. One of the key points in this regard, returned to again and again by the spokespeople of the PWA, is the necessity of inserting literary practice into continuity with the culture at large. Literature has been lagging too far behind:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    It has tried to find a refuge from reality . . . it has produced a rigid formalism and perverse ideology . . . It is the object of our association to rescue literature and other arts from the priestly, academic and decadent classes in whose hands they have degenerated so long; to bring the arts into the closest touch with the people; and to make them the vital organ which will register the actualities of life, as well as lead us to the future.

<p class="continued">
	  This passage is from the first version of the manifesto published by the PWA in London’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Left Review</span> in February 1935.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> In its ambition to transgress, for example, contemporary Indian literature’s “furtive and sentimental attitude towards sex” and to “deal with the basic problems of our existence to-day,” the PWA demonstrates a desire to speak to a present from which it so far feels cut off.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> A central aspect of this effort to connect with a public-to-come is red by the language in which the effort to reach toward the popular imagination will be made. A “new standard of beauty,” to be written “in the language of ordinary people,” is demanded by Premchand at Lucknow.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> This means writing in all the various vernaculars of India: “We want associations to be established in each province and in each language which will be able to spread our message in every language,” he continues. Some of the practical measures thought of by the PWA for this project of “education, enlightenment, and the organization of that enlightenment” are detailed in Anand’s 1939 speech: bookshops, libraries in the rural towns, literacy campaigns, the writing of new school textbooks, a two-pronged national/regional approach to languages, promotion of a national “Indo-Roman” script, and interventions in film and radio.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>, and all of Anand’s early novels for that matter, are necessarily discontinuous with the practical effort of the formative PWA as I have just outlined it. The Indo-Anglian novel was never a part of the popular culture of the subcontinent, and it remains restricted to a small, generally elite indigenous readership, overlapping with a larger foreign one. Its relationship to the <span style="font-style:italic;">popular</span> imagining of the national can only be slight and tangential, and it does not touch a subaltern readership at all. In a letter concerning the reprinting of <span style="font-style:italic;">Coolie</span> over twenty years later, Anand showed a realistic assessment of the kind of readership his novels reached: “Indian doctors in the U.K., the young sons and daughters of the working class of India in the U.K., and the ex-colonials.”<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> In 1933 he was writing to the colonials themselves—to Bloomsbury in particular, perhaps—as well as to the few Indian students, professionals and civil servants in the U.K. The “sons and daughters of the working class of India in the U.K.” had not yet arrived on the scene, and Anand wanted rather to “show the concave mirror to Western intellectuals” who mostly seemed overly sanguine about their own complicity with imperialism.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  However, in a moving 1967 article about the writing of the novel, he also speaks of composing <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> out of a “guilt” and an obsession with the “abjectness” of the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> subaltern.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Anand discusses the way the text of this writer’s life is interwoven with the text of the life of the subaltern: a particular childhood acquaintance is said to be the model for the novel’s re of “tragedy,” or the “negative hero” whom Anand tries to capture in Bakha (“White,” 5, 15). “I wanted to bring to light the ghosts of the ‘dead souls’ . . . I wanted to beckon all the phantoms, so that they should haunt the dreams of the half dead” writes Anand of the prosopopeic impulse to capture the elusive subaltern re in <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>. My point here is that Anand’s desire to approach the subaltern is a strange and errant intervention, through an experiment on modernism, which supplements the PWA’s project of creating a popular art without participating in that project. It is as if the distance of English makes it possible, in 1933/1935 to write of the very subaltern re which underlies the “people” and the “mass” that constituted the imagined subjects of the PWA’s interventions.
	</p>
<p>
	  It is clear, finally, that literary production in English was not a viable facet of the project of the PWA. The PWA necessarily emphasized the use of regional Indian languages as the instrument with which imaginatively to reach and reactivate a <span style="font-style:italic;">popular</span> imagination. <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> does speak to the thorny dilemma of the representation and changing of a subaltern episteme, offering a remote and tangential commentary on the early PWA’s broadest transformative and popularizing ambitions of mass contact. The novel’s paradox is that it does this in a strategically altered English, which adds an extra twist to the torsion generated by its—necessarily but generatively failed—attempt to touch the slippery untouchable re.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Representations of Gandhi in the Subaltern Imagination</h1>
<p>
	  One of the most extraordinary moments in <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> comes near the end, as Bakha attaches himself to a huge crowd that has gathered to see Gandhi. Until this point, miming in miniature the depiction of Leo Bloom’s day (with all its other times and spaces folded in) in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, the novel has tracked Bakha, through a single day in his life in a medium-sized north Indian town. All body and little mind, for most of the novel Bakha is the re of a sleeping giant. He signifies a massive physical potentiality constrained by the cruel workings of a millennially ancient caste system. The untouchable represents the foundation of strength holding up the delicate temple of the upper castes. Anand transforms this symbolic and deeply sedimented ration of the untouchable, rendering Bakha as a muscular proletarian body in the terms of Socialist Realism. Here is a description of Bakha cleaning up excrement, taken from <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>’s very first pages:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	    He worked away earnestly, quickly, without loss of effort. Brisk, yet steady, his capacity for active application to the task he had in hand seemed to flow like constant water from a natural spring. Each muscle of his body, hard as a rock when it came into play, seemed to shine forth like glass. He must have had immense pent-up resources lying deep, deep in his body, for as he rushed along with considerable skill and alacrity from one doorless latrine to another, cleaning, brushing, pouring phenoil, he seemed as easy as a wave sailing away on a deep-bedded river.
	  </p>
<div class="attrib">
	    (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 15–16)  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      Bakha is not of course depicted as utterly mindless, as the narrator expends a fair effort in tracking the movements of his consciousness and subjectivity. As I have already shown, the narrator’s voice, the Socialist Realist voice perhaps, attaches the adjective “unconscious” to him on several key occasions in order to mark the severe limits of that consciousness. In such passages, Bakha is the re of a class, of a power, as yet unconscious of itself, struggling with its own unfocused sense of injustice: “there was a futility written on his face . . . in the highest moment of his strength, the slave in him asserted itself, and he lapsed back, wild with torture, biting his lips, ruminating his grievances” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 65). The transvestite imitation of the soldiers is the flipside of this crisis, the point at which the crisis has led to a displacement in the signs of subalternity.
	    </p>
<p>
	      As the novel draws to a close however, the pattern it has established for the representation of Bakha’s thought-world is interrupted. Coincident with the imminent arrival of Gandhi on the stage, the register of his depicted thought-world shifts drastically. This is the most important point at which what V.N. Vološinov calls “interference” takes place: the “interferential merging of two differently oriented speech acts.”<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> Here is the extraordinary passage (the emphases and parenthetic internal glosses are all in the original):
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		Eager and unconscious, he recalled all that he had heard of this man. People said he was a saint, that he was an <span style="font-style:italic;">avatar</span> (incarnation) of the gods Vishnu and Krishna. Only recently he had heard that a spider had woven a web in the house of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lat Sahib</span> (Viceroy) at <span style="font-style:italic;">Dilli</span> (Delhi), making a portrait of the sage, and writing his name under it in English. That was said to be a warning to the sahibs to depart from Hindustan, since God Almighty himself had sent a message to a little insect that Gandhi was to be the Maharaja of the whole of Hindustan. That the spider’s web appeared in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lat Sahib’s kothi</span> (Viceroy’s residence) was surely significant. And they said that no sword could cut his body, no bullet could pierce his skin, no fire could scorch him!

<p class="continued">
		The quasi-mythic imagery of the subaltern imagination is here inseparably interwoven with the narrator’s voice by free indirect discourse, and can only enter representation at the cost of being a facet of the protagonist’s “unconscious” state. The logic of the imagery of the divine spider and the Gandhian saint pulls against the overwhelming rationalism and empiricism of the narrator’s voice so that the passage embodies a struggle between these two voices or “speech acts.” A page later comes a further account of a rumor about Gandhi in the outcaste colony. These moments are so surprising because for the first time the novel attempts to capture the texture and imagery of subaltern discourse in transgressive or insurgent mode. There has been no gossip of this kind presented in the novel yet, though we have seen many indices of the destabilization of sign-systems. Two of these indices are the novel’s own language in relation to Hindi or Punjabi and Bakha’s transvestism. Subaltern talk, as it has been represented until now has been functional, bantering, pathetic, but neither mythic nor militant. Except for the key theme of transvestism, it has not been articulated in res which attempt to approximate the movement of a subaltern imagination. Nor has it acceded to the impersonal scripting of rumor, here given in the ekphrastic emblem of an arachnid <span style="font-style:italic;">writing</span> a warning to the representative of the British sovereign.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
		Historian Ranajit Guha has shown the fundamental importance of rumor to the practice of subaltern insurgency in colonial India. Yet Guha’s own outline of the practice of rumor separates it too cleanly from writing. “Rumor is spoken utterance <span style="font-style:italic;">par excellence</span>,” says Guha, “and speaking . . . differs from writing not merely in material . . . but in function.”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Guha goes on to say, however, that “rumor is necessarily anonymous and its origin unknown” though “a fictive source may be assigned to it . . . its message cannot be authenticated by any reference to a source” and “the encoding and decoding of rumor are collapsed . . . at each point of its relay” (<span style="font-style:italic;">EAP</span>, 259–60). As Guha himself seems to imply, and as Spivak has explicitly suggested, it is more useful therefore to acknowledge the complicity of speech and writing as it determines the production of rumor. Writing, in the expanded sense of “text,” embraces or is folded-together (com-plicit) with speech.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Writing in the expanded sense <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> rumor according to Guha’s definition of it, inasmuch as it “will constitute a kind of machine that is in turn productive [and that will] continue to ‘act’ and be legible even if what is called the author of the writing no longer answers for what he has written.”<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> The “very structure of the written” is the “force of breaking with its context” that is echoed in Guha’s description of rumor as “anonymous . . . not sealed off by any ‘final signified’ emanating from a primal source . . . free form . . . plastic . . . transitive” (“Signature,” 317; <span style="font-style:italic;">EAP</span>, 261).
	      </p>
<p>
		It is in the depiction of the non-possessive, indeed non-human (it’s a <span style="font-style:italic;">spider</span>’s writing!), structure of writing, operated by the subaltern orality of a rumor-machine, that the novel finally opens onto a momentary imagining of the intricacy and complexity of a different philosophical and rative world. Such writings—in the narrow as well as the broad sense—were demonstrably a part of the insurgent subaltern discursive repertoire, for example during the Santal <span style="font-style:italic;">hul</span> (insurgency) of 1855:
	      </p>

<p class="continued">
		Anand takes up a motif for writing (the spider and its web) canonical in the “European” tradition from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Odyssey</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Metamorphoses</span> onwards. In Anand’s own Bloomsbury context, the spider’s web had been renewed as a re for the delicate relation between fiction and the non-fictional in Virginia Woolf’s <span style="font-style:italic;">A Room of One’s Own</span> . It is one of the best-known quotes from the book: “fiction is like a spider’s web, attached ever so lightly perhaps, but still attached to life at all four corners.”<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> Woolf here is delicately questioning the autonomy of art, and this may have provided an enabling model for Anand’s own practice. The novel may also be tracking the remote troping and permeation into the non-Hindu subaltern world of a celebrated motif from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Upanishads</span>: “The one God who covers himself with things, issuing from the primal source, from his own inherent nature, as a spider, with the threads—may procure us dissolution in <span style="font-style:italic;">brahman.</span>”<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> In the Upanishadic simile, the spider as spinning agent codes the agency of the non-phenomenal Absolute which inheres in all the scattered phenomenal threads, as Gandhi’s face appears in the web “in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lat Sahib’s</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">kothi.</span>” The writing spider traces the face and name of the Mahatma with its webby excretions, which in the popular imagination are its own feces (shit writing), taking on the role of the formless and inhuman agency of writing in the subaltern mindset as it is depicted by Anand. <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>’s spider web passage is an ekphrastic image of the source of writing, located in a nonhuman agency and appearing at a moment of crisis. It is here—at the moment of greatest tension between the narrator’s discourse and the (collective) protagonists’ discourse—that the novel comes closest to “touching” the untouchable. It does this through the ekphrastic acknowledgment of the source of its own writability in a subaltern elsewhere: the writing of the abject untouchables’ rumored spider.
	      </p>
<p>
		The complex discursive world of subalternity appears fleetingly as an enigmatic and scattered offstage collectivity, like the strange collectivity of children who want to dress like white soldiers. The collectivity of rumor is, by definition, mobile, errant, indefinite, yet belonging to all. After the spider web passage, the novel goes into a dizzying sequence of other possible registers and permutations of the interweaving of spoken and written textualities. These include, as previously noted, passages from Gandhi’s published writings presented as parts of the speech he gives to the crowd, and a “babu” who “vomit[s] out” verbatim an article about Gandhi from the newspaper (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 138–153).
	      </p>
<p>
		This complex staging of the imagery and media of rumor is juxtaposed with the arrival on stage of Gandhi, who, like Napoleon III in Marx’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Eighteenth Brumaire</span>, interposes himself miraculously as the bearer of the collective consciousness otherwise scattered in rumor. Gandhi’s is the giant salvational face spun into the novel’s textuality: “Gandhi alone united him with them, in the mind, because Gandhi was in everybody’s mind” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 138). Gandhism expresses an affinity with subaltern consciousness, but acts to mobilize that consciousness within a thoroughly modernizing nationalist set-up. In Partha Chatterjee’s words, Gandhism made possible the indigenous peasantry’s “appropriation into the evolving structures of the Indian state” where they are “mobilized but do not participate” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NF</span>, 125). Marx had written of Napoleon III that,
	      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		  Historical tradition produced the French peasants’ belief that a miracle would occur, that a man called Napoleon would restore all their glory. And an individual turned up who pretended to be that man, because he bore the name of Napoleon, thanks to the stipulation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Code Napoléon</span> that <span style="font-style:italic;">la récherche de la paternité est interdite</span>.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		In Marx’s analysis, the fact that the <span style="font-style:italic;">nephew</span> substitute-Napoleon “bore” [<span style="font-style:italic;">trägt</span>] the name of a benevolent and miraculous father-re (“Napoleon”) is what make it possible for him to appropriate the “historical tradition” of the French peasants. The second Napoleon can play the role or “pretend to be” this man precisely because the legal-historical code will <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> allow the naturalness of the father-position to be questioned. The peasant faith in the miraculous leader as a natural father, a belief determined by their own political and social history, is captured in the representational role-play of the new Napoleon and miraculated into a subaltern general will: “The political influence of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the small peasant proprietors is therefore ultimately expressed in the executive power subordinating society to itself” (<span style="font-style:italic;">SE</span>, 239).<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>
		One of Gandhi’s most popular nicknames was “Bapu,” father. In his book of letters to Gandhi, Anand addresses him as “Bapu,” which is a very homey and colloquial word, more like “dad” than the more formal “father.”<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> Parentality is an important re of oppressive/benevolent authority in the context of colonial semi-feudalism in India, and is often articulated in the phrase “<span style="font-style:italic;">ma-baap</span>” (mother-father, or “parents”).<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> It is too simple to divide the <span style="font-style:italic;">ma</span>-function and the <span style="font-style:italic;">baap</span>-function simply along gender lines between the positions of benevolent support and care (<span style="font-style:italic;">ma</span>) and unquestionable authority and punishment (<span style="font-style:italic;">baap</span>). Nevertheless, the ideological coding of the father, or mother, or parent, not to speak of its position in the symbolic, is different than, but comparable to, that of the French patriarchal father in Marx. To write the story of “The Eighteenth Brumaire of Mahatma Gandhi” would be a formidable task, inappropriate to the limits of this essay. Partha Chatterjee has sketched the main lines within which such an analysis could be undertaken to include Gandhi’s bapu-function. And yet, in spite of the effectiveness of “the Gandhian ideology,” it is also true to say that in this period there was a counter-appropriation of the name of Gandhi by many of the very groups the official Gandhian movement wished to incorporate. <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> juxtaposes the apparition of Gandhi (as a fatherly representative of the absent collectivity of the untouchables) with the spider of rumor and gossip. The spider web, ring the face and the <span style="font-style:italic;">name</span> of Gandhi (“making a portrait of the sage, and writing his name under it”), registers the force of this subaltern borrowing of the name of the Mahatma. Just as Anand seeks to show connection and complicity between colony and metropolis, so does he suggest connection and complicity between the official, national “Gandhi” and the one written in the subaltern imagination. What is interesting about <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>’s articulation of this appropriation-as-representation is that the Gandhian discourse does not “take” in Bakha’s case. He neither accedes to militancy nor to an officially sanctioned Gandhian position. As we have seen, Bakha has, until this point in the novel, had a misfiring relationship to writing in the narrow sense. Like his transvestism, the desire for the ability to write and read marks a site of the crisis of subalternity, and the lack of literacy inaugurates the novel’s most obviously violent episode of caste prejudice against Bakha (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 46). <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> stages a tension between a general subaltern writing (exemplified as rumor and as the image of the spider writing) and the particular skills of literacy in the modern public sphere.
	      </p>
<p>
		The historians Shahid Amin and Gyan Pandey have in recent years shown the ways in which the re of Gandhi registered in subaltern discourses.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> already demonstrates a vivid awareness of this in the early 1930s. In spite of the Gandhians’ attempts to control the meaning of his name, ‘there was no single authorized version of the Mahatma.’ The slogans “Gandhiraja” (King Gandhi) and “Gandhi Swaraj” (Gandhi self-rule) were used to invoke a millennial or messianic arrival of a regime of justice in the present, a sense that current modes of authority had been miraculously suspended, or might be suspended if we took direct action now.<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> The “historical traditions” of the Indian peasants and tribals messianically inscribed “Gandhi” into the re of a  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> redemptive king, charismatic leader or saint (this may still be within the <span style="font-style:italic;">ma-baap</span> structure in many ways, but is often disarticulated from the Congress nationalist agenda in key respects). <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>’s narrator focalizes the mind of a peasant who “had heard from time to time . . . how a saint had arisen as great as Guru Nanak . . . the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ferungi Sarkar</span> (English Government) was very afraid . . . His wife wouldn’t be content with anything less than a touch of the Holy Man’s feet” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 139). In response to such reinscriptions of his name, Gandhi said that “none has authority to use my name save under my own writing.”<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> However, it was a notable feature of the Gandhian signature that it produced an extraordinary number of deviant countersignatories. Lochu Sabar, an aboriginal militant from West Bengal who fought in the campaigns of the 1930s and ‘40s, has reported that during this period the word “Gandhi” became a common name. Anyone could become Gandhi, any disturbance could herald the arrival of his kingdom, right now.<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> The appropriation of Gandhi’s name by aboriginal and peasant activists was an attempt to call a just future into the present. On the one hand there was no presently existing Kingdom of Gandhi; yet for the subaltern it was an imminent reality. In this peculiar re-scripting of the name of Gandhi in the impersonal body of rumor, you could say that the subaltern had something in common with the project of a Progressive <span style="font-style:italic;">Writers</span>’ Association.
	      </p>
<p>
		In <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>, Anand explores this commonality, as well as the persistent classcaste distance which hampers the institutionalization of such a commonality in a lasting political form. The shared dilemmas of progressive cultural activists and subaltern rumor-tellers do not come into contact with each other, a situation staged in the last few pages of the book when Bakha listens in on a conversation about equality between Iqbal Nath Sarshar, “the poet,” and Mr. R.N. Bashir, “Barrister-at-Law.” The position from the poet, which in the novel is made to win the argument, is a fantasmatic technicist solution to the problem of inequality. The “machine which clears dung” will displace the metonymic contamination of the sweeper caste, and equality will follow as a matter of course: “[t]hen the sweepers can be free from the stigma of untouchability and assume the dignity of status that is their right” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 155). The two speakers exit the scene before Bakha can engage their discussion further, and his occupying a clear position in relation to their debate is thereby withheld.
	      </p>
<p>
		The peculiar responsibility of Anand’s novel lies in its stark outlining of the problem of separation between progressive cultural activists and the subaltern spaces they wish to touch, with the “popular”—the Gandhian “crowd” and the “people” of the PWA—as a strange placeholder in between. The fact that <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> does this in the English language is a paradox, as it thereby disconnects itself from the real literary tasks the PWA set itself even as it illuminates their problematic. It is as if the novel as performative text wishes to embody the very separation it thematizes, or to struggle, like Bakha, with the simultaneously alienating and enabling dress of the English. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Letters on India</span> of 1942, where Anand makes explicit his criticisms of the high politics of imperialism, he includes a dedication to “Tom.” Tom Brown is the fictional addressee of the letters, a re of a radicalized member of the British working class (and thus already a displacement of a prior literary re of nationalist, upper-class  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> English decency in the protagonist of the didactic <span style="font-style:italic;">Tom Brown’s Schooldays</span>). As if to write himself back into the space of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>, Anand apologizes to the fictional Tom for the “queer, spidery handwriting” of the original letters.<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>
		In “writing back” to Bloomsbury, Anand guards a particular re of what is untouchable: the formless, elusive, spidery source of his own writing, offering thereby a monitory warning about the distance between activism and the people in whose name it is acted out.

		  The novel’s final line, just above the paraph, reads “And he proceeded homewards” (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span>, 157). This refers to the untouchable protagonist in his north Indian town. The novel has already complicated what “home” could mean in this place, and the paraph opens the dimensions of this questioning further.

		    “And should we overlook entirely the date-line with which Anand signs off from the text of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>?” write Maryam Khozan and Charles Lock in “Touching the <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>: On the Reception of Indian Fiction in England in the 1930s,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Angles of the English Speaking World: Unhinging Hinglish</span>, eds. Nanette Hale and Tabish Khair (Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanaeum Press, 2001), 34. As I have been arguing, this particular paratext is a quite important element for the reading of <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span>. Khozan and Lock suggest that the paraph expresses an embarrassing desire for approval from “Bloomsbury” on Anand’s part. “One is almost relieved,” they write, “to find that this line has been removed from the Indian paperback” . As I am trying to show, the paratextual paraph can be read otherwise. For the theory of the paratext, see Gérard Genette, <span style="font-style:italic;">Paratexts: Thresholds of Interpretation</span>, trans. Jane E. Lewin (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997).

		    I cite here the two best-known critiques of Anand. The first quotation is from Suresht Renjen Bald, “Politics of a Revolutionary Elite: A Study of Mulk Raj Anand’s Novels,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Asian Studies</span> 8:4 , 488; the following three quotations are from Arun P. Mukherjee, “The Exclusions of Postcolonial Theory and Mulk Raj Anand’s ‘Untouchable’: A Case Study,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Ariel</span> 22:3 : 38–43. Bald’s essay is a cold-war era red-baiting psychobiographical polemic which conflates the “heroes” of Anand’s novels with Anand himself. It offers no sense that Anand may be attempting to explore in literature the kinds of problems that Bald accuses Anand of symptomizing. Mukherjee’s essay targets a rapidly-institutionalizing postcolonial theory, faulting it for fetishizing “resistance” and “identity” and “overlooking collaboration” ; and, paradoxically, faulting Anand for <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> representing the resistance of the untouchable political movements of the 1930s, and for writing in a middle-class voice. My contention would be that Anand is trying to represent a subaltern everydayness which has not yet been able to access the upwardly-mobilizing power of the contemporary “untouchable  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> leadership.” This was surely the condition of the vast majority of untouchables in the 1930s, however much metropolitan radicalism may wish to celebrate the possibility of their “revolutionary violence” and “dissenting and angry voices” .

Joshi’s contention is that Anand’s writing has little “literary merit” apart from the realist or documentary one of opening up these other spaces to the possibility of representation .

The essay’s argument is unfortunately marred by a presentist culturalism which compels it to conclude that <span style="font-style:italic;">Untouchable</span> prioritizes “knowing one’s culture . . . over knowing to read and write” . The possibility of agency in literacy is downplayed in favor of an unwarranted and identitarian reading of Bakha coming to “an awareness of his own Indianness” . In spite of this, the chapter does give a useful conspectus of the novel’s references to writing and reading, except for the key scene of the writing of Gandhi’s name by a spider which is the focus of the final section of my essay.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f18" href="#f18-text">18. </a>
		    Many critics have discussed Anand’s strategies of translation, mimesis, and so forth. Anand himself has written on this topic in “Pigeon Indian: Some Notes on Indian-English Writing,” <span style="font-style:italic;">World Literature Written in English</span> 21:2  325–36. Anand writes of attempting to preserve the memory of the other language(s) in English, in particular around the pattern of rhythm (330–33). A representative recent example of the discussion of these features of Anand’s writing may be found in B.R. Agrawal and Nutan Kulshrestha’s “Indian English Novelists’ Experimentations with Technique and Style: A Study of Anand’s Technical and Stylistic Devices,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mulk Raj Anand</span>, ed. B.R. Agrawal (New Delhi: Atlantic, 2006), 172–86. Like the vast majority of such criticism, the chapter tends toward the taxonomic and descriptive.

		    Gandhi’s article was published in <span style="font-style:italic;">Young India</span>, April 27, 1921. It was presented as a speech at an untouchable convention in Ahmedabad the same year. The Uka mentioned there, a servant in the Gandhi household when the Mahatma was a child, is a cleaner of latrines like Bakha. The re of Bakha also seems to have been elaborated from a complex series of identifications with and as untouchable res. However, I cannot here expand on the profoundly complex relation between autobiography and fiction in this novel. For text of Gandhi’s “The Untouchables” see <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gandhi Reader: A Sourcebook of His Life and Writings</span>, ed. Homer A. Jack (New York: Grove Press, 1994), 162–72.

<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Is our drive to “make it new” in the classroom connected to changing views of modernism itself?</span></p>
<p>
      Recent articles and papers on modern literature often assess modernism’s relationship to a broad social terrain that includes advertising, cinema, fashion, magazines, music, photography, and radio. Such work draws from the field of cultural studies which, as Patrick Brantlinger has argued, “locates the sources of meaning not in individual reason or subjectivity, but in social relations, communication, cultural politics.” Cultural approaches to modernism expand the materials for literary study while shifting emphasis away from the traditional focus on originality. This counter-intuitive means of “making it new” can enliven our lectures; for example, I have linked Prufrock’s social anxiety to Roland Marchand’s “Parable of the First Impression” in American advertising. Although poetry is a relative latecomer to cultural studies, Rei Terada observes that we now “talk about how lyric is, as it were, made of the same substance as other media and continuous with the fiber of a society.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>
      In my recent teaching of American, British, and women’s poetry, I tap into these new conrations to renew the undergraduate research paper. My form of “periodical pedagogy,” to borrow Suzanne Churchill’s phrase, places poetry in dialogue with contemporaneous popular magazines. Their interplay of feature stories, readers’ letters, current events, literature, reviews, illustrations, advice columns, and advertising distills the wide field of cultural studies into a practical scope for writing ten-page papers. One assignment requires students to read women’s poetry alongside <span style="font-style:italic;">Ladies’ Home Journal</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Vanity Fair</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Vogue</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Ebony</span>, or <span style="font-style:italic;">New Yorker</span>. Selecting a single issue of the magazine they find  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> relevant to the poetry that interests them, students focus their arguments in two ways. First, they find a theme or motif that the poetry and magazine share, such as domesticity, gender roles, race relations, romance, beauty, or the literati. Second, students must decide whether the poetry mostly <span style="font-style:italic;">coincides</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">conflicts with</span> the magazine’s ideology. A variation of this assignment asks students to assess a magazine that includes the poet’s work—such as issues of <span style="font-style:italic;">Vanity Fair</span> with Edna St. Vincent Millay’s poetry and prose, or the issues of <span style="font-style:italic;">Atlantic</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Harper’s</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Ladies’ Home Journal</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">New Yorker</span> containing poems by Sylvia Plath. Besides eliciting close reading of a single poem, this latter option prompts students to consider the ways poetry circulates through diverse literary markets, sometimes blurring conventional distinctions between “high” and “low.” Such modes of inquiry reflect the cultural turn in new modernist studies.
    </p>
<p>
      Using popular magazines for these writing assignments also invites students to question the widespread assumption that poetry always resists the mainstream and the marketplace. Rachel Blau DuPlessis has noted that “Poetry, most particularly the lyric, has generally been construed (in its university and critical reception) as opposite to society and its discourses.”<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> Criticism of women’s poetry in particular tends to position it as a counter-discourse to popular culture. By contrast, cultural approaches to poetry privilege convergences rather than hierarchies and boundaries. My magazine assignments allow students to take either side of these critical debates, which I invoke in our class discussion of the completed papers.
    </p>
<p>
      By synthesizing diverse material from popular magazines in conjunction with poetry, my students often generate livelier and more creative arguments than they achieve in traditional assignments. Their most sophisticated papers take nuanced positions about the poetry’s relationship to the magazine, moving beyond simple pronouncements of conformity or rebellion. For example, one student wrote an excellent paper on how both Millay and <span style="font-style:italic;">Vogue</span> present a compromised flapper re. Several essays have shown how Brooks shares <span style="font-style:italic;">Ebony</span>’s vision of strong Black womanhood while departing from its postwar standard of beauty. (Brooks appeared in the magazine several times between 1945 and 1960.) Students have compared Plath’s portrayals of fraught motherhood with conflicting images in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ladies’ Home Journal</span> and Millay’s portrayal of liberated womanhood with <span style="font-style:italic;">Vanity Fair</span>’s commentary on women gaining the franchise. One of the more creative papers I have received discussed women’s writing and domestic space in Gertrude Stein’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Tender Buttons</span>, generating its analysis from a 1914 stationery advertisement in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ladies’ Home Journal.</span> An especially lively paper considered Plath’s minority status as an American woman with literary ambitions, reading “Wintering” against an issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Atlantic</span> in which male writers dominated the book advertisements and literary columns.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> I find that magazine research engages majors and non-majors alike. Indeed, several of my advanced students have ended up using this paper as a writing sample for their applications to graduate and professional schools.
    </p>
<p>
      If innovation can enliven students’ performance in their writing, it proves equally vital to our performance as teachers. As Sarah Copland notes, the imperative to “make it new” in the classroom can add to the pressures facing graduate teaching assistants. In teaching assessments for tenure, promotion, and awards, innovation often acts as  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the benchmark for a practice that many consider unquantifiable. At my institution, for example, nominees for faculty teaching awards must demonstrate the “excellence, innovation, and effectiveness” of their pedagogy; furthermore, they must also show “evidence of innovation in course design and/or instruction.”<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> As experts on “making it new,” teachers of modernism should feel advantaged by such criteria. The formal innovations in the texts we teach offer many opportunities for creative pedagogy, as Alan Golding shows in his “imitation” assignment. In my own teaching, I find that the heterogeneous form of popular magazines allows students to fashion innovative arguments that are counter-intuitive. By focusing on poetry’s cultural contexts, these papers simulate the intellectual creativity of new modernist studies.

<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Can innovative practices in the classroom transcend old divisions in the field?</span></p>
<p>
      The New Modernist Studies has toppled the hierarchies of high modernism, challenging the traditional canon’s exclusion of women, minorities, political activists, popular writers, and other marginalized res. But the vital attention paid to the work of what Cary Nelson calls “Repression and Recovery” hasn’t fully overcome the neglect of the Harlem Renaissance, if Lawrence Rainey’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Modernism: An Anthology</span>  is any index to the state of the field.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> This hefty, 1181-page textbook claims to be “the most comprehensive anthology of Anglo-American modernism ever to be published,” yet it does not include a single African American writer (Nancy Cunard is the closest it sails to Harlem). This is not the only sign of the scarcity of African American representation in modernist studies. <span style="font-style:italic;"></span>, although certainly more inclusive than the Blackwell anthology, devotes more attention to T. S. Eliot and Wyndham Lewis than to Zora Neale Hurston or Wallace Thurman, and the attendance at the Modernist Studies Association annual conference—including those of us participating in this forum—is conspicuously white, despite concerted efforts to diversify the program.
    </p>
<p>
      I teach at a small liberal arts college in the South, where diversity is also a challenge and goal, in our curriculum as well as our community. The teaching innovation I’ll discuss here was motivated by a desire to bridge the divide between modernism and the Harlem Renaissance. It was thus driven not by any deficiency in student preparation or engagement, but by a problem more deeply embedded in the structures of modernist scholarship and pedagogy. We are products of our educations. I  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> had little exposure to the Harlem Renaissance either as an undergraduate or graduate student, and my course offerings tended to privilege what I knew best: white, Anglo-American modernism. Yet my research in periodical studies taught me that modernism was not always divided along the color line: Fenton Johnson published poems in the largely white avant-garde magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Others</span>, Claude McKay and Mike Gold co-edited the <span style="font-style:italic;">Liberator</span>, and William Stanley Braithwaite’s 1918 <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthology of Magazine Verse</span> included war poems by Jesse Fauset and William Rose Benét. Such instances of border crossing and collaboration made me wonder what other intersections might be uncovered in modernist periodicals.
    </p>
<p>
      I decided to conduct an experiment in collaborative research with undergraduates, based on a model developed by my colleague in the history department, John Wertheimer.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> I designed an upper-level seminar, “Modernism in Black &amp; White,” with a dual focus: 1) crossing the color line between modernism and the Harlem Renaissance, and 2) doing collaborative research in modernist periodicals. Throughout the semester, as students read major modernist texts by T. S. Eliot, W. E. B. Du Bois, Nella Larsen, and Virginia Woolf, they would work in teams to research and write papers on modernist magazines. Together, we would use the new methodologies of periodical studies to transcend an old divide in modernist studies. In the process, we would reactivate the collaborative energies that generated so much modernist artistic and literary production.
    </p>
<p>
      The seminar’s combination of great books and periodical studies reflected my ambivalence about periodical pedagogy. I’d had good results with previous, smaller-scale efforts to teach modernism through little magazines. When students encountered “difficult” modernist poems in their original magazine contexts—jostled among book reviews, artwork, and ads for cigarettes and soap—the poems seemed less baffling and remote: they became part of a media format students already knew how to read. Modernist magazines work like the contemporary analogues Michael Sayeau describes in his essay: within their sundry pages, arcane literary forms “come to appear familiar, already a part of . . . students’ everyday experiences of media and entertainment, yet something they suddenly feel empowered to understand and describe.” Like Marsha Bryant, I’ve also noticed that when students break out of the traditional framework for literary analysis (say, a three- to five-page close-reading of a poem or novel), they “often write livelier and more creative arguments.” Encouraged by such results, I was eager to incorporate periodical studies on a grander scale. But I was also reluctant to abandon the old ways of teaching modernism altogether, because they’re the ways that made literature come alive for me as an undergraduate in what was quite possibly the last generation formed in the shadow of the New Critical monolith. I want my students to experience the same thrill of reading and connecting with great modernist literature <span style="font-style:italic;">for the first time</span>. They, too, deserve the satisfactions of close reading and the excitement of discovering that “fragmentation is both the theme and design of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>!”
    </p>
<p>
      Close reading has become negatively associated with <span style="font-style:italic;">closed</span> reading practices—with a “privatized reading experience” that, in Alan Golding’s essay, is rendered obsolete by the “active,” “collaborative,” and implicitly anti-authoritarian reading processes  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> engendered by contemporary experimental poetry. Yet recently, scholars have spoken out in defense of the old-fashioned practice of close reading. Jane Gallop argues that it promotes “active learning” and prohibits “easy, reductive generalization.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Rachel Blau DuPlessis utilizes close reading to <span style="font-style:italic;">disclose</span> “the textual traces and discursive manifestations of a variety of ideological assumptions, subject positions, and social concepts concerning gender, race, and religious culture.”<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> In other words, close reading can help (rather than hinder) efforts to anchor poems in their social and political contexts. Moreover, as scholars such as Jerome McGann and George Bornstein ably demonstrate, close reading can be used to decipher both linguistic and bibliographic codes, and can be applied as fruitfully to magazine ads as to poems.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> The traditional practice of close reading can, in Golding’s words, “open up innovative work.”
    </p>
<p>
      In designing “Modernism in Black &amp; White,” I aimed to wed the old-fashioned practice of close reading with the new-fangled methodologies of periodical studies. I divided the weekly, three-hour seminar meetings into two parts: the first half focused on masterworks of modernism and the Harlem Renaissance, and the second half was devoted to the collaborative research project, with carefully sequenced assignments. Each week, students would read the assigned texts and complete the next step in the research paper. In theory, the two halves of the course would fuse into a harmonious whole, with the readings providing a foundation in modernism and the Harlem Renaissance, and the collaborative research unearthing connections between the two movements.
    </p>
<p>
      In practice, the two parts often competed for attention. Scarcely had we begun to scratch the surface of <span style="font-style:italic;">Souls of Black Folks or Jacob’s Room</span>, when it would be time to turn our attention to the methodologies of periodical studies and the tasks of collaborative research. As one student evaluation put it, “The collaborative paper seemed to dominate the day-to-day coursework, and so the readings seemed to get lost in the shuffle. Not sure of the remedy for this, since collaborative topics may vary/depart greatly from the readings.” The topics the students chose to research did, in fact, “depart greatly” from the readings. The fourteen students in the seminar formed two research teams, and neither team selected a topic that sought to bridge the divide between modernism and the Harlem Renaissance. One group wrote on <span style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Fire</span>, arguing that the much-vaunted conflict between these Harlem Renaissance journals belied their shared project of forming a vibrant African-American youth culture. The other group traced Japan’s influence on American modernism, from Imagist aesthetics in <span style="font-style:italic;">Poetry</span> in the 1910s to political cartoons in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New Yorker</span> in the 1930s and 1940s. Their final papers were much stronger than typical undergraduate work—more ambitious topics, more extensive research, and better writing—but the day-to-day processes were often frustrating, burdensome, and unwieldy.
    </p>
<p>
      Concluding that the seminar was too ambitious, I decided to split it into two courses: an introductory survey dedicated to crossing the color line between modernism and the Harlem Renaissance, and an upper-level methods seminar focused on research in periodicals. Last fall, I taught a streamlined version of the collaborative research seminar, entitled, “Modernism in Magazines.” I made it clear from the outset that this was  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> a methods course in periodical studies. Reading great literature was not our focus, nor was crossing the color line our aim. Instead, we would focus on research and writing. This time, students formed three smaller teams. Each team developed ground-breaking and imaginative research topics: modernism’s influence on <span style="font-style:italic;">New Yorker</span> humor, fine art as advertising in <span style="font-style:italic;">Scribner’s</span>, and marriage plotting in magazine fiction “on or about December 1910.” The assigned readings dovetailed with the research, the workload was more manageable, and frustration levels dropped considerably.
    </p>
<p>
      With its singular focus on periodical studies, “Modernism in Magazines” was a neater, more coherent seminar than its more ambitious predecessor, “Modernism in Black &amp; White.” Yet I’m troubled by a nagging sense of loss. By excising the race issues from the collaborative research seminar, did I fall back on structural divisions that are a product of my own education and training—divisions that prevent me from crossing the color line and truly integrating my scholarship and pedagogy? Perhaps by segregating the race issues from the periodical methodologies, I produced what Mina Loy might have called an “Effectual Divorce”—a legal separation that produces a desirable, sanctioned result, precisely because it does not challenge conventional structures of thought and behavior. Next time, I think I’ll go back to “Modernism in Black &amp; White” and try to find better ways to overcome the divisions in my own course designs.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Is “making it new” a linear process of continual reinvention, or does this process involve cycling back to earlier forms of the old?</span></p>
<p>
      Whereas the traditional definition of modernism denies any mantle of commercialism, the current age of modernist studies firmly establishes modernism’s dependence upon market dynamics. The field of “Material Modernism,” initiated over the last few decades by critics such as Lawrence Rainey, Kevin Dettmar, Stephen Watt, and George Bornstein, has persuasively shown how modernism marketed itself and was disseminated to an increasingly popular audience.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Jonathan Rose and Patrick Collier, among others, have explored how modernism became the purview of working class intellectuals and was available in populist forms.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> Fewer scholars, however, have taken into consideration how modernism was defined and canonized by academia. Jennifer Wicke, for one, points out the need for scholars and critics to acknowledge their own implication in establishing modernism’s “brand name,” how our scholarship is involved in the ongoing and self-defining modernist industry.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
      I would take Wicke’s suggestion one step further and point out that not only is our research involved in the “marketing” of modernism, but so is our pedagogy. We, as teachers, are dealers in the multivalent forms of modernism, and the classroom is the place where the movement is “bought and sold.” Yet, as Helen Sword points out in her introduction to this collection, pedagogy is often overlooked in our highly theoretical field of study. There is a divide between what we write and the praxis of the classroom. This gap, I believe, may very well be an echo of that old academically constructed bias against seeing modernism in the marketplace.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
      In an attempt to bridge this divide, I have devised a semester-long group assignment that involves students in the ongoing process of modernist vision and revision. The project uses new, student-based, digital media to teach by example how modernism aspired to innovative forms and stylistics, was spread and marketed as a cultural movement, and, finally, was dependent upon the public sphere. Assigned early in the semester as students grapple with the anomalous, protean definition(s) of modernism, the project has students construct networks of MySpace profiles based upon modernist books, characters, and authors. As part of the process of defining (or un-defining) modernism, we collectively explore many of the movement’s contradictions: how prejudice and misogyny coexisted alongside humanism and feminism; how displacement of the reader encouraged a new, democratic way of reading; how modernism was restrictive yet became the canonized and influential literature of the century.
    </p>
<p>
      The prompt gives groups (usually four students) a limited option of texts (such as Ford Maddox Ford’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Good Soldier</span> or Lawrence’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Sons and Lovers</span>) and/or coterie groups (such as Lewis, Pound, Marinetti, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Blast</span>, or Woolf’s Bloomsbury Salon) for which students produce MySpace profiles. The students research and represent biography, historical context, characterization, and criticism. They are directed to emulate stylistic experimentation in their profiles as a means of “translating” and “enacting” modernism in a non-traditional media. The rubric stresses that pages will be graded on:
    </p>
<ol class="lalpha">
<li><p>a.   
	  understanding of the text and author’s innovations;
	</p></li>
<li><p>b.   
	  creativity in capturing aspects of the work on their pages (i.e. their own stylistic innovation in capturing or updating the subject);
	</p></li>
<li><p>c.   
	  intertextuality between group members and even other groups (i.e. using the “network” aspect of both modernism and MySpace to its fullest advantage);
	</p></li>
<li><p>d.   
	  rationalization for their choices on their group’s discussion board, which includes a bibliography to substantiate research.
	</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="continued">
      Groups are required to contribute weekly both to their profiles and to the class discussion board. This way, the profile clusters evolve organically over the course of the semester both in their sophistication and in their understanding of modernism.
    </p>
<p>
      Students respond enthusiastically and energetically to the unconventional nature of the project, which invites them to use a known language and skill to explore a difficult and academic subject. For example, their detailed historical research into textual allusions has consistently surprised me. One student’s profile for James Joyce was amazingly astute, featuring interplay between illustrations, such as numerous contemporary Dublin postcards, and biographical bulletins about Joyce’s loss of sight. Her research for the webpage led to an excellent paper on Joyce’s capturing of a fading cultural and personal visuality. Just as impressive is the way students “role play” their online interactions. A student profiling Virginia Woolf left wonderfully snide comments on the Joyce profile.
    </p>
<p>
      Even groups that do not emulate the creativity of the material can illustrate aspects of the work in other ways. For example, one <span style="font-style:italic;">Great Gatsby</span> group was complacent, just going to the 1974 film version for profile pictures and inspiration. This lackluster effort  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> sparked in-class and online discussion about the dissemination and popularity of a work, how the book itself might culturally pass as high-brow or as genre novel, and about what aspects of <span style="font-style:italic;">Gatsby</span> lent themselves to adaptation. The profiles have a tendency to take on a protean life as they move across the web: groups blur, and members of the general public (i.e. non-class members) try to “friend” certain characters or res.
    </p>
<p>
      This last element of unpredictability exemplifies how this assignment teaches by example through the transition to a new medium. “Viral” has become the term for inexplicable, runaway popularity online, and the network aspect of the assignment mirrors the viral way in which modernism originally spread. Critics such as Mark Morrison, Michael Murphy, and Joyce Wexler have explored how modernism infiltrated the public sphere via youth culture, slick magazines, and sensationalism.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Such explorations help explain the disparity between the wide cultural influence of modernism and the fact that much modernist writing originally appeared in restricted formats such as little magazines. The MySpace project, when paired with themes about dissemination, definition, and popular history, in effect invites students to create and market a “modernist” text, thereby illustrating how modernism existed across avant-garde and popular spheres alike (to pick up the <span style="font-style:italic;">Gatsby</span> example again, the book was filmed as early as in 1926 and reprinted the same year in the pulp magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Famous Story</span>). By recreating the scene of modernist creation within a virtual medium, students learn to navigate the three temporal dynamics of modernist definition: its initial scene (“what was modernism?”), the New Critical imposition of a cohesive definition (“how was this scene constructed or defined by academia?”), and our current moment of rediscovery and revision (“how are we redefining modernism(s) now?”). I find that one of the greatest challenges of teaching modernism is exactly this negotiation between past and present concepts of the movement: a reinvention that also entails a return to the old dynamics.
    </p>
<p>
      Influenced by (among others) Pater’s call for art to aspire to the dynamics of music, Conrad’s aim to make the reader “see,” Marinetti’s push for explosive typography, and Eugene Jolas and Bob Brown’s call in <span style="font-style:italic;">transition</span> to revolutionize the word, modernist writers aspired to a multi-dimensional form of creativity and reception that taught their audience new strategies for active reading. Similarly, as Catherine McLoughlin and Mark Lee have pointed out, the participatory information-sharing that characterizes today’s World Wide Web (Web 2.0, as it is called) has redefined the idea of audience as passive.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> By introducing “more flexible, dynamic, and interactive notions of the respective roles of author and reader,” notes Dana Wilber, social networking sites such as wikis, blogs, and MySpace create “new, multiple literacies,”<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> or what Carey Jewitt and Gunther Kress describe as “multi-modal literacies.”<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Thus the pedagogy of the MySpace project mimics as well as illuminates modernism, opening up literary texts to the multi-modal semiotics of visuality, orality, aurality, and popular and artistic culture.
    </p>
<p>
      While the use of such a corporate and advertising-driven engine as MySpace might trouble some academics, the feeling of disquiet that surrounds modernism’s corporate involvement (and that worries Michael Sayeau in his teaching project, described below) is in fact central to this assignment. The students’ role-playing as authors and modernist impresarios makes them aware of how modernists were “selling” new ideas and also  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> allows the consideration (albeit in a more subtle manner) of how elements of modernism and the discipline of English Studies constructed their own reputation. I believe that this self-marketing should be central to our concept of modernism, not just in our scholarship, but in our teaching as well.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> As researchers, modernist scholars continually seek to trouble the great divide: what Andreas Huyssen described as modernism’s antagonistic relationship to popular culture. Likewise, our goal as teachers should be not to police the borders of an elitist literature, but to explode them: to advertise, democratize, market, and make modernism consumable to our audience.

<p><span style="font-style:italic;">To what extent does innovative literature require/demand innovative teaching methods?</span></p>
<p>
      Teaching modernist writing that continues to challenge, and new forms of contemporary writing, how might we theorize the felt imperative to “make it new” pedagogically? Does innovative literature require or demand innovative teaching methods? At least one recent book argues persuasively that it does. Joan Retallack and Juliana Spahr rest their essay collection <span style="font-style:italic;">Poetry and Pedagogy: The Challenge of the Contemporary</span> on the premise that “contemporary literary pedagogy is chronically behind contemporary literature by about half a century,” that innovative contemporary writing renders “the familiar battery of code-breaking techniques . . . inappropriate.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> In one essay, Lynn Keller ponders the practical implications of the now-familiar ideas of “reader collaboration” or “active reading.” In what she calls the <span style="font-style:italic;">centripetal</span> classroom, “discussion” involves sharing the kind of privatized reading experience proposed by Edward Hirsch in his overtly pedagogical text <span style="font-style:italic;">How to Read a Poem</span>. With Retallack’s sequence “Icarus FFFFFalling” as her central example, Keller goes on to argue that “the new experimental poetries invite a very different model of reading, one that fosters contrasting classroom dynamics and processes” and that results in what she terms the <span style="font-style:italic;">centrifugal</span> classroom.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> The centrifugal classroom involves “a collective rather than a privatized reading process,” “collaborative reading”; “interpretive authority is dispersed; it is located in no individual and held precariously by the group”; and one finds “the class being drawn toward the world outside the poem and how language works there.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Nor need this methodological shift be limited to the treatment of experimental contemporary work.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Jena Osman describes how “in conjunction with their reading of Eliot, I ask students to write a poem where each line is taken from a different textual source they find in their homes. They are instructed to think about why they are ordering the pieces the way they do, and to annotate the poem with footnotes. This assignment makes Eliot’s seemingly impenetrable text [<span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>] more accessible, in that it shifts the focus of inquiry from ‘what does it mean’ to ‘how was it made’”: a shift from interpretation of a product to participation in a constructive process putatively similar to Eliot’s.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Essays like these provide compelling <span style="font-style:italic;">initial</span> answers to my opening questions, which seem straightforward enough until we apply a little terminological pressure to the relationships among the new, the contemporary and the innovative. (Both “innovative” and “new” may be used as literary historical categories and values; only “new” and “contemporary” can also serve as neutrally descriptive chronological terms.) In my own primary teaching field, Anglophone poetry and poetics in the long twentieth century, the point can be made simply by noticing the uses of the term “new” in the titles of the two main players in the notorious anthology wars, Donald Allen’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The New American Poetry 1945–1960</span>  and Donald Hall, Robert Pack and Louis Simpson’s <span style="font-style:italic;">New Poets of England and America</span> . Hall, Pack and Simpson introduce new poets writing in familiar mid-century modes shaped by the genteel cultural conservatism implicit in Eliotic modernism while bypassing Eliot’s formal radicalism. Allen, in contrast, foregrounds a new <span style="font-style:italic;">kind</span> of poetry (also written by “new” poets) whose innovations have influenced U.S. American (and other) poetic practice ever since.
    </p>
<p>
      At the risk of stating the obvious, then, “new” is a historically specific and contingent category, and especially for teachers of modernism, terms like “new” and “innovative” have a problematic doubleness about them. In the early-mid 1950s, Frank O’Hara’s work was both chronologically and formally new. For practiced and informed readers in 2009 it is neither, though we may continue to love that work and appreciate its innovations in historical context. For many of our students, meanwhile, any poetry beyond what they were force-fed in high school is new. Poetry as a <span style="font-style:italic;">discourse</span> is “new” for them, and even work that is not innovative in a literary historical sense or is no longer innovative to the teacher will often produce the effect of newness in neophyte readers: disorientation, bafflement, a sense of readerly inadequacy.
    </p>
<p>
      So how to help students experience and think about modes of poetic newness, past and present, in ways that go beyond the dominant modes of analysis and what my fellow panelist Marsha Bryant calls “the traditional focus on originality?” The assignment that I’ll describe here is an exercise in imitation that I’ve used at all levels, from lower-division undergraduate classes to graduate seminars: write an imitation of a Frank O’Hara “I do this I do that” poem (a perfect model is “The Day Lady Died” or “Personal Poem”) and then reflect on the process of writing it. In the reflection I ask students to address such questions as “What did you find hard or easy about this assignment? What did you learn? What surprised you? What do you think you did well / less well?” I am fairly unconcerned with (as in, I do not grade) the competence of the imitation. The important parts are the reflection on process and the insights produced in coming up with the poem, not the poem itself. At the same time, for most students  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the writing that they produce is literally “experimental”: it’s something they’ve never tried before, and they don’t know how it’s going to turn out. The assignment can work with any distinctive style: Williams, Stein, the Lyn Hejinian of <span style="font-style:italic;">My Life</span>, the Harryette Mullen of <span style="font-style:italic;">Trimmings</span> (though when I encouraged two expert imitators of Hejinian and Mullen to submit their work to their creative writing teacher some years ago, he turned it back as “not poetry”).
    </p>
<p>
      I think of this assignment in the spirit of what Charles Bernstein calls “creative wreading,” a range of “interactive and creative responses to assigned readings, including imitations” designed to facilitate “accessing the poetic strata of a work, that is, those elements that make a piece of writing a poem” “as a ground for subsequent critical interpretation: after all, you can’t interpret what you don’t experience.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> At the same time, my goals are modest and even traditional. One is to introduce a different kind of writing into the literature classroom, a writing and reading that yields different insights from those produced within the customary boundaries of disciplinary training. A second is to have students understand, or at least think about, the dynamics and construction of a style from the inside (an author-centered approach with which I realize theoretical disagreements are possible). A third is to have students engage in the process of relating theory—or reflection on poetics—to practice. Attempting an O’Hara imitation produces an experientially based understanding that casual everydayness in poetry can be a challenging effect to pull off, and typically leads to student reflection on the pace, rhythm, content, and contradictions of their own days. A fourth goal is to have students inhabit, try on or produce forms of newness. From one point of view, I could be accused of proposing the hoariest and most conservative of exercises, that of imitating a “master.” It makes a difference, then, that the work being imitated is work written against mastery (even if it is subsequently canonized), thoroughly anti-didactic in spirit, and that success in the imitation be considered beside the point.
    </p>
<p>
      As I have suggested, the exercise commonly produces for students both insight into the work being imitated and, perhaps equally valuably, a fresh perspective on their own lives. As one student puts it, “What seemed like the most significant experience in writing the poem was that in the process of writing the events took on new meaning.” The writers comment on their efforts to “capture the spirit of playfulness in O’Hara” and “the communal aspect of my experience,” “to keep a constant flow with casual diction and blatant disregard for punctuation” and avoid “getting too preachy” with politically charged subject matter. They can show a fine ability to internalize O’Hara’s camp humor. One student detournes the end of a canonical text, “The Day Lady Died,” by invoking simultaneously her own favorite music and O’Hara’s poetics of sociability, writing “I put on some Mudhoney and open the book. / I reread some of the Frank O’Hara poems. / I don’t think we’d get along if I ever met him so I’m not sad he’s dead.” While plenty of students find the task initially daunting, this summary response is more typical: “As for the experience of writing the poem, I got a kick out of it. I tend to over-think composition so a sketchy breezy poem was a breath of fresh air. I’d do it again, I tell you.”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
      As seasoned and influential a poet-teacher as Bernadette Mayer has written, in a somewhat dyspeptic moment, that “it’s easy to rely on the Beat Poets when you’re teaching, any more abstract stuff often turns the students off, they find Frank O’Hara much too difficult.”<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Finding a pedagogy adequate to the writing at hand constitutes one of the most compelling rationales possible for pedagogical innovation. As a supplement—not a counter—to the claim that new writing demands new forms of teaching, one of my central assumptions is that a traditional teaching technique can open up innovative work. To put it another way, not all innovative work requires innovative teaching or rethinking of the classroom, though some does. Pedagogy is not self-renewing in the way that innovative literature is: it’s not a sequence of mini-revolutions, of ruptures, of avant-garde moments. Approached from the inside, using an ancient pedagogical technique that will nevertheless strike many students as “new,” apparently Frank O’Hara—as one of many possible examples—isn’t “much too difficult” after all.

      These four formerly unpublished war pieces by Mary Borden (1886–1968) were not included in the comprehensive published edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Forbidden Zone</span> . The three poems, “Escape,” “There is a Monster in the Valley,” “Take Me Away From My Wounded Men,” and the “Prefatory Note” (an earlier version of Borden’s published preface) are housed at the Mary Borden Collection at Boston University’s Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center. Although at times uneven, the vivid, sensuous love poetry best represented by “Escape” sheds a different light on Mary Borden’s published accounts of gender and the nurse’s war experience; and poems such as “There is a Monster in the Valley” expand on her important use of mechanized imagery.
    </p>
<p>
      Borden’s most significant literary achievement was undoubtedly her semi-autobiographical World War I collection of essays, stories and poetry, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Forbidden Zone</span>. A Vassar-educated Chicago heiress – she was British by marriage – Borden was in turn an active socialite, generous philanthropist, courageous nurse and prolific writer. During World War I, she left her family in London to equip and direct a field hospital on the front lines in France. Borden performed similar services during World War II, running a hospital behind the Maginot Line and, later, in the Middle East. In recognition of her wartime contributions, Borden would be awarded the French Legion of Honor and Croix de Guerre with palm. Concurrently, as Lady Spears, wife of a British politician and diplomat, Borden traveled the world, entertaining numerous foreign dignitaries and social luminaries. Throughout these activities, she pursued a parallel vocation as a writer; over a literary career spanning nearly a half century, Borden produced a wide variety of literature including poetry, short stories, war  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> sketches, social essays, romance novels, religious narratives, original and adapted plays and film scripts, a marriage treatise and a full-length autobiography.
    </p>
<p>
      Declared “Whitmanesque” by some, critics seemed unsure how to approach or analyze <span style="font-style:italic;">The Forbidden Zone</span>. “Her <span style="font-style:italic;">Forbidden Zone</span> miscellany,” wrote Lawrence Woodhouse in <span style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times</span>, “swims in the ether of fervid, felt imagination as well as wallows like a troglodyte in modern warfare reality – a rare combination and a rather blasting one” (15 Jun. 1930). Today, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Forbidden Zone</span> is viewed as a significant modernist World War I text and Borden is widely acknowledged for her heroic personal efforts as well as her literary achievement.
    </p>

      Borden’s “Prefatory Note” reveals personal sentiments omitted from the published preface. In this version Borden acknowledges that the War has left “a profound and terrible impression” upon her. Equally notable, Borden’s published dedication “to the Poilus [soldiers]” does not appear here; rather she offers the collection to those men and women “who have never heard for themselves the voice of the War,” an inclusive and hopeful gesture meant to enhance their understanding of the war’s horrors.
    </p>
<p>
      Of Borden’s newly uncovered works, “Escape” and “Take Me Away From My Wounded Men” represent the most marked divergence from material published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Forbidden Zone</span>. Both love poems were omitted from the published text which emphasizes rather the gulf created by World War I between men and women on the front and at home. In “Escape,” Borden addresses an unnamed lover, a military officer, imploring him; “Steal an hour away from France and come with me.” The poem’s final sentiment— Leave your men and let them die in the mud – / Who will tell? / I so long to have you mine –/ I would pay – / I would drink with my own lips all the blood that would stain you if you came”—deftly mingles erotic innuendo with that ubiquitous metaphor of injury and death, “blood,” in a sexualization of the War unseen before in Borden’s poetry.
    </p>
<p>
      “Take Me Away From My Wounded Men” is a highly personal examination of the nurse’s war fatigue. Like “Escape,” the poem pleads for an hour away, but here the narrator begs for her own salvation, not that of another. Overwhelmed and tormented from nursing the injured soldiers, “Their wounds gape at me – / Their stumps menace me,” she implores her unnamed savior; “Make me clean . . . / . . . Give me rest . . . / . . . Give me strength. / And give me joy.” She asks for one hour of respite, “Then let me go back to my wounded men.” Like the soldiers in her sketch “Conspiracy,” whose cycle of recuperation and reassignment to the front is “arranged,” Borden situates herself as one more expendable commodity of the war machine.
    </p>
<p>
      The poem “There is a Monster in the Valley,” in which Borden presents the mechanical and technological aspects of modern warfare, expands upon imagery found in several of her other pieces, such as “Bombardment,” The Regiment” and “The Hill.” Juxtaposing guns, tanks and airplanes with valleys, hills and sky, she urges the reader to “Look – Listen,” experiencing through multiple senses the manner in which the machines of war are destroying man and nature. In Borden’s rendering, the apparatus of war subsumes the natural world, becoming the ambiguous “creature,” the evil “snake,” the ominous “Monster in the Valley.”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>
      To explicate <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>’s obsession with imagery and visuality, many critics have dwelled on the novel’s interest in the relationship between seeing and being seen; on Septimus Smith’s visions; on Peter Walsh’s dream; on its many examples of ekphrastic language; on floods of detail that saturate many passages, such as Clarissa’s visit to the flower shop; and on the subjectivities that serve as the spring (i.e. the habitat, source, and propulsive force) of the novel’s images and pictures. In short, <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>’s dense imbrication of narrative and image maps a territory too complex, too large for a single study. This paper targets only a corner of this territory, focusing on three specific images:  the motor car and  the aeroplane—both found in the novel’s second section—as well as  Big Ben, the clock tower that chimes the passing of a fictional Wednesday in the middle of June 1923. These three images make up a collection of public objects viewed through a collective of private eyes. Rather than analyze the function(s) this collection performs for the novel, the focus of much Woolfian criticism, this paper poses a simple question, borrowed from visual theorist W.J.T. Mitchell: <span style="font-style:italic;">What do these pictures want</span>?

	  “I’m not saying a picture is just a text, or vice versa. There are deep and fundamental differences between the verbal and visual arts. But there are also inescapable zones of transaction between them, especially when it comes to questions such as the ‘life of the image’ and the ‘desire of the picture.’”

<p>
	    Much of the Woolfian criticism regarding the visual imagery of <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span> focuses on the technical, that is, on how its images help establish a new, modernist realism, particularly in developing a narrative sense of simultaneity. Susan Dick, in an essay from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Cambridge Companion to Virginia Woolf</span>, explains that the “careful description of the flight of the plane over London functions, like the journey of the official car, as a structural device enabling [Woolf] to present scenes which are happening simultaneously.” Big Ben also plays a key role for Dick here; its chimes indicate the progression of time, even as “the narrative . . . pauses and loops back.”<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> In attempting to find an explanation for Big Ben that deviates from “primarily technical explanations,” Jörg Hasler, in an earlier article, writes, “[Big Ben] constantly reminds us of the contrast between the external, quantitative time and the inner, qualitative time. The hours of the day are far from equal in length[;] they have [an] elasticity ascribed [elsewhere in Woolf’s work] to ‘time in the mind.’”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Despite his professed deviation, however, Hasler’s approach to Big Ben merely looks at a different “technical explanation.” Critiques like Susan Dick’s examine how such images make possible the spatial elasticity of a moment within a novel (i.e., the presentation of many people doing different things at the same time) while Hasler explicates a temporal elasticity (i.e., the presentation of the individual remembering the past while remaining corporeally present). Far from disagreeing with these technical interpretations, this paper co-opts Hasler’s initial motivation to look beyond the technical, to make sense of the car, the plane, and the clock tower as sites/sights of convergence for many subjective gazes, objects-turned-image that certainly <span style="font-style:italic;">do</span>, but also <span style="font-style:italic;">want</span>.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The relationship between painting and Virginia Woolf’s fiction has also served many critics as a vehicle into understanding the stylistic implications of her imagery. Sue Roe’s essay “The Impact of Post-Impressionism” traces the influence of Roger Fry and the Bloomsbury group on Woolf’s fiction, yet her analysis remains quite similar to Hasler and Dick’s: in order to “show the shifting uncertainties within the human psyche”—a goal of post-impressionists, according to Roe—Woolf sees that “she must somehow look, in writing, for solutions to the problem of simultanism.”<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Likewise, in her recent article “Geometries of Space and Time,” Jennie-Rebecca Falcetta explores the cubist elements in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>. Cubist art achieves the multivalent, simultaneous “sides” Woolf desires to show, and by incorporating public images like the skywriting aeroplane, she too achieves such “sides,” integrating “several subjective Londons into a whole, expressing in . . . glittering prose the idea that at any given moment, the crowds of minds walking in, around, and through a city in one sense <span style="font-style:italic;">are</span> that city.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Though Roe and Falcetta certainly help historicize and clarify how Woolf might have developed her narrative techniques, the examples and demonstrations therein implicitly support the image as subordinate to the narrative, always working, always serving, but never speaking. I certainly do not take issue with the possible influence of post-impressionism and/or cubism on Woolf’s writing, but in the following pages I do hope to question the images such investigations leave silent, to spark the inanimate to life in order to explore the relationship they have with the animate, the living, the collective of subjective gazes that frame them—including the gaze of the reader.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	    But is it possible to interrogate the image? This is not a simple historical matter. In Plato’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Phaedrus</span>, Socrates—in an effort to subordinate writing to speech—compares it to the art of painting. Though both modes of articulation and representation seem to show some thing, neither can clarify this thing. They can only repeat themselves when interrogated and neither can hide from those who seek to abuse them or fail to understand them; both always need their “father to help [them].”<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Writing, one might say (cautiously), has long been rescued from Plato’s sentence, yet the image—ever since Plato’s famous comparison—has continued to haunt the written arts in the eyes of philosophers and theorists. Over a millennium after the <span style="font-style:italic;">Phaedrus</span>, Gotthold Lessing attempted to set the limits of painting and poetry in <span style="font-style:italic;">Laocoön</span>, motivated by the need to purify writing/poetry, to establish an aesthetic hierarchy that sees the written word, the rightful partner of narrative, throned above the plastic arts (e.g., painting and sculpting): poetry has “a wider range” than plastic arts, a repertoire of “beauties at its command which painting is never able to attain”; ultimately, Lessing argues, “the poet has greater freedom than the sculptor and painter.”<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    Projects similar to Lessing’s have accumulated in the twentieth century, from George Lukacs’s critique of the modern novel’s obsession with copious detail to Andrew Higson’s much more contemporary work with heritage cinema.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Both studies demonstrate a concern that narrative—the only art capable of capturing the complexity of human relationships—is endangered, on the brink of a detail-oriented, fetishistic cataclysm. In addition, images have blurred the very concept of reality in the age of late capitalism. Guy Debord writes, “The whole life of those societies in which modern conditions of production prevail presents itself as an immense accumulation of <span style="font-style:italic;">spectacles</span>.” These spectacles, however, are not an accumulation of images, but rather the sum total of “social relationships . . . [now] mediated by images”; in other words, they are impossible to escape.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> We live in an age of simulacra, a society where—to quote Murray Jay Siskind from Don DeLillo’s <span style="font-style:italic;">White Noise</span> —it is “impossible to see the barn.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Baudrillard calls this the <span style="font-style:italic;">hyperreal</span>: “the generation of models of a real without origin or reality . . . the map that precedes the territory . . . that engenders the territory.” Only in such a culture could the mere image of the threat of atomic destruction be “the best system of control that ever existed.”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    Despite this fear of the image’s proliferation, however, some continue to hold that the image remains weak and silent, estranged from narratives that might offer understanding or explanation. Even the rise of photography as a forensic science, as solid ostensive evidence of a pastness brought before the present eye, cannot fill gaps that require narrative orchestration.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Baudrillard, in his disturbingly giddy <span style="font-style:italic;">Seduction</span> (1979, 1990), argues that it is the very weakness of the image that has the power to seduce us: “To seduce is to appear weak. To seduce is to render weak. We seduce with our weakness, never with strong signs or powers. In seduction we enact this weakness, and this is what gives seduction its strength.”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> At this impasse over/between strength and weakness, power and powerlessness, agency and subordination, W.J.T. Mitchell wonders if we might “rein in our notions of the political stakes in a critique of visual culture, and to scale down the rhetoric of the ‘power of images.’”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Certainly, one can  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> adopt images for ill purposes (just as Plato accused sophists of abusing rhetoric); nevertheless, Mitchell holds that our relationship with images remains more complex than the relationship that iconoclastic critiques of the society of the spectacle profess. The belief that images may indeed be weaker than some critical theory tends to assume/argue frames my study of <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, as does Mitchell’s interest in “the ways . . . images seem to come alive and want things” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WDPW</span>, 9).
	  </p>
<p>
	    In navigating between iconoclasm and idolatry, Mitchell argues that the proper strategy for interrogating images resembles playing “upon them as if they were musical instruments.” This, he says, might be a way to overcome the fears that strike us in works like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Society of the Spectacle</span>: “‘Sounding’ the idols [a phrase he borrows from Nietzsche] . . . does not dream of breaking the idol but breaking its silence, making it speak and resonate, and transforming its hollowness into an echo chamber for human thought” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WDPW</span>, 26–7). It is the purpose of this paper to “sound” three public images within <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, to demonstrate how the novel itself sounds these images (pre-ring many of the theorists I cite here), and to rethink this corner of the novel’s obsession with visuality in order to shift the focus away from what these “pictures <span style="font-style:italic;">do</span> to what they <span style="font-style:italic;">want</span>, from power to desire, from the model of the dominant power to be opposed, to the model of the subaltern to be interrogated or (better) to be invited to speak” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WDPW</span>, 33). Recast in this light, what do the motor car and the aeroplane want (in both senses of the word)? What—given its spinning hands, its face, and its chiming voice—does Big Ben, the monumental clock tower, lack and desire? Although Mitchell’s text serves as a useful entry point into <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, I should clarify that the question “What do pictures want?” resists distillation into what one might call a <span style="font-style:italic;">method</span>. Despite the eight decades that separate the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">What Do Pictures Want?</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, the question itself bores a path of textual intimacy between the texts, a critical passage that allows one to work from the middle with no established framework that indicates where to begin, what to apply, and when to finish. Far from following an established method from beginning to end, this essay offers an experiment, one that attempts to unfold the lack and desire of these images and that must continually reorient itself. In other words, I attempt an ahermeneutical reading, and Mitchell’s question offers a way to begin (but not a method) for such a project, a way to begin that always remains ready to begin again.

<p>
		    The first section of <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span> trains readers to follow two sets of oscillatory movements: back-and-forth between its narrator and Clarissa’s stream of consciousness as well as (within this stream) between Clarissa’s present reflections/perceptions and her remembrances of things past. Shortly after a “pistol shot in the street outside” interrupts the lovely catalog of Miss Pym’s flower shop selections, the second section marks the introduction of a third type of narrative movement between one character (whether major or minor) and another (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 13). When the motor car backfires (the sound Clarissa initially mistakes for a fired pistol), the Londoners about this part of the city combine their gazes to form a framework for the first of the novel’s public images: “Passers-by who, of course, stopped and stared, had just time to see a face of the very greatest importance against the dove-grey upholstery, before a male hand drew the blind and there was nothing to be seen except a square of dove grey” (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 14). Unlike the sensory perceptions that spark the movements into Clarissa’s consciousness or her past, Woolf places the motor car (and later the aeroplane) at the center of a framework comprised of dozens? hundreds? of gazes.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Such a framework, however, may be problematic. In a novel like <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span> that celebrates or explores subjectivity and consciousness, this picture of mass hypnosis stands out as a disturbing one.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> To echo Derrida, the crowd becomes a <span style="font-style:italic;">parergon</span>, a frame that “verge[s] on” the image of the car, “push[es] it, press[es] it, press[es] against it, seek[s] contact, exert[s] a pressure at the frontier.” This collective effort, of course, makes possible the “simultaneous effect” studied by the critics cited above (and others of course), and yet such a framework—comprised of several selves—is merely supplemental to the image, in an exterior position that threatens it. In such a position, subjectivity potentially, to cite Derrida again, “disappears, buries itself, effaces itself, melts away at the moment it deploys its greatest energy” to present/ornament/frame the public image.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> By using this technique to train her readers to move quickly from subject-to-subject, Woolf potentially threatens to efface her characters, to rub out their subjectivity like the aeroplane’s smoky letters, to subordinate their selves to the hypnosis of the car’s celebrity, and—most important—to undermine her project.
		  </p>
<p>
		    However, rethinking this dynamic beside Baudrillard’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Seduction</span> helps dislodge this relationship from one of hierarchical subordination to one marked by inclusive reversibility. The locus of agency within the act or process of seduction remains, according to Baudrillard, indeterminable. He asks,
		  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		      Is it to seduce, or to be seduced, that is seductive? But to be seduced is the best way to seduce. It is an endless refrain. There is no active or passive mode in seduction, no subject or object, no interior or exterior: seduction plays on both sides, and there is no frontier separating them. One cannot seduce others, if one has not oneself been seduced.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued"><span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span> casts the crowd (as <span style="font-style:italic;">parergon</span>) and the motor car (as <span style="font-style:italic;">image</span>) in the very kind of relation that Baudrillard outlines here; both participate in a strategy or play of <span style="font-style:italic;">weakness</span> in which neither falls completely subordinate to the other. Like Woolf’s oscillatory narrative—constantly in motion between narration and consciousness, between past and present, between Clarissa and Septimus and others—the relationship  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> between the public image and the private framework, caught within “an endless refrain,” continually shifts. Mitchell’s analysis of desire helps to articulate this: “the question of desire is inseparable from the problem of the image, as if the two concepts were caught in a mutually generative circuit, desire generating images and images generating desire” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WDPW</span>, 58). This multistable status, then, effectively changes the question, “What does the motor car want?” to “What does this passage—i.e., the picture of the car and the crowd—want?”
		  </p>
<p>
		    To start with the car: it wants (i.e., lacks <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> desires) a face with which to peer back at its observers. Within a short space, the narrator mentions Septimus’s pale face, Clarissa’s “pink face pursed in enquiry,” as well as the ruffled faces of the crowd (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 14–16), all drawn to an image that has hidden its own. In order to maintain its celebrity, the car effaces its occupant early by drawing its blind and displaying a tree-like pattern (both Warren Smiths notice it), one that <span style="font-style:italic;">branches out</span>, co-opting the faces staring at it, holding up a mirror in which most pedestrians come to recognize a regal or political allegiance to their image of the car’s occupant. But in the game of seduction, according to Baudrillard, “The mirror . . . is not a surface of reflection, but of absorption.”<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> So by co-opting and absorbing the faces through this reversible art (for can it not be said that the staring faces, jarred by the engine’s backfire, initiate this game? Are they seduced or seducing?), the effaced image can adopt a visually complex, multivalent face. Yet this face is not only a conglomerate of the masses, but of the many faces the crowds attribute to it, the different fruits the characters see hanging from its patterned limbs: simultaneously it absorbs the crowd’s faces but is also—like a shape-shifting chimera—at once the “Queen, Prince, [and] Prime Minister” (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 16).
		  </p>
<p>
		    This face, however impressive or complex, is only tentative, but while it remains in congress with the subjective gazes, the image attempts to speak of commiseration, remembrance, and mourning. This is most telling in the relationship between the motor car and the war-scarred Septimus Smith. Though the detail remains slight, both find themselves “unable to pass” within pages of one another: Septimus blocked by the car, by the sounds and the gazes surrounding him; the official car by an omnibus (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 14, 17). Woolf’s conscious repetition of this phrase—i.e., “unable to pass”—creates an affinity between them that develops, however subtly, after the car passes by the bus. Shortly before the scene shifts to Buckingham Palace, the narrator ruminates that the car had left a ripple

<p class="continued">
		      The “unable to pass” attributed to Septimus and the car takes on a new meaning when read through these passages, for the visions that haunt Septimus and the mourning that breeds his disturbing madness awaken in others throughout the streets as the Queen/Prince/Minister  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> passes. Like poor Septimus, the images and horrors of the Great War cannot pass out of England, but unlike Septimus, the others watching the motor car only experience this image faintly, only adopt this desire for memorialization briefly. As a nigh silent image, the car’s disruptiveness—in individual cases—remains a trifle: “no mathematical instrument . . . could register the vibration” (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 18). As Peter Walsh reminds himself later in the novel, “Still, the sun was hot. Still, one got over things. Still, life had a way of adding day to day” (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 64). This is not the case for Septimus Warren Smith, however, as the ripple experienced by most of the onlookers mutates for him into horrific, traumatic images: “The world wavered and quivered and threatened to burst into flames” (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 15). As a counterpoint to this picture of desired commiseration lost in the public image’s inability to speak across the gap seduction opens, Woolf posits the subjective, unpassable cycle of madness and trauma for Septimus, a re haunted by runaway images that continually accumulate for him yet eventually pass away for others.
		    </p>
<p>
		      Between the motor car and the aeroplane, Woolf posits a short scene that continues to play with the relationship between the public image and private eyes when it shifts to Buckingham Palace—framed by a crowd of onlookers, “poor people all of them.” However, this passage mostly serves to dramatize the subordination of the motor car as an image, to draw attention to its inability to create a lasting, individually profound vision of mourning and national fraternity. It fails to capture and bring a complete vision of the past before their present eyes. Instead, Woolf offers a crowd interested in a commodified form of royalty; the crowds stare at the palace, letting “rumour . . . thrill the nerves in their thighs at the thought of Royalty looking at them” (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 19). But even if it could present static, vivid images of the Great War (like those that terrorize Septimus), such photographic images—photographic in their vividness and persuasive account of a <span style="font-style:italic;">once-was</span> presented as <span style="font-style:italic;">now-is</span>—might transform temporary mass hypnosis to an unpassable madness, a mass schizophrenia attempting to make sense—as Septimus does—of horrific pictures.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> If public images mean to inspire a unity that navigates between hypnosis and madness, they need more than imagistic seduction.
		    </p>
<p>
		      At first it would seem that Woolf’s aeroplane—shooting over the top of Buckingham Palace—manages to correct this impotency. Though it lacks a face (and with it an identity), this public image strikes one as more capable, more active: “[it] turned and raced and swooped exactly where it liked, swiftly, freely, like a skater . . . or a dancer.” As it dances, the official car enters the palace gates “and nobody look[s] at it” (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 21). What differentiates these pictures? The motor car <span style="font-style:italic;">desires</span> commiseration, <span style="font-style:italic;">wants</span> a communal sense of mourning. The aeroplane, on the other hand, overrides this sense of duty to authority (whether regal or state), overshadows the dreary hypnosis of the motor car, and inspires a duty to the awe-inspiring commodity, to toffee. It does so through a strategic blending of text and image, of reading and seeing.
		    </p>
<p>
		      In her short essay “Pictures” , Woolf seems to want to keep such arts ultimately separate, ruminating on the skill of her contemporaries to incorporate vision into their novels without attempting to become painters. Likewise, she appreciates painters who remain silent, who do not attempt the novelist’s knack for narrative and/or explanation:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> “the portrait painter must not attempt to speak; . . . the utmost he must do is to tap on the wall of the room, or the glass of the aquarium; he must come very close, but something must always separate us from him.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> This passage suggests, then, that—at least to Woolf—the aeroplane’s efforts are problematic. Emily Dalgarno, in her book <span style="font-style:italic;">Virginia Woolf and the Visible World</span> , argues that the skywriting “draws the reader’s attention to the process of signifying,” pointing out the tension between the “the various readings” of the crowd below and Septimus’s “recognition that the letters signal beauty and more beauty.”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> When Lucrezia encourages Septimus to “look,” the poor man imagines that “they are signaling to” him in a language “he could not read” rather than in recognizable words (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 21). Tears fill his eyes as the melting shapes bestow “upon him their inexhaustible charity and laughing goodness one <span style="font-style:italic;">shape</span> after another” (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 22; emphasis added). This picture, then, (i.e., the plane and frame) explicitly dramatizes a tension within <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>—especially in this scene—between image and text, between looking (as Septimus does)<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> and reading (as most of the others do), and how both might be necessary in order for an image (or a text?) to approach effective expression.
		    </p>
<p>
		      It would seem, then, that the aeroplane—despite Woolf’s Lessing-like division between the novelist and the painter—wants to be read and seen, to take on the properties of an <span style="font-style:italic;">imagetext</span>; or what Foucault terms a <span style="font-style:italic;">calligram</span>, that is, “a composite text-image that ‘brings a text and a shape as close together as possible’” and implies “an alliance between the shapes and meanings of words.” According to Mitchell, such an alliance does not create a simple reversible opposition, but, rather, “the very identities of words and images, the sayable and the seeable, begin to shimmer and shift in the composition, as if the image could speak and the words were on display.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> By becoming an imagetext, then, the aeroplane strives to become clear presentation (as opposed to <span style="font-style:italic;">re-</span>presentation), curving <span style="font-style:italic;">away</span> from a realism, whether literary or commercial, and toward a reality.
		    </p>
<p>
		      Despite the potential creeping of reading and seeing into one another, however, Woolf’s picture seems to support her ultimate separation between the two mediums of word and image. Even Mitchell, despite his claim that “all arts are ‘composite’ arts (both text and image),”<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> admits that “deep fundamental differences [exist] between verbal and visual arts,” and this textual image, ironically, fails to overcome this difference, fails to become a text, to be clearly read (<span style="font-style:italic;">WDPW</span>, 55). Though it attempts to communicate, the plane still becomes another object-turned-image; as a subaltern, its smoke-letters “lie still” only for a moment before “they [move] and [melt] and [are] rubbed out up in the sky” (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 20). In order to draw the attention of those below toward itself, the plane must literally draw (i.e., write) their attention in the sky again and again. Though the aeroplane does not lack any readers, these onlookers read its letters with varied success (only a few manage to spell out “toffee”). More generally, the aeroplane lacks proximity and permanence—that is, the aeroplane wants to be closer and to offer shapes that remain, that don’t dissolve, that don’t scatter into the misreadings of the aeroplane’s spectators.
		    </p>
<p>
		      What these images do, then, ultimately differs from what they want. The motor car joins and escapes the staring crowds, and yet it simultaneously desires to inspire a  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> mourning for horrors that seem unspeakable, horrors that—in two decades time—will beggar understanding. Likewise, while the aeroplane advertises toffee, it behaves as a Debordian spectacle where the only directly experienced thing becomes the fetishized commodity. However, it lacks a true voice and true proximity, an avenue into both discourse and representation that would allow its hold to last beyond the letters T, O, F, and E. Ultimately both the pictures of the motor car and the aeroplane lack a way to explain the new realities that befall Londoners, English citizens, Western culture, or the world after the fallout of World War I. Neither celebrity nor commodity can make sense.
		    </p>
<p>
		      Dalgarno draws attention to the early notes Woolf kept while when composing <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, noting that Woolf felt Clarissa and Septimus “linked together by the aeroplane”;<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> this seems odd considering that Clarissa never sees or reads the aeroplane. The third section of the novel opens with Clarissa asking, “What are they looking at?” (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 29) Just as the motor car passes through the gate unnoticed, just as the aeroplane draws attention away from the Palace and toward its smoky letters, the aeroplane escapes the notice of Woolf’s central character, whose concern rests solely with her party and—in this scene—with mending her dress. The next image, however, does not pass away so easily, does not reside within a single scene, and demonstrates how the new realities, the new perceptions of the world brought to light in the twentieth century cannot pass. They must be dealt with. Given this, then, what might the chiming clock tower want?

<p>
			As a recurrent public image, however, Big Ben turns out to be more troublesome than the motor car and the aeroplane. For instance, when the narrative alludes to the clock tower and its disruptive chimes, none of the characters in the novel actually see Big Ben; they only hear it. Therefore, I require a different approach to Big Ben’s frame. In addition, the tower and chimes do not simply vanish from the novel’s pages like the images already considered; they interject themselves into the narrative again and again. In other words, Big Ben presses against its ever changing frame suddenly and repeatedly, often surprising those who hear it as well as those of us who read it. Lastly, if I hope to question these images as subalterns, as silent <span style="font-style:italic;">others</span> waiting to speak, how do I reconcile such a state of alterity – associated with femininity in both Mitchell and Baudrillard’s studies – with its connection to a very masculinized “tyranny of clock time”?<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> In short, Big Ben’s invisibility, its recurrence, and its association with oppressive and intrusive power, all confront and trouble the premise of reading Big Ben as an image that wants or lacks.
		      </p>
<p>
			The most prominent difference between Big Ben and the two public images from the second section is the fact that, in the many passages where it intrudes upon the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> narrative, none of Woolf’s characters actually see it. How then can one discuss it as an “image,” a corner of <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>’s obsession with visuality? <span style="font-style:italic;">First</span>: certainly the tower and the bell (both commonly referred to as Big Ben), since they are monuments that have a firm position in the British (more specifically London) cultural consciousness, stand together as an eminent hypericon as well as the most readymade visible English symbol of time and its passage. <span style="font-style:italic;">Second</span>: four times in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, Woolf repeats the phrase, “the leaden circles dissolved in the air” (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 4, 48, 94, 186). The first and last occur in passages devoted to Clarissa while the second and third occur in passages connected with Peter Walsh and Lucrezia Warren Smith respectively. Although these characters may only <span style="font-style:italic;">hear</span> chimes from the massive tower, Woolf presents this cultural symbol as a visual image, an image that inspires a plethora of supplemental images both in the narration itself and in its streams of consciousness.
		      </p>
<p>
			Lucrezia’s “leaden circles” passage occurs halfway through the novel and is particularly useful in broaching the question, “What does the tower want?” After flashing back to the history of Dr. Holmes’s visits with her husband Septimus, the chimes of Big Ben return her to the present:
		      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
			  It was precisely twelve o’clock; twelve by Big Ben; whose stroke was wafted over the northern part of London; blent with that of other clocks, mixed in a thin ethereal way with the clouds and wisps of smoke, and died up there among the seagulls . . . The leaden circles dissolved in the air.
			</p>
<div class="attrib">
			  (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 94)
			</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
			  This paragraph also contains a quick return to Clarissa—who lays “her green dress on her bed.” But rather than demonstrate the simultaneity of this passage, I want to draw attention to another passage back in the second section, a passage that takes place exactly one hour earlier. Shortly after the aeroplane appears, the narrator observes,
			</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
			    All down the Mall people were standing and looking up in the sky. As they looked the whole world became perfectly silent, and a flight of gulls crossed the sky, first one gull leading, then another, and in this extraordinary silence and peace, in this pallor, in this purity, bells struck eleven times, the sound fading up there among the gulls.
			  </p>
<div class="attrib">
			    (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 20–21)
			  </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
			    Like the smoky letters that fade and assemble themselves “round the broad white shapes of the clouds” (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 21), the chimes of Big Ben—these “leaden circles”—fade into the sky, the face of nature, a site of disappearance that refuses to be a tablet. This repeated image, then, speaks of want, lack, and desire. Despite its stationary, erect body and its audible repeatability, Big Ben lacks permanence as an image in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, and though Woolf often uses it as a textual or metonymic device for Time and “an analogue to the simultaneous composite view,”<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> as an <span style="font-style:italic;">image</span> the clock tower and its main bell lack the kind of durability readers and characters might assume it has. The fact that it strikes and kills an “irrevocable” hour (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 4, 117)—i.e., irreversible, unchangeable, unrecoverable—suggests that what Big Ben lacks is exactly what it often inspires: the need to return; the need to remember.
			  </p>
<p>
			    The “leaden circles” alludes to a geometric circularity inherent in the very structure of the novel: characters go and return, the narrator disappears and reappears, the past  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> intrudes on the present yet the present always comes rushing back. It is this last item, the ability of the main characters, particularly Clarissa, to move between the present and past, that Big Ben desires. Its own depiction of time—that is, the rounding of a clock’s face, the spinning of a clock’s gears—creates a mere illusion of circularity. Its return to the numeric hours of every day just hides the fact that the “time” the clock keeps only has one direction. Time’s arrow, for it and all other clocks that ding or chime in the novel, points forward. The spinning of its hands, the roundness of its face, and the repetitions of its chimes hide its inability to be truly reflexive, malleably circular. As an image, it wants this sort of circularity to replace the circularity of its appearance. Just as the aeroplane’s attempt at language fades into the clouds and among the gulls, Big Ben’s attempt at circularity, of calling Woolf’s characters back to the present, certainly sounds yet ultimately fades and melts and dissolves, despite its “leaden,” material, metallic ring.
			  </p>
<p>
			    In his book <span style="font-style:italic;">The Final Sculpture: Public Monuments and Modern Poets</span> , Michael North writes, “The relationship of the monument to time, which might have seemed its clearest and least ambiguous attribute, is in fact troubled and uncertain.”<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Though North’s study focuses mostly on sculpture, Big Ben’s relationship to time remains even more troubled and ironically uncertain given its function as a timepiece. Quoting an anonymous writer in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Civil Engineer</span> , North cites, “A public monument is a book opened for the perusal of the multitude; unless it declares its meaning fully, plainly, and sensibly, the main use is lost.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Of all monuments, Big Ben certainly declares its meaning, more than silent statues. Though the “tremors of [its] great booming voice” certainly repeat throughout the novel (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 49), leaving traces of its echoes in even the chimes of smaller clocks and bells, Big Ben’s use <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> lost in a new age that requires a new aesthetic, new perspectives, new concepts of time and experiential reality. Though the clock tower serves to draw characters back to the present or to transition between characters that hear the bells simultaneously, often its sound comes parenthetically (as in the passage just cited). Often, its chimes seem to have little effect. Stuck in the present as a false marker of time’s forward movement, it may draw characters’ “time in the mind” back to the present, but it cannot keep their minds there. Objects, whether public or private, will inevitably spark another journey, whether expected or not, to the past.
			  </p>
<p>
			    The link that Hasler and others make between Big Ben and the masculine “tyranny of external time”—a construct that Hasler calls “an artifice of the intellect” and associates with male characters like Richard Dalloway, William Bradshaw, and Hugh Whitbread<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a>—is ultimately complicated when we consider Mitchell’s claim that the “question of what pictures want . . . is inseparable from the question of what women want.” How does one reconcile the association of Big Ben with masculinity—need one point out its phallic shape?—with Mitchell’s insistence that “the ‘default’ position of images is feminine” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WDPW</span>, 35)? By recasting Big Ben as an image, this paper essentially feminizes this masculine monument, not merely reversing its gender (i.e., switching the opposition of masculine/feminine) but rather displacing the traditional, “masculine” opposition between male/female with “a femininity that incarnates reversibility,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the possibility of play and symbolic involvement.”<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> In other words, as it does with the motor car and the aeroplane, rethinking Big Ben and its listeners/onlookers as participants in a game of seduction allows for a reversible interaction between them, an interaction in which Big Ben’s desire to remember actually inspires memory and connection even as it calls others back from memories to its domain of the present.
			  </p>
<p>
			    In her essay “From Text to Tableau” , Karthryn Stelmach celebrates Clarissa’s “magical ability to conjure moments from the past” and names the final occurrence of Big Ben’s “leaden circles” as “the most regenerative vision of ekphrastic enchantment in the novel.”<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Near the end of <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, Clarissa separates herself from her party, pondering the significance of Septimus’s suicide, the death of a man she never meets, when she looks out the window and notices “in the room opposite the old lady” whom she had seen several pages earlier “star[ing] straight at her” (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 186).<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> After she watches the old woman put out her light, darkening her room even as the party continues, Clarissa feels an affinity toward Septimus:
			  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
			      She felt somehow very like him—the young man who had killed himself. She felt glad that he had done it; thrown it away. The clock was striking. The leaden circles dissolved in the air. He made her feel the beauty; made her feel the fun. But she must go back. . . . She must find Sally and Peter.

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
			      In this scene, Big Ben does not play the part of the masculine tyrant of external time, but rather the feminine participant in a seductive game, one that manages to succeed in <span style="font-style:italic;">creating</span> a vision of re-enchantment, potentially a lasting vision, as Stelmach writes, “in a desacralized world.”<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> In this “moment of being,” Big Ben desires participation in re-vising this new world—just as the motor car and aeroplane do—but unlike those images, Big Ben’s desire becomes partially satisfied. Far from merely breaking Clarissa out of her ‘time in the mind,’ the familiar sound of the striking tower encourages her to return, in spite of its own inability to remember, to the party with a new vision of the world, particularly to Sarah and Peter, and to honor the death of a young man she never knew.
			    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Conclusion</h1>
<p>
			      W.J.T. Mitchell might also call these pictures—the car, the plane, and the tower framed by private eyes and ears—“metapictures.” In his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Picture Theory</span> , published ten years before <span style="font-style:italic;">What Do Pictures Want?</span>, Mitchell explains that he “want[s] to experiment with the notion that pictures might be capable of reflection on themselves, capable of providing second-order discourse that tells us—or at least shows us—something about pictures.”<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> What, as a closing thought experiment, might the three images this essay unfolds tell or show us about pictures? First, they tell us that pictures rarely comprise images alone. In order to tell or show us anything, in order to cathect us <span style="font-style:italic;">here and now</span>, images need a frame. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, Woolf employs a  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> frame that initially threatens the subjectivity she wishes to honor and explore, yet this very subjectivity turns out to be the very frame by which the images speak. The play of private eyes and public spectacles enacts a reversible game of seduction that exits the hierarchy of subordination and avoids the unilateral power structures in which text and subject lord over the image and object—or in which a fetishistic fascination with images rubs out or dilutes the complexity of a novel’s narrative or characters. Second, as Mitchell argues in <span style="font-style:italic;">Picture Theory</span>, the collection of images considered here—like all metapictures—“reveal[s] the inextricable weaving together of representation and discourse, the imbrication of visual and verbal experience.”<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> In other words, pictures and words (whether written or spoken) can also enter into a sort of reversible game; images and text remain ever immanent to one another, folded into one another, suffering similar limitations and bolstering one another toward a potential and powerful resistance. Third, the car and plane and tower all demonstrate that <span style="font-style:italic;">we</span> too are “inextricably weaved together,” whether through the shared experience of a passing motor car, a flying aeroplane, a chiming bell, or another among the many imagetexts that form the “spider’s thread” which connects us all (<span style="font-style:italic;">MD</span>, 112). When we pause to interrogate silent images, particularly these public metapictures of <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, they teach us that “sounding the image” (again, not a rigid method but an open experiment) creates a condition of possibility from which one can respond creatively and ethically to changed and changing worlds—Virginia Woolf’s as well as our own.

				  In explicating the difference between narration (characteristic of nineteenth century realism) and description (characteristic of “modern novels”), George Lukacs identifies the ultimate consequence of this shift as a loss of literature’s “capacity to depict the dynamics of life, and thus its representation of capitalist reality is inadequate, diluted and constrained.” “Narrate or Describe?: A Preliminary Discussion of Naturalism and Formalism,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Writer &amp; Critic and Other Essays</span>, trans.

				    Andrew Higson claims that a characteristic feature of the heritage film—which is often an adaptation of an English novel—is the refocus from, or at least an ambivalence regarding, the original  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> novelistic narrative to one of detail: “To appreciate the meaningfulness of any text, I would argue, it is important to acknowledge its necessary ambivalence. Thus, although I’ve reworked my earlier arguments in various ways, I would still maintain that it is productive to view heritage films in terms of a tension between drama and <span style="font-style:italic;">mise-en-scene</span>, between what they articulate and what they present visually.” <span style="font-style:italic;">English Heritage, English Cinema: Costume Drama since 1980</span> (New York: Oxford University Press, 2003), 77.

				  Consider Edith Wyschogrod’s analysis of Barthes’s term “punctum” as found in his work <span style="font-style:italic;">Camera Lucida</span>: “Yet the real power of photographs is not lodged in reconciling viewer and image but rather in destabilizing the viewer through the picture’s punctum, a detail in the photograph that functions as a partial object that wounds or punctures the viewer” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CL</span>, 45). It is the punctum that forces the medium [of photography] to self-destruct as signification and that may work catachrestically as an absurd expression that unsays the whole or metonymically as a string of images that extend it. Yet the historian does not know the significance of what she sees if she has only the unretouched photographic record; she knows only that, there where the camera stood, it was thus.

				  Some comments from Susan Sontag’s relatively recent article “Looking at War” seem relevant here: “Harrowing photographs do not inevitably lose their power to shock. But they don’t help us much to understand. Narratives can make us understand. Photographs do something else: they haunt us. Consider one of the most unforgettable images of the war in Bosnia, a photograph of which the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> foreign correspondence John Kifner wrote, ‘The image is stark, one of the most enduring of the Balkan wars: a Serb militiaman casually kicking a dying Muslim woman in the head. It tells you everything you need to know.’ But of course it doesn’t tell us everything we need to know.” “Looking at War,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Best American Essays</span> 2003, ed. Anne Fadiman (New York: Houghton, 2003), 265. This photograph beggars meaning while simultaneously <span style="font-style:italic;">demanding</span> meaning. And if left without help, the photograph—to borrow a phrase from Baudrillard—wears meaning out, “tire[s] it out,” exhausts it. <span style="font-style:italic;">Seduction</span>, 75.

<p><span style="font-style:italic;">What are the rewards, challenges, and risks of innovation in general? Is there necessarily an inherent value in “making it new” in pedagogy?</span></p>
<p>
      Like some of the other respondents—Marsha Bryant and Suzanne Churchill with their “periodical pedagogy” or David Earle in his deployment of MySpace in the classroom—I find that my teaching often involves the juxtaposing of canonical texts and items drawn from the popular and extra-artistic reaches of culture. In general, I try to make things new for my students the old-fashioned way—by addressing and readdressing the contemporary pertinence of the texts that we read. In particular, I am most interested in having my students see the persistence of the formal innovations of modernism—the way that certain strains of irony, estrangement, and montage developed during the modernist period are still central to aesthetic creation today. The shows and movies that we see, the news that we watch at night, and even many of the websites that play an increasingly important role in our lives all bear the marks of modernist influence, however indirect or subtle.
    </p>
<p>
      When I happen upon just the right contemporary analogue, this tactic of mine seems to be very effective. The past and present bring each other into sharp focus as an apparently arcane literary form comes to appear familiar, already a part of my students’ everyday experiences of media and entertainment, yet something they suddenly feel empowered to understand and describe. (It would probably be too much to compare the effect to Walter Benjamin’s concept of the “dialectical image,” but perhaps the same sort of idea is at play.)<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> The students speak  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> more excitedly when things are opened up this way, and when we turn back to Joyce or Eliot or Woolf, the excitement tends to persist. The classroom becomes a happier and more productive place. And amidst all this engagement and interest, and without saying a word about it, I begin to get very deeply worried.
    </p>
<p>
      The best way to show why I am so worried is to tell a story. Last year I decided to open a course on modern European fiction by showing a set of advertisements stored on YouTube that had been on my mind during the last weeks of the summer.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> They seemed to me uncannily good evocations of some of the principal stances of modernist narrative form, complete works viewable in 30 seconds that would bring my students face to face with the issues of technique and tone that would preoccupy us all semester.
    </p>
<p>
      The best one of all is a brilliant spot directed by the filmmaker Spike Jonze for IKEA. Soapy, maudlin piano music plays as we watch a woman unplug the tired reading lamp that sits on a side table next to her sofa and carry it out to the curb for garbage pickup. The camera angle shifts to impersonate the perspective of the lamp itself, as it takes its last look at its comfortable home, staring back at the shut front door and finally, during a dark and stormy night, watching its former mistress reading under the light of a brand new lamp, which she caresses softly before turning in for the night. We get a bit wrapped up in the scene, so cunningly is it shot, until, just as the music comes to its melodramatic crescendo, an odd-looking man with what seems to be a Swedish accent strolls into the shot, looks into the camera, and addresses us directly: “Many of you feel bad for this lamp. That is because you’re crazy. It has no feelings. And the new one is much better.”
    </p>
<p>
      It’s a great joke, of course, and a great vehicle for IKEA’s long-standing (and, in a sense, modernist, if cynically so) pitch: you won’t really stop being a child so long as your home is full of your parents’ old furniture, so throw it all out, head to IKEA and make it (your apartment, yourself) new. But the usefulness of the ad as a means to open a window on modernist form extends beyond its message. Via this advertisement and our discussions of it, my students received a working sense of montage, Brechtian estrangement and shock, and what we might call generic impersonation—that is, what it means for a work to sell itself as, in this case, a soap opera, only to snap back against the viewer suffering along with the lamp at the end of the spot. And since we would start in on <span style="font-style:italic;">Madame Bovary</span> during the next meeting, the overall tactic of the ad opened the complicated concept of the <span style="font-style:italic;">style indirect libre</span> in a way that I have never been able to do as clearly via blackboard diagramming and patient explanation.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Beyond the first day of class, this advertisement, as well as the others that I showed that day, came to serve as touchstones that my students and I would constantly return to as we took up the difficult works of Proust and Kafka, Benjamin and Calvino. But despite the fact that my tactic seemed pedagogically effective, the ease of translation from the one form to the other—from the canonical text to the contemporary advertisement—struck me as increasingly disturbing. What does it say about the texts and methods to which I’ve devoted my working life when their principles of construction are exposed as the secret sharers of the slickest practices of contemporary branding campaigns?
    </p>
<p>
      In short, my small effort to make it new in my classroom provoked much larger  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> questions about the purpose of making it new during the reign of modernism. When the code of Flaubert’s prose can be broken by a television spot bent on selling us a cheap new lamp, what are we left to think about <span style="font-style:italic;">Madame Bovary</span>? Whatever it is that we believe we are doing in the classroom as we teach modernism, I would bet that most of us retain a deep sense that these texts and the formal innovations that “made them new” retain some degree of critical efficacy—that their ability to estrange and reveal the under-workings of modern life remains, despite our increasing distance from their moment of composition. The fact that modernist form can be separated from what we might think of as a properly modernist project threw the texts and tactics that I work on into an abruptly ambiguous light.
    </p>
<p>
      There is, however, a solution to my problem, even if it is one that is far easier to describe than to put into practice. Faced with such doubts, I should have thematized them—brought them into the course itself as an issue for class discussion. After all, the uneasy relationship between modernism and marketing has been a long-standing issue of investigation for modernists and scholars of modernism alike—from the Soviet Constructivists’ avant-garde posters to Jennifer Wicke’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Advertising Fictions</span> and Frederic Jameson’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Postmodernism.</span><a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>
      But even beyond the literary-historical issue, there is an even more fundamental educational opportunity at hand in this situation. The self-reflexivity of understanding—the ability to see ourselves seeing, to read ourselves as we read—is perhaps the greatest skill we who teach literature can help our students obtain—and it is one best taught by practicing it ourselves. As we experiment with new tactics of teaching modernism, we must be ready for and open to the untimely questions and unforeseen openings that emerge from our innovative techniques.

      In 1884, while workers were digging the foundations and well for Thomas Hardy’s future home, Hardy found the remains of several urns and skeletons that appeared to be from the Roman period. This was a discovery that delighted him because, he wrote in his autobiography, “the only drawback to the site [had] seemed to him to be its newness.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Eager to share these findings, Hardy presented a paper to the Dorset Natural History and Antiquarian Field Club (which he had joined in the early 1880s) on “Some Romano-British Relics found at Max Gate.”<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> By this point Hardy was known for his interest in the southwestern region of England, which was already being called “Wessex,” the name he had given it in his novels. Hardy had grown up only a few miles away from the Max Gate site, and he describes in his preface to the “Wessex Edition” of his writing how his literary depictions of “landscape, prehistoric antiquities, and especially old English architecture” (Hardy was trained as an architect) were “done from the real.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> As biographer Michael Millgate notes, Hardy’s nineteenth-century rural upbringing led him “to know his own district with an intimacy which is today hard for most people to imagine,”<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> and early on he was aware of the imbrication of past and present in landscape. One poem, “The Roman Road,” points to the origins of this understanding, as Hardy relates how, with his mother “Guiding [his] infant steps,” they “walked that ancient thoroughfare.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> For readers of his novels, Hardy’s curiosity about the juxtapositions of past and present in specific places is evidenced by the death of Tess at Stonehenge or, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Mayor of Castorbridge</span>, the ancient Maumbery Rings—a Roman amphitheater, then town gallows, which becomes a site for pivotal narrative events.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
      Hardy explores such spatio-temporal layering—the sense that past and present coexist in certain places—not only in his novels, but also in his poetry, and especially, I argue, in his elegiac verse. In fact, Hardy’s experiments with meter in his later elegies demand a turn to geography because of the spatio-temporal relationships the prosody proposes.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> As Marjorie Levinson has recently claimed, “something funereal, melancholy, and haunted defines Hardy’s entire corpus,” and critics such as Ralph Pite and Wesley Kort have argued for a reconsideration of the role of place and geography in Hardy’s fiction.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> In this essay, I bring these two foci together to show how we can understand Hardy’s elegies more thoroughly through attention to their use of geography—the science of the description of the physical features of a place or region. This use allows Hardy to articulate loss as spatially bound and temporally shifting. Hardy’s elegies, as Jahan Ramazani has noted, are characteristic of modern elegies in their performance of a “melancholic mourning,” a label that points to the unresolved nature of his poetics of loss.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> One way that Hardy both expresses and contains this ambivalence is through geographic elements (maps, topographic features, toponymic references) as mediators of loss and presence. His poems thereby set up a relationship between the space of the verse and the charted places of Hardy’s England, effectively challenging the parameters of both elegiac poetry and geography.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> His prosodic and geographic experiments also point, I will suggest, to Hardy’s development of a particularly modernist form of mourning.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Hardy’s lifelong interest in geography originated in primary school where, he reports, he “excelled” at the subject (<span style="font-style:italic;">LI</span>, 20). Until late in the nineteenth century, in fact, primary school was the only place where geography was taught. Their field not yet recognized as a university subject, early-nineteenth-century geographers became increasingly defensive about biological and geological sciences encroaching on their terrain.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> One of the main developments that grew out of the resulting efforts to define and expand the scope of geography was the thematic map, created by cartographers like Alexander von Humboldt, which departed from the topographic map in its presentation of “an argument about invisible phenomena, or phenomena undergoing change, or about interactions between phenomena” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HVT</span> 250). One primary project in these maps was to formulate chartable spatio-temporal relationships. Humboldt experimented with different forms of graphic representation, including the use of graphs and tables alongside maps and, on the maps themselves, “isolines”—“lines drawn between measures of equal values of a particular phenomena”—which could reveal temporally deep relationships like the variation in phenomena over decades or centuries (<span style="font-style:italic;">HVT</span> 252–53). With these experiments, geography became not simply the charting of space as it is, but also as it was, and maps were able to represent this variation within a systematized space (<span style="font-style:italic;">HVT</span> 253). Maps could provide, therefore, a method of understanding temporal shifts as spatial events.
    </p>
<p>
      By the late nineteenth century, the movement for a “new geography”—a term that the influential geographer Halford Mackinder coined in the 1880s—had transformed the field.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Indeed, H. R. Mill claimed in a 1901 speech that “geography will be found to afford an important clue to the solution of every problem affecting the mutual relations  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of land and people.”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Under the guidance of Richard Strachey, the president of the Royal Geographical Society in the late 1880s, this new geography returned to the issues illuminated by thematic maps, stressing the “interpretation of present conditions through their physical evolution.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Geographers mapped out the multiple layers of use in a particular place, and the data provided by what these geographers termed “regional surveys” could be collected and collated, it was proposed, into a map of human relations. The geographers and social scientists behind this new movement, including Patrick Geddes, H. R. Mill, Halford Mackinder, A. J. Herbertson, and H. J. Fleure, argued that geography could act as the repository for studies of the relationship between past and present.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>
      This science of space, which aligns with Hardy’s own sense of the historically and personally saturated nature of his surrounding world, provided an external structure—the surveys and maps—through which to mediate individual, social, and environmental change. Yet Hardy’s use of geography in his writing refines, as well as represents, the discipline’s assumptions. The catalogue of Hardy’s library reveals his continuing interest in the field: he owned and annotated geographic manuals, guidebooks, and maps, which range from the mid-century textbook, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Manuel of Geography Physical, Industrial, and Political</span> , to later books that grew out of the new geography’s focus on regions (<span style="font-style:italic;">A Handbook for Residents and Travellers in Wilts and Dorset</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">The English Lake District</span> , for example).<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Despite these influences, Hardy uses his deep understanding of the historically charged nature of space to reject the narrative of progress (that understanding past uses of space will lead to more perfect future uses) that the discipline supposed. We see this most clearly in <span style="font-style:italic;">Satires of Circumstance, Lyrics and Reveries</span> , the book that contains Hardy’s famous elegiac sequence for his dead wife Emma—the “Poems of 1912–13”—as well as individual poems with titles that suggest the importance of place, such as “The Place on the Map,” “In Front of a Landscape,” and “Wessex Heights.” By turning to geography in his most elegiac lyrics, Hardy presents an interwoven past and present in which the mapped or physical places always reveal the inadequacy of the present and the inaccessibility of the past moment.
    </p>
<p>
      With this geographic focus, Hardy at first seems to be following in a long elegiac tradition of contextualizing grief within a pastoral setting that reflects the mourner’s loss.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> In Spenser’s “Astrophel. A Pastorall Elegie upon the death of the most Noble and valorous <span style="font-style:italic;">Knight, Sir Philip Sidney</span>” , one of the defining examples of the genre, the distraught poet’s lamentation transforms the natural world. “The woods, the hills, the rivers, shall resound/ The mournfull accent of my sorrowes ground,” the poet proclaims, and nature responds accordingly: “Woods, hills, and rivers, now are desolate.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> In Hardy’s world, however, nature is not so yielding, and the pathetic fallacy lies exposed. Hardy revises the conventional pastoral elegiac setting, transforming the regenerative space of nature into a series of charted or remembered spaces that thwart consolatory identification. Instead of nature containing and expressing the lost beloved so as to provide a substitute for the process of mourning, the natural world taunts the grief-stricken Hardy with its indifference—“Beeny did not quiver,” Hardy  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> notes in “A Death Day Recalled”—and with its evanescence: “Does there even a place like Saint-Juliot exist?” he asks in “A Dream or No” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CP</span> 350, 348). In “Wessex Heights,” a poem that precedes the Emma series, Hardy mourns the disappearance of the poet’s “simple self that was” and expresses a decidedly anti-elegiac fear and dislike of the dead, who emerge in the “lowlands” and the “great grey Plain” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CP</span> 319). Here nature and topography map out the haunted and the safe spaces in his region, effectively trapping Hardy in those few high spots where he can escape the ghosts of his past.
    </p>
<p>
      This version of a poeticized place-memory differs from those imagined by Hardy’s predecessors. For example, throughout Wordsworth’s “Poems on the Naming of Places,” the natural landmarks become markers of (and often marked by the names of) beloved individuals, thereby transforming physical places from elements of an abstracted geography into a memory-laden and richly resonant topography. In the second poem of the series, “To Joanna,” Wordsworth describes how, “In memory of affections old and true, / I chiseled out in those rude characters / Joanna’s name deep in the living stone: – / And I, and all who dwell by my fireside / Have called the lovely rock, J<small class="caps">oanna’s</small> R<small class="caps">ock</small>” . <a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Here a specific memory of Joanna <span style="font-style:italic;">in situ</span> inspires the poet (during a new encounter with the landscape) to create verbal signs—both the engraved name on the rock and the poem—that endow nature’s monuments with further meaning. Hardy, contrastingly, takes this form of poetic place–memory in his elegies and empties it of its generative function, producing instead lyrics that abstract the natural landscape into a map of those places that eschew personal meaning-making. The poem “Places” exemplifies this abstract mapping. Each stanza begins with a negation about the wider resonance of personally sacred spots (Hardy begins with the line, “Nobody says: Ah, that is the place” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CP</span> 352). On the one hand, Hardy ends with the claim, “Nay: one there is to whom these things, / That nobody else’s mind calls back, / Have a savour that scenes in being lack” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CP</span> 353), suggesting that the very writing of the poem is an affirmation of place-memory. On the other, however, this meaning only emerges in a memory-scape, rather than in a living and present landscape (the “scenes in being” and “the actual”). Place-memory proves fleeting and limited.
    </p>
<p>
      Even the last pieces in “Poems of 1912–13,” which tend to be read as successful culminations of the work of mourning where “the final res of persistence seem to be inscribed on certain places in nature,” show a double-edged and complex side to nature’s function as recorder and stabilizer (<span style="font-style:italic;">TEE</span> 254). For example, while Hardy claims in “At Castle Boterel” that what the rocks alongside the road “record in colour and cast / Is—that we two passed,” the emphasis on the space between “is” and “passed” suggests that the record is of their “passing,” or death, which has placed them (as a unit) irrevocably in the “past” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CP</span> 352). The rocks record the loss, but as such present us with a blankness, an emptiness that signifies the absence at the center of the mourner’s consciousness. Moreover, the poet is the only reader of this geologic record, and he ends the poem with the proclamation that he will “traverse old love’s domain / Never again,” effectively foreclosing the possibility that the record will remain. Later, in the final poem of the series, “Where the Picnic Was,” we move from the seemingly permanent geological etchings of “At Castle Boterel” to the decidedly transitory and man-made “burnt circle” of grass left over from a picnic outing with Emma and two  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> friends (who happened to be Yeats and Henry Newbolt) (<span style="font-style:italic;">CP</span> 357).<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Nature only records and manifests loss in the imagined space of poetic memory (on the rock) or through the transitory actions of humans (with the fire). The very continuation of the pastoral setting is called into question in “Where the Picnic Was” when we learn that the two surviving picnic-goers “have wandered far / From this grassy rise / Into urban roar / Where no picnics are.” Hardy complicates the idea that landscape can generate narratives that involve, in the words of W. J. T. Mitchell, “an inevitable, progressive development in history.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Instead, Hardy gives us a natural world that disappoints our expectations of continuity and our desire for consolation.
    </p>
<p>
      Hardy’s alternative vision of the relationship between place and memory emerges throughout the “The Place on the Map,” which richly illustrates the complex geographic and metrical patterns that Hardy employed in lieu of fashioning an empathetic natural world. First published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">English Review</span> , this poem was written at the height of Hardy’s exploration of the elegiac mode and reveals the extent to which spatial orders can serve to both manifest and perpetuate experiences of loss and mourning:

<p class="continued">
      At first glance, the map mentioned in the title seems to function as a touchstone for the speaker’s nostalgic reveries on a past event. The speaker (whom Hardy identifies in the original subtitle, “A Poor Schoolmaster’s Story”) describes an act that takes place in his present moment, but that leads him into the past. This past, we soon realize, embodies multiple losses—a long-ago love affair that has lead to a pregnancy (“the thing we found we had to face before the next year’s prime”), which would never be sanctioned by society and, presumably, resulted in the end of the affair. The speaker, however, begins with his view of the map, an experience that seems to be purely aesthetic in those first lines, as he notices the “varnished artistry” and the vibrant colors of the outlined land and water. Looking leads him to “mark,” a term that, in its ability to mean both geographical measurement and the musical “marking” of time, suggests the spatial and temporal overlap this poem will chart.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Such marking brings us back into the remembered scene, as the representation spurs the speaker to reconstruct the event. And yet we do not leave entirely the present-day scene of map-reading: the action is “unfolded” like the unfolding of the map and the place is remembered as a “spot”—a poetically resonant term for Hardy—as if the cartographic symbols have <span style="font-style:italic;">become</span> the memory. Such a conflation therefore compels a return to the map in the third stanza, setting up the imbrication of memory and map that structures the poem. The speaker illuminates the relationship between abstract representation and remembered event in the first lines of the stanza: “This hanging map depicts the coast and place, / And re-creates therewith our unforeboded troublous case.” Hardy’s use of the verb “re-create” points to the double act of creation that this poem grapples with: the spatial (re)presentation that results in a temporal (re)generation. The original event becomes doubly elided behind these two different orders of recreation.
    </p>
<p>
      The stakes of this movement between map and memory are manifest in the meter of the very first lines. The meter and form of the poem seem fixed in our first impression: the quatrains follow the same rhyme scheme (<span style="font-style:italic;">aaba</span>) and the shape of the stanzas stays the same, suggesting a pattern into which the language has been fit.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Yet scansion of the lines reveals a more complex relationship between metrical space and marking time. Take the first line: “I look upon the map that hangs by me—.” The line could be scanned as iambic pentameter with the stresses appearing regularly every two beats in the ten-syllable phrase. Yet placing equal stresses on all five of these syllables is awkward and does not account for the marked caesura at the end of the line; we could instead read the line as having three main stresses—on “look,” “map,” and “me” (words that suggest the central conflict of the poem). To do so means understanding the other two stresses (the “-on” in “up<span style="font-style:italic;">on</span>” and “hangs”) as secondary or even unstressed. We are left with a line that could easily be in trimeter with two of the feet having four syllables: unstressed, stressed, unstressed, unstressed (or light stress). The metrical reading of the line would appear as follows, with light stresses marked with the forward slash (\):
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
      ˘ / ˘ \ ˘ / ˘ \ ˘ / (˘ \) (dipodic trimeter)
    <br>
      I look upon the map that hangs by me –  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      Such a scansion would allow us to take into account the final dash, allowing it to stand in for the final beats and giving a metrical place to the silences in this poem.
    </p>
<p>
      Close attention to Hardy’s metrics in general seems important because of his interest in a major late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century debate concerning whether or not English verse was in essence dipodic. As Denis Taylor has shown, Coventry Patmore’s influential and inflammatory 1857 essay on “English Metrical Critics” (later titled “Essay on English Metrical Law”) had brought this issue to Hardy’s attention.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Though discussions of dipody remained on the fringe of prosodic debates, dipodic meter and Patmore’s essay still surfaced in texts including Omond’s <span style="font-style:italic;">A Study of Metre</span>  and the American George Stewart’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Metrical Technique</span>  and “A Method Toward the Study of Dipodic Verse” .<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Dipody refers to the idea that a foot can have as many as four beats, which means that a rhythm that we might first identify as, say, iambic tetrameter, might also be considered a dimeter with two feet of four syllables each. This theory entails more than the recounting and relabeling of feet. Rather, it suggests that a larger rhythmic pattern may contain a smaller one. A meter would be dipodic in particular if there seemed to be stresses with alternating levels of emphasis. Instead of having to count them all equally, one could see how they are part of a larger pattern of such alternating stresses. This means that one foot could contain both a primary and a secondary stress, the phenomenon that I discussed in the first line from “The Place on the Map.” Moreover, dipodic theory suggests that the silences in the lines may be integral (and countable) parts of the metrical pattern. Hardy’s interest in the measurement of silence is clear from passages he copied from Patmore’s essay: “Unless we are [ . . . ] to regard every verse affected with catalexis (or a deficiency in the number of syllables requisite to make it a full dimeter, trimeter, tetrameter, &amp;c) as constituting an entire metrical system in itself, which is obviously absurd, we must reckon the missing syllables as substituted by an equivalent pause.”<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Spatial absences must be accounted for in temporal measurements.
    </p>
<p>
      In this way, Hardy establishes an intertwined relationship between his metrical experiments and his thematic concerns, for a dipodic meter emphasizes the multiple times that can exist in the same verse space, none of which can be completely forgotten or abandoned. Indeed, Taylor has identified a number of Hardy poems where he experiments with a dipodic theory of meter and he argues that it is used most extensively in Hardy’s elegies (<span style="font-style:italic;">HMP</span> 95). Most significantly, a dipodic meter enforces a back-and-forth movement that emphasizes what is missing each time we settle on one rhythm. The sense of loss in both the present and the past becomes structurally irresolvable. This codification of loss gestures to what critics including Matthew Campbell and Tim Armstrong have described as the “ghostly” nature of Hardy’s elegiac metrical experiments. Referring to the same essay on “English Metrical Critics,” Campbell notes that Patmore’s theory of the immateriality of a metrical beat connects to Tennyson, Yeats, and, ultimately, Hardy’s sense that “sounding the verse provides the material experience not only of the verse in its own time, but also the ghosts of other rhythms from the past.”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> Armstrong continues this discussion of Hardy’s allusions to other poets and their rhythmic experiments, describing the simultaneous “textual replacement and textual  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> recovery” involved in Hardy’s version of mourning.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Yet a focus on dipody points us past the question of literary ghosting and towards the particularly temporal <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> spatial issues that the versification of loss presents. Dipodic theory works hand-in-hand with the elegy by making material the mourning process.
    </p>
<p>
      We can see the blurred boundaries between different times manifested thematically as “The Place on the Map” continues. While the past moment is aestheticized and made cartographic, the present is equally, if not more obscure. The map—not its context—is what we know of the present moment. And as the poem turns in stanza four to the past scene, the line between map and scene begin to blur, despite the numbering of the stanzas that suggests a legible divide between these two time periods. Now the scene is distinguished mainly by its colors and lines, just as the map was in the first stanza, while the sky is described as having “lost the <span style="font-style:italic;">art</span> of raining” (emphasis mine). Instead of returning to a contemplation of the map in stanza five, representation and remembrance become indistinguishable as the speaker reaches the climactic moment and the event that he cannot quite bring himself to describe. We are left with the ambiguous lines in the fifth stanza: “what in realms of reason would have joyed our double soul / Wore a torrid tragic light / Under order-keeping’s rigorous control.” The speaker will not specify who or what is keeping order (presumably those social norms that condemn pregnancy outside of marriage); in the context of the poem such order connects to the varnished lines of the map and to little outside of it, especially without the original subtitle and its suggestion that the scene takes place in a schoolroom.
    </p>
<p>
      We appear to return to the original divide between map and memory in the final stanza as the speaker describes how “the map revives her words, the spot, the time,” and yet this gesture to Wordsworth’s “spots of time” indicates the underlying loss that the poem charts. In Wordsworth’s terms, the spots of time have a “renovating virtue” that enables poetic creation and proves the authority of the mind over the senses.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Hardy’s spot of time, however, is the abstract representation on the map that confronts the speaker, in the end, with his own silence and the impossibility of returning to that moment—a thwarted interpretive episode. The “charted coast stares bright, / And its episode comes back in pantomime” ends the poem. The speaker is distanced even more now than in the beginning from the past scene, which is no longer relived in rich detail, but instead experienced as pantomime, a term that suggests the simultaneously mute and exaggerated or absurd nature of the past event.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Both the scenes of map-reading and the memory lose their temporal rootedness and distinction as the past enters into the present moment and the present transforms the past. In this way, the poem explores the simultaneity of seemingly distant moments through a geographically and metrically bound negotiation of loss and presence. Geography mediates memory and facilitates the mourning process, but it also thwarts the speaker’s desire to inhabit either past or present fully. The meter demands this ambiguity with verse lines that contain and suggest more than one “time,” thereby presenting a record of always-present loss.
    </p>
<p>
      Hardy refines and revises this spatial vision of the elegy in his poetic sequence, “Poems of 1912–13.” The structure of the whole sequence, positioned shortly after “The Place on the Map” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Satires of Circumstance</span>, is the movement between Hardy’s  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> home in Dorset and the Cornwall coast where he and his first wife Emma met—what Donald Davie calls his “stations in a personal purgatory.” <a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> But the movement between past and present through a haunted topography and temporally shifting meter likewise occupies the poems on an individual level. I would like to focus on two of the poems that stand at the center of the sequence, “A Dream or No” and “After a Journey,” both of which display Hardy’s development of a geographically inflected meter and a metrical geography. In the first poem, Hardy follows a rigid metrical form that allows him to question the assumption that the natural world remains stable, and thereby to point to the resulting crisis of memory. With his turn to dipody in “After a Journey,” Hardy begins to synthesize the poetic and the geographic experience of negotiating a space that exists in two times.
    </p>
<p>
      The always-present loss that defines the meter of “The Place on the Map” emerges even more clearly in the title of the twelfth poem in the “Poems of 1912–13” sequence, “A Dream or No.” Set up as if it is presenting a choice of presence and absence, the terms actually offer only a movement between fantasy and negation, the ephemeral and the empty. The dichotomy undoes itself before it has even begun, and we are primed to enter into a world where decisions and perspectives become self-reflexive. “A Dream or No” begins with two questions that get to the heart of Hardy’s concern with memory and place: “Why go to Saint-Juliot? What’s Juliot to me?” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CP</span> 348; see full text of the poem in <a name="app01-text" href="#app01">Appendix A</a>).<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> Specific locations in this poem both become the (questioned) impetus for movement and the clearest manifestations of the unstable nature of our experience of places. Ending the line with “me” sets the questions of motive and movement in relation to a spatially-based identity. While locations may define the self, self-definition is complicated by the instability of place over the course of the poem. Even in the first stanza, the stability and validity of the speaker’s perspective is challenged when he claims, “Some strange necromancy / But charmed me to fancy / That much of my life claims the spot as its key.”<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> In these lines, Hardy sets up a chain of connection between communication with the dead, imagination, and geographical places. The links here are being questioned, however, rather than affirmed. The stable identity of the geographical “spot” is based on an act of imagination that grew out of what could be termed a memory or a haunting.
    </p>
<p>
      This first stanza is worth pausing over further, for lines two and three were changed from their original appearance in the first edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Satires of Circumstance</span> , where they read, “I’ve been made but fancy / By some necromancy.”<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> These lines, while less rhythmically regular than his later revision, propose a curious and evocative role for the poet who has been made <span style="font-style:italic;">into</span> the imagined re through this act of communication with the dead Emma. Thus we begin the poem not only with a possible link between memory, imagination, and place, but also (in the original version) with a gesture to the destabilization of identity in the face of such space and time travel. The meaning of a place is open to debate, and the person constructing that meaning is open to reconration and (fanciful) invention.
    </p>
<p>
      Even though the role of place as key to identity and meaning is challenged in the first stanza, Saint-Juliot and its geography still structure the movement in the poem as  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the “spot” that the poetic imagination takes “as its key.” Thus Hardy’s description of how he traveled “coastward bound” to Saint-Juliot both indicates the physical movements that the poem charts and suggests how geography binds and shapes the dream as surely as do the measured stanzas. And yet the bounds of this geography are strangely ephemeral, as ghostly as the dead Emma. The place is not described in any tangible terms: he identifies it first as “that place in the West,” which harkens to the abstract geography of the spirit world as much as to an actual location in England. Aside from the lost beloved, the only other inhabitants that we see are the “sea-birds around her,” res that are more of the wind and the water than of the land. Indeed, in the last stanza Hardy questions the very existence of Saint-Juliot and its surrounding geographical features. The poem ends on the “flounce flinging mist” of Beeny and Bos cliffs, a description that transforms the geographical place into the very ghostly shape of the woman he imagines there. Through the conflation of place and re, geography and memory, Hardy suggests that this quest to locate his loss will result not in resolution nor any materialization of the lost Emma, but in a dematerialization of the landscape. “Such have I dreamed,” Hardy concludes after remembering their meeting.
    </p>
<p>
      In one way, the meter mirrors the insubstantiality of both the scene and the past. The first and fourth lines of the four line stanzas are in tetrameters, made up of an opening iamb and three succeeding anapests, which create a lilting, dancing effect.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> With their rising meters and regular stresses, the stanzas seem to “fling flounces” much in the same way as the misty cliffs. Yet there is a tedium to the inevitability of this rhythm, which has very little of the “cunning irregularity” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LII</span>, 78) that Hardy described as being at the center of his art. As Donald Davie observed, what can offend us in Hardy’s poetry is how “its form mirrors a cruel self-driving, a shape <span style="font-style:italic;">imposed</span> on the material, as it were with gritted teeth.”<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> “Self-driving” seems an appropriate term to use here; the poem takes place just before Hardy’s March 1913 trip to Cornwall to visit the sites of his early romance with Emma, and the insistent nature of the metrical movements suggests the rhythm of a moving car or train. Yet movement here has no obvious end: along with the meter, the rhyme scheme—<span style="font-style:italic;">abba</span>, etc.—reflects the circular and binding nature of the poet’s reflections and limits the movements to the confines of the prosodically mapped space. And, accordingly, Hardy is trying to describe a tortured movement between belief and disbelief, past and present, dream and reality. With the meter providing and perhaps even requiring such a structure of mental and physical movement, the poet is unable to arrive at an answer to his original questions. In fact, the poet’s reflections only breed more questions in an appropriately parallel fashion. An inverse relationship develops between the meter and the geography, as if they are maintaining an internal equilibrium; while the meter becomes increasingly set and tyrannical in its rhythm, the geography loses its structure. The metrical map insistently replaces the physical and emotional topography.
    </p>
<p>
      This strange dance between a geographical/temporal location and dislocation brings us to one of the puzzles of Hardy’s poetry that Marjorie Levinson has provocatively articulated: “how can a discourse be at once so <span style="font-style:italic;">thingified</span>. . . and at the same time, so blurred, foggy, and amorphous,” with explicitly “named suburbs, train stations,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> holiday spots, etc.” existing on the same plane as “landscapes that seem more like interior spaces” ? Levinson argues here that “in a world without spatial or temporal boundaries, loss itself disappears” . In “A Dream or No,” however, with its self-immolating, spatially-based identity juxtaposed against a “self-driving” meter, loss does not disappear altogether. Instead it changes from being temporally and spatially located in the dead Emma to becoming the pattern of experience itself. The landscape of dreams and memory runs up against the space of the present moment, and the resulting collision involves a loss to both of those times and spaces; neither can bear the interpretive weight that the other wishes to claim. Loss becomes systemic—the meter does not allow for a working through of the absence, but instead only magnifies the original question. Thus the poem ends by asking, “Does there even a place like Saint-Juliot exist?” This question signals not only the loss of the dead Emma and her ghost, but also of Hardy’s memory of his past relationship. Yet, with this reworking of the opening question, the poem also brings us back to toponymy (the study of place names) as the key to understanding what this loss might mean. The map must not only be reworked, but perhaps even entirely erased, for once the reality and meaning of one place has been questioned, all of the surrounding ones—Vallency Valley, Beeny, Bos—may be similarly lost.
    </p>
<p>
      A return to his experiments with dipodic structure in “After a Journey,” the most metrically ambitious poem in “Poems of 1912–13,” allows Hardy to resolve and (re)present the complications manifested by a landscape and meter that must negotiate past and present spaces. Again topography and toponymy structure the poem, which begins, it claims, “<span style="font-style:italic;">After</span> a Journey” (emphasis mine), but only allows the reader to reach that place—Pentargan Bay—after traversing the space of the verse:

      Pentargan Bay
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
    The poem’s first words, “Hereto I come,” suggest that Hardy too must locate himself, but this task is more complicated than the final place-name notation suggests. The poem explores the tensions between the assumed fixity of a topographic space—the bay and surrounding cliffs—and the mourner’s multiple and shifting experiences of the place. The setting forms a relationship of mutual dependence with poetic memory: the memories rely on the shaping presence of both geographic and verse space in order to come into being, while the geographic place gains its meaning from the personal and poetic mapping that brings us to the place name. With Pentargan Bay as a catalyst and a structure for memory, a memory that involves an actual revisioning and revisiting of past spaces, Hardy uses both stanzaic and physical mapping to manifest the multiple times at work in the physical space.
  </p>
<p>
    The direct experience of the landscape in the poem produces a haunting moment of timelessness within a temporally bounded episode. Even though the narrator gestures to the outside temporal events like the coming of dawn—“Soon you will have, Dear, to vanish from me, / For the stars close their shutters and the dawn whitens hazily”—he transcends this constraint within the space of the verse as he moves between past and present. We have flux within a closed realm, the traversing of time inside the physical boundaries produced by the bay and the lines of verse. Yet the “voiceless ghost” that draws the narrator to Pentargan Bay is a fleeting subject who appears and disappears, always eluding poetic fetters. Though the first line begins with a demonstrative locator—the deictic term “Hereto”—which suggests a place-bound memory, the verses cannot pin down the remembered woman, despite the final attempt made at the end with the naming of the bay. “Whither, O whither will its whim now draw me?” the speaker despairingly queries. The alliteration of “wh” emphasizes the airy unfixedness of his situation, both the breathlessness of a man running up and down the cliff paths, and the breathiness of the ephemeral shade. This fluctuating tone is embodied by the appearance of the verses on the page; the lines move in and out, as if mimicking the search for a ghost who keeps “coming and going.”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
    In the second stanza the language of metrical measurement appears—“<span style="font-style:italic;">Scanned</span> across the dark space wherein I have lacked you” (emphasis mine)—and we realize that the physical travel by the bay is made possible by metrical movements. Memory, the journey “across the dark space,” is represented as scansion (the counting of metrical feet); this measurement of the past, Hardy hopes, will provide his “voiceless ghost” with some insight and impetus to speak. Yet she is silent, and he must speak for her. In this versification of memory, we gain insight into the project of the poem: an attempt to re the unrable and to scan past moments by putting them into meter and charting them in space. Just as geographic place spurs memory, so does verse space, for the very forms of his poems provide the necessary shape and structure for his attempt to revisit the past. The opening alternating rhymes (<span style="font-style:italic;">abab</span>) produce a forward momentum and a feeling of anticipation as we wait for the next line to connect back. The rhyme aids the rhythm in propelling the verse forward, even as it enforces a moment of return. The second quatrain, however, produces a quite different effect, breaking up the established pattern and installing one (<span style="font-style:italic;">cddc</span>) that emphasizes containment rather than movement. In this juxtaposition the driving forces of the verse connect to the poet’s movements through space: he must engage in an almost harried trip around the Bay that provokes and is provoked by the circular motion of memory.
  </p>
<p>
    If we delve further into the meter, we can see how it performs a collapse of time within the verse space on both rative and literal levels. The meter manifests absence and loss in the unspoken beats that occupy each line, which correlates with Dennis Taylor’s reading of the poem as essentially dipodic in structure. Taylor argues that the first line’s apparent pentameter and the second line’s tetrameter (followed by an overwhelmingly tetrameter movement throughout) set up a “metrical conflict” that makes us aware of the submerged extra stress latent in the following lines and “takes us up and down the scale of [English verse] history” in its play with multiple rhythms (“the tetrameter of popular song stanzas and the pentameter of the Keatsian ode”).<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> Geographic and metrical time-travel thereby transform both Pentargan Bay and the poem into sites that register loss (the lost love, the past meters) even as they also master and rework that emptiness into a new shape and form.
  </p>
<p>
    Thus it becomes problematic to read “After a Journey,” as Peter Sacks does, as suggesting a primarily positive “assertion of continuous identity” and “Hardy’s recommitment to his early love” (<span style="font-style:italic;">TEE</span> 254). If we take into account the way in which this poem moves between metrical times and spaces (pentameter and tetrameter), the penultimate line, “I am just the same as when” carries less authority. If we have learned anything in this poem, it is that there is no such easy adherence to <span style="font-style:italic;">one</span> time nor maintenance of one static space: the poem and poet will always be shifting between two times and spaces, if not more. The modern elegy as Hardy presents it does not simply involve repetition—one of the conventions of elegy that establishes continuity and control of grief (<span style="font-style:italic;">TEE</span> 23)—but a repositioning that makes the return to the lost moment and place always new and jarring. The elegy balances between two times within a space that is defined by what it is not: “Scanned across the dark space wherein I have lacked you.” Ramazani writes that “Hardy begets his poetry in the dark space of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> his lack” (<span style="font-style:italic;">POM</span> 58), but we could also think of it as a poetic shaping of absence—the materialization of that dark space into meter and the mapping of loss. “The Place on the Map,” “A Dream or No,” and “After a Journey” portray a geography and prosody defined by what is absent as much as by what is present. These poems thereby highlight the conceptual and material distance that cartographers themselves try to elide: the gap between immediate spatio-temporal experiences and a patterned understanding of them (and attempt to access them) provided by a map. Hardy here maps the gap between a real place and a past moment, creating a chart in which the loss—the hope and the bitterness of perpetual movement and unresolved mourning—provides the contour lines of the landscape.
  </p>
<p>
    With poems that enact this unresolved mourning through their presentation of a geographically and prosodically imbricated space-time, we see Hardy formulating a theory of spatial experience that has decidedly modernist overtones. As geographer Timothy Oakes has argued, place itself may be the site of “modernity’s paradoxes and contradictions” where the “tension between progress and loss” is geographically expressed.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> While Oakes focuses on Hardy’s novels as presenting us with an “unstable landscape of process” in which readers negotiate “a tense <span style="font-style:italic;">relationship</span> between dwelling and detachment” (<span style="font-style:italic;">PPM</span> 517, his emphasis), I think that his terms usefully illuminate how Hardy’s elegies formally and thematically explore a version of this spatial paradox. The experience of the subject in place will result in the subject displaced, and this displacement will be provoked and manifested by the multiple (and mutually exclusive) times at work within each place. As such, place no longer functions as “a site of both <span style="font-style:italic;">meaningful identity and immediate agency</span>” (<span style="font-style:italic;">PPM</span> 510, his emphasis), but as a site where identity is unstable and agency shifting. Even further, the poetry transforms each place into a new cartographic space in which the key is always changing and the most important map-reading occurs in the negative space.
  </p>
<p>
    This unwieldy version of map-reading leads me back to “Wessex Heights,” which was the poem Hardy used to open <span style="font-style:italic;">Satires of Circumstance, Lyrics and Reveries</span> in the first edition. This original placement underscores the importance of parsing the poem’s rative and literal perspectives, for the verses thereby functioned as a primer to the lyrics that followed.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> “Wessex Heights ,” which moves towards a progressively more abstracted and identity-erasing lyric space, is an awkward piece to read because the tension between rhythm and words at times seems overwhelming (for full text see <a name="app02-text" href="#app02">Appendix B</a>). Hardy starts us with a seemingly static location:

<p class="continued">
  Although we begin the poem rooted in time and space—the title presents an identifiable place and a particular year<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a>—this sense of fixity is upended by the end of the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> first stanza. From the specificity of two geographic prominences—Ingpen Beacon and Wylls-Neck—and of the present tense (“when I stand”), the speaker suddenly shifts to a place that evades such charting: the space of the distant past and distant future (“I seem where I was before my birth, and after death may be”). The long heptameter lines crowd the page and, by the end of the stanza, create a tongue-twisting reading experience because of the midline caesuras, which suggest to the reader that, for example, the phrase “I seem where I was before my birth” should fit (though it does not) into the same metrical time as the second half of the line: “and after death may be.” Such awkwardness in this instance is deliberate; Hardy decided to use “before” instead of the “ere” that was in the manuscript, thereby adding another stressed syllable and speeding up the first half of the line.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> As Taylor briefly notes, the long lines “invite division into a larger multiple,” hinting at the possibility of an alternative dipodic reading (heptameter becoming tetrameter, for example) that might emerge at moments and suggest the possibility of more than one time (or of two coexisting times) at work in the lyric space.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> This often unwieldy conflict between metrical time and space functions as an aural and visual reminder of one of the central problems in this piece: the negotiation of the relationship between specific geographic spots and fixed past events and the ephemeral negative space and time shaped by the Wessex Heights and sounded by the dipodic background.
</p>
<p>
  The movement that Hardy sets up, therefore, in this first stanza is one in which precise physical locations are counterbalanced by a negative space. The temporal and spatial indeterminateness of the first stanza’s final line foreshadows the poem’s syntactical tendencies. Hardy avoids enjambment and the resulting sense of surfeit meaning and instead breaks the lines in the middle with strong caesuras, pauses that hint at an empty space at the center of this poetic experience. The shape of these lines and the occasional excess of syllables point to the juxtaposing forces at work in the poem: on the one hand, the constraints of the physical and emotional cartography that the poem presents; on the other, a desire to draw a new map of the Wessex Heights that charts spots that are emotionally arid rather than emotionally resonant. In so doing, Hardy brings us back to one of the tenets of the “new geography” and its thematic maps. His stanzas about the lowlands and towns where he is “tracked by phantoms having weird detective ways” and is “barred by the forms now passed / For everybody by me, in whose long vision they stand there fast” present us with geographic areas that manifest personal history—a temporally deep set of relationships that form the isolines in this lyric cartography. Yet he charts these layers only to avoid them, proposing instead to escape to the curiously empty toponymy of the heights.
</p>
<p>
  Poems such as “The Place on the Map,” “After a Journey,” and even “Wessex Heights” turn to dipody—one of the most debated forms in late-Victorian prosody—to express metrically loss and the resulting layered space-time relationship. At the same time, Hardy takes the layering that contemporary geography proposes and points to the slippages and fissures in such a project. Spatio-temporal relationships, these poems suggest, are no longer governed by natural and geographic laws; they point to a modernist space, as Philip Weinstein describes it, not “open to orientation and ownership.”<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> Hardy combines contemporary geography’s concern with charting space <span style="font-style:italic;">through</span> time and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> prosody’s interest in the times <span style="font-style:italic;">within</span> lyrical space in order to suggest that the “place on the map” may be in fact the spot that evades, rather than enables, meaning-making. Thus the melancholic mourning that critics have characterized as central to modernist expressions of grief involves, in Hardy’s formulation, a Janus-faced prosody that maps a haunted terrain of loss.

	The two terms that I use in this sentence, space and place, have been the subject of discussion by both geographers and cultural or literary critics. Space, the more inclusive the two terms, is usually designated as an <span style="font-style:italic;">a priori</span>, abstract arena (see Wesley Kort’s discussion in <span style="font-style:italic;">Place and Space in Modern Fiction</span>). In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Production of Space</span> [ trans. Donald Nicholson-Smith (Blackwell, 1991)], Henri Lefebvre challenged this Enlightenment model with his version of space as created by social processes. Yet, while space now is seen as constructed and, therefore, ideologically bound, it still functions as an inclusive term that can be applied to both physical and mental arenas. Place, on the other hand, is used to refer to, in the words of the geographer Timothy Oakes, “a site of both <span style="font-style:italic;">meaningful identity and immediate agency</span>” [“Place and the Paradox of Modernity,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Annals of the Association of American Geographers</span> 87.3 : 510, emphasis mine; hereafter abbreviated <span style="font-style:italic;">PPM</span>]. These elements of place become, my paper argues, contested in the Hardy’s elegies.
      </p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f10" href="#f10-text">10. </a>
	Specifically <span style="font-style:italic;">modernist</span> mourning has been the focus of a number of recent critical works. Ramazani’s book is, of course, an early example of this. More recent discussions of the connections between modernist aesthetic concerns and the project of mourning occur in Alessia Ricardi’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ends of Mourning: Psychoanalysis, Literature, Film</span> (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2003); Patricia Rae’s collection of essays on <span style="font-style:italic;">Modernism and Mourning</span> (Lewisberg: Bucknell University Press, 2007); and Seth Moglen’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Mourning Modernity: Literary Modernism and the Injuries of American Capitalism</span> (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2007). All of these works share a commitment to exploring the continuum between mourning and melancholia—a continuum that Rae, for one, asks us to revisit through an examination of the formal strategies of modernist texts that may offer “resistance” to mourning .

Geography was not a recognized field in universities until the last decades of the nineteenth century. The Royal Geographical Society began to push for this recognition in 1871, but it was only in 1886  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that Oxford and Cambridge agreed to add geography to their curriculums [Sir John Scott Keltie, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Position of Geography in British Universities</span> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1921), 1–4]. Halford Mackinder was the first reader in geography appointed to Oxford (in 1887), and he remained the only one until 1899, when Oxford established an independent school of geography and Mackinder hired A. J. Herbertson as a lecturer [Robert E. Dickinson, <span style="font-style:italic;">Regional Concept: The Anglo-American Leaders</span> (Boston: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1976), 44].

	Though I group these geographers together, it is important to note that their definitions of regional survey and their vision of its use exhibit differences. Mackinder, for example, saw the study of regions as a means of strengthening Britain’s relationship with its imperial holdings. Geddes, on the other hand, was interested in using surveys to understand the interactions between different regions and between humans and their environment, especially as a precursor to town planning and the development of natural resources (Meller, 133–37). In addition, see David Matless, “Regional Surveys and Local Knowledges: The Geographical Imagination in Britain, 1918–1939,” [<span style="font-style:italic;">Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers</span> 17. 4 : 464–80], for a discussion of this view of “locality as microcosm” .

    This view of Hardy’s poetry is reinforced by his oft-quoted comment about his method of composition, which he describes in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Life</span>: “Among his papers were quantities of notes on rhythm and metre: with outlines and experiments in innumerable original measures, some of which he adopted from time to time. These verse skeletons were mostly blank, and only designed by the usual marks for long and short syllables, accentuations, etc., but they were occasionally made up of “nonsense verses”—such as, he said, were written when he was a boy by students of Latin prosody with the aid of a ‘Gradus’” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LII</span>, 79–80).

    Omond references Patmore’s essay and is sympathetic to the idea of a foot containing “action and reaction, systole and diastole,” but he dismisses Patmore’s claim that dipody necessitates a silent foot at the end of every line [<span style="font-style:italic;">A Study of Metre</span> (London: Grant Richards, 1903), 80]. In his essay, George Stewart tries to make the proof for dipodic meters more scientific with what he calls the “Dipodic Index”: an analysis of the stresses accorded different parts of speech in various poems [“A Method Toward the Study of Dipodic Verse,” <span style="font-style:italic;">PMLA</span> 39.4 : 989]. The debate continues today. After hearing my presentation at the 2007 MSA conference, scholar and poet Stephen Burt wrote about it on a Poetry Foundation blog (<span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2007/11/the_map_that_hangs_by_me.html" target="_blank">http://poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2007/11/the_map_that_hangs_by_me.html</a></span>), and several people responded to his entry with their own readings regarding whether or not “The Place on the Map” could be considered dipodic.

      Donald Davie, <span style="font-style:italic;">With the Grain: Essays on Thomas Hardy and Modern British Poetry</span> (Manchester: Carcanet Press, 1998), 11. To the confusion of his readers, in most of his volumes Hardy arranged his poems in a haphazard order that accounts for neither the chronology of composition nor thematic similarities. In his defensive “Apology” at the beginning of his 1922 book <span style="font-style:italic;">Late Lyrics and Earlier</span> (the title of which itself suggests a disrupted chronology and a retrospective process of creation), Hardy provides an inadequate explanation of this seemingly careless practice, claiming that “the difficulties of arranging the themes in a graduated kinship of moods would have been so great  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that irrelation was almost unavoidable with efforts so diverse” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CP</span> 559). And while Hardy was known to be careless about certain elements of composition, most notably in the serializations of his novels, I think that a more satisfying reason behind his haphazard ordering is that, in terms of the way that Hardy saw space and time interacting, such juxtapositions are more true to life than would be neat chronologies of cause and effect.

    “Fancy” is Hardy’s chosen term for the project of poetry, as he makes clear with his critique of Wordsworth’s choice of the word “imagination” in the Preface to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Lyrical Ballads</span>. He baldly rewrites Wordsworth’s formulation: “He should have put the matter somewhat like this: In works of <span style="font-style:italic;">passion and sentiment</span> (not ‘imagination and sentiment’) the language of verse is the language of prose. In works of <span style="font-style:italic;">fancy</span> (or <span style="font-style:italic;">imagination</span>), ‘poetic diction’ (of the real kind) is proper, and even necessary” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LII</span>, 85).

    I read the middle two lines, which only have two stresses and are likewise set off by their indentations, as amphibrachs (∼ / ∼), which create a similarly rhythmical movement, though one could also scan them as containing three feet (iamb, pyrrhic, trochee). I find the amphibrach more convincing because of the galloping rhythm of the poem as a whole.

Oakes makes his argument to counteract scholars who have claimed that modernity in general (and modernism, in particular) ignored and suppressed the idea of place (the local and specific) in favor of an abstract, totalizing space. See David Harvey’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Condition of Postmodernity</span> (Cambridge: Blackwell, 1990), especially chapter 15, for a discussion of this Enlightenment model of space.

    1896 was the year when Hardy was recovering from the uproar around <span style="font-style:italic;">Jude</span> and when he wrote about his hope to express “more fully in verse ideas and emotions which run counter to the inert crystallized opinion” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LII</span>, 57).

    Change noted in Hynes, 25. Hardy uses a number of amphibrachs in this poem, in particular at the end of the first half of the lines (“in <span style="font-weight:bold;">Wes</span>sex” ; “no <span style="font-weight:bold;">com</span>rade” , for example (stressed syllables  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> are bold)).

      Most scholars of modernism are also teachers of modernism, and a significant proportion of our day-to-day intellectual labor involves prompting our students to engage with notoriously “difficult” cultural artifacts. An outsider to the discipline might therefore well imagine that our scholarly conferences and specialist journals are awash with discussions about this crucial and highly challenging aspect of our work. Nothing, however, could be further from the truth. Since the founding of the Modernist Studies Association eleven years ago, teaching-related events have accounted for fewer than 1% of the panels, roundtables, and seminars on offer at the MSA’s annual conference. Likewise, in the fifteen-year history of <span style="font-style:italic;"></span>, this journal has not published a single article devoted entirely to the teaching of modernism—until now.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>
      In a field of study that openly welcomes international, multicultural, and interdisciplinary approaches, why has pedagogy remained such a persistently untrendy—indeed, virtually taboo—subject? The reasons are as complex and multifarious as modernism itself. Some are economically inflected: most modernist scholars work in university environments where innovative research earns measurable rewards, whereas innovative teaching does not. Personal preference plays a role as well; many academics regard disciplinary conferences and journals as a welcome respite from the daily grind of teaching, which routinely requires  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> them to “dumb things down” for easy digestion by undergraduates. Finally and perhaps most crucially, literary scholars have in many cases never been trained to represent teaching as a scholarly activity—that is, as a complex, research-informed, theoretically-grounded intellectual practice. Influential pedagogical manifestos such Ernest Boyer’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Scholarship Reconsidered</span> (which seeks to reconre teaching as a form of scholarship) and Donald Schön’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Reflective Practitioner</span> (which argues for the importance of a theorized, reflective pedagogy) have largely passed our discipline by.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>
      In an effort to encourage more high-quality discourse around teaching, the MSA Program Committee sponsors an annual Open Forum on Teaching, now in its fourth year. The inaugural Open Forum in 2006 was titled “Teaching out of the Archives” (in keeping with the Tulsa conference theme) and featured seven inventive teachers—Ben Alexander, Michael Coyle, Annette Debo, Amanda Golden, Sean Latham, Jerome McGann, and Cristanne Miller—discussing how and why they incorporated archival materials into their teaching. At the 2007 Open Forum in Long Beach, a series of brief teaching anecdotes launched an animated debate on the uses and value of innovative pedagogies. The 2008 Open Forum in Nashville, organized by John Whittier-Ferguson and Victor Luftig, sought to address some of the broader institutional and socio-cultural issues involved in the teaching of modernism. All three events drew large, appreciative audiences, suggesting that there is a place for teaching around the MSA conference table after all.
    </p>
<p>
      This “MSA Teaching Forum cluster” seeks to capture some of the energy, engagement, and collaborative ethos of the 2007 Teaching Forum, which addressed the topic of “Making It New.” The contributors to this cluster represent a range of academic ranks (from graduate student to full professor), institutions (from small liberal arts colleges to large public universities), and geographical locations (U.S., Canada, U.K., New Zealand). In an attempt to preserve at least some aspects of our lively, non-linear conversation in Long Beach, each of the six panelists was asked to do the following:
    </p>
<ol>
<li><p>1.   
	  submit a question about innovative teaching for the other panelists to consider;
	</p></li>
<li><p>2.   
	  contribute a brief first-person essay that addresses one of those questions via a specific, concrete teaching anecdote grounded in theoretical reflection;
	</p></li>
<li><p>3.   
	  read and comment on one another’s essays, so that the contributions have the texture of an ongoing intellectual conversation rather than a set piece or lecture.
	</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="continued">
      The resulting exchange captured in these pages substitutes conspicuous indicators of academic heft (e.g. footnotes, works cited, carefully crafted sentences) for the spontaneity, serendipity, and interactivity that characterized the live event. What survives intact here, however, is the power of the teachers’ voices, resonant with intelligence, good humor, concern for their students, and an abiding belief in the value of innovative teaching.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

      A surge in interest among modernist scholars in the area of textual editing has made itself evident this past year. Hailed as a “new direction” in modernist studies at the most recent meeting of the Modern Language Association, editing was also the theme of the 2008 International Conference on Virginia Woolf.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> The dizzying array of panels devoted to textual editing, electronic editions, and digital archiving at the most recent MLA meeting testifies to a profession-wide interest in the possibilities of digital environments, particularly as economic constraints continue to make academic publishing increasingly inhospitable to expensive editorial undertakings. The proliferation of electronic editions and digital archives, and the attendant theoretical discussion of them, is bringing renewed attention to the largely invisible textual theories and practices that underlie both digital and print editions.
    </p>
<p>
      Post-eclectic print editions of modernist works have been in existence for several decades: Hans Gabler’s 1983 genetic edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, which utilizes a diachronic, synoptic apparatus for the display of textual variants; Valerie Eliot’s documentary edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wasteland</span>, which features photofacsimile reproductions and transcriptions of the holograph and typescript versions of the work; the documentary Cornell Yeats, which similarly includes photofacsimile reproductions and transcriptions of each poem; and an archival edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ezra Pound’s Poetry and Prose: Contributions to Periodicals.</span> Post-eclectic electronic editions of Ezra Pound’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Cantos</span>, the notebooks for James Joyce’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegan’s Wake</span>, and Samuel Beckett’s manuscripts are only a few of the many modernist editorial projects presently underway. Merry  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Pawlowski and Vara Neverow’s electronic facsimile edition of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> reading notes and Julia Briggs’s electronic genetic edition of the “Time Passes” section of <span style="font-style:italic;">To the Lighthouse</span> are the first efforts to bring Virginia Woolf’s writing into the electronic realm.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">Woolf Online: An Electronic Edition and Commentary of Virginia Woolf’s “Time Passes”</span> is significant not only for the insight it offers into the novel’s rich composition history, but for being the first edition of a work written by Woolf to have been edited according to contemporary textual editing theories and practices.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Virginia Woolf’s works historically have been, and continue to be, edited according to a modernist, essentialist view of textuality that emphasizes the importance of final authorial intention and the production of emended, definitive editions of texts. Established with W. W. Greg’s influential 1950 essay “The Rationale of Copy-Text” and subsequently developed through the work of Thomas Tanselle and Fredson Bowers, this approach is regarded as “modernist” in its view of the work of art as a “well-wrought urn, at once unitary, authoritative, and superior to historical contingency, the product instead of an autonomous creative artist.”<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> D. C. Greetham identifies both as “exemplary modernist practices” in their “organicist, artefactual view of literature and a single unitary consciousness” in which the work of art “is perceived in spatial terms of closure and completion rather than postmodernist open-ended fragmentation.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>
      The temporary lifting of copyright on Woolf’s writings in 1992 produced a spate of new eclectic editions of Woolf’s works by Hogarth, Blackwell, Penguin, and World’s Classics<span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> one of which (Hogarth) identified its edition as “definitive” and another (Blackwell) as “authoritative.” These editions consistently privilege the production of clear reading texts derived, with very few exceptions, from the first British editions of Woolf’s works, which are generally regarded as possessing the greatest textual authority. The rationale of one series editor, who selected the British first edition as copy-text as “a practical way of shedding the accumulated errors of later editions,” exemplifies a common practice central to the eclectic approach to textual editing: what Gerald Grigely has called “textual eugenics,” the impulse to “purify” the text by stripping it of its corruptions.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Elsewhere, she distinguishes between “good” and “bad” reprint series, identifying the former as “a carefully edited text with a helpful introduction and notes” and the latter as one that “reproduces a corrupt, much reprinted text with no supporting material at all”: a dialectic implicit in Naomi Black’s reference to her edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> for Blackwell as “a ‘good’ text, one that is properly edited, annotated, and placed in context.”<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Briggs attributed the fact that few “serious attempts to edit Woolf’s individual texts according to contemporary scholarly practice” had been made prior to 1992 to the fact that insufficient training in theories and practices of textual editing had rendered her early editors “hardly equal to the task of formulating appropriate textual policies, far less of implementing them” (“BT,” 147). Hans Gabler similarly observed how
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	Unlike Eliot’s, Virginia Woolf’s writings have received a variegated range of editorial activity, marked at the same time, however, by lack of coordination, uncertain or absent principles, lack of methodological awareness and mutual incomprehension among the several concurrent editorial enterprises. . . . The transcripts of Woolf’s manuscripts that have been made available reflect little or no concerted thinking as to the nature of transcriptions.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      He went on to conclude in the year 2006 that the task of “<span style="font-style:italic;">editing Virginia Woolf</span> quite simply still remains to be undertaken”—and that “it is not merely the editing, but also the thinking about editing Woolf that needs to be undertaken from scratch.”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>
      That no transcription or edition of the holograph and typescript fragments of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> or its sister text, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Years</span>, has been published more than thirty years after the feminist recuperation of Woolf began—and in light of the fact that holograph drafts and/or transcriptions of those drafts have been published for each of her other major works—is surprising given feminists’ early attention to the holograph drafts of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Years</span>, which were instrumental in bringing to light Woolf’s proclivity toward self-censorship.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> The discrepancy between the pre-publication and published versions of her works is particularly marked in her work of the thirties, the decade in which she was engaged in her most forceful critique of militarist, capitalist, fascist, patriarchal, and imperialist ideologies. While self-censorship can be seen in earlier works such as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">To the Lighthouse</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">A Room of One’s Own</span>, it is particularly pronounced in <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Years</span>, the companion-text and fictional counterpart of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas.</span><a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> The 900 page holograph draft of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Years</span> reveals the development of Woolf’s feminist pacifist critique of war and the fictional origins of her re of the Outsider. Comparing the holograph draft with the 420 page published version, Grace Radin concludes that the holograph suggests “an explicitly political novel” that differs greatly from the final product: absent is Woolf’s “radical and explicit ‘outsider’s’ denunciation of a male-dominated, imperialistic, war-mongering and class-ridden society.”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>
      A resurgent interest in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Years</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> as Woolf’s most overtly political works makes the absence of published holograph facsimiles and transcriptions all the more unfortunate. The current state of affairs can be explained in part by the longstanding bias among critics and publishers for Woolf’s fiction—and quite specifically <span style="font-style:italic;">against</span> the vitriolic <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>—and in part by the sheer extensiveness of the holograph documents, in the case of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Years</span>, and the complex, fragmented nature of those that exist in the case of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas.</span><a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Complete transcriptions of the holographs drafts and fragments are essential for fostering deeper insight into the origins of these, her two most politically ambitious works. But editorial attention to <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> must extend beyond simply reproducing and transcribing holograph fragments if the proposed edition is to suggest something beyond the synchronous dimension of an individual textual state and something of the social and cultural context in which it was conceived, composed, published, and transmitted.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> The gradual supplanting of the modernist, eclectic approach to textual editing by a postmodernist approach that celebrates textual fluidity, along with a more expansive notion of textuality, offers rich possibilities for a future edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> that capable of displaying that work’s extensive pre-publication fragments.
    </p>
<p>
      Several shifts have taken hold within textual editing during the past twenty-five years that have helped to destabilize the hegemony of eclecticism in Anglo-American editing: the rise of social textual criticism, introduced in the early 1980s with Jerome McGann’s <span style="font-style:italic;">A Critique of Modern Textual Criticism</span> and D. F. McKenzie’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts</span>; the widespread implementation of textual versioning in modern editions such as the Cornell Wordsworth and the Cornell Yeats; and the westward migration  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of Continental genetic editing theory and practice, made palpable by Hans Gabler’s 1983 synoptic edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses.</span><a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Over the last quarter century, the general direction of textual editing has been away from modernist, eclectic editions that offer emended, clear reading texts, and toward postmodernist editions that showcase the instability and plurality of a given work as witnessed in its multiple textual states. An important part of this shift was the historicizing of the literary work advocated by Jerome McGann, whose seminal work destabilized the notion of “final authorial intention” by redefining the authoritative text as “always one that has been socially produced” and the central practice of literary criticism as “a complex structure of analysis which considers the history of the text in relation to the related histories of its production, reproduction, and reception” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CMTC,</span> 75, 123). While the practice of versioning predates McGann’s work by nearly four centuries, his redefinition of the literary work as composed of “a series of specific ‘texts’” was instrumental in theorizing a “versionist” sense of textuality that located the existence of the literary work “not in any one version, but in all the versions put together.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>
      With its ability to accommodate multiple versions of a work and highlight variation among those versions, the post-eclectic approach to textual editing is particularly suitable for the editing of modernist works for which extensive pre-publication documents exist. Ultimately, the modernist and postmodernist approaches to textual editing are diametrically opposed in their methods of handling textual variants: while the modernist, intentionalist approach to textual editing emphasize a separation of text and apparatus that subordinates the latter in favor of a clear reading text, the post-eclectic, postmodernist approach to textual editing refuses this distinction, preferring textual open-endedness to closure and the display of variants to their concealment. In this way, “variance becomes not a quality to be subsumed in the ideal . . . but, on the contrary, the innate condition of textuality and of the editing that reflects this condition.”<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Post-eclectic textual editions concern themselves primarily with the display of versions and variants, calling attention to “the tension existing between differentiated states. . . . at what occurs in the transition between texts and how our critical locus may not be on one text or another text, but at the point of transition between those texts” (<span style="font-style:italic;">TA,</span> 48, 49).

</h1>
<p>
	The questions of precisely <span style="font-style:italic;">what</span> may be said to constitute a version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> and precisely <span style="font-style:italic;">where</span> the boundaries of the work are situated are contentious at best. In light of the work’s complex composition history spanning eight years, and Woolf’s proclivity toward self-censorship, feminist scholars generally agree that the boundaries of the work extend beyond its several published versions to include pre-publication materials.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Thus, the editor of the Shakespeare Head edition of the work, Naomi Black, identifies five versions of the work in addition to the first British and American editions, including Woolf’s manuscript notes for the speech she gave to the London National Society for Women’s Service in 193l; her typescript of that speech; the published  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> version of that speech, “Professions for Women” ; the interchapters of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Pargiters</span>; and the two-part essay “Women Must Weep—Or Unite Against War,” published in the May–June 1938 <span style="font-style:italic;">Atlantic Monthly.</span><a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Black’s decision to restrict herself to only those versions that have appeared in print allows her to circumvent the difficult question of how to view the holograph and typescript fragments of that work. Moreover, her assumption that the work’s boundaries are coterminous with its publication, rather than extending beyond the moment of publication, allows her also to circumvent the question of whether subsequent texts that extend the logic and analysis of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> might also be regarded as versions of that work. Jane Marcus, for example, adopts a more expansive view of versioning that includes pre-publication documents such as reading notes and scrapbooks; excised passages, including the interchapters of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Pargiters</span> and unpublished portions of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Years</span>; and works both previous and subsequent to <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> that are thematically linked to it, including “A Society,” <span style="font-style:italic;">A Room of One’s Own</span>, and the introduction to <span style="font-style:italic;">Life As We Have Known It</span>.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Anna Snaith likewise suggests that the correspondence received, and in many cases responded to, by Woolf following the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>—correspondence that helped her extend the argument of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> in later essays like “Why?,” “Reviewing,” and “Thoughts on Peace in an Air Raid”—should be considered an “extension of the text” itself, as “part of the huge body of evidence for the links between patriarchy, war and fascism, the links between public and private tyrannies.”<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Provided that one conceives the boundaries of the work to be sufficiently broad on both ends, one might also reasonably add to these her little-known essay, “The Plumage Bill” , “Two Women: Emily Davies and Lady Augusta Stanley” , <span style="font-style:italic;">Flush</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> “Reviewing” , “Thoughts on Peace in an Air Raid” , and “Why?” , all of which share thematic and rhetorical similarities with <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas.</span> Such an expansive view of textual boundaries is consistent with postmodernist notions of textuality and intertextuality, in which “the materials of which the peaks of ‘finished’ literary works are composed are seen to be interlinked, symbiotic, and in continuous, interrelated flux” and in which “relationships within and between the author’s writings form, as it were, an <span style="font-style:italic;">authorial</span> intertextuality, a continuum of authorship.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Various schools of thought exist as to what constitutes a version of a literary work, with debate generally centering on whether a version ought to be determined by the number of variants or by the textual significance of those variants, whether versions need have a material basis, and whether versions must be authorial. On the one hand is the geneticists’ view that a version is “constituted by a single variant” and forms a discrete semiotic system comprised of interlocking linguistic parts that exist only in relation to one another.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> A common objection to the structuralist view is that it fails to impose any qualitative criteria and therefore produces versions that are otherwise insignificant. Other textual theorists like Peter Shillingsburg, Thomas Tanselle, Siegfried Scheibe, and John Bryant have attempted to establish qualitative, content-based criteria by which to base their determinations.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> In attempting to define what is understood as a “distinctive phase of creation,” Bryant finds useful Scheibe’s concept of revisions that function as “turning points” in the overall development of the work, those “decisive  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> change[s]” that occur early in the work’s composition, as opposed to the changes made later on in the revision process that “that tend to involve fine-tunings of already conceived texts.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> He also finds helpful Tanselle’s distinction between “vertical revisions” that transform the work substantively and “horizontal revisions” that “refine the expression of a passage without changing the drift or general effect of the whole” (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT</span> 85). Content, rhetorical function, and authorial intention intersect, however, in the criteria that he ultimately adopts: versions must display “a <span style="font-style:italic;">strategic</span> pattern of revision evincing some <span style="font-style:italic;">reconception of the function of the work itself</span>” that evidences an author’s “attempt to manipulate a readership differently.” As a result, each version can be seen to possess a “definable <span style="font-style:italic;">rhetorical impact</span>” that “necessarily alter[s] our reading of a work” (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT,</span> 90; italics in original).
      </p>
<p>
	A second debate concerns whether a version need have a material basis. The materialist position, adopted by social text theorists Jerome McGann, D. F. McKenzie, and Jack Stillinger, identifies a version with its physical documents. This view is implicit in Donald Reiman’s position that “if holograph mss or authoritative transcriptions of the work survive in sufficiently distinctive states, they themselves ought to be published as versions.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Tanselle, Shillingsburg, and Bryant, on the other hand, argue that versions need not exist in physical form, but can include mental or conceptual states that lead to the development of the work. Equating the version with “the conception or aim of the Work at a point of Utterance,” Shillingsburg distinguishes among potential, developing, and essayed versions: while often physically unrecoverable, a potential version “refers to the abstract incipient ideas about the Work as it grows in the consciousness of the author” and may include “abstract conceptual concepts in the mind of an author” as well as notes or preliminary drafts, while developing versions are said to consist of “trial drafts in some material form” and essayed versions of “completed manuscripts or revised texts.”<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Potential versions may also include what Bryant refers to as “inferred versions,” which “can only be speculated upon and constructed out of partial evidence found in the document” (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT,</span> 79). Bryant distinguishes between three kinds of versions, each corresponding with a particular stage of textual production, which he classifies as the creation, publication, and adaptation stages. Versions at the creation stage, he argues, may include ideas expressed in journals and letters that reveal the evolution of the work’s concept, various forms of “scribbling” including notes and prewriting, as well as working drafts, circulating drafts, fair copies, and typescripts (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT,</span> 90–1). Versions at the publication level may include those “physical documents emerging from the first phases of print reproduction—copy-editing, galleys, and page proofs; magazine issues, first editions, and corrected copies of editions,” while those at the adaptation level may include translations, productions, films, and other forms of non-authorial adaptation made after the publication of a work (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT,</span> 92, 93).
      </p>
<p>
	According to these expansive theories, a future editor of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> would possess the authority to include as versions of the work “abstract conceptual concepts” expressed in her diaries and letters; various forms of “scribbling,” including her reading notes, preliminary forms of writing, and early drafts; and physically nonexistent versions that can be inferred from authorial corrections. Even the three volumes of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> scrapbooks would have authority as a version under the conceptual view of textuality, as their contents may be said to infer the overall development of the work. (One might even argue that each item contained in the scrapbooks ought to be regarded as a version under the terms established by Shillingsburg and Bryant.) Letters received in response to <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> that suggest an ongoing conversation between Woolf and her correspondent would be authorized by Bryant as belated evidence of Woolf’s “concept” of the work, and as readerly “remakings” of the work through the processes of reading and interpretation. An edition that is to incorporate each of Woolf’s innumerable references to the project in her diaries and letters over the course of a decade, each individual reading note collected in her twelve volumes related to the project, each item collected in her three volumes of scrapbooks, each distinctive holograph and typescript version of each of the several works thematically related to <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>, each published version of the work, each imprint of each published version of the work (as Briggs would have us include), and each cultural appropriation, adaptation, or “textual remaking” that occurs over the course of the text’s lifetime (as Bryant would have us include, thereby constantly expanding the size of the edition)—an edition that is to incorporate all of these documents seems impossible to accommodate in anything <span style="font-style:italic;">other</span> than an electronic edition. Accordingly, each model discussed below lends itself easily to implementation in a digital environment, as can be seen in John Bryant’s electronic fluid-text edition of Herman Melville’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Typee</span>, Julia Briggs’s electronic genetic edition of Virginia Woolf’s “Time Passes,” and Bruce Graver’s and Ron Tetreault’s electronic edition of William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Lyrical Ballads</span>, which allows for parallel text comparison.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>
	In what follows, I explore the viability of the parallel text edition, the genetic edition, and the fluid-text edition as possible models for a new post-eclectic edition of this work. Although my essay will focus on the application of these editorial models to a specific work, the ensuing discussion of theoretical issues and practical applications may be useful to scholars imagining future editions of other works for which extensive pre-publication materials exist.

</h1>
<p>
	It is widely recognized that a considerable degree of variation exists between British and American first editions of Woolf’s works. “Extensive and substantial” textual differences are particularly marked among her mid-career writings, although they can also be found in later works, including <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> (“BT,” 151). Brenda Silver and Julia Briggs attribute this textual phenomenon to Woolf’s practice of marking up British and American proofs separate from one another, which allowed her to “knowingly send out different versions, different texts” (“TC,” 196) and thereby to create “two distinct lines of textual transmission” (“BT,” 152).<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

	At least three distinct versions of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> appeared within Woolf’s lifetime: a significantly different, shorter version published as “Women Must Weep—Or Unite Against War” in the May and June 1938 issues of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Atlantic Monthly</span>; a British edition,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> published by the Hogarth Press on 2 June 1938; and an American edition, published by Harcourt Brace on 25 August 1938. The likelihood that a fourth version of the work appeared during Woolf’s lifetime has gone unmentioned in any account of the work’s publication history, and is likewise absent from B. J. Kirkpatrick’s bibliography. Nevertheless, a letter dated 24 September 1938 in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> letter file, transcribed and published by Anna Snaith, reveals that Woolf had agreed to allow extracts of the work to be published by the Married Women’s Association, a British organization that advocated for the economic and political interests of married women.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> The most recent edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> to include a list of textual variants, the Shakespeare Head edition, identifies 34 variations in wording between the British and American first editions and the existence of four passages that appear only in the endnotes to the American edition. Given that these results have been produced through computer collation, which has been shown to be demonstrably inaccurate in regard to Woolf’s other works, one must assume that this represents the <span style="font-style:italic;">minimum</span> number of textual differences that can be said to exist.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>
	A future editor of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> might wish to take on interversional variation as a focal point for a post-eclectic edition of the work. The edition that seems most appropriate for displaying variation among published versions of this work is the parallel text edition. Rather than tracing the genesis of the work through its various pre-publication documents (as in a genetic edition), or highlighting the significance of revision in the evolution of the work (as in a fluid-text edition), the parallel text edition would highlight and display difference through the use of a facing-page display. While the more localized, condensed forms of variation that one finds in the British and American first editions could be quite easily displayed using marginal notes or footnotes within a variorum edition, the more extensive, substantive differences between “Women Must Weep” and the first American edition would be better accommodated within the format of a parallel text edition.
      </p>
<p>
	This choice of texts and edition recommends itself on multiple counts. On a practical level, it would make immediately available to a new generation of readers a text that has not been reproduced since its initial appearance in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Atlantic Monthly</span>, done so in a format designed to display its differences from the versions with which they are already familiar. Given that parallel text editions can foreground historical and social theories of text production in trying to “plausibly explain the state of difference” between two texts, this choice of edition would generate questions of the ultimate importance to their study: whether the variation is understood to be a product of political, social, cultural, bibliographic, or personal pressures, or some combination thereof, a socialized view of these texts divests the author of sole authority over her work, and promulgates a view of textual authority as that which is located in a “social nexus.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p>
	The textual passages that I have chosen to represent in parallel text format [<a name="1a-text" href="#1a"><span style="font-style:italic;"> 1</span></a>] on the following pages reveal distinct differences from one another. Both passages begin with the speaker’s description of the re of the Dictator in the photograph at which both reader and speaker are presumably looking. From this moment of shared similarity, the passages diverge: in “Women Must Weep,” the photograph “imposes  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> itself” upon the letter, as if materializing from nothing, while in the first American (and British) editions, the speaker actively “lays” it before the reader: a textual change that ascribes to the speaker a greater degree of agency. As a result of this simple change, the speaker in “Women Must Weep” immediately moves on to an exposition of the differences that inhere in acts of looking, admitting that “many men of highest edition” hold favorable views of war and fascism. Recognizing the ultimate relativity of what constitutes good and evil, the speaker’s emphasis on alternative ways of viewing the world makes the predominant characteristic of the passage one of humility, and its predominant function the modeling of tolerant attitudes toward the “Other.” The passage, moreover, possesses a rhetorical function distinct from the other, as a way of justifying the existence of the Society of Outsiders. Given that “there is no judge; there is no certainty in heaven above or on earth below,” the speaker maintains that ethical determinations are to be made on an individual basis as a result of the processes of dispassionate reasoning, self-examination, and cultural awareness: presented as the outcome of such processes, the “rules” proposed by the Society of Outsiders are subject to instant validation.
      </p>
<p>
	If the previous passage is driven primarily by the speaker’s exposition of the differences in viewing the photograph, the second passage is driven primarily by an exposition of the speaker’s motives for presenting the photograph and contains several additional passages that dramatically alter the content, tone, and rhetorical function of the passage as a whole. By changing the circumstances in which the photograph makes its appearance in the text, Woolf gives her speaker the opportunity to finalize the connection between the “tyrannies and servilities” of the public and private spheres, as realized in the re of the Dictator. The speaker articulates as a second motive the desire to promote a greater self-awareness of the ways in which “we are ourselves that re,” thus destabilizing the Self/Other binary that is ultimately responsible for war. Moving beyond the “good” and “evil” dichotomy of the “Women Must Weep” passage, the photograph of the Dictator is invested with the ability to signify our connectedness as human beings:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  But the human re even in a photograph suggests other and more complex emotions. It suggests that we cannot dissociate ourselves from that re but are ourselves that re. It suggests that we are not passive spectators doomed to unresisting obedience but by our thoughts and actions can ourselves change that re. A common interest unites us; it is one world, one life.
	</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	This vision “of a unity that rubs out divisions as if they were chalk marks only,” of “the capacity of the human spirit to overflow boundaries and make unity out of multiplicity,” is without question Woolf’s most optimistic and poetic meditation on the possibility of peace, and her most extensive articulation of how such a state of peace might be achieved through the dismantling of the Self/Other binary.
      </p>
<p>
	Given that both passages appear near the end of their respective versions, it seems reasonable to assume that variation in each passage suggests some shifting intention on Woolf’s part as to how to end each text. The variations discussed thus far suggest that  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	by emphasizing interpersonal difference, Woolf may have wished only to validate the fruits of her own intellectual labour, the Society of Outsiders, as an example of the kind of efforts that must be exerted to determine one’s own ethical stance. Her emphasis on unity, and her active de-emphasis of difference in the second version of the above passage—in which the entire passage is reduced to the introductory clause, “Whatever the verdict of others may be upon the man in uniform—and opinions differ”—suggests that by the time she was writing this version, she perhaps felt less need to defend or justify the Society, and more need to provide some cause for optimism, some vision of unity in a world becoming increasingly characterized by disunity.

	The facing-page display of the parallel text edition allows the reader to reconstruct the possible direction of the textual revisions that he or she sees. Placing the two works alongside one another challenges a critical assumption held by many Woolf scholars: that is, that “Women Must Weep” is, in fact, an abridged version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas.</span><a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> Little is known about the composition of the shorter work, other than that Woolf was correcting the proofs for it at roughly the same time that she was correcting the proofs for both editions of the book. Were “Women Must Weep” an abridgement of the first edition, one would expect to find the same content in both versions, expressed in condensed form in “Women Must Weep.” Yet, strangely what one discovers in this instance is the reverse: a passage in the first American edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> that looks like a condensed version of one that appears in “Women Must Weep.” The multi-directional style of reading facilitated by the facing-page display suggests the distinct possibility that “Women Must Weep” may be an earlier rather than later abridged version of the British and American first editions. In addition to encouraging readers to engage in close textual reading to determine the extent of variation and to determine how linguistic variation is connected to matters of tone and voice, a parallel text edition of “Women Must Weep” would engage readers in considering how and why that work employs a rhetorical strategy different from the first American edition, and in determining how much, and why, the content varies as it does within both American versions. Users of this edition would be able to examine local variation as a means of determining more definitively the relation of these versioned parts to the textual whole.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Notes toward a Genetic Edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>
</h1>
<p>
	A genetic edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> recommends itself for its superior ability to display the work’s progress through its multiple pre-publication stages; by synthesizing inter- and intraversional variation in its textual display, a genetic edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> would allow readers to trace the evolution of specific passages through various sequences of composition and revision. A synoptic apparatus, similar to that adopted by Hans Gabler in his genetic edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, seems particularly well suited for displaying the numerous holograph and typescript fragments that have survived in relation to the work. By placing variant readings in close proximity to one another, a synoptic display of pre-publication documents would allow readers both to trace the sequential  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> development of a specific line or short passage, and thus to attend to the diachronous dimension of the work, and to reconstruct a particular level of the work, and thus to attend to its synchronous dimensions. Placing the synoptic text opposite a reading text based on the first American edition of the work would allow further comparison between pre-publication states and the work in its most expansive published state.
      </p>
<p>
	A synoptic display of pre-publication materials relating to <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> would need to limit itself to those documents bearing a distinct linguistic relationship to published versions of the work. While textual theory would allow us to admit as “versions” of the work <span style="font-style:italic;">avant-textes</span> with no direct linguistic correlation to the published version (including reading notes, excerpts of letters and diaries that reveal the conceptual nature of the work, scrapbooks, etc.), accommodating these materials within the constraints of the synoptic apparatus would be practically impossible. In a print edition, these paratextual materials could be included in an appendix constructed as a reading text in its own right, with its own set of textual notes referring the reader back to those places in the synoptic or reading text in which Woolf made use of the materials and notes that she had gathered. An editor’s notes would allow the reader to move easily from the reading or synoptic text to the appendix, and from the appendix to the reading or synoptic text, facilitating multi-directional reading and allowing the reader to trace the work’s genesis forward from its moments of inception, or backward from its moments of inscription.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<p>
	The synoptic text in this genetic edition would incorporate the approximately 291 pages of holograph and typescript fragments that are housed in the Berg Collection of the New York Public Library and in the Monks House Papers at the University of Sussex. There is some speculation, however, as to the existence of another manuscript apart from the fragments housed in these collections. The document at the center of this controversy is the manuscript of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> that Woolf reported having donated to the American Guild for German Cultural Freedom at the request of May Sarton in February 1939.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> The circumstances surrounding the document are as follows. In a letter dated 15 January 1939, May Sarton requested that Woolf donate a manuscript for an upcoming auction to benefit the American Guild for German Cultural Freedom, the American sister organization of the German Academy of Arts and Sciences in Exile.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> “In New York an association for taking care of refugees from Germany has been having auctions of mss.,” Sarton wrote. “Prince Lowenstein asked me to see if I could persuade Julian [Huxley], H. G. [Wells] and you to part with a written fragment of yourself for this purpose. It seems rather horrible, but also necessary as anything that <span style="font-style:italic;">can</span> be done <span style="font-style:italic;">must</span> be done for these people.”<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> Woolf responded in a letter dated 2 February 1939:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  I tear up my manuscripts when I have any; but in fact I make such wild sketches in hand writing alter so completely on the type writer that a manuscript of mine is mostly nonsense. And I don’t like to sell nonsense; nor do I think it would sell; for no sane person could make head or tail of it. Still, I promise that I will rout among my papers and see if there’s some page not too incoherent. If so I’ll do violence to my horror of this groping and send it to the address you give.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	A subsequent letter to Elizabeth Bowen makes clear that Woolf did, in fact, donate a document related to <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>, presumably a manuscript or a manuscript fragment, to the Guild: “I’ve a nice letter from someone called something Jones who bought 3 Guineas, I hope for a large sum. Will you thank her, if you see her.”<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Woolf’s comment suggests that she may have donated a manuscript document that was considerably larger than the “single page” that Sarton had requested, and to which Woolf had committed herself in the previous letter—for had she donated a single page, or even ten pages, of manuscript, it seems unlikely that Woolf would have made reference to someone having “<span style="font-style:italic;">bought Three Guineas</span>,” a comment that invokes the work in its entirety. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that the sale of a page, or even ten pages, would be capable of generating the “large sum” of which Woolf says she is hopeful.
      </p>
<p>
	A recently translated, first-hand account of the activities of the German Academy in Exile supplies some context for the auction of Woolf’s manuscript. The event, which took place on 19 February 1939 at New York’s Hotel Delmonico, was said by <span style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times</span> to have created “unprecedented interest” within the press itself. Included in the auction were manuscripts donated by Thomas Mann, Sigmund Freud, Albert Einstein, Bertold Brecht, Lewis Mumford, John Erskine, and Thomas Wolfe; musical scripts by Arnold Schonberg, Kurt Weill, and George Gershwin; and original scores by Franz Liszt, Richard Strauss, Richard Wagner, and Vincenzo Bellini, among others.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> Some fifty to sixty items were sold, totaling sales of $5000: these include $300 received for the manuscript of Mann’s essay, <span style="font-style:italic;">Dieser Friede (This Peace)</span>; $200 for Freud’s manuscript of <span style="font-style:italic;">Der Prometheus-Komplex</span>; and $100 for the manuscript of Einstein’s 1938 Commencement Speech at Swarthmore College. The highest amount, $1700, was received for Wolfe’s “bulky manuscript” of <span style="font-style:italic;">Look Homeward, Angel.</span> Based on the above res, which account for $2300 of the auction’s total earnings, we know that the sale of Woolf’s manuscript would have brought an amount far less than the remaining $2700, given that some forty-six to fifty-six other items were also sold, placing the average sale price of each item between $48 and $58. Although earnings from the auction were far below what had been anticipated, the auction itself was considered to be successful in that it helped raise awareness of the plight of the German community in exile.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>
	Despite Woolf’s explicit claim, no record of the sale or the donation exists among the archives of the German Academy in Exile and the American Guild for German Cultural Freedom.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Rather, a typed list in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Exilarchiv</span> indicates that Woolf had donated a copy of <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob’s Room</span>, designated “item 146” in the auction’s printed catalogue and which reads, “WOOLF, VIRGINIA: Jacob’s Room, Hogarth Press, 1922. Sm. 8vo, orig. cloth. Charles Whilbey’s subscription copy, with AUTHOR’S AUTOGRAPH INSCRIPTION, dated Oct. 1922.” It seems highly unlikely that this item would or could have been donated by Woolf herself, whose letter conveys her understanding of Sarton’s specific request for a page of manuscript for what she had specifically called an “auction of manuscripts.” Woolf’s concern that her item should earn the Guild “a large sum,” moreover, makes it all the more unlikely that she would have chosen to donate an autographed first edition, which would have brought a smaller, rather than a larger, sum than a manuscript. (Add to this her awareness that autographed first  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> editions of <span style="font-style:italic;">Flush</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Years</span>, which had attained recent, unprecedented success in the American market, would have been likely to fetch a larger sum than a first edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Jacob’s Room</span>.)
      </p>
<p>
	Even more compelling, and obvious, evidence lies in the item description itself: for how would Woolf have come to possess an autographed, subscription copy of a book belonging to one “Charles Whilbey”? Given the ease with which transpositions occur in typing, it seems plausible that the cataloguer transposed the letters “b” and “l” in recording the name “Whilbey” and that the copy may have belonged to renowned British biographer, essayist, literary reviewer, and columnist Charles Whibley, who was a friend of T. S. Eliot.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> While it is understandable that the archives should credit Woolf with this donation, it seems more likely that an autographed copy of a book belonging to Charles Whibley would have been donated by the latter’s estate rather than by Woolf herself. That the manuscript of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> should go unmentioned in the auction catalogue does not preclude the possibility that Woolf donated it, but suggests that it may have been received too late to be included in the catalogue.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>
	The Berg Collection is the main repository for the bulk of the holograph and typescript fragments relating to <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>, and University of Sussex the main repository for notes, reading notes, and scrapbooks relating to that work.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> A careful re-evaluation and collation of these documents is required in light of the confusing nomenclature (“fragments” and “notes”) used to describe these materials, and which in many instances obscures the nature of the documents themselves. The Monks House Papers, for example, include what appear to be holograph fragments of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> that have been mistakenly classified as reading notes: thus, MH/B16e, catalogued as “Notes on ‘the inflated brown bug’; notes on William Holtby; ‘Letters to a Friend’; and notes for <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> (?),” appears to contain three pages of holograph; MH/B16c, catalogued as “Notes about Women, War and other subjects,” appears to contain several pages of a holograph fragment interspersed among pages of Woolf’s notes; and MH/B16a, catalogued as “Reading notes for the above [<span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>],” appears to contain four pages of holograph interspersed among her reading notes.
      </p>
<p>
	A further editorial difficulty is posed by the Berg’s description in its finding aid of the largest chunk of holograph in M28 as “Fragment, with the author’s ms. corrections. Holograph, 90 p. Sept. 21 [n.y].” This description mistakenly implies the existence of a larger, continuously paginated document that is more accurately described as a series of fragments—“an assemblage of texts, a polytext of seriated texts and versions” comprised of passages that Woolf appears to have compulsively rewritten (<span style="font-style:italic;">TA,</span> 99). As a habitual reviser of her work, Woolf would reach a particular stage in the composition of a passage only to return immediately to its beginning, rewriting and correcting it as if realizing what she wanted to say only through these successive attempts to say it. Consider, for example, the sequence of manuscript revisions that exist for the passage in which Woolf’s speaker contemplates the potential effect of “250, or 50, or 25” people “pledged not to commit adultery of the brain.” In the American edition, the published version of the passage reads:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  Now suppose, Madam, that there were 250, or 50, or 25 such people in existence, people pledged not to commit adultery of the brain, so that it was unnecessary to strip what they said of its money motive, power motive, advertisement motive, publicity motive, vanity motive and so on, before we unwrapped the grain of truth, might not two very remarkable consequences follow? Is it not possible that if we knew the truth about war, the glory of war would be scotched and crushed where it lies curled up in the rotten cabbage leaves of our prostituted fact-purveyors; . . . if newspapers were written by people whose sole object in writing was to tell the truth about politics and the truth about art we should not believe in war, and we should believe in art.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	This passage underwent at least three successive rewritings in the first four pages of what appears to be a continuously paginated holograph fragment contained among the Berg’s collection of holograph fragments (M28). The revisions to this passage [<a name="2-text" href="#2"><span style="font-style:italic;"> 2</span></a>] show Woolf to have been working through questions of the utmost importance to her work during the very act of composition: namely, <span style="font-style:italic;">how many</span> people need bind themselves to this oath in order for its twin aims to be achieved? <span style="font-style:italic;">Who</span> may bind themselves to this oath?

</div>
<div class="reEnd"></div>
</div>
<p>
	In the first passage, Woolf modifies an earlier insistency by deleting the word “quite” from the phrase “quite certain,” but still manages to convey a sense of certainty through her use of the qualifiers “not” and “but even” (“not two hundred, but even one hundred or fifty”). In the second passage, she drastically and somewhat mysteriously (perhaps in a moment of optimism) reduces the number of people from 200, 100, or 50 to 50, 20, or 10. Equally mysterious are the subsequent revisions that gradually increase these numbers to an amount—250, 50, or 25—closer to that of the first passage: a move that may suggest her renewed confidence in the earlier idea, or a gradual fading of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the sudden flash of political optimism revealed in the second passage. The revisions above also importantly reveal the direction of her thinking about questions of political agency, gender, and audience. For while the <span style="font-style:italic;">who</span> of the political action is restricted to daughters of educated men in the first passage, it is expanded to include “either sex” in the second passage; all reference to gender is abandoned in favor of “people” in the third and fourth passages in what may be viewed as an attempt to broaden her working base. That the implied audience, too, should undergo a gender transformation in these revisions, morphing from a male audience to an audience of unspecified gender and, finally, to an audience that is distinctly female, suggests that while Woolf was moved to include men among those who might participate in the various peace culture-creating activities she describes, it is specifically women to whom the details of these activities must be directed.

	Woolf’s progressive revisions of a particular passage of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> at the early, intermediate, and late typescript stages can be seen in the facsimiles and transcriptions included as <a name="3a-text" href="#3a">res 3</a>, <a name="4a-text" href="#4a">4</a>, and <a name="5a-text" href="#5a">5</a>, all of which Woolf numbered identically as “page 45.” The passages included as <a name="3a-text" href="#3a">res 3</a> and <a name="4a-text" href="#4a">4</a> can be found within the “21 miscellaneous pages” that follow the longer, forty-nine page M28 typescript “fragment,” while <a name="5a-text" href="#5a">re 5</a> is part of the forty-nine page typescript “fragment” itself.

<p>
	The passage that appears as <a name="3a-text" href="#3a">re 3</a> (the first of the “21 miscellaneous pages”) can be identified as the earliest of these three typescript fragments based on several criteria: the existence of a long passage (beginning, “Now there would be no need to say this so emphatically and pictorially . . .”) not found in any of the other versions under consideration; the presence of the independent clauses “this is butter” and “this is the best butter,” both absent from the other versions; and the incompleteness of the phrase “ribbons colours &amp;c,” to which other words appear to have been added in subsequent versions. The passage that appears as <a name="4a-text" href="#4a">re 4</a> (the second of the “21 miscellaneous pages”) can be identified as an intermediate typescript fragment. This determination is based on several manuscript corrections that Woolf made at this stage, including the addition of “is comparatively,” “fulfills,” and “the advertisement function,” all of which are incorporated in the subsequent typescript version.

	is distinguishable from the later typescript version based on the presence of several words that are absent from the third version, notably “wear” and “the splendour.” The passage that appears as <a name="5a-text" href="#5a">re 5</a> (the seventh page of the M28 typescript fragment) clearly represents the textual state closest to that of the published version. This version adopts changes made to the preceding version, including the addition of the phrase “the advertisement function,” and includes other changes that are retained in the published version, including “simple” and “prime.” Changes made subsequent to the latest typescript stage are offset by braces in the synoptic reading text [<a name="6a-text" href="#6a"><span style="font-style:italic;"> 6</span></a>].
      </p>
<p>
	Each successive version is overlaid upon one another in the synoptic text in the left-hand column of <a name="6a-text" href="#6a">re 6</a>. The following guidelines will help the reader navigate the synoptic display, using it to reconstruct both the diachronous and synchronous dimensions surrounding this particular textual moment. As noted above, changes made subsequent to the typescript stage are enclosed in braces, thereby separating authorial changes (made in Woolf’s own hand) from those of a potentially more “questionable” authority (made, for example, by typists, copyeditors, or proofreaders). Readers interested exclusively in revisions traceable directly to Woolf can easily bypass this braced content. Similarly, words or phrases present at any stage of the typescript that were removed at a subsequent stage are enclosed in carets. Each version is assigned its own distinctive typeface indicating the stage at which a word or phrase first appears in the work: thus, <span style="font-style:italic;">simple</span> indicates that the word “simple” first entered the passage at the late typescript stage. The use of brackets and angle brackets in conjunction with a given typeface indicates the stage at which Woolf gave these instructions: thus, <span style="font-style:italic;">&lt;wear&gt;</span> indicates that Woolf’s instruction to add this word occurs at the intermediate typescript stage and [<span style="font-style:italic;">because</span>] indicates that Woolf’s instruction to delete this word occurs at the intermediate typescript stage. The use of carets in conjunction with a typeface indicates the last stage at which a word or phrase occurs: thus, ⁁<span style="font-style:italic;">the other sex</span>⁁ indicates that this phrase made its final appearance at the late typescript stage.
      </p>
<p>
	The advantage of such a display lies in its flexibility and its comparative usability. Once familiar with the typefaces and sigla, users can read the synoptic text for evidence of either textual variation or similitude. While variation is more prominently displayed through the juxtaposition of sequential variants, textual similitude can also be inferred from the use of distinctive typefaces, thereby allowing the reader to access the work’s diachronous and synchronous dimensions. Take the following line as an example:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  If you will excuse the humble ⁁comparison⁁ <span style="font-style:italic;">illustration</span>, your dress ⁁resembles⁁ ⁁&lt;has also the office of&gt;⁁ //<span style="font-style:italic;">fulfills</span>// <span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="font-style:italic;">the same ⁁purpose⁁</span></span> {function} <span style="font-style:italic;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">as</span></span> the tickets ⁁on⁁ in <span style="font-style:italic;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">a</span></span> grocers {grocer’s} ⁁shops⁁ <span style="font-style:italic;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">shop</span></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	The reader interested in tracing the genesis of this passage through its textual variants will see that “comparison,” present at the early typescript stage, is replaced with “illustration” at the second stage; “fulfills,” which Woolf identified in the intermediate stage as one of two possible replacements for the early typescript’s “resembles,” is only  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> adopted at the late typescript stage; and that “purpose,” added at the late typescript stage, was replaced with “function” at a subsequent stage, and may therefore be a nonauthorial revision. Knowing that variants are presented in a distinctive typeface that corresponds to the stage at which they entered the passage, and that any phrase or word absent from a subsequent version would be indicated by carets, the reader interested in reconstructing the synchronous dimension of a given level of the typescript would be capable of doing so. Thus, a reader attempting to reconstruct the later typescript stage would be able to infer that the passage had read “illustration” from the intermediate stage onward; that the proposed phrase, “has also the office of,” simultaneously appeared and disappeared at the intermediate stage in favor of the word “fulfills,” which is adopted at the late typescript phase; and that the word “purpose” appears for the last time in the late typescript stage. In this way, the reader would be able to correctly reconstruct the following sentence of the late typescript stage from the coding and typefaces used in the synoptic text alone: “<span style="font-style:italic;">If you will excuse the humble illustration, your dress fulfills the same purpose as the tickets in a grocers shop.</span>”
      </p>
<p>
	The early typescript passage ponders the psychology of the man in uniform and clearly repudiates an essentialist view of gender. Wondering why men go to the “expense and discomfort to assume uniforms that are always gaudy and often uncomfortable,” she concludes that the resulting admiration of women is a “bribe by which you [recompense] &lt;reward&gt; yourselves for doing what is distasteful to you.” The removal of this passage from the intermediate typescript moves the speaker away from imaginative sympathy for men and softens her indictment of women in this spot, while its replacement with an analysis of the “advertisement function” of men’s dress distances the speaker from the object of her view. More than a loose assortment of variants, this sequence of revisions achieves a distinct rhetorical effect, thus suggesting an altered, or shifting, intention on Woolf’s part. A marginal note made at the late typescript stage further complicates the matter of how one might interpret this sequence of revisions: for there she has hastily scribbled the line, “Why, if you possess a quality, do you wish to advertise the fact”—a comment that suggests a persistent, or perhaps simply an intermittent, desire to reintroduce the subject of men’s psychology that had been removed at the intermediate typescript stage.
      </p>
<p>
	An apparent limitation of the synoptic reading text is its relative inaccessibility and the demand that it places on the reader to perform intraversional comparison. The relentlessly democratic nature of this kind of display, moreover, equalizes all variants and refuses to distinguish their relative significance to the work at hand. With no room for editorial commentary, and no additional space in which to contemplate the effects or significance of a particular sequence of revisions, the sample synoptic text under consideration cannot bring to the reader’s attention the shift in content, tone, and intention that is the result of revisions made between the early and intermediate typescript stages.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">Notes toward a Fluid-Text Edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span>
</h1>
<p>
	A viable alternative to the genetic edition is John Bryant’s fluid-text edition, which is predicated on a postmodernist view of fluidity as “an inherent condition of any written document and in writing itself,” a condition that aligns it with textual instability and indeterminacy (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT,</span> 1, 6). Rather than rely on readers to perform interversional comparison and analysis, the editor of the fluid-text edition highlights selected revision sequences and effectively “narrates” them for the reader, assuming a more active role, and voice, in the text and creating a paratext with a potentially powerful ideological function. As Bryant writes, it is the task of the fluid-text editor to “expose readers to the <span style="font-style:italic;">distances between</span> multiple versions,” to “map out the variation, chart paths from one version to another, and enable users to lead themselves along those paths” (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT,</span> 123). This edition showcases the fluid condition of the work by mapping selected “revision sites” onto a base version of the work, which are then accompanied by a “revision sequence” and “revision narrative” that supplies a possible explanation for the particular revision made at that site (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT,</span> 151).
      </p>
<p>
	re Seven depicts an image of what a fluid-text edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> might look like. In this passage, the speaker responds to her correspondent’s request that she join his society for the prevention of war. The fluid-text edition would allow the editor to call the reader’s attention to linguistic, rhetorical, and thematic variation between the passage as it appears in the first American edition of the work and in an earlier holograph fragment, through the use of carefully delineated revision sequences. While the earlier line emphasizes the benefits bestowed on the sons of educated men, the later one emphasizes the lack of benefits bestowed on their sisters. A transcription of the holograph passages allows the reader to observe variation in the rhetorical context of the line: where the earlier line exists as evidence of men’s investment in patriotism and nationalism, the later one exists as a rationale for women’s investment in pacifism. The revision narrative at the bottom explains the rhetorical and thematic significance of these textual variations. While the earlier passage explains the outsider’s position, the later one shows the reader how to explain her position, a difference that may indicate Woolf’s shifting intention to teach her readers rather than preach to them.
      </p>
<p>
	Revision narratives presuppose a certain degree of authorial intention, regarding each revision as “material evidence of <span style="font-style:italic;">shifting</span> intentions” (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT,</span> 9). While Bryant’s call for a modified recuperation of the notion of authorial intention may seem to reside uneasily with the aims of an otherwise post-eclectic edition, his use of the term is thoroughly inflected by postmodernist notions of simultaneity and multiplicity, and reflects the realization that “even a given author at a given moment often displays not a monolithic singularity of purpose or desire, but rather a multiplicity of them embodied in a multiplicity of intentions.”<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> It is this “multiplicity of intentions” that can be discovered within the single variant, as Bryant explains:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	  A cancellation or insertion in manuscript is the visible sign of altered intentions. When we observe a revision, we “see” the vestige of a writer’s changings, and in this way the writer’s absence takes on more presence, or more precisely, we begin to perceive layerings  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of absence. A revision has a beginning, middle, and end, and its end does not negate the beginning or middle. A revision occupies space and reflects the passage of time; it reveals options and choices; it has direction. It is a chord of dissonances and harmonies, and not a single note. A writer’s revision presents us with multiple texts vying for position on the page.
	</p>
<div class="attrib">
	  (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT,</span> 12–13)
	</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  Rather than a unified <span style="font-style:italic;">objet d’art</span>, constructed in a linear fashion from a set of unified intentions, Bryant’s work of art is conceived as the product of tensions, contradictions, confusions, and simultaneities. Wresting the concept of “authorial intention” from its roots in textual eclecticism, Bryant retools it to advance a fundamentally postmodernist view of the literary text and textuality.
	</p>
<p>
	  Bryant extends the boundaries established by other textual theorists in ways that further render his fluid-text edition suitable for a post-eclectic edition of Woolf’s work. For example, he extends McGann’s socialized view of textuality to pre-publication states, arguing that revision should be viewed as a fundamentally “social act” impacted by forces external to the self (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT</span>, 58–9). Because writers “cannot avoid internalizing the problem of their socialized conditions,” he argues, “the ‘first’ communicative exchange in writing occurs not at the moment of editorial production, but at the writing desk, and in the writer’s mind” in “individualized moments of social ‘eventuality’” (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT</span>, 54). This theoretical extension to include pre-publication states is particularly appealing for an edition of Woolf in that it would enable an editor to consider the influence of social factors—the existence of “social negotiations occurring in the creative process that are materially evident in ms revisions” (<span style="font-style:italic;">FT</span>, 53)—on the direction of her revisions, particularly those revisions that diminish the political or polemical content of a given passage, and that may shed further light on the question of self-censorship within her revision practices.
	</p>
<p>
	  The fluid-text edition also usefully extends the material boundaries imposed by a genetic view of the work to include nonauthorial revisions and post-publication adaptations and cultural revisions. In a position that resonates with McGann’s notion that a work “incorporates, however invisibly, all of its accumulated history” and Grigely’s postmodernist notion of “textualterity,” which maintains that “the uniqueness of the unique art object or literary text is constantly undergoing continuous and discontinuous transience as it ages, is altered by editors and conservators, and is resituated or reterritorialized in different publications and exhibition spaces,” Bryant argues that the “cultural revision” of a work over its lifetime produces additional versions of that work (<span style="font-style:italic;">TA</span>, 1; <span style="font-style:italic;">FT</span>, 108).<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> His conception of the fluid-text edition includes an electronic component capable of accommodating a work’s post-publication adaptations.
	</p>
<p>
	  The fluid-text edition looks especially promising as a model for a future post-eclectic edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> in its ability to accommodate and narrate both the extensive pre-publication and post-publication documents that are known to be in existence. The recovery of the former is essential to our deeper understanding of Woolf’s practices of political self-censorship, and of her role as a public intellectual participating in pacifist and anti-fascist debates in 1930s Britain.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> Attention to the post-publication versions  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	    Textual editing was one of the new directions identified by Doug Mao at the MSA-sponsored panel, “New Directions in Modernist Studies,” held at the 2008 meeting in San Francisco. The theme of the 2008 Conference on Virginia Woolf was “Woolf Editing/Editing Woolf.”

	      Snaith, <span style="font-style:italic;">Virginia Woolf: Public and Private Negotiations</span> (London: Macmillan, 2000), 128. Elsewhere, she argues that “the discussion and correspondence which <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> instigated”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> should be considered part of the “extended text,” in addition to the twelve reading notebooks and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Years.</span> “Wide Circles: The <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> Letters,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Woolf Studies Annual</span> 6 : 5. Brenda Silver laid the groundwork for this argument as early as 1983 when she argued that the letters constituted a continuation of Woolf’s ongoing dialogue with her culture on the subjects of war, patriarchy, and fascism—a dialogue that she sees continuing through to Woolf’s 1940 essay, “Thoughts on Peace in an Air Raid.” “<span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> Before and After,” 255, 266, 270.

	    It seems probable that the letter was actually written by <span style="font-style:italic;">Juan</span>ita Frances, who founded the Association and served on its Executive Committee, rather than by “Granita” Frances, as Snaith’s transcription reads. As Snaith notes, enclosed with this letter was a receipt for three pounds and sixpence, the amount contributed by Woolf toward publication expenses. Juanita Frances’s comment that “the publishers have the text &amp; I have instructed them to go through it again carefully” implies expressed concern on Woolf’s part that the extracts may have required some additional correction or emendation, as well as the likelihood that proofreading or correction of the text was underway at this time. Neither the records of the Married Women’s Association at The Women’s Library, nor the <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Guineas</span> letters file in the Monks House Papers, appear to contain further information as to where or when the extracts were published, or by whom. Further research into the possible existence of this version is clearly warranted.

	    One might further disrupt the hierarchical relation of text and apparatus by laying those parts end to end, rather than end to front, and by flipping the direction of the book itself between the two parts. In this way, a reader might physically approach the edition from either direction. In an electronic genetic edition, hypertext would obviate the need for such measures.

	      Of the Academy in Exile, Volkmar Zuhlsdorff writes,
	     	
		<p class="display"><blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		    The Academy in Exile and its aid organizations—the American Guild and its British “offshoot,” the Arden Society for Artists and Writers Exiled in England—together created a network spanning every continent. The strings of that network came together at the headquarters shared by the Academy and the Guild at 20 Vesey Street in New York. It was there that the extensive programme of assistance and aid, involving scholarships and prize competitions, advice and mediation, approaches to authorities and all sorts of other support, was coordinated, with the aim of relieving the creative and material troubles of numerous exiled intellectuals. It was there too that funds were made available for further rescue operations and for recent arrivals embarking on a new life in America.

	    From the date of her response to Sarton, we know that Woolf could have sent the manuscript only <span style="font-style:italic;">after</span> 2 February 1939; and given that she anticipated having to “rout among my papers” to find something suitable, it seems likely that several days may have elapsed before she actually put it in the mail. To this should be added the time it would have taken for a parcel to make the trip from Rodmell, Sussex to New York. Woolf, “To May Sarton,” 314.

	      Notoriously linked and frequently besmirched as racist or exploitative of black cultural stereotypes, Carl Van Vechten’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span>  and Claude McKay’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span>  juxtapose Harlem’s emergent black middle class, seeking education and cultural refinement, with the decadence and debauchery of cabarets, speakeasies, gambling, pimping, interracial sexuality, homosexuality, and myriad intoxications. Dismissing these representations of Harlem’s sordid underbelly as mere sensationalism, reckless bookselling fodder, or even racial betrayal, as a range of notable critics once did, at once obfuscates black and African-American socio-economic hierarchies and elides the complex cultural exchanges made possible by Harlem’s thriving Prohibition-era culture.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Through meticulous descriptions of cabarets, speakeasies, and urban pleasure-seekers, Van Vechten and McKay illuminate a nascent subculture of jazz and intoxication that is not antithetical, but integral, to the history of Harlem’s New Negro community. Hedonistic or not, the sites and activities associated with Harlem’s nightlife enabled substantial and dynamic cultural exchanges that far exceed primitivist fantasies and trendy exoticism.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	      Even if <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span> “were not designed to elucidate a complex human existence,” as Houston A. Baker, Jr. once proclaimed, they nonetheless record how what I call the jazz-addict subculture interlocked with the broader, socioeconomic issues impacting the New Negro community.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> In fact, Baker’s own “blues matrix” and “blues geographies” are especially useful concepts that help elucidate the political and aesthetic forces at play in and around the jazz-addict subculture.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Baker writes that, “The matrix is a point of ceaseless input and output, a web of intersecting, crisscrossing impulses always in productive transit.”<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> This blues matrix designates the intricate wellspring of African-American cultural potentiality. In both novels, such potentiality flourishes in a multiplicity of inputs, outputs, intersections, and impulses that trigger and sustain the jazz-addict subculture.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>
	      This essay begins by considering how the underground blues geography of Harlem’s cabarets and speakeasies gave rise to the jazz-addict subculture and how this subculture situated itself spatially and ideologically in relation to the political terrain of Harlem’s New Negro community. The essay then engages with two pivotal aesthetic features of the novels and the subculture they depict. First considered is the authors’ use of a Signifyin(g) black vernacular, to use Henry Louis Gates’s term, which amplifies the coalescing sounds of jazz and drug vocabularies. Van Vechten and McKay show how a jazz-addict vernacular becomes a mark of distinction that separates the subculture from its New Negro neighbors, and how its linguistic structure mirrors the subculture’s investment in dynamic, flexible, and improvisatory cultural exchange. The essay concludes by discussing how Van Vechten and McKay produce Harlem Renaissance adaptations of the Orientalist fantasies modeled by Thomas De Quincey, Samuel Coleridge, and Charles Baudelaire in attempts to describe drug-induced hallucinations and the general saturnalia of the jazz-addict subculture. By supplementing the black vernacular descriptions of spaces, people, and sounds with the imagery and textures of the romanticist experience of being on drugs, Van Vechten and McKay effectively locate an Afro-Orientalist imagination thriving within Harlem—an imagination that is not merely indulgent exoticism, but an active political part of the Harlem Renaissance.

<p>
		It is perhaps W. E. B. Du Bois who best pinpointed a key conflict of cultural and and geographical values that ostensibly exacerbated the rift between the jazz-addict subculture and certain members of the New Negro community. Du Bois’s vision of Harlem tied the success of social advancement to the neighborhood’s physical and cultural growth. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Black Empire</span>, Michelle Stephens explains how Du Bois stressed the importance of “a rootedness in Harlem [that underscored] a belief in the steady advance of black life in America through class mobility, racial integration, and national citizenship.” Pursuant to this vision, Du Bois wanted representations of Harlem to highlight the most validating aspects of the community. McKay, who, according to Stephens, was inspired by a similar vision of Harlem, chose instead to “[portray] those marginal res in Harlem who had no access to Du Bois’s narrative of upward  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> mobility—the unemployed, the drifters, the criminal.”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Hence the famous bath that Du Bois felt he needed after reading <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span>. Du Bois had a similar reaction to <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> and bluntly wrote in <span style="font-style:italic;">Crisis</span> that, “Harlem is no such place as that.”<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Aside from decrying Van Vechten’s portrayal of Harlem, Du Bois’s comment reflected that the dispute in defining Harlem as a place had as much to do with its territorial distinction from the rest of New York City and white culture, as it had to do with the internal, territorial politics of the New Negro community. As Hazel Carby contends, “The twenties must be viewed as a period of ideological, political, and cultural contestation between an emergent black bourgeoisie and an emerging urban black working class.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Throughout <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span>, Van Vechten and McKay demonstrate how such socio-economic contests map on to the spatial quarrels that Du Bois repeatedly discussed. Accordingly, this section examines how the jazz-addict subculture launched its political and cultural expression spatially and how this subculture thereby factored into the feverishly debated organization of labor, leisure, and class within the Harlem community.

<p>
		In his now classic study, <span style="font-style:italic;">Subculture: The Meaning of Style</span>, Dick Hebdige connects the emergence of a subculture directly to its situated space in the community. He explains that, “the experience encoded in subcultures is shaped in a variety of locales (work, home, school, etc.). Each of these locales imposes its own unique structure, its own rules and meanings, its own hierarchy of values.”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> For the jazz-addict subculture, cabarets and speakeasies housed a distinct set of “subversive” and “subterranean” values (<span style="font-style:italic;">S</span>, 3, 76). These subcultural locales manifested veritable flea markets of transgressive and taboo wares and, as Lewis A. Erenberg writes, “provided settings for the fantasies money might buy.”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> In historian Ronald L. Morris’s words, “Clubs remained open all hours, accommodating every trade, taste, and temptation. Whatever his or her work schedule, the customer was at least assured of finding some convivial little cellar haunt . . . in which to escape and unwind . . . . In the case of the wealthy . . . illicit pleasures were unlimited.”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Instead of making an illicit buy and then slinking home, one stayed in the cabaret or speakeasy in order to purchase, interact with, and ingest the market. As a result, these subcultural locales were a spawning ground for style: “The challenge to hegemony which subcultures represent is . . . expressed obliquely, in style” (<span style="font-style:italic;">S</span>, 17).
	      </p>
<p>
		In the cabaret and the speakeasy, style meant jazz and blues, dancing the Charleston and the Black Bottom, widespread intoxication, uninhibited social and sexual combinations, and the efflorescence of a distinct jazz-addict vernacular. It is <span style="font-style:italic;">this</span> Harlem for which Jake yearns at the beginning of <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span>, and it is of this style that the controversial prologue to <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> offers an acute study. Jake, whose First World War service kept him abroad, believes the women of Harlem “were calling him.” He fantasizes about “‘Them tantalizing brown legs! . . . Barron’s Cabaret! . . . Leroy’s Cabaret! . . . Oh, boy!’”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> On his return, Jake reimmerses himself into the spaces, the noises, the tastes, and the language of Harlem and its subcultural locales: “Oh, to be in Harlem again after two years away. The deep-dyed color, the thickness, the closeness of it. The noises of Harlem. The sugared laughter. The honey-talk on its streets. And all night long, ragtime and ‘blues’ playing somewhere, . . . singing somewhere, dancing  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> somewhere! Oh, the contagious fever of Harlem . . . . Burning now in Jake’s sweet blood . . . .” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 15). As Michael Maiwald suggests, Jake identifies with a world that conforms neither to the rules of white culture nor the business-professional model of New Negro racial uplift. Instead, he embraces a “moral code that rejects exploitation as a means of livelihood and the economic as the central mode of human existence: Jake finds his values outside of surplus value.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Hence, Jake opts for the style embedded in the “contagious fever,” the syncopated rhythms, the street vernacular, the subterranean excitement of cabarets and speakeasies.
	      </p>
<p>
		By comparison, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> begins with the gigolo-like character Anatole Longfellow, also known as the Scarlet Creeper, swaggering along the Harlem streets toward the Black Venus cabaret.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> As he does throughout the novel, Van Vechten treats his eccentric character to a full blazon, detailing his “tight-fitting suit of shepherd’s plaid,” “a great diamond, or some less valuable stone which aped a diamond, [that] glistened in his fuchsia cravat,” and an “ebony cane, tipped with a ball of ivory” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 3–5). The Scarlet Creeper picks up Ruby Silver, a girl in a crowd of “pleasure seekers,” and takes her out for a night of jazz, dancing, and “tea for two” (code for gin with ginger ale). Inside, the Black Venus vibrates with “intoxicating rhythm”: “On all sides of the swaying couple, bodies in picturesque costumes rocked, black bodies, brown bodies, high yellows, a kaleidoscope of colour transred by the amber searchlight . . . . The band snored and snorted and whistled and laughed like a hyena” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 13–14). These ebullient partiers, animalistic noises, hot jazz, sexual intimacy, drinking, and drug-use return throughout the novel, each time exhibiting what Kevin J. Mumford calls “the human geography of the interzones.”<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>
		In <span style="font-style:italic;">Interzones</span>, his study of Chicago and New York sex districts in the early twentieth century, Mumford examines the production of subjectivity within urban vice districts. These interzones, which include Harlem cabarets and speakeasies, are both “spatial and ideological [by] definition,” are “simultaneously marginal and central,” and “should be understood as the foremost areas of cultural, sexual, and social interchange” (<span style="font-style:italic;">I</span>, 20). Elsewhere, Barry Milligan uses the phrase “bilateral cultural exchange” to describe a similar phenomenon taking place in the nineteenth-century opium dens of London’s East End. Milligan refers to these opium dens as “miniature Orients within the heart of the British Empire” and describes them as spaces where institutions give way to instability, and class, racial, and legal boundaries falter.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Milligan suggests that addiction subcultures are at once produced by a specialized space of transgressive behavior, like interzones, and also produce new multiracial and cultural exchanges that exceed—in fact, refuse—the hegemonic social boundaries of the dominant culture. Like opium dens, Harlem cabarets and speakeasies indulged their patrons’ allegiance to an array of transgressive options. And despite being somewhat artificial environments, these interzones fostered an authentic subcultural style. Given its multitude of interacting lifestyles, the underground cosmopolitanism of the jazz-addict subculture manifested an alternative world of choice far more egalitarian than the marketplace of ideas and commodities advertised by white capitalism or more conservative versions of New Negro identity.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
		To the culturally and economically elite segment of the New Negro community, which David Levering Lewis describes, <span style="font-style:italic;">à la</span> Du Bois, as the Talented Tenth, these underground activities and attitudes stood at odds with the rise of the New Negro and threatened the community’s legitimacy by pandering to white slumming and primitivist fantasies.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> To Du Bois, Harlem’s cabarets and speakeasies were no better than “a nasty, sordid corner into which black folks [were] herded, and yet a place which they in crass ignorance [were] fools enough to enjoy.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Unlike Du Bois, who voiced the Talented Tenth’s antimony for these interzones, Hebdige emphasizes that one should understand “the idea of [subcultural] style as a coded response to changes affecting the entire community” (<span style="font-style:italic;">S</span>, 80). In a comparable analysis of British mod culture, Hebdige suggests that, “The mods were negotiating changes and contradictions which were simultaneously affecting the parent culture but they were doing so in the terms of their own relatively autonomous problematic—by inventing an ‘elsewhere’ (the week-end, the West End) which was defined <span style="font-style:italic;">against</span> the familiar locales” (<span style="font-style:italic;">S</span>, 79). No doubt, the “elsewhere” of the jazz-addict subculture issued explicit challenges to the New Negro model endorsed by Du Bois’s Progressive-minded Talented Tenth. But as Van Vechten’s and McKay’s novels indicate, the jazz-addict subculture also levied sophisticated responses to issues that occupied the rest of the New Negro community, including white hegemony, Jim Crow politics, American capitalism, and the general rise of modernity.
	      </p>
<p>
		In addition to examining the impact of white slumming on Harlem’s geographic relationship to the white world, Van Vechten and McKay illuminate moments when the jazz-addict subculture and the rest of the New Negro community combine to demarcate and push Harlem’s boundaries into the white world. One scene in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> shows a complex intermingling of the working world and the jazz-addict subculture. At seven in the morning, on his way to a new job, Byron Kasson joins a mass of Harlemites heading to white neighborhoods to work as messenger boys and servant-girls. Byron admires the independence and patent happiness they find living in Harlem: “they refused to ‘live in.’ The white world might do its best to rob their days of pleasure, but they could always look forward to the evening” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 188). As he joins this “procession of an oppressed people” to “labour in an alien world,” he passes a cabaret emptying of its working-class partiers (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 187). The partiers join the procession: “They had had no sleep. After a night devoted to gaiety they were returning to take their places as pawns in this strange game of toil that the white world insisted upon playing” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 188). In this moment when labor and leisure converge, the refusal to “live in” as servants in the home of white employers takes on additional significance. By <span style="font-style:italic;">going out</span> to the cabaret all night, the partiers also refuse to “live in”; they do not worry about replenishing their labor-power, instead pursuing entertainment and cultural activity that disobeys approved standards of behavior. Byron, who struggles throughout the novel to become a cultural and professional elite, cannot reconcile his staunch individualism with this confluence of different Harlemites. He resignedly observes that as these two segments of Harlem’s working class press into a train together, they coalesce into a unified, undifferentiated mass, as the white world mistakenly views them.
	      </p>
<p>
		In McKay’s novel, during a move from one cabaret to the next, Jake and Felice stroll down the “Block Beautiful,” a white block struggling to hold its ground against  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Harlem’s expanding boundaries. While its white inhabitants sleep, the Block Beautiful offers a romantic promenade for Harlem’s late-night pleasure-seekers. In a meeting of architecture and allegory, an iconic Presbyterian church monumentalizes the block’s “ancient sepulchral Respectability”; it gives the block’s white denizens “moral courage” and yet it “frowned on the corner like a fortress against the invasion” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 300). Against this austere white traditionalism, Jake and Felice represent the approach of both the excesses of the jazz-addict subculture and a New Negro middle class with the financial wherewithal to settle on the most notable streets. While Van Vechten observes a daily movement of African-American laborers heading into white neighborhoods, McKay considers also the more permanent influx of New Negroes into white urban space and the resulting white flight: “That was the limit: the desecrating of that atmosphere by black love in the very shadow of the gray, gaunt Protestant church. The Ancient Respectability was getting ready to flee . . . .” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 301).
	      </p>
<p>
		Within the Harlem limits, the politics of identity and territory are even more complex. While Van Vechten and McKay show how the Scarlet Creeper and Jake find room for stylistic self-definition within the interzones, they also consider how the emerging African-American middle class and the Talented Tenth continually negotiate individual and class identities in relation to the jazz-addict subculture. On one level, characters like Mary, Byron, and Ray, each frustrated in their own way with New Negro life, experiment with the jazz-addict subculture as they search for temporary reprieve from the trials of class-climbing amid institutional racism. On a whole other level, the characters who establish their own socio-economic identities by aggressively disparaging or mocking the jazz-addict subculture tend to adopt extraordinarily conflicted, even hypocritical, positions. Indeed, both novels present jazz, cabarets, and interracial affairs as the lurid, gossipy conversation of drunken upper-class and aspiring middle-class characters that strive to differentiate their own decadent habits from the stereotypes of Harlem’s seedy underworld.
	      </p>
<p>
		In <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span>, Adora Boniface, whom Van Vechten modeled after A’Lelia Walker, is a former music hall star and the wealthy widow of a Harlem real-estate tycoon.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> When living in the city, she spends her time amid the lavish decorations, antique furniture, and potpourri of museum pieces in her home on “Strivers’ Row,” the ritzy stretch of Harlem’s 139th Street populated by wealthy prizeters, bandleaders, and professionals. The weekend-long “orgies” at her Long Island estate provide an alternative space for intoxication, jazz, and dancing the Charleston. These extravagant parties for her upper- and middle-class cohorts come complete with notable jazz bands imported from the city and an endless supply of booze: “Gin, indeed, flowed as freely as if there had been a natural spring of it, while whisky, Scotch, rye, and Bourbon, was almost equally plentiful” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 22). Adora even invites Randolph Pettijohn (the Bolito King), a Harlem cabaret owner who runs an illegal lottery. Despite Pettijohn’s attendance and the resemblance between Adora’s crowd and cabaret patrons, this world is always set apart from Harlem’s underground nightlife. Adora disparages the naïveté of workingclass African-Americans and tells Mary Love that success for African-American women means marrying rich.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
		Similarly, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span>, McKay’s Gin-head Susy demonstrates how having access to intoxicants without having to patronize nightclubs widens the gulf between the jazz-addict subculture and its opponents. In her Brooklyn apartment, Gin-head Susy frequently hosts private parties with gin, whisky, and beer, and like Adora, she leverages her money and her ability to furnish booze against the appeal of Harlem. She prohibits her boyfriend Zeddy, who is “living sweet” off her money, from going to Harlem for entertainment. Attacking Harlem nightlife, she says, “What makes you niggers love Harlem so much? Because it’s a blood ungodly place where niggers nevah go to bed. All night running around speakeasies and cabarets, where bad, hell-bent nigger women am giving themselves open to sin” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 79). During an impromptu visit to Harlem, she later declares, “This here Harlem is a stinking sink of iniquity. Nigger hell!” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 99). Playing on the same slang term that Van Vechten took for his novel’s title, Gin-head Susy coopts and reconres the structural rules of racial segregation to exclude herself from the jazz-addict subculture of Harlem.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>
		While Adora and Gin-head Susy both arrange private debauches for their friends, they remain adamant about their elite status and their distance from the jazz-addict subculture. No matter how drunken and orgiastic their parties become, Adora and Gin-head Susy remove the music and intoxication from the subcultural locale; their parties remain separate from the jazz-addict subculture because they maintain a secure perimeter. They are not interzones, and therefore they lack the distinct combination of space, style, and bilateral cultural exchange that sustain the subculture.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Pink-chasers, Happy Dust, and the Jazz-Addict Glossary</h1>
<p>
		Perhaps no better evidence reveals the importance of the interzones and bilateral cultural exchange to the jazz-addict subculture than its language. Take, for instance, a scene important to both the queer and linguistic politics of <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span>. Ray, the well-educated and friendly Haitian railcar waiter, teaches Jake about the history of Sappho.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Returning the instructional favor, Jake tells Ray that in Harlem they call lesbians and gays “bulldykers” and “faggoty men” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 129). The scene not only verbalizes how different forms of cultural capital separate Jake and Ray, but it also goes on to demonstrate how the material space of the Harlem underground spawns vernacular exchange. After reading from Ray’s copy of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sapho</span> by Alphonse Daudet, Jake exclaims “Bumbole!” and remarks that the speech in the novel fails to represent the spoken language he knows (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 129). McKay reveals that, “‘Bumbole’ was now a popular expletive for Jake, replacing such expressions as ‘Bull,’ ‘bawls,’ ‘walnuts,’ and ‘blimey.’ Ever since the night at the Congo when he heard the ting West Indian girl cry, ‘I’ll slap you bumbole,’ he had always used the word. When his friends asked him what it meant, he grinned and said, ‘Ask the monks’” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 130). Jake receives the West Indians’ term “bumbole” through a bilateral cultural exchange within the jazz-addict subculture and experiences an Afro-Caribbean encounter that differs markedly from the postcolonial narrative of Haiti that Ray later imparts. In keeping with his critique of Ray’s book, Jake’s use of “bumbole” suggests a privileging of speech and its historical immediacy  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> over the stagnant written word. Jake embraces the jazz-like improvisational quality of this subcultural speech; indeed, part of the appeal of “bumbole” is its slippery trickster quality. “Bumbole” expresses meaning and yet eludes traditional definition. Even if Jake cannot precisely define it, he can still inhabit its stylistic value, its diasporic space, and its queer undertones. As this linguistically-rich scene suggests, the jazz-addict vernacular expressed style and perpetually evolved alongside the myriad of cultural intersections occurring in cabarets and speakeasies. In using this vernacular, Van Vechten and McKay indicate that the jazz and drug subcultures were more than cohabitants of the same “elsewhere”; rather, they fused together into a cohesive subculture.
	      </p>
<p>
		Between 1928 and 1938, the linguistics journal <span style="font-style:italic;">American Speech</span> published a series of articles that studied and attempted to decipher the language patterns used by jazz and drug subcultures. Articles including “The Language of Drug Addicts,” “Volstead English,” “Jazz Jargon,” and “The Argot of the Underworld Narcotic Addict” discussed how these subcultures deployed idiosyncratic slang, lingo, and subterranean vocabularies and observed how the subcultures’ vernacular connected to behavioral customs, social mores, and political attitudes.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Collectively, these articles assembled an enormous list of words, phrases, and definitions, creating a dictionary of the jazz-addict subculture.
	      </p>
<p>
		The vernacular stylings of Van Vechten and McKay made the pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">American Speech</span> in Nathan Van Patten’s 1931 article, “The Vocabulary of the American Negro as Set Forth in Contemporary Literature.” Along with Eric Walrond’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Tropic Death</span>  and R. Emmet Kennedy’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Gritny People</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span> were the basis of Van Patten’s study of black linguistic expression. In the article, Van Patten sets the novels against “hundreds of novels and countless short stories . . . written by authors with no first-hand knowledge of how a Negro speaks and without either a desire to present a correct record or any realization of why such a presentation is desirable.”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> For Van Patten, the novels deliver authentic representations of speech that stand in stark contrast to a legacy of racial misrepresentation stretching from minstrel shows to “Amos an’ Andy.”<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> He places special emphasis on the fact that even though Van Vechten and McKay were not African-American, living in and around Harlem supplied them with ample and authentic cross-cultural experiences.
	      </p>
<p>
		Like the other <span style="font-style:italic;">American Speech</span> articles, Van Patten’s compiles a glossary of terms and phrases, but it also addresses the innovative character embedded in this language. Emphasizing complexity, intricacy, and variation, Van Patten outlines eight etymological categories under which the listed words fall, including mispronounced English words, words of French, Spanish, or African origin, hybrid creations, and obsolete English words surviving through black vernacular. While Van Patten says little about the novels’ content, he illumines key historical and cultural topics by selecting, codifying, and then translating the vernacular words into standard English. For example, in addition to using terms like “high yaller,” “ofay,” “blue,” “buckra,” “pink,” “punkin seed,” and “potato-yellow” to describe the complex register of people’s skin tones, both Van Vechten and McKay show how this vernacular describes a range of identity categories, social activities, and commodities central to the jazz-addict subculture. “Pink-chasers”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and “jig-chasers” signify interracial social and sexual lifestyles, in that pink-chasers name African-Americans seeking white company, and jig-chasers name the opposite circumstance. A pimp can be called a “P-I” or an “Eastman,” and cocaine is better known as “happy dust” or “snow.”<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>
		Van Patten’s concentration on the range of word origins and the complexity and convolution of word usage in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span> calls to mind Gates’s exploration of black vernacular as a literary-critical principle. To recall <span style="font-style:italic;">The Signifying Monkey</span> briefly, the crux of Gates’s analysis is the differentiation between Signification (black vernacular) and signification (standard English); the correlative terms Signifyin(g) and signifying represent the black vernacular expression of identity through a linguistic repetition with a difference.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Like Van Patten, Gates highlights playful mutability, arbitrary and strategic substitutions of signifiers, and “the obscuring of apparent meaning” (<span style="font-style:italic;">SM</span>, 53). As a vernacular base for new jazz and addiction vocabularies, Signifyin(g) offered this subculture an audible discourse of refusal and Otherness that complemented its styles, behaviors, and attitudes. In the tradition of Signifyin(g), the jazz-addict vernacular manifested a malleable linguistic code that could both accommodate and reflect the complex political struggles and aesthetic innovations emerging in Harlem’s interzones.
	      </p>
<p>
		Insofar as politics translate into linguistic expression, Gates writes that, “By an act of will, some historically nameless community of remarkably self-conscious speakers of English defined their ontological status as one of profound difference vis-à-vis the rest of society. What’s more, they undertook this act of self-definition, implicit in a (re)naming ritual, within the process of signification that the English language had inscribed for itself” (<span style="font-style:italic;">SM</span>, 47). Therefore, participation in the Signifyin(g) tradition establishes individual membership within the larger community and simultaneously allows the individual to continually rearticulate that community through revision, play, and repetition.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Hebdige describes something similar: “The struggle between different discourses, different definitions and meanings within ideology is therefore always at the same time, a struggle within signification: a struggle for possession of the sign” (<span style="font-style:italic;">S</span>, 17). For the jazz-addict subculture, a distinct vernacular in the Signifyin(g) tradition enables self-actualization through language, while also challenging the signifying machine of white capitalist or Talented Tenth hegemonies.
	      </p>
<p>
		On a basic level, Signifyin(g) offers a relevant, theoretical descriptor of the interplay between the jazz-addict subculture’s political identity and linguistic expression. On a more advanced level, the <span style="font-style:italic;">American Speech</span> articles, the novels at hand, and Gates’s own study suggest that the formation of the jazz-addict subculture holds an important place in the history of Signifyin(g). For one thing, Gates openly acknowledges that the underlying properties of Signifyin(g) speech acts flourish in the musical patterns, individual improvisations, and general ethos of jazz.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> For Gates, the Signifyin(g) practices that abound in blues and jazz follow a long tradition of black vernacular and African mythology. As historian David T. Courtwright reveals, addiction too has a subcultural, Signifyin(g) legacy. In his history of U.S. opium addiction, Courtwright notes that,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		  Addict subcultures date back at least as far as the mid-nineteenth century . . . . There were separate, sometimes overlapping subcultures of Chinese and white opium smokers in the nineteenth century; subcultures in the sense that each of these groups had its own terminology, procedures, loyalties, and common standards of appropriate behavior. It is interesting in this context to note that many of the terms still in use today (<span style="font-style:italic;">yen, dope fiend, hophead</span>) derive from these prototypical nonmedical addict subcultures.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		In a sense, then, the jazz-addict subculture marks the conjunction of two Signifyin(g) histories, each with an allegiance to communicating through and experimenting with difference.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>
		Indicative of this convergence, Gates borrows a definition of Signifyin(g) from jazz musician Milton “Mezz” Mezzrow’s autobiography, <span style="font-style:italic;">Really the Blues</span> . Gates writes that “Signifyin(g) for Mezzrow is not what is played or said; it is rather a form of rhetorical training” (<span style="font-style:italic;">SM</span>, 70). Though Gates calls Mezzrow a “commentator” on black vernacular, he never deals with the fact that Mezzrow is not African-American. In his autobiography, Mezzrow, a Jewish Chicagoan, recounts how jazz appealed to his quest for self-expression. The aesthetic and cultural refusal of Jim Crow racism by African-American jazz culture resonated with his own confrontations with anti-Semitism. As Mezzrow puts it, “I was maneuvering for a new language that would make me shout out loud and romp on to glory. What I needed was the vocabulary.” He adds, “I not only loved those colored boys, but I was one of them—I felt closer to them than I felt to the whites, and I even got the same treatment . . . . They were my kind of people. And I was going to learn their music and play it for the rest of my days. I was going to be a musician, a Negro musician, hipping the world about the blues the way only Negroes can.”<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Confirming his education in jazz and Signifyin(g), Mezzrow writes in a black vernacular similar to that used by Van Vechten and McKay; like Van Vechten, he includes a glossary of jazz vernacular, and, along with a translation, he composes an entire section in jive.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>
		Despite the historically complex and often inharmonious quality of Jewish American and African American cross-racial identification, Mezzrow’s place in Gates’s study suggests that the black vernacular tradition can be made multiracial under the right conditions. Moreover, Mezzrow’s inclusion in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Signifying Monkey</span> puts the jazz-addict subculture squarely within this tradition. Along with chronicling the Prohibition-era jazz scenes in Chicago and New York, <span style="font-style:italic;">Really the Blues</span> offers some of the most zealous passages of drug use in American literature. Even Mezzrow’s own name participates in the playful cycles of Signifyin(g) used by the jazz-addict subculture. His nickname Mezz is said to be slang for premium marijuana and riffs on another marijuana reference derived from his surname: Mezzroll or Messerole, which refers to “fat sticks of marihuana, hand-rolled, with the ends tucked in.”<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> It seems that what Gates calls the “classic confrontation between Afro-American culture and American culture” (<span style="font-style:italic;">SM</span>, 45), which he emphasizes linguistically through his Signification-signification distinctions, loses some consistency and accuracy within the jazz-addict subculture. Like Mezzrow, Van Vechten and McKay account for their participation in bilateral, multiracial exchanges of language and cultural practice, and then create literary characters  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> who engage in similar experiences. Indeed, Van Patten’s taxonomy of words used by Van Vechten and McKay implies that Signifyin(g) is always already produced through bilateral, perhaps multidimensional, cultural exchange, precisely what thrived within the jazz-addict subculture.
	      </p>
<p>
		Though the jazz-addict vernacular is clearly tethered to the very cultural and political issues that have occasioned a critical recuperation of these two novels, it has nonetheless remained a major sticking point for certain critics who seem compelled to qualify their work by making disclaimers about exploitation and racial stereotyping. Of particular concern is Van Vechten’s “Glossary of Negro Words and Phrases.”<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> While the glossary supports Van Patten’s case for the novel’s authenticity, it also fosters an insider-outsider dynamic by presenting readers not hip to the Harlem community with a brief guidebook. David Levering Lewis reports that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> “drove much of literate Afro-America into a dichotomy of approval and apoplexy over ‘authentic’ versus ‘proper’ cultural expression.”<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> For Justin D. Edwards, the glossary may indicate a desire to represent Harlem life accurately, but it ultimately still reiterates Van Vechten’s biographical role as a Harlem cultural authority and tour guide for his multiracial group of friends.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Edwards argues that <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> therefore emulates travel writing and fosters a problematic readerly “tourism,” but Edwards wavers in his analysis: “While <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> exploits Harlem’s speakeasies and nightclubs for its literary material, it is also the first American novel by a white writer to attempt representations of black middle-class characters.”<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Even though Edwards weighs the glossary’s premise against literary caricature, he cannot finally accept the novel as anything other than exploitative or derogatory. He concludes, “By choosing to use . . . textual devices associated with the genre of the travel narrative, Van Vechten is unable to avoid the discursive strategies of eroticisation, voyeurism and taxonomy—all of which contradict his claims of authenticity in favour of contemporary stereotypes.”<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>
		Echoing Edwards’s negative reading, Kathleen Pfeiffer also has difficulty reconciling the glossary’s contribution with the novel’s seedy or racy passages. In her introduction to the reissue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span>, she asserts that sensationalism and the glossary are both part of Van Vechten’s strategy to attract black and white readers. Pfeiffer even hints at Gates’s work when she argues that,
	      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		  What the glossary accomplishes . . . is more in keeping with the African American trickster tradition than any scholarly tradition. This is best illustrated in the twinned entries ‘<span style="font-style:italic;">boody</span>: see hootchie-pap’ and ‘<span style="font-style:italic;">hootchie-pap</span>: see boody’ . . . . The glossary points in sum to the larger project of the novel itself—to offer a glimpse into the contours of black culture, but to obscure and thereby protect the integrity of that culture’s meaning.
		</p>
<div class="attrib">
		  (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, xxviii)
		</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		  Like Edwards and Van Patten, Pfeiffer suggests that this glossary verifies Van Vechten’s legitimate knowledge of, and participation in, Harlem’s New Negro community. However, she sees that community rather conservatively; when addressing the novel’s salacious content, she insists that the cabaret scenes and those involving the Scarlet Creeper are “peripheral scenes” that “move quickly” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, xxvi). Eventually countering Edwards’s conclusions, she defends the novel against charges of racist exploitation,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> but only by minimizing the content of these passages.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> Essentially, Pfeiffer excises the black vernacular of the novel from the cultural contexts in which it thrives, severing Harlem’s nightlife and black vernacular from the middle-class main characters. She assures that, “<span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> actually spends only thirty-nine of its 284 pages depicting raunchy or debauched aspects of Harlem life” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, xv). Aside from her argument’s problematic quality-versus-quantity approach, Pfeiffer simply sweeps the jazz-addict subculture under the rug.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>
		  As Jake’s attraction to the word “bumbole” demonstrates, the jazz-addict vernacular matters even outside “raunchy” and “debauched” scenes; it signals the complex identity politics affecting the entire New Negro community. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span>, Byron’s class and cultural membership involves a daily competition for signification. His lack of knowledge about black vernacular severely compromises his ability to secure work or jumpstart his writing career. Paradoxically, he is denied entry into the white business world for which his University of Pennsylvania education has trained him, and his own stubborn refusal to accept help from established New Negro businessmen relegates him to lower-class employment. As if imitating Paul Laurence Dunbar, Byron hopes that his job operating elevators, however disagreeable, will at least provide writing material:
		</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		    Nevertheless, his immediate pendent thought was that he would never write about this life, that he could never feel anything but repugnance for these people because they were black. I can’t bear to think of myself as a part of this, he sighed . . . . Well, presently he knew what <span style="font-style:italic;">they</span> thought . . . . He caught phrases: posin’ an’ signifyin’, high-toned mustardseed, arnchy yaller boy, sheik from Strivers’ Row.
		  </p>
<div class="attrib">
		    (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 192)
		  </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		    Already excluded from the business world because of his race, Byron realizes that his coworkers have judged him an outsider because of his education and class. Later, his friend Howard apologizes and says, “I forgot to warn you . . . . You ought to speak in dialect . . . . You have to be a mixer” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 194). As Howard suggests, Byron’s situation is clearly a crisis of passing, one in which black must now pass for black.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Byron’s inability to learn, speak, and write the jazz-addict vernacular ironically undercuts his attempts to become the New Negro aesthete. His short story about an interracial cabaret romance is rejected for publication because the magazine editor finds it too prudish and lacking authenticity. The editor tells Byron, “Jean Cocteau could have done a cabaret better without ever having heard of such a dive. Your scene reads like a description of a Baptist sociable for the new minister” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 225) and advises, “Go home now, tear up everything you’ve written, and begin afresh. Pray and get drunk” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 227). For Byron, this suggestion highlights the failure not only of his writing, but also the failure of his authorship of self. Near the novel’s end, Byron gets drunk on gin in the Black Venus and declares his dual resentment of New Negro ambitions and the jazz-addict subculture: “A meaningless jumble. Like life. Like Negro life. Kicked down from above. Pulled down from below. No cheer but dance drink and happy dust” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 278). Unable to negotiate his place, either in language or style, Byron falls tragically into a cultural void.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">“Artificial Paradises”: Coleridge and Baudelaire in Harlem</h1>
<p>
		    By representing the jazz-addict subculture’s Signifiyin(g) speech practices and the affirmation of its underground space through language, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span> exemplify what Gates calls “speakerly texts.” These two “double-voiced” novels also capture the “elsewhere” aura of the jazz-addict subculture by performing “tropological revision” (<span style="font-style:italic;">SM</span>, xxv).<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> In particular, both novels create intertextual relationships by repeating and reworking the tropes of nineteenth-century European drug literature. Van Vechten and McKay mobilize signature Orientalist metaphors and motifs from authors such as De Quincey, Coleridge, and Baudelaire in attempts to capture the various states of intoxication experienced by their characters.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> However, more than simply hijacking opium narratives and adopting Orientalism wholesale in order to describe the jazz-addict subculture, these two novels portray an Orientalism with a black difference, or what Bill Mullen terms “Afro-Orientalism.” While the “speakerly” aspects of these novels convey a vocalized “elsewhere,” the Afro-Orientalist tropological revisions suggest an additional “elsewhere” inhabited and experimented with by the jazz-addict subculture.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Through a kind of tropological revision of its own—a rethinking of Said’s Orientalism, in particular—Mullen’s Afro-Orientalism denotes both an historical African-American fantasy of escape from the black-white binary of American racism and also “a speculative bridge” that understands African and Asian diasporas as proximate, synchronous experiences produced along the pathways of Western imperialism, slavery and indentured servitude, and institutionalized global racism.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> As presented by Van Vechten and McKay, the Afro-Orientalism of the jazz-addict subculture offers participants an alternative political and cultural reality. Like the subcultural “elsewhere,” this Afro- Orientalism offers “an imaginary ‘third way’ out of the crushing oppositional hierarchies of the American South’s peculiarly brutal history. Asia’s distance in this parable is its utopian attraction, far removed, literally and ratively, from the sphere of Western power.”<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> By describing scenes of intoxication and racial fantasy through allusions to Coleridge and Baudelaire, Van Vechten and McKay reconre the Western Orientalist typology. This act of Signifyin(g) breaks down and reassembles African primitivism and Orientalist exoticism in order to create a new, Afro-Orientalist voice of cultural expression, dissent, and escape.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Before dealing with the Afro-Orientalism that colors the characters’ behaviors, remarks, and impressions of intoxication and partying, it is first worth mentioning that in both novels Harlem is itself Orientalized. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span>, cabarets and eateries have names like the Nile Restaurant and the Sheba Palace, where the crowd “was a scene of blazing color. Soft, barbaric, burning, savage, clashing, planless colors—all rioting together in wonderful harmony” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 320). In <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span>, Harlem is repeatedly called “the Mecca of the New Negro.” Indeed, the Harlem hotspots in both novels closely resemble the favorite establishments—the Lybia, the Oriental, and the Garden of Joy—that Rudolph Fisher recollects in his essay “The Caucasian Storms Harlem.” The novels present what Fisher once witnessed, a Harlem still African-American, but  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> in the form of essentialist apparitions of African origin. As Erenberg explains, there was both “the sense that New York was not America” and the feeling that it was “the pagan center of the nation.”<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> Like the miniature Orients of London’s East End opium dens, the Congo, a blacks-only cabaret in <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span>, “was a real throbbing little Africa in New York” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 29). This “Africanness” distinguishes the Congo from a Jewish-owned cabaret that caters to largely interracial crowds: “The Congo was African in spirit and color. No white persons were admitted there . . . . When you were fed up with the veneer of Seventh Avenue, and Goldgraben’s Afro-Oriental garishness, you would go to the Congo and turn rioting loose in all the tenacious odors of service and the warm indigenous smells of Harlem, fooping or jig-jagging the night away” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 30). Here McKay reveals a scale of Afro-Orientalist possibility: one plays with the fantasy of escape at Goldgraben’s, but one realizes that escape at the Congo.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>
		    Such nightspots provide a subcultural locale for experimenting with the Afro-Orientalist imagination. According to Mullen, Afro-Orientalism within the broader African-American community took shape through cultural and political expressions of Afrocentrism, Egyptocentrism, and Ethiopianism, which sought to resuscitate a mythology of past African greatness and reimagine Africa as a tangible utopian destination. In both novels, jazz and intoxication offer a spiritual portal for making this mythological journey. For instance, during a visit to Madame Laura’s brothel in <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span>, Jake and Ray listen as the piano player “wandered off into some dim, far away, ancestral source of music” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 196). The roomful of couples in carnal knowledge becomes a community through collective fantasy: “Black lovers of life caught up in their own free native rhythm, threaded to a remote scarce-remembered past, celebrating the midnight hours in themselves, for themselves, of themselves” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 197). This combination of jazz and sex transports the intoxicated orgy of Madame Laura’s brothel “back to Africa,” away from the hegemonic constraints and frustrations posed by American racism, capitalism, and New Negro expectations.
		  </p>
<p>
		    At its surface, Afro-Orientalism involves a degree of theatrical caricature, which makes both novels susceptible to the critics who accuse them of racial stereotyping and exploitation. In fact, the Afro-Orientalist flair of a place like Goldgraben’s in <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span> certainly plays into the fantasies of white club goers. Mumford suggests that for many slumming whites, “spending a night on the town in Harlem might represent the cultural equivalent of taking a Cunard cruise to Africa, an exciting excursion into another social world” (<span style="font-style:italic;">I</span>, 143).<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> That being said, Afro-Orientalism still contributes to a genuine subcultural style by allowing New Negro participants to experiment with primitivist and exotic parody.<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> In <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span>, for example, Mary and Byron enjoy Afro-Orientalized sexual foreplay: “You talk like a savage! I am. I’m an African cannibal! Son of a king! Going to eat you up for my dinner!” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 145).
		  </p>
<p>
		    Such role-playing cannot be divorced from the more ostensibly political depths of the Afro-Orientalist imagination. This is especially true for Mary, who assembles an exhibit of authentic African artifacts that is mocked and disparaged by a group of elite New Negro acquaintances: “African sculpture! That dreadful, vulgar stuff! . . . It’s the work of heathen savages . . . and it has nothing to do with art . . . everybody goes back  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to savages, but it does no good to unearth that sort of thing” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 70–71). Here Hester Snodes argues that the African past has no present-day value for the New Negro. On the contrary, Mary deftly wields Afro-Orientalism as a critical lens for viewing her community and her cultural roots. To Mary, the aristocratic Adora resembles Cleopatra, while Orville Snodes has an “empty face, so like an Ethiopian Moon” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 26, 67). Mary’s father, in turn, personifies Othello. She thinks that, “He actually represented her idea of a Moor. Might he not, indeed, be one?” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 94). Mary’s tendency to see people in this way triggers a lengthy meditation on the origins of the Negro and Afro-Orientalist diasporas:
		  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		      The old slave traders were none too particular concerning the individuals they kidnapped along the African coast . . . . Not only were the miserable human beings raped from all parts of Africa, representatives of widely differing African tribes, but also Arabs, Egyptians, Moors, and even Spaniards and Portuguese were gathered in. In America these curiously distinct races came together and bore children; further these children were often impregnated with French, Spanish, English and Indian blood. The result, whatever the percentage of the mixture, was known in this enlightened country as a Negro.
		    </p>
<div class="attrib">
		      (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 94)
		    </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		      For Mary in particular, and throughout both novels in general, Afro-Orientalism becomes a paradigm of subjective self-reflection and a sign of concern about what is at stake in pursuing a New Negro identity which ignores or rejects the historical past. Afro-Orientalism also acts as a conduit through which Van Vechten and McKay critique the modernist high culture/low culture posturing endorsed by elitist New Negroes like Van Vechten’s Hester Snodes. To be precise, the scenes of greatest decadence and lowest debauchery receive, through tropological revisions of Coleridgean and Baudelairean motifs, some of the most highly stylized treatments in the novels. By taking from high culture the narcotic reveries of European romanticism and then conjoining them to the low culture of the jazz-addict vernacular, Van Vechten and McKay both compose a politically and aesthetically syncretic subcultural riposte to the Talented Tenth.
		    </p>
<p>
		      In <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span>, Byron and Lasca speed toward the novel’s ultimate indulgences and vice by drinking heavily, snorting cocaine in the back of a taxicab, and giving the order, “Drive to hell!” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 252). Their destination, the Black Mass, is a secretive, underground cabaret where Kubla Khan’s pleasure-dome hides in the bowels of Harlem.<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> When the compliant if not naïve Byron asks Lasca about the club, she explains that, “It’s a garden where champagne flows from all the fountains and the paths are made of happy dust and the perfume of the poppies is opium” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 252). In contrast to this drug-laced paradisal advertisement, Byron observes “tortured music from the depths of hell,” “demoniac saxophones,” a “witches’ sabbath,” and “pleasure seekers from the cold slabs of the morgue” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 254). In a startling display of sexualized exoticism, a young girl, “pure black with savage African features,” removes her black cloak, dances naked, and performs “her evil rites” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 255–56). Coleridge’s “Kubla Khan” hinges on a similar antagonism between a hedonistic Orientalized garden and a satanic, feminine danger: “A savage place! as holy and enchanted / As e’er beneath a waning moon was haunted / By woman wailing for her demon-lover! / And from this chasm, with ceaseless  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> turmoil seething, / As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing, / A mighty fountain momently was forced.” Under Lasca’s influence and intoxicated with liquor and cocaine, Byron hears “that music loud and long” and becomes the poetic witness to Kubla Khan’s “sunny dome” and “caves of ice.” The Black Mass scene seems to cry “Beware! Beware!” as it sends Byron to his ignoble fate; “For he on honey-dew hath fed / And drunk the milk of Paradise.”<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<p>
		      During the lengthy tryst that follows, Lasca becomes the corporeal source of Byron’s moral turpitude, his pleasure and his pain. Her name appears to be derived from “Lascar,” an archaism for an East Indian sailor. And like the Black Mass, her home is an Orientalist pleasure dome: “Over the Steinway, a black Spanish shawl, embroidered in huge vermilion and orange flowers, was held in place by a rock-crystal lamp in the form of a Chinese goddess. Strewn on the tables, the desk, the mantelpiece, were more Chinese objects, birds, fish and animals” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 237). Byron and Lasca continue their torrent of excess for days, drinking absinthe, having violent confrontations leading to sex, and enjoying other indescribable indulgences: “There were rages, succeeded by tumultuous passions; there were peaceful interludes; there were hours devoted to satisfying capricious desires, rhythmical amours to music, cruel and painful pastimes; there were the artificial paradises” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 261). The allusion to Baudelaire’s treatise on hashish and opium, <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Paradis Artificiels</span> , further invokes the tradition of Orientalist drug literature.
		    </p>
<p>
		      As an allusion to Baudelaire, this passage also cements Byron’s catastrophic collapse. Baudelaire’s stories of hashish and opium are impassioned admonitions, not romanticized celebrations; the exotic and Oriental is as dangerous as it is alluring. In a warning that resonates with Coleridge’s “Kubla Kahn” and the Satanic aura of the Black Mass, Baudelaire writes that, “These stimulant poisons are not only one of the most direct and terrible means employed by the Prince of Darkness to entrap and enslave deplorable humanity, they are also among his most perfect embodiments.”<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> To Byron, who is already known to be a “slave to [his] appetites,” Lasca presents an even greater threat (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 171). As Baudelaire suggests, “A man in such a situation never believes he is selling his soul. In his infatuation, he forgets that he is playing with a being subtler than himself, and that if the Spirit of Evil is allowed to grasp but a single hair, it will lose no time in carrying off the entire head.”<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> Once Lasca uses Byron up and throws him out, the novel fulfills Baudelaire’s predicted ignominy and becomes, like Coleridge’s fragmentary vision, an irretrievable hallucinogenic dream ending with Byron exhausted, empty, and mortified.
		    </p>
<p>
		      In <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span>, tropological revisions of Coleridge and Afro-Orientalist wonderment surface during Jake’s interactions with Ray. For Jake, Ray embodies a desirable and perhaps queer Otherness; he represents the independent black nationalism of Haiti, speaks French, reads poetry, and attends college. During a stopover in Pennsylvania, Ray entrances Jake with a Wordsworth poem about Toussaint L’Ouverture and introduces him to a new Afro-Orientalist worldview that triangulates back through Afro-Caribbean postcolonial history. After hearing Ray’s stories about West Africa, Abyssinia, Egypt, Palestine, Ethiopia, the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon, Jake  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> is enthralled: “as an American Negro he looked askew at foreign niggers. Africa was jungle, and Africans bush niggers, cannibals. But now he felt like a boy who stands with the map of the world in colors before him, and feels the wonder of the world” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 134). Like Mary, Jake’s encounter with the Afro-Orientalist imagination, by way of the Black Atlantic, manifests a self-reflective consideration of his place in the African-American community. Indeed, for Michelle Stephens, Ray’s “story of racial solidarity is a transnational one because it pulls Jake out of his own nationality, both as an American and as a Harlemite, and into a more internationalist imagining of racial home and his own black masculinity.”<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a></p>
<p>
		      Though Ray appears already fluent in the academic aspects of the Afro-Orientalist imagination, it is not until his fantasies funnel through the jazz-addict subculture that his own crisis of identity and community is fully revealed. In the chapter “Snowstorm in Pittsburgh,” McKay’s Signifyin(g) play-on-words in the title setting up the chapter’s cocaine episodes, Jake and Ray discover a jazz-addict subculture in Pittsburgh and receive an invitation to share some cocaine with a few of the speakeasy patrons. Jake and Ray’s unnamed companion describes Happy, the man who invited them: “He’s the biggest hophead I ever seen. Nobody can sniff like him. Yet he’s always the same happy nigger, stout and strong like a bull” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 149). While Ray calmly declines, Jake accepts the invitation, and his familiarity with cocaine is revealed: “Jake looked mischievously at the little brown door, remarking: ‘It’s a great life ef youse in on it . . . ’” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 149). As if entering into another world, Jake passes through the mysterious brown door and enters a room of opium smoking and cocaine snorting. Inside, Happy says, “‘Say what you wanta about Chinee or any other stuff . . . but theah ain’t nothing can work wicked like snow and whisky. It’ll flip you up from hell into heaven befoh you knows it’” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 150). Happy’s remarks suggest a spiritual upward mobility via intoxication and also acknowledge a carefully negotiated exchange between African-Americans and Asian-Americans made possible by a shared affinity for these drugs. Here, the opium den subcultures discussed by Milligan and Courtwright rematerialize within an African-American subcultural space.
		    </p>
<p>
		      For Jake, this drug experience is a casual and mundane affair, hardly an Afro-Orientalist phenomenon. After partaking, he buys a few packets of cocaine from Happy and leaves. However, for Ray, who finds and uses Jake’s cocaine, his drug experience collides with his already intense cultural and political anxieties. Restlessly dreaming about a return to Haiti and thinking about his railroad job as slave labor, Ray naïvely hopes that the cocaine will be soporific. For Ray, the cocaine seems to be a way out of the unnatural world of American capitalism, “that magnificent monster of civilization” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 155). Mirroring the fantastical awe he earlier sparked in Jake, Ray’s druginduced dreams transport him to a Coleridgean world of exotic pleasures, luxuries, and possibilities:
		    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
			And the world was a blue paradise. Everything was in gorgeous blue of heaven. Woods and streams were blue, and men and women and animals, and beautiful to see and love. And he was a blue bird in flight and a blue lizard in love . . . . Taboos and terrors and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> penalities were transformed into new pagan delights, orgies of Orient-blue carnival, or rare flowers and red fruits, cherubs and seraphs and fetishes and phalli and all the mosthigh gods.
		      </p>
<div class="attrib">
			(<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 158)<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
			  “Here,” according to Stephens’s reading of Ray’s dream, “the black male subject flies away from even his Caribbean nation-home to a multicultural premodern dreamscape in which he can actualize in himself the re of the black, male, sovereign self.”<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a> This dream liberates Ray’s imagination from the stultifying limits of diasporic life, thereby enabling his desire for political and sexual sovereignty to reach its most radical and uncompromised expression. And yet, as in Coleridge’s poem and Byron’s escapade with Lasca, Ray’s escape into an Afro-Orientalist paradise shuts down abruptly. Utopian pleasures turn painful as “a thousand pins were pricking Ray’s flesh” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 158). When Ray is found the next day, having overdosed, he must be taken to the hospital.
			</p>
<p>
			  Though Jake realizes what had happened, the railroad chef misinterprets Ray’s condition and instead blames the illness on Ray’s scholarly pursuits: “Better leave that theah nigger professor alone and come on ’long to the dining-car with us. That theah nigger is dopey from them books o’ hisn. I done told befoh them books would git him yet” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 159). The chef’s belief that one can overdose on books calls attention to the conflicted attitudes toward education and high culture within the New Negro community.<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> The chef implies that Ray’s cultural capital promotes a false, if not dangerous, sense of superiority over the rest of the working-class New Negroes. But at the same time, the distinction between high culture and low culture collapses. The slippage between Ray overdosing on drugs and overdosing on literature underscores Ray’s own inner conflicts about the redeemable value of his education. The cocaine puts Ray in touch with an Afro-Orientalist variation on the escapist fantasies already integral to his engagement with literature and culture. Well after the cocaine episode, Ray contemplates an Afrocentric “third way out”: “I don’t know what I’ll do with my little education. I wonder sometimes if I could get rid of it and go and lose myself in some savage culture in the jungles of Africa” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HH</span>, 274). Like Byron, Ray cannot find a stable home within the jazz-addict subculture; nor can he find a gratifying pursuit that justifies his education. Ultimately, both characters’ engagements with the jazz-addict subculture are profound not because their desires come to be satisfied, but because their desires come to be expressed and experimented with in ways that are unavailable elsewhere. In this sense, the jazz-addict subculture manifests a community of desire that seeks alternative pathways to racial, sexual, and economic self-understanding—pathways which are actively obstructed by the expectations of white culture and the Talented Tenth.

			  Like Ellison’s invisible man, whom Dr. Bledsoe punished for giving the college’s white trustee the “complete tour” and “the full treatment,” Van Vechten and McKay have been widely criticized for exploring the gritty and scandalous underside of the Harlem Renaissance.<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a> But as the denouncements of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span> subside, it is important to reconsider the political and aesthetic legacy of the Harlem underground. In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Harlem Renaissance in Black and White</span>, George Hutchinson  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> contends that, “New York provided a freer atmosphere for the black artist both because of the concentration, dynamism, and diversity of racial consciousness in Harlem <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> because of the greater freedom and variety of <span style="font-style:italic;">inter</span>racial and <span style="font-style:italic;">inter</span>ethnic relationships, which only intensified the experimental development of new forms of ‘racial’ expression.”<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a> Van Vechten and McKay find such expressive forms in the language and style of the jazz-addict subculture, and thus, they showcase these forms in their representations of Harlem life. From within an intoxicated, jazzing world of bilateral cultural exchange, the jazz-addict subculture expressed “a fundamental tension between those in power and those condemned to subordinate positions and second-class lives” (<span style="font-style:italic;">S</span>, 132). Through their examinations of the Afro-Orientalist imagination and their mobilization of the jazz-addict vernacular, Van Vechten and McKay show how the jazz-addict subculture responded materially and aesthetically to class hypocrisies, racial disenfranchisement, and Progressive-era hegemonies affecting the entire Harlem community.

			  By using the term jazz-addict subculture, I do not mean to conflate drug use with addiction. Rather, I use addiction here to represent the conservative Progressive-era attitudes toward drug use and alcohol consumption. The Harrison Act of 1914 along with Prohibition affirmed a legal and cultural consensus that the slippery slope between casual use and addiction presented too great a social threat to allow narcotics and alcohol to go unregulated any longer. Six years before Prohibition, the Harrison Act established Internal Revenue Service taxation policies to control the distribution of opiates and cocaine. The Harrison Act made it “unlawful for any person to sell, barter, exchange, or give away any of the aforesaid drugs” without IRS approval. Quoted in <span style="font-style:italic;">Drugs in America: A Documentary History</span>, David F. Musto, ed. (New York: New York University Press, 2002), 254. Unlike Prohibition, which targeted manufacture in addition to sales and distribution, the Harrison Act expressly sought to prevent drugs from entering society by illicit means.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>

			The term “Eastman,” which Van Vechten defines as “a man who lives on women” (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 285) is likely an allusion to the flashy comportment and clothing associated with Monk Eastman’s New York City street gang of the early 1900s.

			Gates’s terminology, Signifyin(g)/signifying for instance, reproduces the rhetorical character of black vernacular through devices like antanaclasis (“homonymic puns”) and agnominatio (“the repetition of a word with a change denoted by a difference in sound or in a letter”).

			In this way, Gates resonates with Pierre Bourdieu, who uses the term habitus to describe the mutually reinforcing exchange of cultural practices between the group and the individual. Bourdieu writes that “The habitus is not only a structuring structure, which organizes practices and the perception of practices, but also a structured structure: the principle of division into logical classes which organizes the perception of the social world is itself the product of internalization of the division into social classes.” Pierre Bourdieu, <span style="font-style:italic;">Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste</span>, transl.

			In “Story in Harlem Slang” , Zora Neale Hurston employs a similar black vernacular and like Van Vechten includes a glossary. Hurston’s story demonstrates how this vernacular arms the two male gigolo characters with the power to simultaneously differentiate identities culturally and socio-economically: “Man, I don’t deal in no coal. Know what I tell ’em? If they’s white, they’s right! If they’s yellow, they’s mellow! If they’s brown, they can stick around. But if they come black, they better git way back! Tell ’em about me!” Zora Neale Hurston, “Story in Harlem Slang,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Zora Neale Hurston: Novels and Stories</span>, ed. Cheryl A.

			Edwards, “Carl Van Vechten,” 182. On the problem of authenticity and choice in the two novels, Nathan Huggins writes that “McKay’s novel is far more evocative than Van Vechten’s. The fact that <span style="font-style:italic;">Home to Harlem</span> was written from the ‘inside’ is apparent from its confusion. Van Vechten’s  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> novel described life that the author had observed as a chosen part of his experience.

		      When Edwards calls the novel a failure, he argues almost the opposite position with regards to cabarets and the Scarlet Creeper: “The text fails in part because the most significant scenes in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nigger Heaven</span> are those containing the Scarlet Creeper and Lasca Sartoris. Unfortunately, the sections of the novel which focus on the middle-class lifestyles of Mary Love, Byron Kasson, Olive Hamilton, and Howard Allison fail because they seem trite, banal and over determined.” Edwards, “Carl Van Vechten,” 180.

Afro-Orientalism, in other words, is a signifying discourse on race, nation, and global politics constituting a subtradition in indigenous U.S. writing on imperialism, colonialism, and the making of capitalist empire” (xv).

		      Byron and Lasca gain entrance into the Black Mass only after passing through three separate doors vis-à-vis a ritual of button pushing, door knocking, and an inspection from an attendant behind a sliding door panel (<span style="font-style:italic;">NH</span>, 253–54). For Erenberg, this type of descent announces a cultural fissure: “During the 1920s the nightclub entered the speakeasy phase of its existence, one associated with secret passwords and criminal suppliers of alcohol. The illegal aura surrounding its operations best expresses the removal of the cabaret from public life and the disjuncture between public and private values” (Erenberg, “From New York,” 763). In one sense, Byron ends up a tragic victim whose inability to reconcile the conflicting demands of public and private (manifested in his struggles with race, class, and labor), leads to impotent disgrace.

<p>
	Food, U.S. propaganda director Elmer Davis suggested in 1942, was a profoundly political matter during the Second World War. As global famine conditions and national rationing programs came to define the daily lives of most people, agriculture and eating became fraught emblems of military power, war trade, and political allegiances. In the context of transatlantic literary culture, the wartime politics of food animates a wide range of modernist writers.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> By the same token, food writers such as M. F. K. Fisher and Elizabeth David adapt modernist aesthetics to the project of instructing home cooks on how to prepare gourmet meals out of scarce resources and black market ingredients. We should thus consider avant-garde writers such as Samuel Beckett and Lorine Niedecker to be coextensive with these gastronomical res; considered together, their works constitute an expressly transcultural form of late modernism that turns on a cultural divide between austerity and luxury (or what George Orwell  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> terms “luxury feeding”) as well as a felt anxiety vis-à-vis the expanding power of the United States and its food-centered economy.
      </p>
<p>
	Although no critical account attends to the preoccupation with food in literary modernism, that preoccupation proves to be a productive area of inquiry for modernist studies. In treating food aesthetically, modernist writers neither resist the culture of consumption nor disavow the “social life of things,” to cite Fredric Jameson and Arjun Appadurai respectively, but squarely confront the global market in the practices and ideologies that fuel the food economy.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> In what follows, I investigate the conceptual interplay of global scarcity and U.S. overproduction in four texts of the Second World War: Objectivist poet Lorine Niedecker’s <span style="font-style:italic;">New Goose</span> poems (1935–1945), American food writer M.

	  In one of her many war-inflected poems, Objectivist poet Lorine Niedecker correlates the weapons of the Second World War with the economics of U.S. agriculture and daily habits of farmworkers. Opening with a reference to the atomic bomb, the poem moves on to describe the dairy town of Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin and the print shop where Niedecker worked as a copyeditor for <span style="font-style:italic;">Hoard’s Dairyman</span> from 1944 to 1950.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p class="continued">
	    Written in 1950, the poem opens on a snowy day in early December on the road that Niedecker presumably traveled from her home on Black Hawk Island to the print shop. The first stanza immediately inflects a romantic trope—a poet’s contemplative walk across a sublime winter landscape—with the spectral re of “the bomb,” which at once recalls the Pearl Harbor attack of December 7, 1941 and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on the sixth and ninth of August 1945. In this palimpsest of the air strikes that opened and closed the Pacific theater of the Second World War, the poem transmutes the winter storms of the Great Lakes into the atomic fallout over Japan. Against pastoral renderings of this iconic American landscape, Niedecker thus connects the Wisconsin dairy region to the global weapons of world war and, perhaps too, the fascist “radio barbs” of Ezra Pound.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> According to the poem’s formal correspondences, which yoke weapons and words but also world war and national work, it would seem that no place is safe from, and no one entirely innocent of, the century’s total war. To this point, Elizabeth Willis observes that the “most frequently recurring nouns” in Niedecker’s poems are war and work, a thematic emphasis that reflects her poetic process of incorporating extra-literary material in which public and private “content often merge . . . including private commentaries on the public matters of governance, art, war, and labor politics.”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    The 1950 poem revolves, in particular, around the interconnected machines of war and agriculture, which, according to the poem’s logic, pose a fundamental threat to poetry. Juxtaposing the utilitarian pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">Hoard’s Dairyman</span> (with its “hog feeder price lists”) and the speaker’s scant “six lines of poetry,” Niedecker imagines her poetic writing to be incommensurable with her work as a copyeditor in the war economy that the large dairies and related agriculture commodities of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dairyman</span> signify. In contrast to First World War poets who imagine poetry as a vehicle of war memorial, Niedecker res poetry as out of step with the war. In the poem’s stark calculus, there is the quietism of poetry and the “dreadfully much else.” The poem does not correlate this re to the wartime suffering of Midwestern folk culture that the second stanza evokes and that informs much of Niedecker’s poetry. Rather, in increasingly colloquial  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> diction, the poem lambastes the industrial and material structure of the agricultural economy: the “suction, / pull, you know, favor, drag, / well-oiled protection” that drives rural workers to move up the ranks from “barbarous hirelings” to “corrupt higher-ups.” The machinery of war and this “well-oiled” machinery of the food industry work in tandem to rearticulate pastoral conceptions of rural America. Against the enjambed form and contemplative tone of the first stanza, the latter stanzas proceed via a series of simple sentences and noun phrases. Analogous to the tickers of commodity prices and government-sponsored radio announcements but also to the machine guns of the Second World War, this staccato cadence reinforces the poem’s implicit argument that the production of food and bombs is the interconnected and defining backdrop to daily life in this period. This idea emerges even more forcefully in an earlier draft of the poem, in which Niedecker concludes the poem’s first stanza not with the spatial re of a backcountry road but with the temporal trope of “our time,” suggesting that the poem is addressing the war’s fundamental <span style="font-style:italic;">Zeitgeist</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">LN</span>, 386–87).
	  </p>
<p>
	    Yet we may ask what the poem’s thematic nexus of U.S. agriculture and consumer culture have to do with the bombs of the Second World War? One indication comes in the speaker’s off-hand reference to the war’s radio barbs. As examined in detail below, the most prolific printing presses and radio tickers in the United States during the 1940s were those funded by the Office of War Information (OWI), whose chief instruments were the poster, the film short, and the radio broadcast. Administered by the OWI, U.S. propaganda during the war centered on the rhetoric that Allied nations would win the war because of their democratic institutions, but also because of the productivity of the U.S. economy and, especially, its agriculture. In tandem with this state-sponsored rhetoric, radio advertisements for foodstuffs and other consumer goods employed virulent racial epithets to reinforce military campaigns against Germany and Japan. Having worked as a scriptwriter for a Madison radio station in 1943, Niedecker would have been familiar with these forms of political and commercial broadcasting during the war. Her poem suggests, moreover, just how influential such radio barbs were on everyday consumer habits, gendering those habits in terms of the working-class women who “hold jobs,” clean, cook, and raise families. The poem’s final line speaks to the particularly ubiquitous discourse that surrounded the U.S. rationing program, a discourse that characterized patriotism as the duty of consumers, and especially women, to conserve food. The speeches and posters that promoted ration compliance to women were indeed both prolific and vitriolic, as suggested in a 1943 poster that entreats women to “save waste fats for explosives.” (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>)
	  </p>
<p>
	    To encourage conservation, gardening, and price ceilings, this rhetoric of war rations aligned food consumption with the war in Europe and Asia but also with the vitality of U.S. agriculture and consumerism. While these campaigns aimed to conserve U.S. food surpluses for the purpose of providing food aid to overseas militaries and civilian populations, they also functioned to jettison certain foodstuffs, such as animal fats and tin cans, into the literal production of weapons and supplies.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> A response to this militarization of food, Niedecker’s poem imagines agricultural labor and rural poverty as constitutive of the United States’ political and economic power during the war.

<p class="continued">
	    contrast to the national discourse of shared sacrifice, which naturalized the patriotic citizen as a middle-class consumer enjoying a rationed yet substantial diet of “three squares a day,” Niedecker’s poetry of the 1940s takes as its organizing trope the social stratification and poverty of workers. As the four-line poem cited in the above epigraph quips, the experience of rationing for a “destitute” community is one of “Nothing nourishing, / common dealtout food.” Echoing this aphorism, another poem from the same 1945 manuscript unfolds as an apostrophe to the local grocer: “What’s today, Friday? Thursday! Oh, nothing till tomorrow.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Niedecker perhaps most forcefully expresses this critique of the wartime food economy as structured around inequity rather than solidarity in a poem that pits the “government men” who control agricultural production (instructing the speaker, “Don’t plant wheat, / we’ve got too much”) against an ironic lack of food in rural food-producing communities:

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  This poetic exposé of the U.S. economy as oxymoronic in producing food surpluses that do not alleviate hunger is not confined to the poverty of agricultural Wisconsin, however. Niedecker positions regional food scarcity on a continuum with global famine conditions and austere ration programs: “a story about the war,” as one poem begins, that records the enormous rift between the social elite (red in this case as the French Vichy government) and civilians who are “too hungry too flatter” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LN</span>, 118–19).
	</p>
<p>
	  Niedecker thus emerges as a poet who is fundamentally concerned with the persistence of hunger, despite American food surpluses, both within and outside of the United States.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> In comparison to the global famine that impacted Europe, Africa, Latin America, and Asia, the United States boasted grain surpluses throughout the 1940s, a situation that proved central to American power in Europe and Japan after the war ended. In pointing to this global context for the American war economy, Niedecker’s poems prove emblematic of late modernism, which this essay shows is preoccupied with eating as a central signifier of wartime deprivation and as a politicized form of civic identity.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Food Rations in the Land of Plenty</h1>
<p>
	  As one of its most important economic effects, the Second World War solidified the global power of the American food economy. Due partly to beneficial weather and partly to war-related policies, American farmers produced food surpluses throughout  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the 1940s. In the words of Agriculture Secretary Orville Freeman, the Second World War transformed the United States into “the greatest agricultural production plant on earth.”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Both during the war, when farm yields increased by one-third, and after the war, when the Marshall Plan expanded food aid to Europe, agriculture red as a form of civic and even military service in the United States.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> The government instructed farmers, for example, to “view their farms as factories” analogous to the nation’s war plants.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Similarly, government propaganda encouraged consumers to view eating as a political duty, publicizing compulsory ration programs and voluntary conservation campaigns as essential to an Allied victory. In contrast to much more stringent forms of food restriction in Europe and Asia, however, the U.S. could also promote its agricultural reserves, and American middle-class consumers continued throughout the war to eat relatively well; to cite the war’s first director of rationing, John Kenneth Galbraith: “Never in the long history of human combat have so many talked so much about sacrifice with so little deprivation as in the United States in World War II.”<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  In December 1942, as part of the “Victory Program” that allowed President Roosevelt to reorganize government bureaucracies, OWI Director Elmer Davis delivered a national radio address to explain a new points rationing program.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Overseen by Agriculture Secretary Claude Wickard and administered by the Office of Price Administration (OPA), the program expanded the number of rationed goods while also enacting a points system to allow consumers greater flexibility in purchasing any particular food or other rationed good. Rationing of sugar, coffee, tires, steel, and gasoline had begun earlier in the year and, in the case of gasoline especially, had already spurred black markets.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> The new program, Davis announced, would restrict more goods but would ensure an equitable distribution of commodities that were either scarce or required for war operations. The speech does not detail which foodstuffs would fall under the points system; rather, it aims to bolster public opinion of the underlying rationale for rationing and, by extension, the U.S. declaration of war.
	</p>
<p>
	  While Davis argues for solidarity with the U.K. in the war against Germany, Italy, and Japan, he also distinguishes between the deprivation of Europe and the prosperity of the United States. The speech censures both critics and skeptics who perceive rationing as a program to deprive citizens of daily nourishment in order to feed foreign populations. In response to this criticism, Davis argues that rationing functions to manage the United States’ food surpluses, feeding Americans while also providing for the national military and its allies. Davis thus suggests that, at home, Americans will continue to eat well, while the United States will provide international food relief out of its agricultural surpluses; he concludes this section of his address by ring the nation as the perennial land of plenty: “We all eat food; and whatever sacrifices we may have to make to take care of the needs of our ting men, the American people will continue to be better fed than any other nation on earth.”<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  In this and related propaganda, the Office of War Information repeatedly distinguishes the economic condition of the United States from that of its allies as well as its enemies. After stressing the alimentary needs of Europe, Davis goes on to contrast the politics of food in the United States and Germany:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    Food is a weapon in all wars, but in this one more than usual. The enemy has used it as a weapon, negatively—looting the conquered people of their food supply, and giving back to them just enough to keep them alive—indeed not always even that much; hoping to break their spirit. . . . We are using our food supply as a weapon, positively; so distributing it that the American army and navy, and the American people, will be well nourished; yes, and so that the armies of our allies will be kept strong.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  This passage obliquely references the Nazi’s coordinated programs of land seizures and stringent rationing in occupied countries.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> In contrast to these brutal tactics, Davis proclaims, the United States upholds an egalitarian system of food production and distribution, “using [its] food supply as a weapon, positively” to nourish the armies that will defeat Germany and Japan while nourishing the home front especially well. Nonetheless, he concludes, “food is a weapon that we have more of than anybody else; but that doesn’t mean that we can afford to waste it.” Davis’s rhetoric is paratactic and declarative, organized around stark comparisons that link the pastoral tropes of U.S. abundance with the procedures of democracy; rationing, he implies, does not represent an infringement on consumer-citizen liberties but rather upholds the democratic principle of cooperation. This syllogism relies on the idea of an American middle class as it solidified in the period—the idea, satirized in Niedecker’s poem, that the national body is comprised of individuals who work, play, and consume alike.
	</p>
<p>
	  The interwar experience of the Great Depression seems to haunt this rhetoric of rationing. In his recent study of New Deal modernism, Michael Szalay describes the cultural anxieties that justified new forms of economic planning and government control in the thirties: “The Depression was occasioned, many believed . . . because the American public either did not or could not purchase the goods churned out by American industry.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> In response to this problem of overproduction, the New Deal aimed not just to redress unemployment and poverty but to ameliorate “the displacing conditions of modern life in a rapidly evolving capitalist society.”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> The rhetoric of ration compliance during the Second World War reinforced the underlying paradigm of the New Deal according to which the government would manage the economy to ensure social and economic equality: in the words of the ration campaign’s tagline, “produce and conserve, share and play fair.” (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>) During the war, the government contracted with over twenty-four artist associations representing a total of 8,000 artists––the socalled “Artists for Victory”––to produce such posters. Many of the artists employed the international style of modernism to frame the government’s nationalist discourses. The “play fair” poster, for example, uses the geometrical designs of second-generation modernists like Piet Mondrian; the poster’s form thus augments the cultural capital of seemingly pedestrian consumer habits. At the same time, the War Food Administration deployed this poster campaign to discipline women as guardians of the national food supply by entreating them to take the “Home Front Pledge,” a campaign that Niedecker’s 1950 poem res as an undue burden on working women.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> According to the logic of the Pledge, the housewife’s practices as a food consumer position her on the frontlines of the domestic war effort.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	  These rationing campaigns echo Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s 1941 pronouncement that U.S. support of the war would culminate in a worldwide middle-class. In his famous “Four Freedoms” speech, Roosevelt vowed that an Allied victory would secure freedom from want for “every nation.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Ramón Saldívar clarifies the ideology underlying Roosevelt’s speech, arguing that “what is at stake in Roosevelt’s momentous pronouncement of a world order built on the groundwork of the Four Freedoms is nothing less than a renewed commitment to an ideal vision of a unified American nation working to effect that brave new world order.”<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Saldívar’s analysis allows us to theorize food rationing as a problem for “the pledges of American democracy” during the war.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> Occluding experiences of hunger both within and beyond the borders of the United States, the Four Freedoms discourse res the nation as free from discrimination, fear, and hunger, a nation, in other words, of plenty.
	</p>
<p>
	  While this formula of political democracy as alimentary abundance supported the U.S. government’s war campaign, in practice, rations drew into relief the inequities of class and race that allowed some citizens to consume much more than others. Although Davis’s 1942 address publicly promotes an egalitarian image of the war economy, a confidential OWI memo to radio station producers characterizes the risk of hoarding as serious and labels potential “chiselers” as traitors.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> In direct opposition to Davis’s public radio broadcast, the confidential memo maintains that, “We live no longer in a ‘land of plenty.’ . . . If we are to have ships, planes, guns and tanks . . . then we must skimp on sugar, gasoline, metals, rubber and other commodities.”<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Addressing the risk that unequal standards of living will lead to non-compliance, the memo directs radio producers to depict rationing as an organized system of sharing resources. This disjuncture between the public and private rhetoric of rationing underscores the fraught status of food during the war. In <span style="font-style:italic;">American Hungers</span>, Gavin Jones makes an elegant case for material poverty as a crucial but undertheorized category in U.S. literature and culture; he argues that the efforts to comprehend poverty’s “persistence” in the world’s most affluent nation have been “remarkably controversial aspects of American intellectual and social history, just as [they continue] to unsettle national ideologies and to disrupt conventional ways in which we think of class and cultural identity.”<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> During the Second World War, as the U.S. economy rebounded, the persistence of famine both within and outside of the United States troubled the entwined discourses of American democracy, prosperity, and humanitarianism. To quell social discontent about rationing in particular, and hence to maintain the nation’s agricultural surpluses, the government aimed to convince every citizen that he or she had plenty of food to eat, and the food supply thus came to define the national imaginary. At the same time, the international reliance on U.S. food yields increased dramatically during the war such that, by 1945, the United States was providing one-tenth of the world’s foodstuffs (<span style="font-style:italic;">PP</span>, 100). To address this global food demand, the postwar Truman administration incorporated substantial food relief provisions into the Marshall Plan. Despite negative public opinion in the U.S. on European and Asian food relief, those provisions ultimately solidified the position of the United States as a world food power, which in turn has been a key structural factor since 1945 in the nation’s wider political, economic, and cultural hegemony.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>
	  One might imagine that the political rhetoric of rationing and belt-tightening during the Second World War inhibited conspicuous displays of consumption and especially fine dining. Yet throughout the 1940s, affluent consumers patronized French restaurants in both New York and London. While in London those restaurants doubled as bomb shelters for their diners, they elicited considerable critique as spaces of what George Orwell called “luxury feeding,” spaces that sheltered upper-class Londoners from the material and military realities of the war. Notably, Orwell directs his 1942 critique of London gourmandise to an American audience, including it in one of his London Letters to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Partisan Review</span>: “at long last, and against much opposition in high places, the Ministry of Food is about to cut down ‘luxury feeding’ by limiting the sum of money that can be spent on a meal in a hotel or restaurant. Already, before the law is even passed, ways of evading it have been thought out, and these are discussed almost undisguisedly in the newspapers.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Orwell here exposes the political paradigm of rationing as shared sacrifice to satiric scrutiny, ring fine dining as an extralegal form of gluttony. By comparison with the London restaurant scene that persisted in the shadow of bombing raids, a thriving gourmet restaurant industry emerged in New York during the war. Chefs who had arrived in the United States for the 1939 World’s Fair in Flushing and then stayed on as refugees after the German invasion of Poland opened French restaurants or joined the staffs of established hotel dining rooms, providing decadent and often quasi-illegal meals to their urban patrons.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Against the backdrop of “luxury feeding,” on the one hand, and state-sponsored ration books and meal plans, on the other, the dissident voice of California-born food writer M. F. K. Fisher emerged. As seen throughout her early writings, Fisher attends not only to the traditions of gastronomy and French cuisine but also to the political and military uses of food after 1939. The status of eating as an antidote for and a signifier of war is nowhere more salient than in <span style="font-style:italic;">How to Cook a Wolf</span>, Fisher’s 1942 cookbook, revised in 1951 and republished in 1954, whose expressed aim is to enable culinary innovation in the rationed kitchens of the Second World War.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Most British and American cookbooks published in the period provide practical recipes to comply with ration programs;in sharp contrast, <span style="font-style:italic;">How to Cook a Wolf</span> intersperses recipes that are anything but practical with commentary on the politics of wartime gastronomy.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Max Rudin describes the book as a work of “culinary modernism,” but it is better described as an intervention in both culinary literature and literary high modernism.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> In <span style="font-style:italic;">How to Cook a Wolf</span>, Fisher inflects modernist forms––nonlinear narrative, montage, and irony for example––with journalistic commentary on overconsumption and government rations. The cookbook can be understood, moreover, as a late modernist work, in that Fisher’s use of these aesthetic forms rearticulates the conceptual commitments of Anglo-American modernism. More precisely, the cookbook arrests the mythological forms of history that define high modernism by redirecting modernist techniques to the material (and often banal) history of war rationing, middle-class appetites, and the agricultural industries that underlie them.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	  The culture of rationing and standardized cooking proved generative for Fisher’s 1942 cookbook, whose missive is an exposé of rationing as an instrument of state control that exacerbates social inequalities as well as wartime deprivations, which Fisher res as the “wolf at the door.”<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> Critical of the ideologies that motivate rationing in the United States, Fisher promotes a “creative economy” of cooking that might disrupt the nation’s economic, political, and military interests in the program. Her introduction, for example, critiques the OWI’s rhetoric that food production and consumption should serve the military’s war strategy. Against the government’s call to eat on behalf of the nation and its military-industrial complex, Fisher calls on her readers to eat selfishly: “Now, when the hideous necessity of the war machine takes steel and cotton and humanity, our own private personal secret mechanism must be stronger, for selfish comfort as well as for the good of the ideals we believe we believe in” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HCW</span>, 3–4). The directive redirects the government’s gendered rhetoric, which views food as a matter of national security and housewives as auxiliary soldiers, by encouraging readers to eat without regard to their ration cards. In a late chapter entitled “How not to be an earthworm,” Fisher uses a stark wit resonant with Niedecker’s tone in the 1945 and 1950 poems to reveal food rationing as a means not of symbolic civic service but rather of literal weapons production: “Since this country went to war, a great deal has been done to prepare us for emergencies (a polite word for bombings, invasions, and many other ugly things)” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HCW</span>, 184). The chapter goes on to trace this shifting meaning of emergency during the Second World War:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">

	    In the old days, before Stuka and blitz became part of even childish chitchat, every practical guide to cookery urged you to keep a well-filled emergency shelf in your kitchen or pantry.

	    Evoking the threat of a German or Japanese invasion on the U.S. mainland, Fisher here participates in war propaganda while also reframing its logic. The passage historicizes the Second World War as a period that ruptures gastronomical meanings of food by linking cooking to the operations and technologies of war. No longer can a cookbook use the term “emergency shelf” without evoking the fear of the blitz; thus, Fisher goes on to say, her cookbook will recommend emergency foods not to feed an unexpected neighbor but rather to survive potential blackouts, bombings, and invasions. Ironically, the foods Fisher recommends for such catastrophic emergencies are the very processed foods (unpalatable in her view) that the Second World War and its food rationing produced. Fisher observes that such mass-produced foods can be used to simulate home cuisine via a kind of “chicanery.” Dismissive of the affordability and convenience of processed foods, Fisher suggests that new food brands such as Hormel, Kraft, and Kellogg Cereal Company—whose products began to dominate store shelves during the 1940s—produce food suitable only for the war’s emergency conditions. Vanilla wafers, prepared soups, artificial and synthetic fats, and processed cheese will nourish her gourmet readers,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Fisher’s indicates by analogy, only in so far as the Hershey “Tropical Bar” will secure the basic survival of Allied soldiers in Japan and China.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    Against the uniform and often unpalatable prescripts of the government’s Food Nutrition Board, Fisher goes on to craft an avant-garde gastronomy whose methods recall that of the bricoleur. The recipes and techniques that appear throughout the cookbook encourage the reader to be “lavish” with whatever “odds and ends” that they can obtain. While the term lavish might resonate only with an elite class of home cooks, Fisher also promotes a technique of “dressing up” affordable ingredients. In one breakfast menu, for example, Fisher recommends toast “generously buttered”: “It can be piles of toast, generously buttered, and a bowl of honey or jam, and milk for Mortimer and coffee for you. You can be lavish because the meal is so inexpensive” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HCW</span>, 8). Butter, sweeteners, preserves, and coffee were all in short supply (or at least subject to rationing) in the U.S. at the time, and thus not necessarily inexpensive. In the British context, food writer Elizabeth David describes precisely such foods as rare luxuries and the food shortages in Britain as bleak. To offset the scarcity of certain ingredients, furthermore, David’s 1950 cookbook provides the names of specific food retailers in London, complete with addresses, where her local readers might find the rare ingredients that some of her recipes require.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> In contrast, Fisher provides little pragmatic advice for procuring rare ingredients (such as truffles, citrus fruit, and duck confit) when encouraging her readers to cook lavishly. Nonetheless, the meal described above remains one primarily of toast combined with a modest amount of more decadent ingredients that can be varied depending on the reader’s pantry and budget.
	  </p>
<p>
	    To develop the “creative economy” that <span style="font-style:italic;">How to Cook a Wolf</span> imagines, Fisher recommends an enormous range of cooking techniques. Her third chapter—“How to Distribute your Virtue”—assumes the form of montage, an almost incoherent collection of tactics and implements for home economics that combines the traditional and the modern, the technological and the rudimentary, the time-intensive and the laborsaving. One such catalogue of techniques for fuel conservation in the kitchen includes the rudimentary technique of steaming food in a haypacked box, a practice that Fisher describes just before referencing the technological convenience of a pressure cooker. As social historian Joy Parr’s research demonstrates, such kitchen technologies emerged at the intersection of modernist design and war economics.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> During the interwar years, modernist designers from Europe and the United States “gloried in the kitchen”; in the words of American designers Teague and Dreyfuss, “modernism in all its aspects would enter the whole dwelling through the kitchen door.” Promoting the end products of these modernist designers, consumer goods companies aggressively promoted the adoption of kitchen appliances in the thirties and forties, ring them as symbols of a “highly capitalized kitchen.”<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> When Fisher includes the haypacked box in her own model kitchen, then, she implicitly undercuts the modernist (or more aptly, futurist) ideology of technology adoption as a form of civic as well as consumer identity.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    Fisher moves from this critique of kitchen efficiency to a meditation on the importance of fresh vegetables, suggesting that inventive salads can offer an antidote to both ration cards and kitchen technologies by allowing the home cook to play with  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> both raw ingredients and culinary conventions. In the context of world war, one could argue that the call for playing with food smacks of escapism. How can a “fresh salad” of a “dozen tiny vegetables” be anything but trivial in the face of the war’s casualties and global famine conditions? And yet Fisher formulates food play as a powerful act of engagement that might counter, if only momentarily and microscopically, an ideology of eating in service of the war, which res in both Niedecker’s poetry and Fisher’s food writings as less a war against totalitarian regimes than a war on behalf of capitalism. If an earlier generation of high modernists and haute gourmands neglected domestic cuisine, Fisher imagines a kind of dissident home cuisine that resists both state food controls and “capitalized kitchens.” To counter these standardized yet unequal food systems, Fisher invents a model of foraging, improvising, and consuming the “resources you have.”<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    The earnestness of the book’s recipes remains in doubt, however. As Fisher expounds in chapter four, the war makes gourmet cooking and food writing untenable, and cookbooks, restaurant reviews, and gastronomical manifestos now function as imaginative literature rather than practical handbooks or class primers. By extension, the wartime readership of food writing has widened, providing “good escape-reading material in direct ration to the possibility of following [recipes] in our small kitchens and hurried hours” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HCW</span>, 29). The pun on ration is significant in this remark, suggesting that the government’s food shortages are in fact not egalitarian and that consumers will therefore respond to gourmet cookbooks as aesthetic, rather than pragmatic, artifacts in “direct ration” to their social situation. More modernist than pulp, Fisher here participates in the mid-century coterie of American and British reviewers, cookbook authors, and chefs: such res as James Beard, Nora Ephron, Sheila Hibben, and A. J. Liebling. Foodies <span style="font-style:italic;">avant la lettre</span>, these culinary arbiters articulate an urbane culture of fine cuisine. However, Fisher ultimately appears offbeat and unorthodox in the context of this culinary establishment. Somewhat akin to Niedecker, Fisher achieves a smaller readership and crafts a more modernist style than her peers, a “minorness” that affords her a kind of generic and political freedom. As a somewhat marginal and upstart member of the transatlantic food coterie, Fisher thus occupies a privileged position, from which she can produce food writing as an aesthetic as well as political form of literature. At times, Fisher promotes egregiously extravagant recipes, as for French consomé or red wine reduction, under the premise that either reading about or, if income allows, preparing such dishes will keep the wartime wolf’s “pungent breath” from knocking down the door. Against such proscriptions for indulgent consumption as a rejoinder to U.S. war rations, Fisher simultaneously addresses the transnational problems of hunger, poverty, and scarcity.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    The insistence on international experiences of the war accompanies an implicit critique in <span style="font-style:italic;">How to Cook a Wolf</span> of the privileged economic position of the United States. One of the longest sections in the book—“How to Carve the Wolf”—laments that North Americans rely so heavily on meat for bodily fuel. Fisher suggests that this dependency borders on a consumer obsession, an obsession laid bare by the relatively minimal restriction of meat sales during the war. Despite the rhetoric of stringent food  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> control on the part of the OWI and the War Food Board, the actual practice of meat consumption, as Fisher describes it, subverts the governmental rationing discourse. As food historian Harvey Levenstein corroborates, U.S. meat restrictions began with a voluntary “Share the Meat” campaign in 1942 that morphed into a 2½lb weekly meat ration per capita the following year, a ration that was more than two times that of the British ration and almost ten times that of other European meat rations.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> Niedecker turns this transatlantic food divide into the subject of one of her 1945 poems, which depicts the hunger of French citizens during the Second World War by parodying a Vichy official, who chastises the people to “eat your beef-ounce from a doll’s platter / you’ll think it’s a roast wrapped in butter” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LN</span>, 119). This odd dramatic monologue clarifies Niedecker’s synthesis, to cite Rachel Blau DePlessis’s term, of imagist and surrealist poetics.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> In particular, the lines call attention to the physical and psychic effects of European food rations by positioning an everyday commodity (in this case, a one-ounce portion of beef) against a strange and even fantastic image (i.e., the “doll’s platter”). Through the attendant tonal shift from the mundane to the macabre, the poem thus makes the quotidian experience of meat shortages outside the United States a provocative signifier of war suffering.
	  </p>
<p>
	    In contrast to the dearth of meat in the global diet, meat remained not only central to American food culture but achieved the status of a de facto political right. When the government provided advance announcement of protein rations in 1943, for example, a “hoarding frenzy” emptied grocery stores of canned meats and fish (<span style="font-style:italic;">PP</span>, 80–81). The public demand for meat was so high, in fact, that a 1943 announcement of meat rationing provoked riots and looting: in Cleveland, 50,000 people assembled to demand meat from grocers, while in New York City, 2,000 butchers marched on the wholesale meat market district (<span style="font-style:italic;">PP</span>, 83). In the 1951 version of the chapter “How to Carve the Wolf,” Fisher alludes to the relatively large size of the U.S. protein ration during the war as well as the subsequent postwar meat glut. Considered in tandem, two passages, the first published in the 1942 edition and the second added to the 1951 edition, connect everyday appetites for meat to wartime food policy and to the wider U.S. military-industrial complex. In the first passage, Fisher undercuts her earlier lamentations on meat scarcity (and the challenges it poses to home cooks) with a satirical allusion to the “zub zub zub” of media hype about potential meat shortages. Fisher suggests that the media only exacerbates the cycle of overproduction and overconsumption of meat in the United States:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	      There are several more or less logical reasons why meat grows scarce in wartime: soldiers need it, there are fewer cattle, zub zub zub. It is unfortunate that so many human beings depend on eating some form of animal flesh every day for strength. Many of them do it because their bodies, weakened or diseased demand it. Others simply have the habit. Habit or necessity, it becomes a truly worrisome expense in wartime, so that money spent for meat must be used to buy as much nourishment as possible, even at the risk of a certain monotony.

<p class="continued">
		Fisher’s use of the phrase “more or less” gives pause. The phrase questions the official rationale for food control in the United States from 1942 until 1945, suggesting that the federal government’s argument that rations function to prevent scarcity and to curtail war-related shortages is misleading. To Fisher’s point, U.S. ration programs functioned less to redress food shortages in the United States than to divert certain foodstuffs for weapons and supplies production, to expand European lend-lease contracts, and to encourage civilian allegiance to the war. These material and symbolic objectives do not square, moreover, with the persistent surplus in the U.S. of staple crops and meat products, a surplus that made consumer runs on foods possible when rumors of potential shortages circulated. To this point, Fisher’s phrase “zub zub zub” mimics the media buzz that inflamed public fears in the U.S. of meat shortages, which, in turn, prompted urban meat riots. While Fisher does not directly reference the riots, her distinction between necessary and habitual meat consumption infers it.
	      </p>
<p>
		The second passage, which provides a recipe for calf’s head, further satirizes the meat gluttony that Fisher observes to be a defining characteristic of U.S. consumer culture at mid-century. The first portion of this passage mocks white Americans’ distaste for offal, the form of meat that was most readily available and least expensive during the war. In the conclusion to the passage (shown in brackets as an addition to the 1951 version), Fisher supplements the original recipe with a critique of the postwar explosion in both beef and pork consumption:
	      </p>

<p class="continued">
		  As suggested by contemporaneous newspaper headlines, the government’s promotion of offal and ground meat upset the middle-class Anglo-American palate, at least as white writers and food critics defined it. One such headline—“Tongue Vegetable Casserole Stretches Meat Allowance”—describes the coordinated effort of nutritionists, food writers, and government bureaucracies to encourage middle-class white families to consume “undesirable” cuts of meat.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> Yet those same consumer groups resisted this alimentary prescription, revealing the class bias and racial stereotypes informing their distaste for offal. In this context, Fisher’s 1951 allusion to a suburban “Mid-South Peoria Muezzins’ Jamboree and Ham-bake” caricatures the steadfast allegiance of white middle-class and affluent Americans to a “meat-and-potatoes” diet, correlating that diet to the food culture of potlucks and buffets. In sharp contrast to a culture of overconsumption, Fisher reflects, other populations within and outside of the United States experienced the war and its immediate aftermath as a period of sustained malnourishment. In juxtaposing suburban buffets and global famine conditions, Fisher employs her cookbook to make manifest the stratified structure of the domestic  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and international food economies that the war years further stratified. To this point, Fisher’s chapter on starches—“How to Pray for Peace”—characterizes the potato as the principal food of impoverished and displaced victims of the war: “It is easy to think of potatoes, and fortunately for men who do have not much money it is easy to think of them with a certain safety. Potatoes are one of the last things to disappear, in times of war, which is probably why they should not be forgotten in times of peace” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HCW</span>, 123). Fisher alludes here to the infamous Irish potato famine and, by extension, to the scarcity of everything but root vegetables in Europe during the Second World War. More importantly perhaps, she reminds her readers that scarcity and deprivation are highly contingent experiences.

		  While the program of standardizing and rationing the national cuisine to provide for each citizen’s nutrition purported to fulfill President Roosevelt’s political promise to end want during the war, <span style="font-style:italic;">How to Cook a Wolf</span> suggests that state food controls failed to resolve the fundamental social inequities of hunger. Fisher’s late modernist cookbook further demonstrates that an evidently innocuous prescription—to “share alike” and eat a “balanced” diet—obfuscates the structural imbalance of the global food chain during the war. Critiquing food conservation, food aid, and national cuisine as a sign of the war’s shared sacrifices, Fisher catalogues the voracious appetites of American consumers to imagine everyday acts of eating as indicators of U.S. world power.

<h1 class="sec-headA">British Austerity and American Food Power</h1>
<p>
		  In stark contrast to U.S. food rationing, the postwar Labour government in Britain imposed draconian restrictions on bread consumption, a controversial scheme that contributed substantially to the Labour Party’s political defeat in 1951.<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> As the recurring image of dry, dark rationed bread in George Orwell’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Nineteen Eighty-Four</span> indicates, postwar wheat shortages prompted fears that both the war and the austerity of wartime government control would never end.<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> A 1946 League of Nations report reveals, moreover, that European leaders implicitly blamed the United States for apparently interminable famine conditions.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> The international appeal to the U.S. for grain exports and food relief routinely made headlines, and as a result, the issue of food scarcity featured prominently in President Truman’s 1946 appeal to American consumers, ranchers, and farmers for grain and meat conservation. While the food relief programs built into the Marshall Plan expanded U.S. food exports and, thus, economic power, consumers in the United States continued to eat more food than any other country per capita. To take up Fisher’s concluding point in <span style="font-style:italic;">How to Cook a Wolf</span>, although the United States claimed that its population made tremendous food sacrifices during the Second World War, those sacrifices appear relatively scant when placed in a transnational context.<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>
		  Tony Judt, in his recent history of postwar Europe, describes the condition of Britian’s food supply during and after the war as profoundly austere: “everything was rationed, restricted, controlled. . . . This was the age of austerity.”<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> While a brief economic recovery occurred in Britain and elsewhere in Europe just before September 1939,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the continent never really emerged from the depression of the early 1930s. The key markers of that depression during the war were the ration card and the long queues for food.<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> While the British government, akin to the United States, depicted food shortages as universally shared, working-class citizens experienced shortages the most acutely. As Orwell writes in his August 1941 letter to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Partisan Review</span>, “there is no real food shortage” in Britain for the middle class because “the lack of concentrated foods (meat, bacon, cheese and eggs) cause serious underfeeding among heavy labourers, such as miners who have to eat their midday meal away from home.”<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a> Nonetheless, British propaganda emphasized the need for citizens not just to “share alike,” as in the U.S., but also to suffer on behalf of the nation. Austerity rather than conservation thus characterizes the discourse of rationing in Britain.<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> The disparity between British and American food culture in the 1940s and early 1950s provides an unexamined context for the transatlantic study of both late modernism and food writing, a point made particularly salient in Elizabeth David’s 1950 <span style="font-style:italic;">Book of Mediterranean Food</span>. The endurance of austerity programs and food shortages in Britain after the war inspired David’s cookbook, which took shape from recipes that she had been collecting while living abroad during the war. The project functioned for David and her imagined readers as a rejoinder to the gastronomical wasteland she encountered in postwar London. As David explains in letters, this return to London was, above all, a return to “the awful, dreary foods of rationing.” The “bleak” homecoming provoked the gourmet David to cook more rather than less, making “the most out of rationed ingredients, ignoring the powdered and dehydrated foods to which the English had become conditioned” and “scour[ing] Soho” to search out “lemons, olives oil, [and] bootleg butter.”<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>
		  Composed in London between 1947 and 1950, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Book of Mediterranean Food</span> is as much an artifact of the Second World War as a postwar cookbook, a culinary tract that emerged from the peculiar forms of migration and paramilitary service afforded to Anglo-American intellectuals in the late 1930s and early 1940s as well as from Britain’s particular imperial interests in the war. As Judt clarifies those interests, Britain’s dual status as an Allied power and the reigning imperial nation required enormous economic and military expenditure: “the only way for the country to pay its way in these overstretched circumstances was for the British to impose on themselves unprecedented conditions of restraint and voluntary penury.”<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> For Britain, rationing signified a sacrifice made not only to win the war but also to maintain the empire, and the pride that many citizens expressed about wartime austerity measures—or rather, that the Ministries of Food and Finance expressed on their behalf—reveals how essential not only German defeat but also imperial possession were to British national identity.<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a> While David experienced those austerity programs belatedly, she had worked, during the war, directly in the service of the British Empire. Following an inverse trajectory from Fisher’s wartime return to the United States from Europe, David migrated further and further south in the years between 1939 and 1947—from Marseille and Antibes to Athens, Corsica, and the Greek Island of Syros to Alexandria and, finally, New Delhi—each move prompted by the advances of the German and Italian armies. While the original intent of these travels was personal (a combination of romance and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> food tourism), David’s holiday morphed into a form of civil service: in Alexandria, she worked as a staffer for the British Admiralty and befriended the writer Lawrence Durrell; in Cairo she served as a researcher for the British Ministry of Information; and she moved finally to New Delhi to join her then-husband, an administrator for the British Commander-in-Chief of Middle East operations.<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>
		  The literary and culinary product of this period, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Book of Mediterranean Food</span> reflects, even more so than <span style="font-style:italic;">How to Cook a Wolf</span>, a transnational gastronomy. In prefaces to the book’s four principal editions, David contrasts the monotonous rations of postwar Britain with the vibrant cuisines of North Africa and India, which she had enjoyed throughout the war. The book thus takes the form of a gastronomical war memorial, recording foods that are “no more than exotic memories” in postwar London. In “those icy, hungry weeks” of 1947, when severe winter storms exacerbated food shortages and famine conditions, David “took refuge from reality in writing down memories of the food I had cooked and eaten during my Mediterranean years.” David thus enacts a form of food exoticism, even as the book constructs an unconventional model of Mediterranean food that de-centers French provincial cooking in favor of Greek, Turkish, Moroccan, Italian, and Spanish cuisines.<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> In relationship to the British Empire and to David’s imperial service, the cookbook constructs a faulty map of the war’s political blocs. Put differently, David’s cross-cultural guide to Mediterranean food—an Anglo- American category for cuisines that cut across Southern Europe and North Africa— diverts readers’ awareness of the political structure that undergirds both the British Commonwealth and the Allied bloc. In other words, David gives her readers the food of Italy and Morocco rather than of Egypt and India, the colonial locales where she concluded her own wartime service.

<p>
		  In his seminal 1988 essay, Jameson theorizes the cultural underpinnings of British imperialism (and the system of global capitalism that the empire both produced and ultimately gave way to):
		</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		    In Colonialism, a significant structural segment of the economic system as a whole is now located elsewhere, beyond the metropolis, outside the daily life and existential experience of the home country, in colonies over the water whose own life experience and life world— very different from that of the imperial power—remains unknown and unimaginable for the subjects of the imperial power, whatever social class they may belong to.<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		  Using <span style="font-style:italic;">Howards End</span> as a case study, Jameson argues that Britain’s modern form of empire produces a geographic “totality” in which citizens are intimately linked as consumers and producers and yet utterly remote from one another politically and psychically, a social map that no one person can read or comprehend in its entirety. In response to such geographic dissonance, Jameson argues, modernism adopts mapping as its formal procedure, a kind of compulsion to solve the intractable geopolitics of imperial capitalism.<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a> In <span style="font-style:italic;">A Book of Mediterranean Food</span>, this modernist procedure is patently at work. From the vantage point of postwar London, David attempts to map the Mediterranean region through the geographically eclectic composition of her recipes. Yet this culinary geography ultimately displaces and stands in for the discontinuous  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> boundaries of the British Empire, which in turn underwrite David’s status as a world food traveler. In place of the imperial map of the United Kingdom, then, David offers a guide to Mediterranean food. In contrast to Fisher’s gourmet send-up of war rationing, which proceeds by mapping the discontinuous yet interdependent structure of the U.S. and European war economies, David deploys a kind of culinary nostalgia that preserves the fuzzy picture of Britain’s imperial interests in the war. While <span style="font-style:italic;">A Book of Mediterranean Food</span> emerges similarly to <span style="font-style:italic;">How to Cook a Wolf</span> from the experience of war rationing, then, its sentimental catalogue of “rich,” pan-Mediterranean foods distracts readers not just from the experience of, but also the political and economic reasons for, British austerity.

		  In the second act of <span style="font-style:italic;">Waiting for Godot</span>, upon the re-entrance of Pozzo and Lucky, it becomes clear that Vladimir alone can remember the prior day, or rather the prior act, whose temporal relation to the second proves indeterminate. Vexed by Vladimir’s insistence that the two couples have already met, Pozzo launches into an extended complaint on the constraints of time and the human burden to parse days, while Estragon simply dozes off.

		  Lois Gordon, integrating philosophical and psychoanalytic approaches to Beckett’s drama, interprets such impasses as consequences of <span style="font-style:italic;">Waiting for Godot’s</span> existential “paradox of survival.”<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> In the absence of verifiable facts, new information, or the will to leave this spot, Beckett’s characters proceed through the behavioral force of “habit.” This “note of uncertainty,” Hugh Kenner argues, “plagues the whole Beckett cosmos, where the reliability of a witness is always open to question.”<a name="f65-text" href="#f65"><sup>65</sup></a> Jameson has rearticulated this argument about the play’s existential uncertainty and the absurd forms of repetitive action it generates, citing Beckett as an exemplar of late modernist bids for aesthetic autonomy. In Beckett’s case, Jameson writes, dramatic minimalism excludes referential and historical content through the “mechanism” of the “incomplete sentence”: “a kind of aphasia in which the syntactic conclusion, known in advance, does not have to be given” (<span style="font-style:italic;">SM</span>, 200–201, 205). The analogy of aphasia is provocative, extrapolating Lucky’s mostly mute part to the play itself, theorizing <span style="font-style:italic;">Waiting for Godot</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> as a form of drama that refuses not just logical dialogue or motivated action but the audience’s comprehension.

		  While compelling as descriptions of the play’s form, this trajectory in Beckett criticism continues to ignore not so much the play’s “referential content” as the materiality of its theatrical world. In these accounts of <span style="font-style:italic;">Waiting for Godot</span>, the interpretation eclipses the thing itself, the live play with its five actors, single tree, many props, and fallow country setting. Attentive to those material artifacts in the text and on the stage, we can reframe the play as one in which performed despair and formal scarcity are products not of any existential situation but of the particular conditions of a post-atomic world in which, according to the play’s dramatic situation, only one out of five people has enough to eat. Vladimir’s above monologue demonstrates that the intractable uncertainty about what happened yesterday and what tomorrow will bring coexists with the ineluctable deprivations of this particular present. As elsewhere in the play, the stage directions undercut Vladimir’s philosophical ruminations, insisting on Estragon’s struggle for basic physical comfort. Thus, to Vladimir’s rhetorical question, “in all that what truth will there be?”, the stage directions respond: “<span style="font-style:italic;">Estragon, having struggled with his boots in vain, is dozing off again. Vladimir looks at him</span>.” The cue to action invites the audience to look with Vladimir at Estragon and his tattered, ill-sized, stinking boots rather than to meditate further on the problem of relativity. Vladimir picks up his train of thought with the grandiose assertion that tomorrow, when Estragon wakes, “He’ll know nothing,” an assertion that the opening of Act Two has already verified. Yet again, the philosophical statement falls flat when Vladimir goes on to enumerate the particular suffering that will most certainly befall Gogo once more: “He’ll tell me about the blows he received and I’ll give him a carrot.” The choreographed pause that follows this line is significant, inviting us to pause on the most banal of props in the play—the carrot—before pursuing Didi’s aphoristic speech on the human condition as “astride of a grave and a difficult birth” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WG</span>, 104–105).
		</p>
<p>
		  While “habit is a great deadener,” the recursive actions that propel the play are enacted, at least in the case of Estragon, as if for the first time; nor do those recursions deaden the expression of physical pain, emotional despair, or abject fear that the couple experiences. “The air is full of our cries,” Vladimir says, and then proceeds again to pause (<span style="font-style:italic;">WG</span>, 105). The twin pauses in his monologue thus stress for the audience two evidently opposing forces in the play—Estragon’s appetite for carrots and the cries of the dead. I argue that we understand the proximity of these two pauses as central to the drama of <span style="font-style:italic;">Waiting for Godot</span> in that they correlate the bodily hunger of Estragon with the play’s repeated references to the dead of the Second World War and to the social hierarchies that the war failed to end.
		</p>
<p>
		  Jameson and Gordon both acknowledge the presence of such historical “externalities” in the play: in Jameson’s reading, those referents center on the “allegorical schema” that stages the “British Empire (Pozzo) in relationship to its colonies in general and Ireland in particular (Lucky),” while in Gordon’s, they center on allusions to the Holocaust (<span style="font-style:italic;">SM</span>, 200–201).<a name="f66-text" href="#f66"><sup>66</sup></a> However, these arguments take the form of asides, or concessions, about anomalous moments of historical signification that, as Jameson contends, Beckett’s  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> later work rejected entirely because of their capacity to rupture the play’s formal experiments. Regardless of Beckett’s original intent for or retrospective assessments of <span style="font-style:italic;">Waiting for Godot</span>, the play’s references to the Second World War are at once spare and insistent. At one point for example, without provocation or explanation, Vladimir looks out at the mound of dirt behind them and demands of Estragon, “where are all these corpses from?” During another discussion on the origin and burden of thought, Vladimir again draws Estragon’s attention to the spectral presence of corpses, as he “cries out” to Gogo, “A charnel-house! A charnel house!” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WG</span>, 71). In evoking the Jewish victims of the Holocaust, Didi’s interruption avers that we cannot think our way out of the horrors of the Second World War, just as it suggests that the human burden of abstract thought is not the greatest misery of all.
		</p>
<p>
		  While minimal, the social scaffolding of the play stems directly from these poignant evocations of the Second World War and the Holocaust. It would seem that in the play’s post-atomic landscape—which, despite the flowering of the lone tree between the play’s two acts, shows little sign of arable life—a social order persists that is at once feudal and totalitarian. By this account, Pozzo res as an exploitive landlord and a foil for Godot, whose power in turn might best be compared to Big Brother’s rule by fear and absence in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nineteen Eighty-Four</span>. While the play’s landscape is a dystopian one, carefully stripped of temporal and geographic setting, Beckett provides a cipher for the place in Vladimir’s memory of the Rhône Valley and the field work he once did harvesting grapes. We learn at the close of Act Two, for example, that Vladimir remembers harvesting grapes in the Rhône, a reference that recalls Beckett’s years during the Second World War serving the French Resistance and living in the southwest provincial town of Roussillon. Although Estragon remembers almost nothing about this shared history, and Vladimir forecloses the memory almost as soon as he recalls it (with the quip, “There’s no good harking back on that”), the allusion begs the question of how the time and place on stage before us compare to Didi’s remembered past of agricultural labor.<a name="f67-text" href="#f67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<p>
		  In addition to its fallow and violent characteristics, the setting of <span style="font-style:italic;">Waiting for Godot</span> (which Estragon insists on calling “Cackon County”) is both stratified and materialistic, a caricature perhaps of the postwar ideology of competition and prosperity. The possible reasons that Vladimir and Estragon continue to wait for Godot emerge early in the first act, when, after flirting with the option of hanging themselves, Didi and Gogo decide that they should at least wait to hear Godot’s “offer.”
		</p>
<p>
		  Beckett’s use of a term drawn from finance and real estate works analogously to Niedecker’s evocation of the “pull” required to succeed in the postwar and post-atomic American economy. The stakes of Vladimir and Estragon’s decision to wait are, in other words, material as well as existential in that Godot’s appearance might improve their status in this strange social order. As in Niedecker’s poem, the language when the pair reflects on whether to stay or go is colloquial and clichéd, the speech of businessmen rather than tramps:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		    Estragon: Don’t let’s do anything. It’s safer.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Vladimir: Let’s wait and see what he says.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Estragon: Who?
		  </p>
<p>
		    Vladimir: Godot.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Estragon: Good idea.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Vladimir: Let’s wait till we know exactly how we stand.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Estragon: On the other hand it might be better to strike the iron before it freezes. Vladimir: I’m curious to hear what he has to offer. Then we’ll take it or leave it.
		  </p>

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		    Continuing in this vein, the two speculate that Godot will likely consult his agents, correspondents, and bank accounts before providing them with an offer in response to their “vague supplication.” The humor in this exchange—the darkly comedic movement from the couple’s contemplated suicide and existential musings to Godot’s financial solvency—parodies postwar discourses of political negotiation and economic reconstruction. The parody recurs when Estragon attempts, in Act Two, to extract money from the helpless and now-blind Pozzo. In response to Pozzo’s proposition of one hundred francs, Estragon cries out, “It’s not enough,” to which Vladimir humorously retorts, “I wouldn’t go so far as that” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WG</span>, 92). As an explanation of Estragon’s hostility, we learn that the two are economically beholden to Pozzo, whose private land surrounds both them and the road.<a name="f68-text" href="#f68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>
<p>
		    Against this playful banter on matters financial, the play enacts, if mostly by inference, the material power that both Godot and Pozzo hold over Didi, Gogo, and Lucky. In response to Estragon’s inquiry as to where they “come in” in this world, Vladimir speculates, “on our hands and knees.” The re of speech leads Estragon to wonder if they have “no rights any more,” an evidently naïve comment that prompts Vladimir’s stifled laughter (laughter being “prohibited” now). The line seems particularly resonant with the economic and political regimes of postwar Europe as well as the loss of rights during the war under the Nazi and Vichy governments. As the play’s final discourse suggests, Vladimir and Estragon are powerless to move precisely because of their material and political dispossession vis-à-vis Godot (<span style="font-style:italic;">WG</span>, 107).
		  </p>
<p>
		    The particular vulnerability that the pair experiences with respect to food highlights the abject poverty that the two suffer, in stark contrast to Godot’s imagined luxuries. Composed during Beckett’s postwar “siege” of literary activity in Paris, the play thus dramatizes the ironies of the food economy in the critical years of 1946 to 1948, when rations persisted long after the war’s end. In one of many embraces, Gogo recoils from Didi, exclaiming that the latter stinks of garlic. In response to this absurd rejection, Didi replies, “it’s for the kidneys.” The retort provokes laughter, and in that laughter we sense the tragic irony of the exchange, for a man that cannot even furnish a carrot is unlikely to have meat (<span style="font-style:italic;">WG</span>, 15). One of the most poignant expressions of Didi’s powerlessness is his dearth of good food, which prevents him from fulfilling his companion’s constant cravings even as Estragon’s intense hunger seems, at this late date, only capable of demanding a carrot.
		  </p>
<p>
		    On the heels of their first extended discourse on Godot, Estragon “violently” exclaims to Didi, “I’m hungry!” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WG</span>, 15). The exclamation leads in turn to the play’s first discourse  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> on food. By staging the poverty of Beckett’s antiheroes, the comedic exchange reminds Beckett’s contemporary Parisian and London audiences of the famine conditions that continued and, in some regions, intensified after the war. Against Pozzo’s subsequent lunch of chicken and wine, Vladimir can only offer to Estragon one carrot and a handful of turnips, the latter of which he tries to pass off as carrots:
		  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		      Vladimir: Do you want a carrot?
		    </p>
<p>
		      Estragon: Is that all there is?
		    </p>
<p>
		      Vladimir: I might have some turnips.
		    </p>
<p>
		      Estragon: Give me a carrot. (Vladimir rummages in his pockets, takes out a turnip and gives it to Estragon who takes a bite out of it. Angrily.) It’s a turnip!
		    </p>
<p>
		      Vladimir: Oh pardon! I could have sworn it was a carrot. <span style="font-style:italic;">(He rummages again in his pockets, finds nothing but turnips.)</span> All that’s turnips. <span style="font-style:italic;">(He rummages.)</span> You must have eaten the last. <span style="font-style:italic;">(He rummages.)</span> Wait, I have it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(He brings out a carrot and gives it to Estragon.)</span> There dear fellow. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Estragon wipes the carrot on his sleeve and begins to eat it.)</span> Make it last, that’s the end of them.
		    </p>
<div class="attrib">
		      (<span style="font-style:italic;">WG</span>, 16)
		    </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		      In this scene, both the need to eat and the act of eating—much like Estragon’s discomfort with his boots or recollection of bruises—interrupts, defers, and makes comical Vladimir’s philosophical inquiries. The key word in this scene is “rummage”; an action that not only anticipates the sets of later plays like <span style="font-style:italic;">Endgame</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Happy Days</span>  but also recalls at once the dumpsters and the national canteens of the Second World War. Condemned to the cheapest and most plentiful output of agriculture in the 1940s—root vegetables—Estragon subsists on a monoculture of free (as in unrationed) food. At the same time, Didi warns Gogo that this carrot will be the “end of them,” affording it a special status. These banal habits of eating may not recur, the warning stresses, a warning that the second act realizes when Vladimir attempts to pass off a blackened radish for a carrot.
		    </p>
<p>
		      Immediately after this scene, Pozzo comes on stage for the first time along with Lucky, who is carrying a burdensome load that includes a stool, a heavy bag, a great coat, and a picnic basket (<span style="font-style:italic;">WG</span>, 18). Its contents—chicken and wine—would have been indicators of affluence in postwar Britain and France. Indeed, Pozzo’s bourgeois social position is signaled directly here, as, one imagines, these foods come either from his land or from the black market. The dissimilarity between Estragon’s and Pozzo’s meals is so stark as to border on a caricature of social disparities during the period, particularly when the latter man flaunts both his power and his satiation:
		    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
			Pozzo: . . . with your permission, I propose to dally with you a moment, before I venture any further. Basket! <span style="font-style:italic;">(Lucky advances, gives the basket, goes back to his place.)</span> The fresh air stimulates the jaded appetite. <span style="font-style:italic;">(He opens the basket, takes out a piece of chicken and a bottle of wine.)</span> Basket! <span style="font-style:italic;">(Lucky advances, picks up the basket and goes back to his place.)</span> Further! <span style="font-style:italic;">(Lucky takes a step back.)</span> He stinks. Happy days! <span style="font-style:italic;">(He drinks from the bottle, puts it down and begins to eat. Silence.)</span></p>
<div class="attrib">
			(<span style="font-style:italic;">WG</span>, 22)  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
			  While Pozzo eats in this scene, he throws his cleaned bones as waste onto the road. Much to Vladimir’s horror, Estragon feels emboldened to beg for the scraps, in response to which Pozzo demands that Estragon ask Lucky—“the carrier”—who would ordinarily have the opportunity to consume them. Faced with Lucky’s silence, Pozzo concedes the bones to Estragon who, again to Vladimir’s embarrassed pride, “<span style="font-style:italic;">makes a dart at the bones, picks them up and begins to gnaw them</span>” (<span style="font-style:italic;">WG</span>, 25). An extended scene, this sequence dramatizes Estragon’s hunger, a hunger that prompts him, as the uninhibited and irrational member of the couple, to gnaw on the bones left over from Pozzo’s luxury feeding, to cite Orwell again. While Pozzo dines on wine and chicken at his leisure, in other words, Estragon must scarf down scraps of meat.
			</p>
<p>
			  In tandem, the plays scenes of eating suggest how dire the experience of food shortages, scarce resources, and famine were for those who, like Didi and Gogo, had no money, no work, and no social power during or after the war. Against the discourses of shared sacrifice and fine dining that M. F. K. Fisher situates as pivotal to American food consumerism and that Niedecker res as smokescreens for national and global famine, <span style="font-style:italic;">Waiting for Godot</span> thus stages a potentially endless state of hunger as the war’s most dramatic legacy. In their respective representations of world famine and luxury eating, these late modernist texts each probe the power of food in the mid-century period. As a foil to Niedecker’s and Fisher’s respective satires of the inequities that wartime famine poignantly reveals, David’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Book of Mediterranean Food</span> aims to preserve rather than critique the culture of gourmandise. By comparison, <span style="font-style:italic;">Waiting for Godot</span> enacts a condition of deprivation that turns on the rift between Pozzo’s imperial mode of eating and Vladimir and Estragon’s abject hunger. A significant conceptual divide between austerity and what Orwell terms “luxury feeding” thus emerges in late modernist texts, one that confronts the consequences of world war in both the geopolitical contours and individual experiences of food.

			      In using the term “late modernism,” I follow critics such as Frederic Jameson, Marina MacKay, and Tyrus Miller who argue for a period of late modernism, which  includes the late works of modernist writers,  accounts for the persistence of modernist theory and practice after the Second  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> World War,  acknowledges transnational developments within modernism, and  unsettles the chronology of modernism and postmodernism, suggesting, at the very least, a third term.

			      The most noteworthy of these French restauranteurs were Henri Soulé and Pierre Franey. Franey worked his way up from a saucier to a chef in Soulé’s New York restaurant Le Pavillon.

			      “<span style="font-style:italic;">How to Cook a Wolf</span> was first published in 1942, when wartime shortages were at their worst. It was revised by the author in 1951 by the addition of copious marginal notes and footnotes and a special section of additional recipes.

			      Rudin contends that Fisher’s modernism inheres in her “freewheeling” combinations of French classical cooking (characterized as “sumptuous”) and American regional cuisines (marked by “improvisation”). Susan Derwin argues similarly that critics would do well to recognize Fisher as a literary writer. In an earlier article, David Lazard seconds both Rudin and Derwin that Fisher is a modernist writer who simply took gastronomy and food as her central topic. Max Rudin, “M. F. K. Fisher and the Consolations of Food,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Raritan Quarterly Review</span> 21:2 (Fall 2001), 131, David Lazard, “The Usable Past of M. F. K.

			    We might think here of the mythological histories that underlie high modernist texts such as Eliot’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, H.

			      During the war, Parr argues, Keynesian economic theory also fueled an ideology of “the highly capitalized kitchen.” As modernist designers translated their products for mass production after the Second World War, “the highly capitalized kitchen” affirmed “the affluence and thus superiority” of Western states, the imagined fulfillment, in other words, of Roosevelt’s third freedom.

			    Fisher is ambivalent about the convenience of canned goods, which were rationed during the war as a means of conserving tin for weapons production. In chapter four, Fisher champions can openers and tinned soups as an economical supplement to fresh foods, while in chapter five, she correlates the spread of “modern canning” to “those other two omnipresent realities, Death and Taxes” (<span style="font-style:italic;">HCW</span>, 45, 49).

		    On the whole, Americans consumed more rather than less food during the war in key categories, while British consumers, by comparison, consumed significantly less. Although meat consumption declined 19% in the U.K., it increased 8.9% in the U.S. between 1939 and 1944; similarly, fruit consumption fell by 30% in the UK, but increased by 5% in the U.S. Finally, sugar consumption fell by 31% in the UK but only by 24% in the U.S. (<span style="font-style:italic;">PP</span>, 84, and Lindberg, “Food, Relief and Famine,” 61).  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>

		    Government propaganda on the part of the Ministry of Food rallied civilians to make sacrifices to support the enormous war effort, stressing the “magnitude” of the war and encouraging pride in the sacrifices required. A February 1940 Gallup poll found that 51% of the nation agreed “that every person should buy as few goods as possible.” In reality, attitudes toward the rationing were mixed, and lower income citizens expressed discontent with the habits of upper-class citizens who dined at fine restaurants and took shelter in hotels throughout the blitz.

		      This “paradox” rewrites Camus’s “Myth of Sisyphus,” in which Sisyphus faces the choice of rolling a rock up a hill each day or leaving it, the only certainty being that the rock will always be there. According to this dilemma, one can get on day by day only by accepting life’s fundamental meaninglessness. In the case of <span style="font-style:italic;">Godot</span>, Gordon argues, the characters lack “defiance” about their lot and, thus, express despair about the very state of going on and getting by.

	She liked it. There was no heavy closeness of greasepaint, no scent of soiled and tawdry costumes which years before had revolted her behind the scenes of a musical comedy. This work was done in the clean mornings, the appurtenances seemed rich and gorgeous and new. On a set that was joyous with Manchu hangings a perfect Chinaman was going through a scene according to megaphone directions as a great glittering machine ground out its ancient moral tale for the edification of the national mind.

	—F. Scott Fitzgerald, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Beautiful and the Damned</span> <a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a>

</blockquote>
<p>
	  Gloria Patch, Fitzgerald’s ambivalent heroine of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Beautiful and the Damned</span>, is hoping, in vain, for a career in film at the time of her visit to the movie set. It may very well be that Gloria likes the set for the wrong reasons—her reaction seems to qualify her for the role of the consumer rather than producer of images. Her fascination with the “glittering machine” of movie-making mirrors the fascination expressed by people the world over at the time—it is the smoothly running mechanism that attracts her, the world in which the chaos and clutter of everyday reality has been converted and aestheticized into a perfect arrangement—a dream factory.
	</p>
<p>
	  The splendor of this dream is conveyed by means of a Chinese setting in Fitzgerald’s scene, and his choice of subject matter and site is in keeping with the film industry of the day.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Chinese themes, and in particular Chinatown scenarios, were hugely fashionable in the film industry of the 1910s and 1920s, and their popularity survived the silent-era film industry’s move from the east coast to California. This popularity had to do with the Chinese presence in the United States, with fears related to immigration, overseas expansion, the international labor market, and the ensuing processes of cultural diversification, as numerous critics have pointed out.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> But the vignette from Fitzgerald’s novel may serve as a reminder that the anxieties and apprehensions about the Chinese and about Chinese America in the first third of the twentieth century were mixed with desire and fascination—that the logic of orientalism is as much about attraction as it is about repulsion.
	</p>
<p>
	  Most of the critical work devoted to early Chinatown films has focused on the fact that these urban enclaves are generally represented as cauldrons of crime and perversion. Opium dens, brothels, joss houses, and dark alleys are made out as the classical sites of the genre, while the films’ Chinese protagonists are hatchet men and opium addicts, slave traders, and corrupt tong bosses. But there is one standard setting with its stock res, which has gained far less critical attention, even though it was just as popular as the above repertory: the Chinatown antique or curio shop, with the Chinese merchant or storekeeper as its central occupant. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Social Buccaneer</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">Mystic Faces</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">The City of Dim Faces</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">A Tale of Two Worlds</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">The First Born</span> , to name just a few examples, all revolve around the Chinese store. This is not to say that the stereotypical Chinatown of vice and depravity does not come into view in these silent-era films—it does, and quite starkly so—but it is mixed up with comparatively neutral imageries of economic exchange, consumption, exotic display, and cultural contact. In what follows I would like to reflect upon the function of commercial sites and scenarios of consumption in the Chinatown film, the function of themes, that is, that are less fraught with immediately negative associations than the settings which have attracted most scholarly attention.
	</p>
<p>
	  Up to now, commercial themes and sites have largely interested critics working on so-called art films of the period, such as Cecil B. DeMille’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Cheat</span>  or D. W. Griffith’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span> . Here, the topic has been approached against the backdrop of melodrama studies and with a view to the function of filmic mise-en-scène. <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span> will also be central to my analysis, but by setting it into a slightly different context I hope to bring to light some implications of its aesthetics and ideology that have not been discussed before.
	</p>
<p>
	  Where does this fascination with commercial sites and commodity culture in the Chinatown film come from? In the very first place, the choice of site and character reflects the historical fact that during the time of Chinese Exclusion (1882–1943), merchants were one of the few professional groups exempt from the immigration restrictions.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> In addition, the 1910s and 1920s were a period in which an American consumer culture consolidated and diversified.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Yet the Chinatown film is not exactly known as a paragon of social realism, so there is clearly more to this focus and theme than its putative correspondence to real-life conditions. A detailed reading of the films  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> might help to get a grip on the function of images of consumption in this context. Before I turn to the films, however, I will map out a context for this reading, by focusing on two quite different ways of visualizing and evaluating the logic of commerce and consumption at the turn of the twentieth century: the re of the ornament and the idea of decadence. Significantly enough, both concepts, as different as they are, are closely, if indirectly, connected to the discourses of orientalism.
	</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Ornamentalization</h1>
<p>
	    The antique or curio store is a site which in its very function epitomizes the aesthetic dimensions of commerce. It encourages the indulgence in exotic splendor, lavish decoration, and luxurious excess, epitomizing the kind of self-serving, dysfunctional spectacle which caught the eye of Fitzgerald’s protagonist in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Beautiful and the Damned</span>. Silent-era Chinatown films are stuffed with exotic things; Chinese objects or ornaments often form a central point of reference for the plot or even the title of such films (for example, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sable Lorcha</span> [1915], <span style="font-style:italic;">The Forbidden Box</span> [1919], <span style="font-style:italic;">Mandarin’s Gold</span> [1919], <span style="font-style:italic;">The Purple Cipher</span> [1920], and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Scarlet Dragon</span> [1920]), often seeming to stand in for Chinese people—signifying Chineseness, as it were. In the vignette from Fitzgerald’s novel, the gorgeous “Manchu hanging” comes into view before the “perfect Chinaman” meets the eye, and as a consequence the Chinese decorative object and the Chinese person seem to form a pleasurable entity—embodying the joyful experience of smooth interaction which forms the core impression of the scene. This logic of a concatenation of things and beings has been characterized as a more pervasive phenomenon in the cultural scene of the early twentieth century. For Siegfried Kracauer, the principle of reification, exemplarily expressed in the re of the “mass ornament,” evolves as a central element of a global aesthetics of capitalist production:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      A change in taste has been taking place quietly in the field of physical culture . . . . It began with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tiller Girls</span>. These products of American “distraction factories” are no longer individual girls, but indissoluble female units whose movements are mathematical demonstrations. Even as they crystallize into patterns in the revues of Berlin, performances of the same exactitude are occurring in similarly packed stadiums in Australia and India, not to mention America. Through weekly newsreels in movie houses they have managed to reach even the tiniest villages. One glance at the screen reveals that the ornament consists of thousands of bodies, sexless bodies in bathing suits. The regularity of the patterns is acclaimed by the masses, who themselves are arranged in row upon ordered row.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    These observations, which open Kracauer’s 1927 essay “The Mass Ornament,” bring to the fore how the differences between the living body and the lifeless arrangement, subject and object, are being systematically dissolved in the world of popular media and entertainment. Ornaments are purely formal arrangements—superficial, intricate, dazzling res, which are pleasing and puzzling to the eye, yet hard to “read,” since at least in their modernist variation they do not rely upon an overarching authoritative semiotic system.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	    Kracauer’s observations could be complemented with another diagnosis of the ornamental (or, as this author has it, “hieroglyphic”) aesthetic of modern mass culture, a diagnosis which explicitly (and exclusively) relates its subject matter to film. In 1922, Vachel Lindsay published the second, revised edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Art of the Moving Picture</span>, a study in which he reflects upon the same developments which Kracauer discusses, yet comes to different conclusions than his Marxist contemporary. In the movies, according to Lindsay, “while the actors tend to become types and hieroglyphics and dolls, on the other hand, the dolls and hieroglyphics and mechanisms tend to become human.”<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Lindsay thus brings to the fore a reciprocity of the process of ornamentalization (or hieroglyphic transration) which was not foregrounded in Kracauer.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The early filmic depictions of Chinatown, I shall argue, exemplify the process that Kracauer and Lindsay trace. Time and again, in these films, things and people merge into ambiguous arrangements, with people being displayed like things and things taking on a considerable degree of agency. In addition, the very boundaries between things and people are constantly called into doubt. In what follows, I draw attention to the <span style="font-style:italic;">processes</span> of ornamentalization, to the techniques and strategies which are used to turn ordinary beings and things into exotic ornamental arrangements. My understanding of the “ornament” thus deviates from Kracauer’s model in that it pays more attention to the ornamentalization of individual bodies or characters. In contrast to Kracauer, I am less interested in an exploration of general principles of reification or alienation, but in the aesthetic and ideological effect which this principle may have on a more singular level.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> On these grounds, Lindsay’s approach is closer to my own. After all, modernist ornamentalization might involve a general “draining” of reference, but it never discards the referential function altogether—the <span style="font-style:italic;">Tiller Girl</span> display evoked by Kracauer would not work if the ornamental form effectively effaced the individual bodies (or “units,” in Kracauer’s vocabulary) that constitute it.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The processes of ornamentalization are intricately connected to the emerging urban realities of the early twentieth century.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> The Chinatown presents a particularly fraught version of modern urbanity in its conration of periphery and center, inclusion and exclusion, West and East. Seen in this way, filmic Chinatowns constitute an exemplary instance of the negotiations of modernity, ring a paradigmatically modern space that corresponds with the “hyperstimulus of the modern metropolis,” which Ben Singer designates as a characteristic feature of modernity in the early twentieth century.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> In this, the filmic sites resemble their real-life counterparts, even though real and filmic Chinatowns have otherwise little in common.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    In addition, ornamentalization may be associated with the very unfolding of a filmic aesthetics at the outset of the twentieth century, an aesthetics which hovers uneasily between representation (of an extra-filmic social reality) and self-reference (to filmic technology, filmic modes of perception, and the star system). The Chinatown film captures the workings and the logic of the dream factory particularly well: it signals both social reality and the practices and circumstances of film production in the early twentieth century, and does so by means of an elaborate concatenation of things and bodies. However, as will become clear, I disagree with Kracauer’s estimation of the effect  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of modern ornamental displays. I argue that there is more to these enactments than stupefaction and stultification, that they do not just mirror a social reality of capitalist production. Rather, the films act as ambiguous conrations that variously disguise and disclose the character of materialism around which they revolve.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Chinese Things</h1>
<p>
	    At the turn of the twentieth century, Bill Brown argues, “the invention, production, distribution, and consumption of things suddenly came to define a national culture” in the United States.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> He cites an anonymous writer in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Atlantic Monthly</span> of 1906 who calls the new century “the age of things.” A logic of possession was taking over in this period, and it was increasingly seen to cut both ways: “We realize that we don’t possess [the things], they possess us,” the writer continues.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    The idea that “things own us” is charged with various degrees of anxiety. In these and many similar reflections, a development with a momentum of its own is envisioned—a process of commodification and commercialization which is no longer controlled by people. Neither producers nor consumers have full command over its workings. Karl Marx saw as early as 1867 that the circulation of goods tends to become self-serving and that in the world of consumption the “products of the human hand” become “autonomous res which have a life of their own, and interact among themselves and with man.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> By the turn of the century, this insight was widely accepted. Many shared Marx’s skepticism toward the universal growth of commodity fetishism, even if they might not have agreed with his final conclusions.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The German physician and cultural critic Max Nordau’s voluminous assessment of the European fin de siècle, <span style="font-style:italic;">Entartung</span> (published in 1892 and titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Degeneration</span> in the English translation of 1895), is a case in point. The book resonated not only with German and French, but also with American fears and phobias of the period.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Nordau’s work is concerned with the condition of the arts and of literature at the turn of the twentieth century—a condition that Nordau considers to be marred by decadence, nervous overstimulation, and hysterical sensationalism.
	  </p>
<p>
	    For Nordau, the pathological effect of a globalized and mediatized culture is brought to the fore most clearly in the practice and self-fashioning of artists—who, according to him, are not so much geared towards exploring the world of the future but rather caught in morbid self-reflection. It is in the private homes of these “unscrupulous copyists and plagiarists” that their true nature becomes most obvious.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

	      Here are at one stage properties and lumber-rooms, rag-shops and museums. The study of the master of the house is a Gothic hall of chivalry with cuirasses, shields and crusading banners on the walls; or the shop of an Oriental bazaar with Kurd carpets, Bedouin chests, Circassion marghilehs and Indian lacquered caskets. By the mirror on the mantelpiece are fierce or funny Japanese masks. Between the windows are staring trophies of swords, daggers, clubs and old wheel-trigger pistols. Daylight filters in through painted glass, where lean saints kneel in rapture. In the drawing-room the walls are either hung with worm-eaten Gobelin tapestry, discoloured by the sun of two centuries (or it may be by a  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> deftly mixed chemical bath), or covered with Morris draperies on which strange birds flit amongst crazily ramping branches, and blowzy flowers coquet with vain butterflies. . . . Startling is the effect of a gilt-painted couch between buhl-work cabinets and a puckered Chinese table, next an inlaid writing-table of graceful rococo. On all the tables and in all the cabinets is a display of antiquities or articles of vertù, big or small, and for the most part warranted not genuine; a re of Tanagra near a broken jade snuff-box, a Limoges plate beside a long-necked Persian waterpot of brass, a <span style="font-style:italic;">bonbonnière</span> between a breviary bound in carved ivory, and snuffers of chiseled copper.

<p class="continued">
	      The description, which runs on for well over another page, ends with the conclusion that “[e]verything in these houses aims at exciting the nerves and dazzling the senses. . . . All is discrepant, indiscriminate jumble” (<span style="font-style:italic;">D</span>, 11).
	    </p>
<p>
	      In many respects, this setting could be read as a scenario of globalization run wild, representing a world where the periphery hit home with a vengeance, inundating the metropolitan scene with things that do not allow for distanced contemplation but overwhelm, excite, and eventually root out what appears as the essence of respectable Europeanness: rationality, distanced contemplation, and level-headedness. In particular, “Oriental” features determine this new aesthetics of indulgence, sensationalism, and luxurious languor.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>
	      In Nordau’s list of decadent arts, one is missing, for it was too early for him to conceive of it in terms of the fundamental upheaval that it would finally effect: film. However, this medium and its public reception capture the very dynamics mapped out by Nordau. Film exemplifies an artistic engagement which does not aim at education or elevation but stimulates, excites, envelops, and arouses, which does not cater to reason but to sensuality, and which mingles with parts of the modern world that are neither respectable nor clean. When Nordau describes a fashionable trend in his contemporary theater world, he might as well have been describing the world of early film:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		The new school fetch the puppet theatre out of the nursery, and enact pieces for adults which, with artificial simplicity, pretend to hide or reveal a profound meaning, and with greater talent and ingenuity execute a magic-lantern of prettily drawn and painted res moving across surprisingly luminous backgrounds; and these living pictures make visible the process of thought in the mind of the author who recites his accompanying poem, while a piano endeavours to illustrate the leading emotion. And to enjoy such exhibitions as these society crowds into a suburban circus, the loft of a back tenement, a secondhand costumier’s shop, or a fantastic artist’s restaurant, where the performances, in some room consecrated to beery potations, bring together the greasy <span style="font-style:italic;">habitué</span> and the dainty artistocratic fledgling.
	      </p>
<div class="attrib">
		(<span style="font-style:italic;">D</span>, 15)
	      </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		Undoubtedly, Nordau’s cultural pessimism would have been further confirmed and entrenched had he witnessed how in the United States people of all classes and races would soon mix in dingy movie houses to watch sensationalist scenarios of low life, corruption, criminality, and licentiousness. He would not have been surprised to learn that one of the most favored settings of these scenarios was oriental to the core: the Chinatown, and, even more particularly, the Chinese curio store.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
		Nordau’s description of the decadent artist’s home rings with disgust, but it extends over two pages, registering in minute detail every facet of the corrupt world under investigation, revealing in the accuracy and close attention to detail, a paradoxical and indubitably unconscious attraction to that world, which Nordau would have been loath to admit. His obsessive mapping resonates with the equally ambiguous attention which Chinatown films lent to the processes of commodification and consumption. While the images of the contact zones between Chinese and white America, the sites where goods and money are exchanged and where things and bodies touch, are undeniably fraught with racist overtones and phobias, they just as clearly reveal the forces of attraction and desire, particularly when these scenarios are approached indirectly, mediated by the “dream factory” of cinematic production.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Ornamental Death: <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span>
</h1>
<p>
		Most critical writings about Chinese images in silent era American film take on, in some way or other, D. W. Griffith’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span> , a film that did indeed come to constitute a landmark for the field of cinematic representations of Asian Americans.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> But when it comes to the popular genre of Chinatown films, <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span> is far from typical. As John Kuo Wei Tchen has pointed out, the film’s release was announced as “the Art Sensation”; rather than focusing on the film’s story line, the film’s advertising enthused about “the ‘poetic delicate work of art, a tragedy of the first order,’ by Griffith.”<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span> is indeed too sophisticated in its techniques and markedly “artistic” approach to fit fully into the generic frame. It came to be received as an “art film” by film critics throughout the twentieth century, many of whom approached the film in close connection with Griffith’s controversial <span style="font-style:italic;">Birth of a Nation</span> of 1915.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> This film-analytical and film-historical framing might also be responsible for the attention that the representation of objects—props, outfits, sceneries; in short, the film’s mise-en-scène—has garnered in the critical debate about the film. And though I will profit from many of these observations in what follows, I take a different approach to <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span> than previous analyses by placing the film in the context of the Chinatown film genre in spite of the obvious divergences. I contend that <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span> unfolds an aesthetic repertoire which can also be found in other films of the time that deal with Chinatown. But I argue that in <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span> these techniques are employed for different ends than in the majority of films belonging to the same genre. To make this point, I will turn to a more typical example of the Chinatown genre film of the day: <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span>, which came out in the same year as <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span>. Finally, I will sketch some further implications of the comparison by discussing another silent Chinatown classic, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Tale of Two Worlds</span> .
	      </p>
<p>
		Griffith’s film is set in a Chinatown, but it is not set in the United States—<span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span> takes place in the Limehouse District of London. And yet, as Susan Koshy observes, “Griffith’s Chinatown [although] geographically located in London . . . is discursively located in the U.S.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> The setting owes to the fact that Griffith based his  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> film on an English short story, Thomas Burke’s “The Chink and the Child” from the 1917 collection <span style="font-style:italic;">Limehouse Nights</span>. In line with Burke, Griffith enacts a melodramatic fairytale world furnished with a cruel brute of a father, a beautifully suffering child-heroine (played by Lillian Gish), and a mysterious “Yellow Man” (played by the white actor Richard Barthelmess) as a highly ambivalent savior re.
	      </p>
<p>
		Much has been written about the ambiguity of the Yellow Man (whose name in the story, Cheng Huan, is never used in the film’s intertitles). It has been observed that his intervention on behalf of “the Girl” (whose name, Lucy, is also dropped) is marred by his obvious sexual attraction to the white victim.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> The reflections on the representation of, or rather circulation around, the theme of miscegenation in Griffith’s film have been developed with close reference to the film’s obvious fascination with the world of commerce and consumption.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> After all, one of the film’s main settings is a Chinese store, run by the Yellow Man, and it is this store that provides shelter to the Girl after a particularly brutal beating by her father. She is then nursed back to health in the storekeeper’s private quarters, which “are opulent and ornate, redolent of ritual and consumption” and in which she is gradually transformed into an oriental object herself—becoming one of the Yellow Man’s “shop window dolls on display for his visual contemplation and adoration, an object of lust and veneration.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>)
	      </p>
<p>
		The Chinese store, and even more so the living quarters above the store, assume the connotation of a world apart, a beautiful retreat from the brutal reality of working-class life, as Sandy Flitterman-Lewis points out:
	      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		  From its most obvious signifiers (the lines of poetry in the intertitles, the floral references of its central metaphor) to its more oblique (the circulation of res that link this sequence to its predecessor at the shop: doll, flower, window/mirror, and desiring gaze), to the materials of its construction (ethereal, chiaroscuro lighting, gestures of pantomime, expressive close-ups), the sequence is an apotheosis of religious and sexual ecstasy, the ineffable inscribed.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		“Style itself becomes a character” in Griffith’s film, concludes Flitterman-Lewis.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> Indeed, the film’s implementation of mise-en-scène anticipates what Thomas Elsaesser has marked as a characteristic feature of the 1950s family melodrama: in its very excess and plenitude, the mise-en-scène of <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span> expresses insights about the characters which the film and its producers do not want or dare to address openly.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<p>
		Yet while the Chinese store and living quarters re as a kind of fairy-tale retreat, in stark contrast to the Girl’s dingy abode, they are simultaneously made out as a site of misery and degradation for the storekeeper himself—the earthly equivalent to the “hell” about which an eager missionary warns the immigrant early in the film. This contrast is amplified by Griffith’s decision to begin his narrative in China rather than London (where Burke’s short story is exclusively located) and to depict the Yellow Man’s rich spiritual past in the film’s opening scenes—presenting a world of calm, peace, and patriarchal protection. By juxtaposing these scenes to the scenes in the Limehouse District, the film seems to first establish a marked dichotomy between  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> spirituality—associated with the East—and materialism—associated with the West, only to collapse this distinction in turn.

<div class="reEnd"></div>
</div>
<p>
		After all, in the course of the film the Yellow Man comes to stand not only for spirituality but res also as the representative of the fascinations of the material world. By this token, Griffith’s film eventually replicates the logic of Burke’s story, in which the Chinese protagonist is never equipped with a spiritual past to begin with, but is instead made out as a “poet,” “tinged with the materialism of his race.”<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Still, what sounds like a contradiction or paradox is easily suspended on the grounds of aesthetics—the extremes of spirituality and materialism, subject world and object world, souls, bodies, and things, merge in the aesthetics of the ornament.
	      </p>
<p>
		This becomes particularly apparent in the representation of the Girl. The Girl is not only “orientalized,” as Gina Marchetti has shown, but also “ornamentalized”: in the strange back and forth of the scenes of convalescence and restoration, the Girl is simultaneously transformed from a suffering waif into a beautiful object and from a “poor thing” into a person. Dressed in a rich robe, adorned in flowers, and equipped with a Chinese doll, the Girl is obviously reified, but when she looks at herself in the mirror and smiles her first and only natural smile of the film (elsewhere she pathetically and melodramatically uses her fingers to force her mouth into a sad semblance of a smile in order to please her father), she also reveals what every spectator of the day knew all along to be there, underneath the tattered clothes and dirty make-up: the glamorous, beautiful star, Lillian Gish. (<a name="2-text" href="#2">. 2 and 3</a>) True, the scene is sexually charged as it is framed by the Yellow Man’s lustful gaze, but he is as inert and paralyzed  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

		by Gish’s beauty as the spectators in front of the screen—it is not his agency that brought about the transformation, but the agency of the things—the robe, the flowers, the doll, the candles—that emphasize the Girl’s true nature. Along these lines, Vachel Lindsay’s assessment of the power of the moving image—to make “all the inanimate things which, on the spoken stage, cannot act at all, the leading actors”—is almost triumphantly driven home.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p>
		While things gain human agency in this scene, the role of the human being onscreen becomes increasingly more complicated. After all, this scene is hinged, eventually, no longer upon the diegetic plausibility of the Girl, but involves, more and more, an appreciation, conscious or unacknowledged, of Lillian Gish’s performance skills.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> We must not forget that the first “true” smile of the film is also the actress’s signature smile—so that the epitome of spontaneity simultaneously points to the performative aspect of the entire scene. By dint of the logic of ornamentalization, the Girl is presented as both orientalized object and commodified (star) image in this scene, ring forth a space at a distance from the real world that invites the audience to retreat to an enclave of self-indulgence and beauty, which may take the form of Chinese quarters here but is really nothing but the realm of the dream factory itself.
	      </p>
<p>
		In the course of this scene, however, not only the Girl is transformed. Much has been written about the objectification or fetishization of the Girl in the film, who acts as a “token of property, power, and moral legitimacy that circulates” between the film’s male characters.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> But it should also be noted that the Yellow Man undergoes the same fate—shrinking back from the temptation of sexual contact, he becomes part of the setting, an automaton playing a flute, a life-sized doll at the command of the beautiful being in his bed, who eventually takes his own life shortly after the Girl’s life ends. Richard Barthelmess’s bloodless performance and lethargic demeanor underscores this effect of reification—this is not an agent, but a decorative object. The uneasy position between subject and object marks the re from the very beginning of the film, but this becomes most apparent in a central scene in which a friend of the Girl’s father has some business in the Yellow Man’s store and discovers the Girl’s presence upstairs while the Yellow Man has gone out to get change. When the storekeeper returns, the customer, who is viciously pleased with his discovery, approaches the astonished Chinese and picks a speck of lint off his jacket. This is the one and only moment of physical contact between a white man and an Asian in the film; even the scenes of violence take place at a distance. Set in the store, the contact zone between whites and Asians, it marks the Chinese body’s object status—he appears like a piece of the store’s fittings, a doll or mannequin—unknowing and inert, a plaything for the film’s evil white men.
	      </p>
<p>
		In the course of this transformation of the main res into things, the inanimate objects onscreen gain even more weight and significance. The audience is invited to enjoy the interaction of people and things as a pleasurable, thrilling spectacle. The fact that the action is set in England contributes to the effect of a far-away puppet-play rather than an engagement with a contemporary real space. This logic culminates in the film’s ending, when the Yellow Man lays out the Girl’s dead body with a final flourish of decoration, before he kills himself—his own dead body falling to the ground  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to allow for a last long shot of the Girl’s beautiful corpse. The Yellow Man’s last arrangements of the Girl’s dead body reverberate with allusions to an earlier scene in the film, in which the Girl collapsed on the floor of the store and the Yellow Man, in an opium trance, stared uncomprehendingly at her prostate body—already the Girl is more ornament than living being. The film’s audience is invited to share the Yellow Man’s drugged perspective at the end of the film, to passively take in the perfection of the dead body on display and—by extension—to perceive the titillating story of miscegenation and subjugation as a beautiful tragedy set in a far-away region at a safe distance from contemporary debates and laws in the United States. This is precisely where contemporary Chinatown films set in the United States differ most glaringly: they shape audience perspective not so much by highlighting the exotic distance, but by suggesting expertise where strangeness rules.
	      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Images of Chinatown</h1>
<p>
		Perhaps it is far-fetched to read the Yellow Man’s dumb stare when under the influence of opium as a comment on the moviegoer’s oblivious immersion. Yet to approach the entertainment industry in terms of intoxication and addiction was far from unusual at the time of the release of <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span>, as Sabine Haenni has pointed out with reference to popular writing about the mass media in the early twentieth century: “According to these accounts, opium smoking had the same kinds of effects that Hollywood would later be accused of producing through such institutions as the star system. It may therefore be no surprise that opium smoking was associated with leisure tout court . . . .”<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>
		Haenni raises this point while reflecting on the popularity of the Chinatown in white middle-class culture of the early twentieth century. She starts from the observation that tourism and the media, the two most popular, and in many respects contiguous, modes of approaching Chinatown from a white perspective, had problematical implications—aiming ultimately at the consolidation “of the middle-class, imperial nation.”<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> But this very effort at consolidation and hierarchization, she argues, goes along with an interesting reconceptualization of the ideas and functions of cultural difference. In particular, the re of ornamental excess, the idea of a sensory overload stimulated by the Chinatown setting came to function as a crucial element in the context of Chinatown enactments:
	      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		  Ultimately, such accounts of Chinatown’s surface aesthetic point to the fear that “Chineseness” may be beyond the bounds of an intelligible identity or a coherent self, especially when excessive decorations seem to mark mere profusion and lack of order. In such a context, Chinatown and the Chinese are marked as “queer,” an epithet . . . meant to evoke the indescribability of the neighborhood’s identity, its incapacity—or unwillingness—to conform to commonly available concepts of identity itself. And yet, even as Chinatown’s gaudy surfaces raised questions of intelligibility and self-coherence, even as it challenged American journalists’ ability to describe it without descending into confusion, the neighborhood’s  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> impulse to decorate also resulted in an aesthetization of difference that ultimately promoted the quarter’s attractiveness.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		The Chinatown of the sensational press is characterized by an overabundance, an excess, an ornamental surplus, which does not allow for rational or logical decoding, especially since the signs, instead of suggesting a carefully conceived design, appear to have sprung from the sheer plenitude of people and things in the neighborhood. To try and decode the messages behind these colorful displays would be futile and pointless. On these grounds, Chinatown turns out to be an exemplarily aesthetic site, as Haenni contends. In a way, Griffith’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span> addresses this very same experience and phenomenon when the film dwells obsessively on the object world of the Chinese store. But Griffith’s “art film” tries to gain control over the plenitude of signs by arranging them into ornaments which are ultimately lifeless formations—it is no accident that his film ends with the long shot of a corpse.
	      </p>
<p>
		Chinatown in its very unreadability, contingency, and sensory plenitude encapsulates the world of the future, a world in the process of emerging, as also Nordau had evoked it. Nordau’s response to the phenomena of the new, which I see as oddly resonating with Griffith’s approach, was to call for a concerted effort at control and reorientation. By contrast, many other participants in the cultural scene of the early twentieth century might have shared the assessment, and yet chosen to embrace modernity instead of trying to curb it. The nexus of film production and film reception is a case in point, since “the cinema to some extent absorbed the functions of the utopian imagination, albeit in a diminished, alienated, and depoliticized form,” as Miriam Hansen has claimed.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>
		Reading filmic representations exclusively in terms of clear-cut ideological positions, as has been the case with many Chinatown films, might thus bear the danger of disregarding some of the most powerful implications of these films. While it is undeniable that the anxieties and prejudices of the day are reflected on the screen, the films may also be seen in terms of their correspondences to an increasingly complicated reality, allowing for a pleasurable experience of the dislocation and alienation particular to the modern urban scene: the modern spectator, writes Siegfried Kracauer, taking up the popular parallel between drug consumption and cinematic entertainment, “sits as an artificial Chinaman in an artificial opium den, he turns into a trained dog which performs ridiculously clever tasks to impress a film diva, he assembles into a thunderstorm in the high mountains, he becomes a circus artists and a lion at the same time.”<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> Again, as in “The Mass Ornament,” Kracauer reads this phenomenon in exclusively negative terms—“you forget yourself gaping, and the big dark hole is animated with the illusion of a life which belongs to nobody and which consumes everyone.”<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> But one can easily invert the scenario and highlight the transformative power emanating from the movie theater, which allows for a brief identification with beings and lives which otherwise seem at best exotically distanced, at worst irreconcilably alien. This comes to the fore in the enactments of Chinatown in the filmic Chinatown genre of the 1910s and 1920s.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Ornamental Masquerade: <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span>
</h1>
<p>
		Like <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span> came out in 1919.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Directed by William Worthington, it starred the Japanese-born actor Sessue Hayakawa in the title role and the white actress Helen Jerome Eddy, decked out in Chinese outfits, as his love interest Sen Chee, daughter of the Chinese merchant Louie Toy (played by another Japanese actor, Toyo Fujita). In many respects, the film is more typical of the Chinatown film fashion of the day than <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span>: apart from the fact that it focuses on a world of extortion, violence, drug abuse, and illegal trade, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span> also openly addresses the subject matter of an illicit love affair—although by contrast to many other films of the genre, it does not depict interracial attraction but presents two “Chinese” lovers separated by bounds of status and affiliation. Most of the action is set indoors, in Chinese temples, opium dens, and in the stores and storage rooms of a Chinatown that seems to tolerate a white presence only through undercover police agents and the occasional cop on a street corner. The love story between Luk Chen (Hayakawa), a hit man for the local Tong who has the intention of leaving his criminal career behind, and the merchant’s daughter is played out against the backdrop of the criminal conflict between the corrupt Tong bosses and Louie Toy, the merchant who is unwilling to pay the bribes that the Tong demands. Nevertheless, Louie Toy is clearly a shadowy re himself—an intertitle introducing him informs us that he “has grown rich trafficking in curios—and smuggling opium”—and at his first appearance on screen he is seen counting his money. He runs a lavish store of Oriental antiques, and his beautiful daughter and “most-prized possession” clearly res as one of them.
	      </p>
<p>
		Like many white actresses “playing Chinese” in Chinatown films (Leatrice Joy in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Tale of Two Worlds</span> would be another case in point), Helen Jerome Eddie does not really attempt to come across as ethnically Chinese, emanating a vague and stylish exoticism instead. Throughout the film (and again, like the heroine in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Tale of Two Worlds</span>), Eddie wears “Chinese” costumes with pants, and the outfits suggest a mix between orientalism and chic new womanhood—this Chinese girl is a flapper. Indeed, Sen Chee is the perfect match for Luk Chen, whom Hayakawa plays in cool pre-Valentino gangster style, smoking his inevitable cigarette and wearing his American dress hat in stark contrast to the dowdy Chinese caps all around.
	      </p>
<p>
		Most of Sen Chee’s scenes take place in the store, where she is seen in elegant poise next to the elaborately carved furniture, heavy draperies, Buddha res, and the ornate cash register which time and again seems to form the perfect visual link between storekeeper, customers, and wares. At one point in the action-laden plot, the merchant’s daughter is abducted and packed into a crate, which is then declared to contain “China” bought from Louie Toy. Trades and deals involving and connecting people and things mark the film on several levels, and they extend well beyond the sphere of Chinatown. After all, Luk Chan declares at some point that he is going to quit his Tong job and return to China—not in order to abandon the commercial world altogether but rather to become a “merchant prince.” At the end of the film, the two lovers are on their way “home,” and from their relaxed appearance we might well expect that they will resume their comfortable American lifestyle in China, trading goods  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> which will eventually end up in a Western curio store—so that China does not re as a perfect world apart (as the film’s happy ending vaguely suggests), but rather as an extension of the Chinatown reality we were acquainted with before.
	      </p>
<p>
		Even more than <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span> insists upon the materialism and materiality of Chinese and Chinese American culture. As in Griffith’s film, the setting of the Chinese store allows for a focus on processes of cultural encounter and material exchange—exemplified by the encounters between the lovers. Their tryst evolves, significantly enough, when Sen Chee flirts with Luk Chan by hiding behind and peeking through the heavy ornamental curtain which divides the living space from the sales room of her father’s store, marking a boundary between private and public which seems far from solid. This is by no means the only transitional site in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span>. Central scenes are played out on the balcony, others take place on the thresholds between store and street, opium den and alley; doorways, entrances, and windows repeatedly frame the audience’s view.
	      </p>
<p>
		The film relies heavily on a spatial logic, suggesting a divide between insiders and outsiders, the ones in the know and the ones who are kept out, and the sites and processes of transition between these extremes. Of course, the Chinese store itself constitutes the paradigmatic intermediate space, a space of crossing, and again, as in <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span>, a space with transformative potential: people may easily turn into things here—as Sen Chee’s enactment exemplifies. And in this film, too, reification is marked by ornamentalization. In particular, the scenes set in intermediate sites—the curtained entrance, the balcony, the thresholds—are subjected to a mise-en-scène which highlights the ornamental arrangements of people and things. The effect is most obvious in the curtain scene with the two lovers, when the draperies’ ornamental pattern is seen to correspond harmoniously with Sen Chee’s stylish Chinese outfits and becomingly frames her smiling face, while in the scene’s countershots we see Luk Chan watching Sen Chee through a shop window decorated with tassels which then frame and dissect his gaze. (<a name="4-text" href="#4">. 4 and 5</a>) The balcony is another case in point, as it features a rich growth of ferns and other “oriental” plants, a Japanese-style rice paper window screen, and an elaborately carved chair, and thus suggests a remote location of romance and exotic difference, which is then reanchored in turn in the film’s diegetic world when we learn that the site is under observation. Several times the audience shares a jealous neighbor’s perspective of surveillance, and again the gaze is framed by a curtain and a window which add further ornamental features to the scenario. Finally, the big Chinese letters which mark the entrance of Louie Toy’s store come into close view whenever dramatic encounters are played out on this threshold, highlighting the unreadability and ominous significance of the characters who are presented against this backdrop. All of these transitional sites point to the ultimate threshold which is, however, not openly addressed in the film: the film screen which functions as the contact zone between the diegetic world and the audience. This final framing, which goes beyond diegetic functions, is also evoked in the correspondence between the Chinese letters of the film’s diegesis and the American intertitles which are decoratively framed by oriental ornaments.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>
		As in Griffith’s film, people are shown as elements of aesthetic arrangements in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span>. But where <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span> stopped short in the pursuit of this effect of reified perfection, the <span style="font-style:italic;">nature morte</span> or still life—in other words, ornamental death— <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span> suggests a more complicated logic of ornamentalization. Here, things and beings might enter a complex ornamental interaction, yet the individual elements constituting the whole are in constant flux, their significance and status depending very much on who is looking and who is being looked at. The camera perspective continually changes to reveal point of view shots which lend additional or new significance to certain arrangements, encounters, or exchanges. Thus, the persons on the balcony are either being watched or themselves come to engage in watching or overhearing others. This is also characteristic of the film’s narration on a more general level, with respect to the very inscription of an implied audience into the film. Repeatedly, the assessment of a character, his or her function as active agent or passive object, is explicitly marked in the film as depending on specific points of view.
	      </p>
<p>
		For example, at one point early in the film, Louie Toy decides to hide a young sailor, who has just killed another man in an impulsive act of revenge and comes running to the store, closely followed by the police. To disguise his complicity, Louie Toy steps into the entrance of his store, smoking his pipe. A close-up shows him coolly and unsmilingly surveying the scene outside, leaning in the doorframe with its Chinese lettering until he calls out to a policeman running by. (<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>) His following lines are the only intertitles in the film which use the pseudo-language going for Chinese English in American films and literature of the time: “Him lun up Dupont, down Saclamento; you no like stop dlinkee tea?”
	      </p>
<p>
		Here, ornamentalization takes effect on the most immediate visual level—Louie Toy is framed by “unreadable” Chinese signs and he “speaks” the “ornamental” language of filmic Chinese. But there is more to the scene than just ornamentalization. The (white) policeman in the film may perceive an inert and “ornamental” Chinaman; yet the (white) viewer in the movie house whom the film addresses sees a Chinese character secretly in command. And while the standard dichotomy of oriental passivity and oriental depravity is clearly being called upon here, the scene goes beyond it. After all, this episode may be about the devious act of hiding a criminal, but the criminality of the action is not highlighted, since the sailor on the run is a pretty boy who has been carefully invested with sympathetic significance beforehand—he is presented as a victim rather than a perpetrator in the scenes leading up to his escape, and he later becomes Luk Chan’s likeable sidekick. Perhaps the most important dimension of the scene thus consists of the fact that it allows the white viewer to see what the white men of the film’s diegesis cannot see, to penetrate the ornamental arrangement and to decode the very signs which seem meaningless to the film’s naïve white “outsiders.” This effect of an inside perspective is further enhanced by the language games of the intertitles, which convey “Chinese” dialogue smoothly and clearly, transcending the very linguistic differences which obstruct the understanding of the film’s white people. By dint of this turn, the comprehensibility of Chinatown seems to be closely hinged upon the medium of film, since understanding depends upon the intertitles which make up for the limits  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of the diegesis and for the white audience’s putative limits of linguistic and cultural knowledge. Moreover, the technique of disclosing different points of view, changing perspectives, and modes of secret observation and surveillance in Chinatown, none of which the film’s characters ever register, both emphasizes the ornamental surfaces of an alien world and suggests means of penetrating them, rendering the viewer an expert observer (or “reader”) in a world of misinformation, lies, masquerade, and deceit. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span>, the ornament was all there is; in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span>, it is merely a curtain which may be withdrawn.

<p>
		This logic of the glance behind the curtain, which places the viewer in the position of the initiate, the expert, the person behind the scene, is also apparent on another level of the film’s aesthetics: just like <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span> is an excellent example of an early engagement with the star system, which is complicatedly entangled with the film’s diegesis. Both in <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span> and in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span> we see white actors of both genders playing Chinese. In addition to this, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span>, the twenty-five-year-old star actress Lillian Gish plays a fifteen-year-old waif. The promotion of both films clearly revolves around their stars’ reputation—Sessue Hayakawa, Lillian Gish, and Richard Barthelmess were well-established actors in 1919. Indeed, it is important to reflect on the fact that “[w]ith Sessue Hayakawa an authentic and popular Japanese leading man [was] on hand in Hollywood,” when Griffith decided to cast Barthelmess for the role of his Yellow Man.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> By 1919, Hayakawa had managed to make himself known as the “generic Oriental” in American film, his representation of Japanese, Chinese, Siamese, Arab, and Indian characters “blurring the national boundaries and cultural differences among Asian countries” which he had meant to dutifully  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> represent in the first place.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Where Barthelmess plays Chinese by means of affected gestures and miming, Hayakawa is much more sophisticated, as Daisuke Miyao points out: “Luk Chan . . . always stands straight, walks actively, and never places his hands in front of his chest. He deviates from the ‘Oriental’ postures and facial expressions represented by Barthelmess.”<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>
		But this difference in acting styles should not be taken as an indication that <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span> is somehow more authentic than <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span>. After all, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span>, too, a white actor plays a central Asian role—Mark Robbins was cast as the villain Ming Tai—and resorts to exactly the same devices of effeminate-sly stylization as Barthelmess before him.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> Audiences of the 1910s were very well used to the obvious maneuvers around age and ethnicity on screen—the grown woman playing a girl, the Japanese playing a Chinese, the white men and the white woman playing Asians would not have disturbed the reality effect of the films. However, while the machinations of casting would not have confused the films’ viewers, their layered implications (gesturing simultaneously, though unevenly, to the films’ fictional universe and to the no less fictional world of the Hollywood star system) address an implied audience which is both at ease with the standard plotlines of filmic narration and with the star system and its connotations—an audience familiar with the workings of the dream factory.
	      </p>
<p>
		In many respects the mobilization of the star system in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span> coincides with the effects at work in <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span>. The skilled and moving impersonations which point to their artifice, their actors’ stardom, rely upon the ongoing vacillation between diegetic immersion and extradiegetic appreciation (of performances, techniques of representation, filmic technology, star reputations). To this day, this is an intricate part of the movie experience, but it was particularly important in the movies of the so-called transitional period, before the emergence of the classical Hollywood system.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> Yet again, Griffith’s film artfully resolves the dichotomy between story-telling and film technique, between diegesis and extra-diegetic reality, aiming at a diegetic totality as it marks, exemplarily, the perfection of its last <span style="font-style:italic;">tableau</span> (thus anticipating, arguably, the aesthetic closure of the classical Hollywood phase). But in the less sophisticated filming of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span> there is no such resolution. Here diegetic and extra-diegetic realities are juxtaposed rather than merged, transitions and discrepancies marked rather than smoothed over. The film joins together different acting styles and different images of Chineseness when it allows for the divergent performances of Hayakawa and of Roberts, and it presents a Chinatown that is varied, heterogeneous, and messy. Throughout the film, the very old and authentic exist next to the new and stylish, just like the antique furniture, the Joss res, and Buddha statues in the store of the old Chinese smoking his pipe are seen next to the sleek outfit of the young Chinese smoking his cigarettes or the pantsuits of the heroine. Again, this is not to say that <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span> represents a more truthful picture of the contemporary reality (or experience) of Chinatown than <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span>—it does not, and it is certainly as fraught with clichés as the former film. But <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span> does convey a pleasurable (and thrilling) image of the unchecked workings of difference and diversity, while Griffith’s film seems anxious to evoke these forces only as long as they remain contained by the modes of fairy-tale storytelling.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Expertise and the Ornament: <span style="font-style:italic;">A Tale of Two Worlds</span>
</h1>
<p>
		I end these observations on the Chinatown film with a quick glance at another representative of the genre, a film which I see in close correspondence to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man: A Tale of Two Worlds</span>, which came out in 1921, directed by Frank Lloyd.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> The film enacts a classical topos in that it revolves around the illicit love story between a white man and a Chinese girl, which is then melodramatically resolved when we learn that the girl is really white herself, having been abducted as an infant in China from American parents. The same story was told in the same year in <span style="font-style:italic;">Wing Toy</span> and with some variations a year later in <span style="font-style:italic;">East is West</span>—it allowed, of course, for the elaborate enactment of biracial attraction while eliminating its attendant risk. Like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Tale of Two Worlds</span> is set in a sphere of crime and deviancy, the American Chinatown. And like many other films of the genre, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Tale of Two Worlds</span> has an antique store as its main location, where a proud merchant father lives with his beautiful daughter (“the most prized and guarded of all his treasures” as the intertitles reveal). I contend that like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span>—and in contrast to <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span>—<span style="font-style:italic;">A Tale of Two Worlds</span> tries to mediate a “correct” approach to Chinatown and to Chinese America as exemplary instances of American modernity to its target audience of white viewers. These films do not only aim at entertainment, but also mean to reassure their audiences about a complex and heterogeneous modern urban reality and to instruct them in possible ways of negotiating this reality.

<p>
		Again, the themes of deception and sophistication, of cultural naïveté and of cultural expertise are pivotal in the film; they are played out on the level of plot, casting, acting, and mise-en-scène, and they involve once more the logic of ornamentalization. At one point we thus see the film’s white hero and love interest, Robert Newcombe (J. Frank Glendon), who is introduced as a “student of Chinese literature and art,” being approached by a young Chinese store assistant in Chinatown. The young man, played by Yukata Abe, tries to cheat Newcombe into buying an antique scroll, for which he asks one hundred dollars, while Newcombe, who has recognized the seller’s fraudulent intentions, is willing to pay only one. Later in the film, the two meet again, this time in the antique store where the young man is engaged in some handicraft work. Upon noticing Newcombe’s interest, the boy looks up, grins and declares that he’s “making an antique bowl.” Newcombe smiles back and tells him to let him know “when it gets to be a thousand years old”—both men are laughing. Later in the same store, we see a fat matron, richly dressed, with her well-kempt husband in tow, examining the bowl, obviously impressed when she learns from the sly-looking young man that, “It was the favorite bowl of the great-grand-mother of the Emperor Chi Yang, and it is now a thousand years old.” She orders her husband to pay what he wants—a hundred dollars.
	      </p>
<p>
		Once more, the audience, which by dint of language skills and expertise would most likely be in the same situation as the buyers, is invited to side with the expert, the insider, and to laugh, together with the white man, but also the Chinese boy, at the naïveté of people who are at a loss about what is really going on. This scene echoes an earlier episode in the film which introduces the reality of Chinatown by showing a  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> group of white tourists who are led through the neighborhood and fooled into seeing crime and deviance when really acting and make-belief abound. “But no tourist will ever see the real life of Chinatown” runs the intertitle following this scene—and the film’s plot begins for real. Of course, what “tourists” cannot see, the film’s audience (which, ironically, might be constituted by the very tourists of Chinatown derided before) gets to see and decode easily and coolly.
	      </p>
<p>
		Where <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span> epitomizes distance, Chinatown films like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">A Tale of Two Worlds</span> insinuate expertise; where ornamentalization in <span style="font-style:italic;">Broken Blossoms</span> evokes alienation and non-communication, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span> and other similar films the same principle aims at fostering new modes of communication and exchange, and at familiarizing its audiences with a world that is different, yet more abstractly fascinating than personally threatening. It is important to stress once more that this is a fictional world, and that the Chinatown films by no means capture an authentic Chinese American experience of the day. The target audience of all of these films is white—Chinese American concerns and perspectives are not explicitly addressed or sought. But they are not categorically excluded either.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> Thus, while films such as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tong Man</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">A Tale of Two Worlds</span> cannot be seen as challenges to the measures of immigration restriction and racist segregation of the time, and while they undeniably draw on the catalogue of racist stereotypes and cater to all kinds of anxieties and reservations, to reduce them to this racist agenda would be to miss much of what made (and makes) them fascinating.
	      </p>
<p>
		In their ceaseless display of changing arrangements and flexible constellations between people and things, these films (inadvertently) also highlight the problems involved in identity politics of any sorts. Stereotypes are here not consolidated and cemented, but rather juggled around. Seen thus, the fact that the representation of difference in many Chinatown films is framed by the settings of commodity culture and commerce, and that the aesthetics of ornamentalization rules supreme might also indicate an uneasy awareness that ethnic diversity is produced, constructed, and subject to constant rearrangements and reappropriations. After all, identities and ethnicities in the Chinatown film are often constituted by nothing but (obviously enacted) props, such as fake beards, pant suits, dress hats, or silk gowns—they are tangibly and glaringly made-up.
	      </p>
<p>
		The insight that the value judgments and assumptions about identities are as volatile and malleable as the things (the props and commodities) which often take center stage in the films need not raise anxieties, however. At any rate, any such anxiety is alleviated through the films’ strategy of addressing their implied audiences in the roles of insiders and experts, who know how to read the complicated signs and signals of modernity and are not misled and fooled like the outsiders in the films’ diegesis. They see through the tricks of the trade, as it were, and this is exactly what constitutes the pleasure of the Chinatown film set in the United States: “the commodification of Chinatown made it the locus of Chinese American modernity rather than a traditional authenticity,” as Sabine Haenni concludes her observations about a different repertory of Chinatown images.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> The popularity of these Chinatown films attest to the fact, as I hope to have  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> demonstrated, that early-twentieth-century audiences (and producers) were as thrilled with the advent of the new as they were frightened by contact with the unfamiliar.

		  The ornamentation of modernity is “an <span style="font-style:italic;">end in itself</span>,” as Kracauer puts it; by contrast to ornamental traditions in folk art and ritual, the modern ornament does not refer to a larger frame of meaning. Instead, it is entirely self-referential, and in this respect expresses the logic of its time—the logic of capitalist production: “The commodities which it creates are not actually produced to be possessed but to make unlimited profits. Its growth is bound up with that of the factory. . . . The producer works for the expansion of the business; values are not produced for values’ sake.” Kracauer, “The Mass Ornament,” 69–70.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>

		    It would be interesting to learn about Chinese American responses to the Chinatown film, but in spite of the often cited claim that early film acted as a means of assimilation for all kinds of ethnic audiences, it is difficult to locate detailed demographic data for early and transitional-era movie audiences—let alone to records of audience responses. “Because of its chameleonlike quality, the cinema seems to have assumed a certain threshold function, oscillating between the tradition of family-centered ethnic entertainment and the more anonymous, more modern forms of commercialized leisure,” writes Miriam Hansen about film in the 1910s and 20s (Hansen, <span style="font-style:italic;">Babel &amp; Babylon</span>, 104–105), and her observation might very well extend beyond the Jewish and Italian audiences she addresses explicitly, and also apply to Chinese Americans of the day, who participated actively in the processes of modernization described by Hansen. See also Anthony W. Lee, <span style="font-style:italic;">Picturing Chinatown: Art and Orientalism in San Francisco</span> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001).

      Katherine Mansfield’s career was indelibly influenced by a prolonged and active engagement with a diverse and lively book and journalistic trade, which saw the publication of her writing in a number of formats, both “literary” and “popular.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Her short stories appeared in little magazines and illustrated papers, in books printed by prestige private presses and commercial publishing houses, and her negotiation of these varied sites of publication helps earn her a place within what Lawrence Rainey terms modernism’s “social reality: a conration of agents and practices that converge in the production, marketing, and publicization of an idiom, a shareable language in the family of twentieth century tongues.”<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> Mansfield’s modernist aesthetic evolved within the context of these diverse cultural and social institutions of early-twentieth-century publishing, and her writing life was marked by a dual commitment to achieving both artistic credibility and commercial success, oscillating between the twin poles of the “great divide” so often associated with literary modernism.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> However, recent scholarship has increasingly sought to challenge what Mark S. Morrisson has termed “the commonplace of modernism’s inveterate antagonism to mass culture” in order to reinterpret the spaces between “literariness” and “popularity” in early-twentieth-century culture.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Mansfield’s writing, shaped as it is by a combination of commercial and aesthetic ambitions, enacts a challenge to the categories of “high” and “popular” culture through her exploitation of different modes of publication of her work. Moreover, this challenge is further enhanced by her commitment to the short story genre, which leant itself both to technical innovation and widespread  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> circulation through a variety of channels, both “literary” and “popular.” Her textual experimentations and negotiation of a range of publication sites amount to a quest for what she termed “a new word” in her fiction, a rallying cry for new approaches to the production and consumption of fiction which she mapped out in a series of reviews first published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Between April 1919 and December 1920, during a period when she took a brief hiatus from her more familiar career as a writer of short fiction, Mansfield was employed as book reviewer for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>. This journalistic interlude would eventually give way to the final and most prolific period of her life, which saw the composition and publication of many of her most renowned and innovative stories, among them “The Daughters of the Late Colonel,” “The Garden-Party,” and “At the Bay.” However, the formative nature of her alternative career as reviewer has been underestimated. Mansfield enthusiastically exploited the environs of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> and its literary network as a forum in which to hone her craft; and this in turn was crucial to her emergence as a shrewd writer of innovative short stories that were commercially viable once she parted company with the journal at the end of 1920. Ultimately, an account of Mansfield’s use of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> to refine and promote her fictional technique enriches an understanding of her as a modernist short story writer at work in a busy publishing world; an understanding which in turn reevaluates the supposedly antagonistic relationship between “high modernism” and “popular culture” that pitted the “intellectuals” against the “masses.”<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Mansfield’s professional involvement with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> began when her husband John Middleton Murry took over its editorship at the beginning of 1919. The two had previously collaborated on a number of avant-garde little magazines earlier in the decade—<span style="font-style:italic;">Rhythm</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Blue Review</span>, and the short-lived <span style="font-style:italic;">Signature</span>—but, unlike these earlier coterie publications which Murry had helped found, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> was already an established organ of literary debate by the time he took over its mantle. First launched in 1828, it had gained a formidable reputation as “the mirror of Victorian culture” throughout the nineteenth century.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> However, its impact had waned by the early decades of the twentieth century, and the task of rejuvenating the unfashionable paper fell to Murry (with financial support from the chocolatier Arnold Rowntree) and his newly-assembled team of contributors culled from the Bloomsbury and Garsington sets. Aldous Huxley was initially appointed as coeditor after T. S. Eliot turned down the position, and the paper frequently featured articles by the likes of Virginia and Leonard Woolf, Bertrand Russell and E. M. Forster, as well as Eliot and Mansfield herself.
    </p>
<p>
      Although Mansfield’s direct involvement with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> was somewhat hampered by the fact that it was mainly conducted from mainland Europe where she had been convalescent since September 1919, it was considerably more extensive and dynamic than has often been implied in critical accounts of the journal. In particular, many commentators have emphasized the biographical contexts for her engagement with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>, often based on an overly-romanticized and sensationalist portrait of her relationship with Murry. Marysa Demoor, for example, implies that Mansfield’s decision to work for the journal was motivated by a desire to promote and further her  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> husband’s career rather than her own, arguing that she “devoted the larger part of the little time she had left to live to raising the quality of the journal which, she thought, would establish her husband’s renommée as an editor and a literary critic.”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Similarly, Oscar Wellens suggests that her decision to resign from the paper in December 1920 was entirely motivated by feelings of jealousy about Murry’s rumored affair with fellow short story writer and <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>-contributor Elizabeth Bibesco.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> In casting Mansfield as a jilted wife in this scenario, he ignores a more compelling reason for her resignation: after eighteen months of reviewing the work of other writers, she had renewed her ambition to publish her short stories beyond the pages of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> and had subsequently clashed with Murry over the marketing of <span style="font-style:italic;">Bliss and Other Stories</span> , her first collection of short stories for nine years.
    </p>
<p>
      Such melodramatic representations of Mansfield as the devoted, but scorned, wife of the editor underestimate the professional significance of her association with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>, and give insufficient consideration to the material that she published in the paper. Where critics have examined her involvement in more detail, however, they have presented an image of Mansfield that is equally problematic, often overemphasizing her supposed jealousy in her attitudes to other contemporary writers, as well as a sense of inadequacy in relation to literary predecessors such as Anton Chekhov.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> This has inevitably colored the critical attention that has been paid to her most infamous appearance in the paper: “A Ship Comes into the Harbour,” her review in November 1919 of Virginia Woolf’s second novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span>. Unsurprisingly, this has been read in the context of the increasingly fraught friendship between the two writers, which has been the subject of a number of illuminating comparative studies in recent years.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> However, the review of <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span> has continued to be the subject of speculation that Mansfield’s criticism was personally motivated, primarily by feelings of resentment at Woolf’s apparently settled life which contrasted so sharply with her own itinerant lifestyle as her health worsened throughout 1919. Margaret M. Jensen, for example, suggests that, “Mansfield’s critique was influenced by her private sense of Woolf” and her “envy of Woolf’s lifestyle, of her possessing ‘so many nice things’ at once.”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Such conjecture about the ways in which Mansfield’s personal circumstances and apparent jealousy may have influenced the contents of her review column again runs the risk of undermining the broader professional context in which these reviews were produced; and by reading “A Ship Comes into the Harbour” primarily in terms of its place within the “public of two” formed by the two writers, insufficient consideration has been given to the publication environment of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Perhaps more crucially, the review of Woolf’s novel has dominated discussions of Mansfield’s association with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>, effectively reducing almost two years of her professional writing career to the composition of a solitary review. This is to overlook the extent of her engagement with the journal, to which she contributed despite her illness throughout 1919, offering advice on how it should be run until the end of 1920 (when she officially resigned from its team of reviewers; Murry’s editorship ended in February 1921, when the financially-troubled paper merged with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nation</span>). Her letters from the period are filled with commentary on individual issues and suggestions  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> for improvements; and when she was in London she was (as she puts it in a letter to Sydney and Violet Schiff) kept busy with “manuscripts to be read, poems, essays to choose ‘finally’, novels to review, schemes to draft, an article to write on <span style="font-style:italic;">why we intend to publish short stories</span>.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> After the paper followed through on this commitment to the publication of short fiction, Mansfield contributed a number of stories of her own to the journal, appearing at roughly one-month intervals; one prose sketch (“Perambulations”) and another story (“Revelations”) had appeared prior to the paper’s announcement in June 1920 that it would “devote a portion of space henceforward to prose fiction.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> She also contributed a number of poems under the pseudonym “Elizabeth Stanley”; a series of translations (in collaboration with S. S. Koteliansky) of the letters of Anton Chekhov; and, in July and August 1920, three leaders, two offering commentary on contemporary publishing trends and the other detailing the arrival of Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks in London three months after their wedding, and demonstrating Mansfield’s preference for the films of Charlie Chaplin.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> However, her primary role at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> was as reviewer of fiction in a weekly column, which quickly became a highlight.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Between April 1919 and December 1920, “K. M.” published over one hundred and fifteen literary reviews of novels and short stories.
    </p>
<p>
      In her memoir, her friend Ida Baker (“Lesley Moore”) provides another image of Mansfield at work as a reviewer which has proven enduring: “[t]hey had to be done by a certain date, whether she was ill or not, and she found most of the books so dull, so impossible to write about with interest.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> However, a closer examination of the published reviews themselves provides a much more compelling picture than this account of a frustrated and ailing writer. Her first column, “Three Women Novelists,” indicates the mixture of material under review, from the experimental prose of Dorothy Richardson’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tunnel</span> to more popular forms like Mrs. Victor Rickard’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The House of Courage</span>; a similar range is apparent in her short story reviews, from Virginia Woolf’s “Kew Gardens” to more obvious magazine fare like <span style="font-style:italic;">A Sailor’s Home</span> by “Richard Dehan” (the pseudonym of the popular Irish writer Clotilde Graves).<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Mansfield may well have found the specifics of some of this material under review “dull” and she was undoubtedly frequently critical of her fellow writers and dwelled on their shortcomings, but that is not necessarily to say that she found them “impossible to write about with interest.” In fact, the task of wading through this material engendered a reappraisal of fictional forms and conventions that would underpin her literary output from this point on.
    </p>
<p>
      Mansfield’s criticisms of her contemporaries need to be understood, not as the product of an insecure author who aimed to run down the work of more talented rivals in order to offset her own limitations, but as evidence of her ongoing project to perfect her short story aesthetic. In judging her peers, Mansfield was inevitably faced with the necessity of reappraising her own development as a writer of fiction; by pointing up the weaknesses in her contemporaries’ work, she aimed to encourage them to engage in a similar project of self-interrogation. Ultimately, the body of reviews that she wrote throughout 1919 and 1920 constitutes her manifesto for the kind of literary fiction that she deemed necessary as the twentieth century entered its third decade, and her criticism  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of her peers amounts to a rallying cry to them to “make it new,” in Ezra Pound’s famous summation of the modernist project. Throughout her career as reviewer, she was engaged in establishing the parameters of this envisioned literary aesthetic, and it was through her association with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> that she would consolidate her position as a writer of formally inventive short stories in a commercial publishing world.
    </p>
<p>
      Throughout 1919 and 1920, Mansfield used her review column to interrogate the place of fiction in the contemporary world and its need to break free of conventional and conservative forms, placing particular emphasis on the dominant prose genre of the novel. The review of <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span> makes this clear from its opening paragraph:
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	There is at the present day no form of writing which is more eagerly, more widely discussed than the novel. What is its fate to be? We are told on excellent authority that it is dying; and on equally good authority that only now it begins to live. Reviewers might almost be divided into two camps. . . . But in all this division and confusion it would seem that opinion is united in declaring this to be an age of experiment. If the novel dies it will be to give way to some new form of expression; if it lives it must accept the fact of a new world.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      Throughout the First World War and its immediate aftermath, Mansfield’s private letters and journals frequently recorded her belief that the time had come for both a “new form of expression” and a “new world.” As she grappled with the review of Woolf’s novel, she wrote to Murry that: “I feel in the profoundest sense that nothing can ever be the same—that, as artists, we are traitors if we feel otherwise; we have to take it into account and find new expressions, new moulds for our new thoughts and feelings” (<span style="font-style:italic;">L</span>: III, 82, 10 November 1919). Eventually, this commitment to “making it new” would escalate into an all-out antipathy to formal conservatism in fiction—both literary and popular—in the immediate postwar period.
    </p>
<p>
      To read Mansfield’s reviews from start to finish is to chart her increasing frustration at the array of what she considered inferior, formulaic work that found its way into print at a time at which she continued to struggle to publish her short stories outside of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> itself. In her first column she noted what she saw as a growing trend in fiction, identifying that the problem lay as much with contemporary writers as with the expanded and changing reading public that had emerged with the rise of the working and leisured classes: “Reading, for the great majority—for the reading public—is not a passion but a pastime, and writing, for the vast number of modern authors, is a pastime and not a passion.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> As her column developed, she became increasingly irritated by the prevalence of this “pastime” fiction as she deemed it; her review of Compton Mackenzie’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Vanity Girl</span> offers an illustrative anecdote of the inadequacies both of an undemanding audience and an author that seemed unwilling to challenge such a readership:
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
      It was our fortune some time ago to overhear the following conversation:
    <br>
      “Is that a new one, dear?”
    <br>
      “Well, yes, dear, I suppose it is.”
    <br>
      “How far have you got, dear?”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <br>
	“Chapter twenty-seven.”
      <br>
	“Make room, dear; let’s read the synopsis.”
      <br>
	“Oh, that’s not new, dear. That’s just the same as usual.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Mansfield’s private correspondence further reflects her escalating dissatisfaction with contemporary novels. On 25 September 1920 she wrote to Murry that:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	  It is an awful temptation, in face of all these novels to cry “Woe—woe!” I cannot conceive how writers who have lived through our times can <span style="font-style:italic;">drop</span> these last ten years and revert to why Edward didn’t understand, Vi’s reluctance to be seduced or (see Bennett) why a dinner of twelve covers needs remodelling. If I did not review novels I’d never read them.
	</p>
<div class="attrib">
	  (<span style="font-style:italic;">L</span>: IV, 50–51, 25 September 1920)
	</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  It is in these terms that Mansfield’s dismissal of <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span> should be read, motivated not by jealousy of Woolf, but by disappointment in the woman whose first novel (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>) had been more experimental. By these standards, <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span> was a huge letdown, as is evidenced by Mansfield’s concluding description of it as “a novel in the tradition of the English novel. In the midst of our admiration it makes us feel old and chill: we had never thought to look upon its like again!”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> In Mansfield’s eyes, then, <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span> (like Mackenzie’s novel) might be deemed “just the same as usual,” a formulaic throwback to the social milieu of Jane Austen and insufficiently attuned to the “new moulds and new expressions” now necessary for the reinvention of fiction generally, and the novel in particular.
	</p>
<p>
	  Shortly after Mansfield’s review of <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span> appeared, Murry wrote to her with an account of a subsequent meeting he had with Woolf, reporting the latter’s claim that “your novel reviews showed that you were not interested in novels. I thought that was a very illuminating remark, illuminating Virginia of course.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Rather than merely revealing bitterness at having been slighted in print by her friend and rival, though, Woolf’s comment seems to reflect her recognition of Mansfield’s growing disquiet at the privileging of “the tradition of the English novel.” Indeed, it might provide some indication of the nature of the discussions about work and writing that the two engaged in throughout their friendship, which was based on the fact that (as Mansfield put it in one letter), “We have got the same job, Virginia &amp; it is really very curious &amp; thrilling that we should both, quite apart from each other, be after so very nearly the same thing” (<span style="font-style:italic;">L</span>: I, 327, 23 August 1917). Although Woolf herself was subsequently to help reinvent “the tradition of the English novel” with <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">To the Lighthouse</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waves</span>, with <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span> she had apparently failed to build on the experimental impulses first evident in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>. Even more crucially, <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span> seemed like a step back from material like “Kew Gardens” and “The Mark on the Wall,” the experimental short fiction that Woolf had begun to produce and of which Mansfield was more complimentary, having published a positive review of the former in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> in June 1919, five months before the publication of the unadventurous <span style="font-style:italic;">Night and Day</span>. Mansfield’s rejection of conservative novelistic forms and her own ambitions to promote the short story as an alternative medium is clearly  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> expressed in a review published in June 1920, which most closely approximates her manifesto. In “Wanted, a New Word” (significantly, a review of a series of short story collections), she called that it was time for the expression of a “new word” in fiction. For Mansfield, then, this “new word” was to be fundamentally linked with her commitment to the short story genre.
	</p>
<p>
	  Mansfield’s own breakthrough as a short story writer had come with the composition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Prelude</span>, which in total took some two and a half years to complete; it was finally published in July 1918, hand-printed by Leonard and Virginia Woolf at the Hogarth Press. The composition of the story is most often linked with her grief at the death of her brother, Leslie Heron Beauchamp, in the First World War, which prompted her resolution to find “a kind of special prose” in which to pay tribute to him.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> The “kind of special prose” that Mansfield committed herself to in 1916 would eventually evolve into the terms of “Wanted, a New Word.” The phrase itself had previously appeared in a journal entry from July 1919, in which she wrote of her belief that “the time for a ‘new word’ has come but I imagine the new word will not be spoken easily. People have never explored the lovely medium of prose—It is a hidden country still.”<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> The review itself appeared almost a year later, and has been described by Clare Hanson as “virtually the only ‘manifesto’ KM produced for the kind of fiction she herself wrote.”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> It poses a riddle:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    I am neither a short story, nor a sketch, nor an impression, nor a tale. I am written in prose. I am a great deal shorter than a novel; I may be only one page long, but, on the other hand, there is no reason why I should not be thirty. I have a special quality—a something, a something which is immediately, perfectly recognizable. It belongs to me; it is of my essence. In fact I am often given away in the first sentence. I seem almost to stand or fall by it. It is to me what the first phrase of the song is to the singer. Those who know me feel: “Yes, that is it.” And they are from that moment prepared for what is to follow. Here are, for example, some examples of me: “A Trifle from Life”, “About Love”, “The Lady with the Dog”. What am I?<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a></p></blockquote>

	  Mansfield does not answer the final question within the review, except to claim that the material under discussion (Elizabeth Robins’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Mills of the Gods</span>; Arnold Palmer’s <span style="font-style:italic;">My Profitable Friends</span>; and Dorothy Easton’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Bird</span>) does not successfully fulfill these criteria. Her definition of the “new word” required in fiction is actually presented as a series of negatives.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> She cannot define it in any positive, autonomous terms: it is only presented as the series of illustrative Chekhovian examples at the end, and is only defined in relation to what it is <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span>, a short story (specifically, the kind of plotted short story that remained a mainstay of popular publishing) or a novel.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> This amorphous definition might be applied to Mansfield’s own fiction, which categorically refused to conform to the plotted conventions of the short story form; a letter to Dorothy Brett, for example, records her scornful reaction to a request for a technically “marketable” story in November 1921:

	    Instead of plot, Mansfield’s short stories would prioritize impressionistic prose, epiphanic structures, and a movement inwards to focus on the inner workings of her characters’ minds.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> The opaqueness of these techniques is evident in the vague critical language adopted in the published review; moreover, a “new word” would be needed to describe this new form and its associated subject matter.
	  </p>
<p>
	    “Wanted, a New Word” provides a blueprint for the kind of fiction that Mansfield now aimed to promote, and its discussion of the short story form is in keeping with a recurring feature of her review column: the endorsement of the short story rather than the novel as the genre most adaptable to literary experimentation in the postwar world. Unsurprisingly, her novel reviews also demonstrate an increasing tendency to comment on the pressures of short story publication and the persistent critical assumption about the “inferior” nature of the form itself. She makes a wryly humorous gesture to the perceived lowliness of the craft in a review of Margaret Symonds’s <span style="font-style:italic;">A Child of the Alps</span> and Jane Mander’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Story of a New Zealand River</span>:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      We question whether anyone who has not himself written the eighty thousand-odd words [that constitute a novel] realizes to the full the grim importance of the fact that a novel is not written in a day. In the case of the short story it is possible to give orders that, unless the house is on fire—and even then, not until the front staircase is well alight—one must not be disturbed; but a novel is an affair of weeks, of months; time after time the author is forced to leave what he has written to-day exposed to what may happen before to-morrow.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    Given the tortured route Mansfield took to complete and publish <span style="font-style:italic;">Prelude</span> (on which she began work in March 1915, finally delivering the complete manuscript to the Woolfs in October 1917) it is clear that her tongue is firmly in her cheek here. A lingering sense of the perceived inferiority of the short story is further evident in a review of Compton Mackenzie’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Poor Relations</span> and Gilbert Cannan’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Time and Eternity</span>, where Mansfield’s sense of humor once more comes to the fore:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      To be taken seriously in England a novelist must be serious. Poets may be as gay as they please, story-tellers (especially as nobody will publish short stories) as light-hearted as they wish, but if a young man desires to be told (and who does not?) that he is in the front rank, the head of, leading, far outstepping, immeasurably in advance of all other novelists of the day, he must be prepared to father fiends hid in the clouds.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    Inherent in this apparently throwaway remark, of course, is Mansfield’s suggestion that the short story continued to be viewed as a devalued form: the subtext to the statement may be interpreted as “to be taken seriously in England a <span style="font-style:italic;">writer</span> must be a <span style="font-style:italic;">novelist</span>.” Short stories, after all, were deemed the province either of the apprentice “serious” writer or the contented “popular” writer, a preconception that Mansfield actively aimed to challenge in the final years of her career.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	    Her parenthetical quip that “nobody will publish short stories” indicates a further source of anxiety at the time, namely that she was finding it difficult to find anywhere that would publish her own work. Reviewing her two most recent book publications in the <span style="font-style:italic;">TLS</span> in January 1920, for example, Harold Childs had dubbed <span style="font-style:italic;">Prelude</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Je ne parle pas français</span> “two stories of the ‘awkward’ length which, as publishers declare, the public finds too long for a short story and too short for a novel.”<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Each had been published in a single-story edition by a small, private press: the Hogarth Press published three hundred copies of <span style="font-style:italic;">Prelude</span> while the Heron Press printed one hundred copies of <span style="font-style:italic;">Je ne parle pas français</span>, of which twenty were spoiled and only sixty sold. However, such select and limited readerships were now inadequate in Mansfield’s eyes; indeed, her breakthrough with <span style="font-style:italic;">Prelude</span> had actually coincided with a firm commitment to achieving critical and commercial success with the new material that she began to produce at this time by delivering this work to as wide an audience as possible. An integral aspect of her “kind of special prose” was, of course, that it would be formally innovative. In a series of oft-quoted journal entries during the composition of the story, she expressed her commitment to a new form of writing and it is from this time that her development of a modernist aesthetic is usually traced. On 22 January 1916, she had written that, “the form that I would choose has changed utterly. I feel no longer concerned with the same appearances of things. The people who lived or who I wished to bring into my stories don’t interest me any more. The <span style="font-style:italic;">plots</span> of my stories leave me perfectly cold.”<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Quoted less frequently, however, is another entry written two weeks afterwards on 3 February:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">

<div class="attrib">
	      (emphasis mine)
	    </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      Mansfield’s commitment to a new form, then, coincided directly with her most openly expressed commercial ambition: throughout the second half of her career she aimed to fuse these two impulses; attempted to clarify an aesthetic approach that was simultaneously “modernist” <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> commercially viable; and came to recognize the need to expand and reinvent an audience for this new fiction.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Before she really came to terms with these ambitions in her reviews for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>, however, she wrote a piece of prose fiction which displays similar concerns about the necessity of establishing an audience for her work, and the corresponding anxiety about how this might leave her exposed to indifferent editorial, critical, and reading publics. The little-known “Perambulations” appeared in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> in May 1919, and its composition was clearly motivated by Mansfield’s frustration at the lack of an outlet for her work; she had recently failed to secure a contract for the publication of a volume of her stories with William Heinemann’s firm.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> This rejection doubtless influenced the basic premise of the sketch, which details secondhand an author’s account of a dream of submitting a manuscript to a publisher and meeting with  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> ridicule, and the fundamental problem for the author presented in “Perambulations” is her failure to overcome the first hurdle in the necessary process of distributing her writing. The sketch begins:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		She told me she dreamed she took her darling to a publisher, and, having placed it upon the altar, she made obeisance and waited to hear if it should be found worthy in his sight for a sacrifice. And he asked her how old she was. She had to confess that, though she had seen him quite recently and they had spent a wonderful time together, she never would see Thirty again.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      The sacrificial language suggests the author’s anxiety about the fate that awaits her “darling” should it actually be published, but in her dream, she fails even to impress her initial audience of the publisher. Moreover, it is not only the author’s novel that meets with rejection, but also the author herself; the publisher’s refusal to take seriously the author’s delivery of her novel after reaching the advanced age of thirty echoes Mansfield’s wry sense that her own preferred genre continued to be perceived as at best an apprentice and at worst a lesser art. The publisher dismisses her delivery of her first novel “fourteen or fifteen years” too late, and at a time when she “ought to be either writing [her] memoirs or crackin’ up the new generation. We’ve no use for anything in the creative line that’s not brought to market in the green ear.”<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> As a result, she sees herself as “doomed to pass these delicious hours of our fine flowering not only unwept (which doesn’t matter so much), but quite absolutely unhonoured and unsung—which does.”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> More specifically, “Perambulations” reflects the problematic status of an author who remains “unread,” an anxiety that would preoccupy Mansfield for the remainder of her career as she came to appreciate more fully her public role as a writer within the marketplace. Writing to Murry two years later, for example, she was to describe her reaction to the appearance of “At the Bay” in the <span style="font-style:italic;">London Mercury</span> as “such a queer feeling—after one has dropped a pebble in. Will there be a ripple or not?” (<span style="font-style:italic;">L</span>: III, 229, 9 May 1921). In “Perambulations,” it is the <span style="font-style:italic;">lack</span> of an audience for her work that preys on the author’s mind; and the sketch is clearly a product of Mansfield’s developing awareness of the need to publish her work in a broader context. Her reviews see her interrogating this need in much more rigorous terms.
	    </p>
<p>
	      As Mansfield’s career progressed, she was to become increasingly conscious of the necessity of locating her work within a commercial realm in order to establish herself as an author, and throughout her review columns she frequently questioned the nature of the relationship between the author, the text, and the reading public. She established the theme in her opening column:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		It is terrifying to think of the number of novels that are written and announced and published and to be had of all libraries, and reviewed and bought and borrowed and read, and left in hotel lounges and omnibuses and railway carriages and deck chairs. Is it possible to believe that each one of them was once the darling offspring of some proud author,—his cherished hope in whom he lives his second richer life?<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      Even here it is possible to trace Mansfield’s fundamental sense of difference as a writer of short stories: if novels led such a precarious existence, what was to be the fate of the majority of her short stories that did not as yet exist in book form, appearing rather in disposable formats of papers and journals? From the very beginning of her career as reviewer for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>, then, Mansfield highlighted the tension between the autonomy of a work of art and the necessary reproduction of it in delivering it to an audience. This concern would inform many of her reviews in the following eighteen months, and would preoccupy her for the remainder of her career. For example, she wrote to Murry on 24 February 1920 that:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		I never knew before what killed Dickens. It was money. He couldn’t as he grew older resist money: he became a miser &amp; disguised it under a laughing exterior. Money and applause—he died for both. How fearful that is! But still my own precious we must have the books. We must have his complete works . . . .
	      </p>
<div class="attrib">
		(<span style="font-style:italic;">L</span>: III, 229, 24 February 1920)
	      </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		Mansfield’s conflict here is obvious. On the one hand, she suggests that Dickens’s early death was brought about by his location within (and engagement with) the commercial realm of literature and the cult of celebrity fed by an avid paying audience; on the other, she implies that this “killed” him in that it affected the image he projected for his public, and influenced the kind of material he produced as his career advanced. Yet commercial publishing had facilitated the continued dissemination of Dickens’s work fifty years after his death, and in Mansfield’s role as consumer of his novels and in her desire to own his complete works, she must acknowledge her own participation in the very processes which she claims brought about both the commodification of his writing and his self-destructive celebrity. Although Mansfield often perceived the problematic nature of her own attempts at employing similar methods of promoting herself and her work, it is evident that she became increasingly aware of the necessity of doing so in order to be an author. By the end of 1921, she made this clear in a letter to Dorothy Brett:
	      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		  Dont you think an artist ought to have a show at least once a year? It seems to me almost as necessary as for a writer to produce a book. That sort of contact with the public—even the feelings of being at the mercy of the public is somehow <span style="font-style:italic;">right</span>. After all, we express these things because we want a bigger audience than ourselves—We want to reveal what we have seen.
		</p>
<div class="attrib">
		  (<span style="font-style:italic;">L</span>: IV, 292, 5 October 1921)
		</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		  Her immersion in the publishing world of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> in particular honed her sense of obligation in engaging with this realm in order to “reveal what she had seen.”
		</p>
<p>
		  Mansfield also came to recognize that, in order to produce a new form that would have any kind of impact, it was not only necessary to write a “new word” but also, through a more complex engagement with a variety of publication strategies, to address (or establish) a new audience. In essence, Mansfield’s developing perception of her artistic role would necessitate the production of a new form and the publication of it for a diverse readership; this audience should in turn modify its expectations in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> order to consume something that was “not the same as usual” and more than mere “pastime” fiction. In a review of October 1919, she had written of F. Brett Young’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Young Physician</span>: “If only Mr. Young could forget the impatient public and let himself be carried away into places where he thinks they do not care to follow!”<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> The problem here identified is not so much that the “impatient public” is unwilling to read something new, but that contemporary writers assume this to be the case and fail to challenge their audience’s expectations as a result. By contrast, Mansfield seems to imply that if she is prepared to produce a “new word,” her audience will in turn be prepared to consume it. Mansfield’s later career was characterized by just such a challenge to generic expectations as she continued to refine her approach to the short story form and the contexts in which she published her work. Her renegotiation of the short story form was central to her strategic placement of challenging new material which would, by implication, change the way in which the short story was read and perceived. Throughout 1921 and 1922, for example, she began experimenting with different sites in which to publish her work, continuing to appear in literary journals (such as the <span style="font-style:italic;">London Mercury</span>) but also exploiting illustrated papers such as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sphere</span> to suit her own needs; and in February 1922, the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Garden Party and Other Stories</span>, her third collection of short stories, coincided with the appearance of the title story in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Westminster Gazette</span> over the course of three Saturdays. Many of these stories which made their initial appearances in the more perishable formats of newspapers and magazines would subsequently be included in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Garden Party</span> collection. The diversity of these sites of publication and their associated readerships—and more importantly the resultant commercial and popular success that she was to achieve—was to prompt Wyndham Lewis’s snide dismissal of Mansfield as “the famous New Zealand Mag.-story writer,” but this is to invoke a binary of high and low culture that she actually aimed to renegotiate in her ambition to forge a new reading public and achieve a synthesis between these “literary” and “popular” sites of publication that attempted to undermine the distinction between such categories.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> As a direct result of her career as a reviewer, Mansfield would ultimately aim for a greater sense of accessibility in her art, publishing material in a variety of journals and papers that continued to disseminate her “new word,” but in contexts that were available to a more diverse readership. In order to put this plan into effect, though, she needed to move beyond the environs of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>, which had begun to prove stultifying.
		</p>
<p>
		  Her disdain for the increasingly predictable nature of the material she reviewed for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> became increasingly apparent in her private writing, as for example to Sydney Schiff on 3 November 1920:
		</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>

		  </p>
<p>
		    I wish there were 6 or 7 writers who wrote for themselves and let the world go hang.
		  </p>
<div class="attrib">
		    (<span style="font-style:italic;">L</span>: IV, 99, 3 November 1920)  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		      By the end of her stint as reviewer for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span>, Mansfield was evidently disheartened by the continued proliferation of “safe” literary forms, written to a readymade market. Her brief career at the journal had seen her read and review nearly one hundred and fifty novels and short story collections. The process of wading through this mass of material ultimately sharpened her awareness of the position of literary fiction within the marketplace, but also strengthened her perception of the dangers of complacency and the inadequacies of writing to a pre-approved audience. Once she began to write and publish short stories again throughout 1920, her irritation at the fact that she should feel forced to review what she regarded as unchallenging and substandard fare at the expense of producing her own fiction continued to mount. On 6 December 1920, she wrote to Murry about the increasing pressures of her weekly review column:
		    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
			Its <span style="font-style:italic;">hell</span> to know that one could do so much &amp; be bound to journalism for bread. If I was a proper journalist Id give the day to reviewing &amp; so on—but no! Reviewing is on my chest—AND a sense of GUILT the whole week! However it cant be helped. Ill win out and then I dont want to read another novel for ———— But isn’t it grim to be reviewing [E. F.] Benson when one might be writing ones own stories which one will never have time to write, on the best showing!
		      </p>
<div class="attrib">
			(<span style="font-style:italic;">L</span>: IV, 136, 6 December 1920)
		      </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
			She resigned as reviewer for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> two days later. December 1920 also saw the publication of her second collection, <span style="font-style:italic;">Bliss and Other Stories</span>, and a return to her sole commitment to short story writing. She approached this return to fiction writing with a rejuvenated sense of her purpose as an author in need of a public, and her development of a short story form which was both formally innovative and commercially successful would characterize the final years of her writing life.
		      </p>
<p>
			The <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> had provided Mansfield with the means to consolidate her status as a professional short story writer, leading finally to her enduring success. The body of reviews that she produced between 1919 and 1920 presents an insight into Mansfield’s reactions to literary and popular texts as they appeared in the immediate postwar period, as well as forming a manifesto which called for a renegotiation of reading and writing practices by her contemporary readers and fellow authors. Mansfield’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Athenaeum</span> contributions chart her evolving understanding of the workings of the literary marketplace, and her growing sense of the potential for combating a perceived conflict between artistic and commercial ambition by means of a complex negotiation of “popular” and “literary” sites in the dissemination of her fiction. Ultimately, the theories expounded by Mansfield in her journalistic output equipped her with the tools she needed to establish a brand of literary modernism that was both formally experimental <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> commercially viable; it was here that she found the space in which to articulate “a new word.”

Jensen, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Open Book: Creative Misreading in the Works of Selected Modern Writers</span> (New York and Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2002), 106. Similarly, Hermione Lee implies that the review was prompted by Mansfield’s apparent inferiority complex when faced with the work of her older (and ultimately more celebrated) rival. Lee speculates that Mansfield’s review had the following effect on Woolf: “Because of it, she had refused to review the new Dorothy Richardson, in case she might—like Katherine?—be swayed by rivalry. At the same time, she was reading Ethel Smyth’s memoirs and relishing her ‘honesty’. Honesty was exactly what she felt she was not getting from Katherine (and would get, in spades, from Ethel). She had seemed to be a kind of friend, but now she had published a piece in which Virginia detected spite and subterfuge.” <span style="font-style:italic;">Virginia Woolf: A Biography</span> (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1996), 386.

From this point on the journal featured a short story or prose sketch in each issue.

    Mansfield is presumably using “short story” here in the “plotted” or magazine sense of the phrase, but she does not make the distinction explicit; nor is she consistent in her use of the term, since her review of Woolf’s plotless, experimental “Kew Gardens” was published in a column entitled “A Short Story.”

<p>
      In 1999, <span style="font-style:italic;">The New York Review of Books</span> reprinted Sylvia Townsend Warner’s first novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span>, as part of its eclectic “Classics” series. Reading this now widely accessible work—first published in 1926—alongside more familiar texts of the period alters our perspective on the landscape of modernist British fiction; but not only, I want to suggest, for the reasons that have thus far been offered. In her introduction to the reprinted novel, Alison Lurie presents <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span> as a revolutionary feminist text disguised as “a charming British fantasy about witchcraft.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> The novel, which has as its protagonist a spinster aunt who becomes a witch in midlife and who delivers an impassioned critique of patriarchal society at its conclusion, was a “surprise international best seller” upon its initial release, and indeed was the first ever Book-of-the-Month Club selection. According to Lurie, Warner’s narrative spoke most to “single women of all ages,” anticipating Virginia Woolf’s radical call for the need of “a room of one’s own.” While Woolf “spoke, we know now, for thousands of women then and in years to come,” Lurie proudly declares that “Sylvia Townsend Warner had spoken for them first” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, xiii). Critics writing both before and after Lurie have largely shared her tendency to read Warner’s earliest published experiment in fiction as a work located firmly within, and to a large extent delimited by, what Brooke Allen has labeled a “purely feminist zone.”<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> That is, when the novel has not been dismissed outright as a work of “total fantasy gratification,” to quote Gillian Beer, <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span>’s radical nature as a feminist tract (whether successful or failed) which uses witchcraft as an allegory for the liberation of European women from everyday  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> oppression, has been taken as the primary reason for recuperating it as a significant work of twentieth-century women’s writing.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
      While such an assessment of the novel’s revolutionary potential is not inaccurate, I would argue that it flattens Warner’s sly, slippery, and perverse text by forcing it into the genre of the manifesto. In this article, I wish to resist the impulse to reduce Warner’s novel to a feminist manifesto by attending to its subtle and reanimating play with works of art. I hope to show how the novel’s feminist engagements cannot be fully appreciated apart from its use of narrative witchcraft, or its deployment of what I call its arts of dispossession. Removed from their frames, Warner reveals in her play with a Leonardo portrait, a Henry Fuseli painting, and a woodcut of a witch hunter, the often stealthy interpenetrations between the realms of aesthetics and politics, narrative, and witchcraft. More than a “charming British fantasy” that masks its radical feminist potential through allegory, <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span> can be read as a fiction that disturbs the imperial grasp and gaze of patriarchal possession through a delicate and devious process of conjuring, animating, and reanimating two-dimensional images. Calling forth each image “rather like the Witch of Endor calling up old Samuel” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 115) (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>), as we are told the landlady and witch, Mrs. Leak, dispassionately conjures up her neighbors through her speech, Warner’s narrative proceeds to manipulate the shape and boundaries of the image, giving each one new lives, and in so doing, coolly evacuating possession of its power. This novel can be read alongside the works of Woolf and other modernist writers, not only for its interest in “the current condition of women,” as Lurie notes (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, xii), but also, and perhaps more interestingly, for its profound revision of the novelistic imagination through its unsettling of works of art, enacting a shift from an aesthetics of creation to one of memory and witness. Regarded in this light, <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span> embodies a far more subtle politics and a more deeply nuanced challenge to the unequal power relations engendered by patriarchy than previous accounts of the novel have yet accounted for.
    </p>
<p>
      One fruitful place in which to begin a reassessment of <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span> and its potential to reshape our conception of Warner’s larger aesthetic and political concerns is at the turning point in the narrative, when its protagonist is driven to make her pact with Satan—or the “loving huntsman,” as he is called in the novel’s original subtitle. Warner here establishes the immediate context for the conversion that will rather sedately shift the novel’s register from realism to fantasy. Laura Willowes—who, after her father’s death, is absorbed into her brother’s household for the next twenty years as the “useful and obliging and negligible” “Aunt Lolly” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 150)—one day startles her family by announcing that she is leaving them to forge a life of her own in the English countryside. Despite their astonished and aggrieved protestations, Laura trusts her mysterious inner visions (of picking plums by night) and inexplicable impulses (to wander alone in cemeteries and desolate woods), and moves to the small village of Great Mop. After an uneasy period of transition Laura finally gains a sense of freedom—the “weight of all her unhappy years” mercifully lifting from her one day in a field of fragrant cowslips—when her nephew Titus arrives like a genial, ruthless emperor. Titus is the only member of her family who has been sympathetic to her  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

As Titus begins to take root in Great Mop, his colonizing relation to the countryside dispossesses Laura, threatening to turn her into an exile, just as she had been exiled from her childhood home upon her father’s death. When Titus and Laura go for walks together, for instance, “he would sometimes fall silent, turning his head from side to side to browse the warm scent of a clover field”:

	However, Titus’s love is “a horror to her,” and is “different in kind from hers.” “It was comfortable, it was portable, it was a reasonable appreciative appetite, a possessive and masculine love.” That is, he “loved the countryside as if it were a body” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 147). “Commenting, pointing out, appreciating, Titus tweaked her senses one after another as if they were so many bell-ropes,” judging the landscape as his uncle sized up horses, sending silence fleeing out of the fields, threatening to turn the village into “a place like any other place, a pastoral landscape where an aunt walked out with her nephew” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 149). Under Titus’s “discriminating paw” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 148) and through his unwitting usurpation, the landscape, which has lost its unique identity, is colonized, domesticated, and rendered picturesque—essentially fixed and framed as a pictorial object—just as Laura herself was “possessed” by the system that left her with no other option than to take on the role and identity of “Aunt Lolly,” the diminutive name bestowed upon her first by a niece and then by all her relations, in the prime of her life.
      </p>
<p>
	The landscape, like a work of art, like a woman’s body, its rounded hills recalling an earlier description of Titus as an infant, his fat hands sprawled over his mother’s bosom, is seen as inescapably caught within a patriarchal system of ownership that attempts to fix and render things both static and portable. This scene foregrounds the way in which the realm of art and the pictorial is particularly under pressure in <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span>, and it raises the question whether anything in the world of the novel escapes the possessive reach of patriarchy, which extends not only over works of art, landscapes, and material goods, but over territories and entire nations as well. Even at the novel’s conclusion, which has baffled critics (such as Jennifer Nesbitt) intent on reading the novel as a feminist manifesto, Laura remains subject to Satan’s “satisfied but profoundly indifferent ownership” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 222).<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Yet Laura’s escape from, and ultimate victory over, Titus, which is achieved through her unquestioning sense that she has entered into a pact with Satan such that others could not “drive her out, or enslave her spirit any more, nor shake her possession of the place she had chosen” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 159–60), enacts a transformation that allows Laura-as-witch to step outside an imposed pastoral  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and pictorial frame. She is able to elude the ration of herself as an aunt walking out in the landscape with her nephew, allowing us to rere the power relations with which the novel ends. I will return to this conclusion later, but for now a consideration of Warner’s slippery play with three works of art in particular can, I suggest, lead us to revise earlier conceptions of the novel’s feminist potential while still preserving its radical, delightful strangeness.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Lady (Laura) and the Ermine</h1>
<p>
	  Our first glimpse of Laura, outside of the perspective of her sister-in-law Caroline’s thoughts, which are busy planning how to accommodate Laura in her London home, Apsley Terrace, and musing on how black is not becoming for her “pale grey eyes,” is of her “not thinking at all”:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">

	    She picked a red geranium flower, and was staining her left wrist with the juice of its crushed petals. So, when she was younger, she had stained her pale cheeks, and had bent over the greenhouse tank to see what she looked like. But the greenhouse tank showed only a dark shadowy Laura, very dark and smooth like the lady in the old holy painting that hung in the dining-room and was called the Leonardo.

<div class="attrib">

	  </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    We catch in this passage only a play of surfaces, projected upon Laura’s unthinking, blank mind: the reflection of Laura in her younger self as she is looking at her reflection in the waters of the greenhouse tank, which reflects another image—Leonardo’s “lady in the old holy painting,” which itself reflects its original sitter who, however, remains draped in darkness. Against this shadowy smoothness we see briefly the vivid, almost excessively sensual, red of the crushed geranium juice that stains Laura’s wrist and earlier, her cheeks, and which is quickly absorbed in the greenhouse tank. In the play of reflections the image of the “dark shadowy Laura” ripples into that of the lady in Leonardo’s painting and back. Whereas, in Walter Pater’s well-known and often-quoted description of “Lady Lisa,” who is “older than the rocks among which she sits,” and whose beauty is “wrought out from within upon the flesh, the deposit, little cell by cell, of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite passions,” we are denied any access to an interior knowledge or history of Laura’s (or Leonardo’s lady) that can be wrought through the lineaments of wrist or cheek, eyelids or hands.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

	    While no specific painting is referred to or named by the narrator—it is simply the “old holy painting”—it seems likely that Warner had in mind <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady with an Ermine</span> (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>)—a work that helped precipitate a shift in European portraiture from the “psychologically inert” profile pose to the more fluid expression of psychological depth.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> David Bull describes the portrait, which is supposedly of the young Cecilia Gallerani, mistress of the duke Ludovico Sforza, as follows:

She is supporting the bulk of the ermine’s body with her left  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> hand, while her long, elegant right hand gently touches the animal’s shoulder with an ambiguous mixture of soft caress and firm control.

	    The sitter’s turned head is poised upon her long neck like the ermine’s, with, as Joanna Woods-Marsden observes, the narrative power of this “flexed pose, unprecedented in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> European painting” existing in tension with the legibility of the ermine as symbol.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Indeed, the ermine in the painting has been read iconographically in three ways: as standing in for Cecelia Gallerani herself, with the ermine’s designation in Greek, <span style="font-style:italic;">galee</span>, a “pun on the sitter’s family name”; as a marker of purity because the animal “was believed too fastidious to soil itself”; and as a re for the Duke Ludovico, whose heraldic emblem was an ermine.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> The animal is essentially linked with Laura Willowes in that her full name—in fairy tale fashion connected to the story of her birth and coming-of-age—is Laura <span style="font-style:italic;">Erminia</span> Willowes.

<p>
	    Laura’s father, Everard, we are informed, “was a lover of womankind,” and delights upon the birth of his daughter. Faced with the inappropriateness of setting aside port as he had done with his two sons for her coming-of-age, he hits upon a solution that involves “[g]oing to London upon the mysterious and inadequate pretext of going bald.” Everard returns from the city “with a little string of pearls, small and evenly matched, which exactly fitted the baby’s neck”:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	      Year by year, he explained, the necklace could be extended until it encircled the neck of a grown-up young woman at her first ball. The ball, he went on to say, must take place in winter, for he wished to see Laura trimmed with ermine. “My dear,” said Mrs. Willowes, “the poor girl will look like a Beefeater.” But Everard was not to be put off. A stuffed ermine which he had known as a boy was still his ideal of the enchanted princess, so pure and sleek was it, and so artfully poised the small neat head on the long throat. “Weasel!” exclaimed his wife. “Everard, how dare you love a minx?”
	    </p>
<p>
	      . . . To Everard she seemed his very ermine come to true life. He was in love with her femininity from the moment he set eyes on her. “Oh, the fine little lady!” he cried out when she was first shown to him, wrapped in shawls, and whimpering at the keen sunlight of a frosty December morning.

	      Soon after her birth he goes out hunting and returns with the brush of the first kill—“‘’Twas a vixen,’ he said. ‘Such a pretty young vixen. It put me in mind of my own, and I thought I’d ride back to see how she was behaving’” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 15–16). As in the play of Laura’s reflections at the beginning of the novel, we witness (with perhaps a degree of bemusement as well as much amusement) a quick series of slippery Ovidian-like transmutations that constitutes one of the primary aesthetic principles of Warner’s novel. That is, we move from an imagined ermine trim to the stuffed ermine as enchanted princess, to Laura as the ermine reanimated and come to life, and then quickly compared to the hunted and killed vixen whose tail she is presented with. This shape-shifting mirrors the instability of the ermine as signifier in Leonardo’s painting, which can be read, as noted above, both iconographically and as a physical animal, or as both captive and protector, supported and gently probed—controlled and caressed—by the sitter’s enlarged hand with its delicate fingers. Laura herself can be viewed as the lady in the portrait, whose beads encircle her neck and hang down her chest, or as the animal being held (if we agree that <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lady with an Ermine</span> is indeed being conjured by Warner), which is gripped yet still remains elusive. Or Laura can be taken as herself, merely, just as difficult to pin down to any two-dimensional surface as Leonardo’s lady with her  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> ermine. Thus, while the painting by Leonardo is one of the Willowses’s prize possessions, catalogued and inventoried as part of the dowry that Laura’s mother brought to Lady Place upon her marriage to Everard (one of “two oil-paintings by Italian masters which the younger Titus, Emma’s brother, had bought in Rome whilst travelling for his health” [<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 14]), it manages to escape the pervasive system of masculine possession—in part at least—through a process of reanimation and transformation within Warner’s narrative. In referring to Leonardo’s “old holy painting” and playing with the forms of the lady and ermine, the text performs its own mischievous magic—a kind of narrative witchcraft that critics, intent on reading <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span> as a stridently political critique, have so far overlooked.

	      Leonardo’s lady makes another appearance in the novel during the Witches’ Sabbath that Laura attends after making her pact with Satan. Here, she is brought face to face with a re that she (mistakenly, she discovers afterwards) takes to be Satan joining in the revelries. Laura sees his face and for a moment the possibility that “he was a Chinaman” crosses her mind; “then she saw that he was wearing a mask”:

<blockquote class="disp-quote">

		The candle-light shone full upon it, but so fine and slight was the modelling that scarcely a shadow marked the indentations of cheek and jaw. The narrow eyes, the slanting brows, the small smiling mouth had a vivid innocent inexpressiveness. It was like the face of a very young girl. Alert and immobile the mask regarded her. And she, entranced, stared back at this imitation face that outwitted all perfections of flesh and blood. It was lifeless, lifeless! But below it, in the hollow of the girlish throat, she saw a flicker of life, a small regular pulse, small and regular as though a pearl necklace slid by under the skin.

<p class="continued">
		The girlish mask, rendered foreign and strange, and the reappearance of the pearl necklace that slips and beats like a “small regular pulse, small and regular” in the hollow of the re’s throat, uncannily bring back the younger Laura and the lady in Leonardo’s painting reflected in the greenhouse tank. This image of the would-be-Satan, actually a young author who has lazily sold his soul for fame at dinner parties, also recalls an earlier description of Laura’s other sister-in-law, Sibyl, who, it seems to Laura, has “exchanged her former look of a pretty ferret for this refined and waxen mask.” This prompts Laura to wonder, “Which, what, was the real Sibyl: the greedy, agile little ferret or the memorial urn?” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 85). Linking together all of these female res, the masked man keeps us in the play of reflections and surfaces, foregrounding the difficulty of probing beneath them and of possessing something that does not immediately elude one’s grasp, displaced or transformed into something else. We are confronted with a frustration of readerly desire to penetrate beneath exteriors— the desire, as Gillian Beer aptly describes in her essay on Warner, “to move closer inside the text than it quite permits.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> In Warner’s novel, as in her other works of fiction, “[e]mpathy is encouraged and then deflected,” a process that largely operates through the process of shape-shifting transformation that is evident in the novel’s play with ladies and ermines (or foxes and ferrets), which are brought to life and death and life again by the playful, quick movements of the narrative voice, darting in with keen observations yet maintaining its distance persistently, ironically—one might even say, devilishly.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<span style="font-style:italic;">The Nightmare</span> and the Secret Country of the Mind</h1>
<p>
		The image of another artist’s painting is also, I would argue, summoned and transformed by Warner in <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span>—Henry Fuseli’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Nightmare</span> (<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>). Laura’s nephew, we are told, is writing a biography of Fuseli:
	      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		  Fuseli—pronounced Foozley—was a neglected re of the utmost importance. The pictures, of course, didn’t matter: Titus supposed there were some at the Tate. It was Fuseli the man, Fuseli the sign of his times, etc., that Titus was going to write about. It had been the ambition of his life to write a book about Fuseli, and his first visit to Great Mop convinced him that this was the perfect place to write it in.
		</p>
<div class="attrib">

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		  Hovering somewhere between Titus’s idiom and Laura’s—and the narrator’s—tacit, mocking exasperation at his flippantly expressed ambitions (which ignore the work for the man), this passage opens up a space for the reader to spot the utter incongruity between Titus’s literary plans and Fuseli’s works. It is only because the “pictures, of course, don’t matter,” as Titus insists—pictures known for their ability to depict as well as evoke in their viewers an irrational terror—that there is nothing at all out of keeping for Titus in writing a biography of the artist in Great Mop, which is for him a “comfortable lap” like any other (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 148). However, as easily as Titus colonizes Fuseli as a subject for biography (just as he domesticates the landscape, to Laura’s horror), Fuseli’s paintings—<span style="font-style:italic;">The Nightmare</span> in particular—emerge as an uncanny subtext in the novel, conjured up for any reader familiar with the artist’s name and work while remaining unseen, or in the blind spot of the would-be biographer himself.
		</p>
<p>
		  In Fuseli’s painting a sleeping woman in her bedchamber, draped in a sheer white gown, lies stretched on her back, her hair and arms dangling dramatically to the ground.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> A goblin sits astride her stomach, directly facing the viewer in a pose of sinister contemplation with a look that suggests a recognition of complicity, while a horse’s head with glowing eyes stares from the shadows in eerie blankness at the woman’s form. The vulnerability of the woman’s body and the sense that the confined space around her is invaded by these bestial, unreadable forms creates a mood of dread and an awareness of a violation that has both already happened and which is also an inevitability that has yet to occur. As Martin Myrone notes in his study of Fuseli, “<span style="font-style:italic;">The Nightmare</span> in particular is instantly recognisable” as a work by the artist, “reproduced in publications literary, scholarly and popular as an icon of irrational eroticism.”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> This image, evoked in the reader’s mind’s eye by the talk of Fuseli, is conjured and reenvisioned by a later scene that takes place in the “sour field” where Laura makes her pact with Satan, while also rippling backwards to an earlier moment in the novel, set not in any gothic castle or young heroine’s bedroom, but on “the top of Cubbey Ridge, past the ruined windmill that clattered with its torn sails” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 122).
		</p>
<p>
		  Before considering this scene on the ridge, let us consider the one that follows close upon the heels of our discovery that Titus is writing a biography of Fuseli. While Laura shows her visiting nephew all of her favorite footpaths in the countryside, she hears a great deal about the artist from Titus, who discourses on Fuseli as they walk.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Because the paths are narrow, “there was seldom room for two to walk abreast, so Titus generally went in front, projecting his voice into the silence.” His words about the artist thus fill the hot summer air and filter back towards his restless aunt, who feels “ashamed of his company,” sensing that the woods, upon seeing her with Titus, are drawing “back scornfully to let them pass by together” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 146). One can imagine Titus’s inflated and suspended speech, spurned by the trees, punctured by the summoned vision of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Nightmare</span> that is to emerge, or perhaps reemerge, and change, before the alert reader.

		  Exasperated by her situation, feeling pushed out from her new home and newfound freedom by her nephew, and driven to escape, Laura concludes bitterly that, “Nothing was left her but this sour field. Even this was not truly hers, for here also Titus walked beside her and called her Aunt Lolly. She was powerless against him. He had no idea how he had havocked her peace of mind, he was making her miserable in the best of faith” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 149). Well-intentioned and even kind, the ruin that Titus brings with him is devastating nonetheless; he lacks the awareness to even detect any resentment in his aunt, who for him is illegible precisely because he has already determined what he will find written upon her countenance. Indeed, when she is with him, “she came to heel and resumed her old employment of being Aunt Lolly.” Blocked both by him and, more powerfully, by her own helpless submission to her former identity as the obliging spinster aunt, Laura determines that “There was no way out.”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		    In vain she had tried to escape, transient and delusive had been her ecstasies of relief. She had thrown away twenty years of her life like a handful of old rags, but the wind had blown them back again, and dressed her in the old uniform. The wind blew steadily from the old quarter, it was the same east wind that chivied bits of waste paper down Apsley Terrace. And she was the same old Aunt Lolly, so useful and obliging and negligible.

<p class="continued">
		    The field becomes full of “complacent witnesses” in the form of her relations, who, in her imagination, express surprise to find her in this field, struck by the incongruity of her presence in this dim and sultry place, which, in its triangular shape and enclosure on two sides by woodland, takes on a “premature twilight, as though it were a room” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 141). Laura stands “at bay, trembling before them, shaken and sick with the grinding anger of the slave. They were come out to recapture her, they had tracked her down and closed her in. They had let her run a little way—that was all—for they knew they could get her back when they chose. They had stood grinning behind the bushes when she wept in the cowslip field” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 150).
		  </p>
<p>
		    Laura feels them closing in about her, condescending and malevolent, magnanimous and cruelly gleeful in their good intentions, with Titus standing somewhat detached “like a showman” saying, “‘You see, it’s all right. She’s just the same’.” She sees them “all leagued against her. They were come out to seize her soul. They were invulnerably sure of their prey” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 151). Hemmed in by these res, which both comically and terrifyingly obtain the grinning status of the beasts in Fuseli’s painting, with the field transformed into the site of some violation that has already occurred and which has yet to happen, Laura cries out for help against this pressure of claustrophobic inevitability (a pressure so powerfully conveyed by Fuseli’s painting), the sound of her own voice frightening her, echoing in the “impassive wood.” She waits for an answer to her cry yet hears none; however, “the silence that had followed it had been so intent, so deliberate, that it was like a pledge. If any listening power inhabited this place; if any grimly favourable power had been evoked by her cry; then surely a compact had been made, and the pledge irrevocably given” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 151). Thus is her pact with Satan made, unspoken yet understood. Conjured up and transposed from a bedchamber to a sour field that resembles a room, Fuseli’s painting takes on a new life, one in which Laura’s family members become the perpetrators of some unthinkable crime, as invasive as the bestial creatures that impose their presence upon the sleeping re in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Nightmare</span>, becoming both leering witnesses and benevolent oppressors. In this version, though, the woman is awake and not asleep, not silent but forced to cry out, answered by an intent silence, falling out of a private nightmare into a sleepwalking state that offers some means of liberation from the pressing realities she seeks to escape.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Considered in retrospect, an earlier scene in <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span> also seems to call forth and transform Fuseli’s painting, removing it from its frame and challenging its status as an object of possession. Laura climbs to the top of Cubbey Ridge one night on a solitary walk, soon after her move to Great Mop, and feels “the wind swoop down to the earth. The moon was out hunting overhead, her pack of black and white hounds ranged over  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the sky.” Listening to the voices of the wind through the trees, Laura hears “another voice,” the “far-off pulsation of a goods train labouring up a steep cutting”:
		  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		      It was scarcely audible, more perceptible as feeling than as sound, but by its regularity it dominated all the other voices. It seemed to come nearer and nearer, to inform her like the drumming of blood in her ears. She began to feel defenseless, exposed to the possibility of an overwhelming terror. She listened intently, trying not to think. Though the noise came from an ordinary goods train, no amount of reasoning could stave off this terror. She must yield herself, yield up all her attention, if she would escape. It was a wicked sound. It expressed something eternally outcast and reprobated by man, stealthily trafficking by night, unseen in the dark cleft of the hills. Loud, separate, and abrupt, each pant of the engine trampled down her wits.
		    </p>
<div class="attrib">
		      (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 122–23)
		    </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		      While Laura is exposed on a ridge rather than lying asleep in her room, and is again extremely alert rather than dangerously unconscious, this scene evokes the sublime, erotic terror and sense of fatality we find in Fuseli’s painting. Animated with sound, the panting goods train is as terrific a beast as the grinning goblin or glaring mare of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Nightmare</span>, or the pressing members of her own family whom she envisions closing in upon her, out to “seize on her soul.”
		    </p>
<p>
		      Yet there is a significant difference between Laura’s “nightmare” here and the one depicted by Fuseli. Laura realizes on the ridge that she “was alone, just as in her dreams, and the terror had come to keep her company, and crouched by her side, half in fawning, half in readiness to pounce.” She asks, in a curiously antiquated diction, “What was this cabal of darkness, suborning her own imagination to plot against her?” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 124). The outward scene mirrors the “secret country of her mind” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 123) and is thus both familiar and strange. Laura is not only frightened but also delighted by the train; she is both hunter and hunted, trapped with her wits trampled down and yet not only mistress of the desolate countryside (outward and inward) but “mistress, too, of the terror that roamed over the blank fields and haunted round her” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 123). She possesses, in other words, a power to experience pleasure that revisions the gendered relations of power evident in Fuseli’s painting of a prostrate female subject. Thus when we learn of Titus’s planned biography in the following section of the novel and reenvision <span style="font-style:italic;">The Nightmare</span> as it unfolds within the dim field occupied by Laura, I would argue that we are also led back to this vividly pictured, highly sensual scene, which in its turn ripples forward to the site of Laura’s transformation into a witch, allowing us to discern there an element of pleasure and even power in its vision of entrapment. Her experience in this field, we can now more clearly discern, offers a negative image of irrationality and sublimity that counters the pastoral, picturesque frame (“a pastoral landscape where an aunt walked out with her nephew”) that Titus’s presence in Great Mop places around her. She is trapped yet able to transform her condescending family into bestial hunters of her soul. Later, in her extended speech to Satan, she tells him to think “what a compliment” he pays a woman, “pursuing her soul, lying in wait for it, following it through all its windings, crafty and patient and secret like a gentleman out killing tigers. Her soul—when no one else would give a look at her body even!  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> And they are all so accustomed, so sure of her!” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 214). Able to be both hunted and hunter, prey and mistress of the terror she feels, Laura, as the narrative performs its delicate visual transactions, steps beyond any pastoral or even gothic frame. Each iteration of Fuseli’s image interfuses and interpenetrates the other in a way that challenges Titus’s masculine possessiveness, or indeed any firm possession of a work of art as a mere object to be catalogued, fixed, framed, and hung on a wall. The reprobate and stealthy goods train that Laura hears, however mundane, potentially loaded with cabbages making their way to “their bourne at Apsley Terrace,” offers a means of stepping outside the realm of the comfortable, tame, and domestic as well as the realm of powerless subjection into a world where familiar spirits can be sent forth to individuals at the command of Satan.

<h1 class="sec-headA">The Witch-Finder Generall and the Satanic Imagination</h1>
<p>
		      Warner’s play with Fuseli lies just beneath the surface of the text, as if the artist’s painting, like Leonardo’s, is reflected in the dim waters of the greenhouse tank, conjured and transformed, rippling backwards and forwards, yet never completely illuminated. There is, however, one work of art that is explicitly described in <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span>: a woodcut illustration of Matthew Hopkins, famously known as the “Witch-Finder Generall,” as he is labeled in the image that initially accompanied Hopkins’s pamphlet, “The Discovery of Witches” (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>).
		    </p>
<p>
		      After Laura’s cry of desperation and her sense that she has been heard by, and has entered into a pact with, Satan, she returns to her lodgings (in her sleep-walking state) to find that she is not alone there. She has been joined by a nearly starving “little rag-and-bone kitten with absurdly large ears” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 157), which, after biting her hand and sucking her blood, behaves like any normal kitten. Laura immediately and matter-of-factly recognizes the kitten as her familiar spirit, sent to her by the “Prince of Darkness” as a “sign of the bond between them” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 156). When Titus later asks what Laura will name the kitten, she recalls
		    </p>

			a picture she had seen long ago in one of the books at Lady Place. The book was about the persecution of witches, and the picture was a woodcut of Matthew Hopkins the witch-finder. Wearing a large hat he stood among a coven of witches, bound cross-legged upon their stools. Their confessions came out of their mouths upon scrolls. “My imp’s name is Ilemauzar,” said one; and another imp at the bottom of the page, an alert, ill-favoured cat, so lean and muscular that it looked like a skinned hare, was called “Vinegar Tom.”

			Laura decides to call the kitten “Vinegar,” and upon hearing its name, it pricks up its ears as if in recognition. In a characteristic manner, the flattened pictorial plane of the illustration, described in a moment of ekphrasis in the novel, is literally reanimated by Warner in the living form of the playful kitten.

<p>
			While Laura’s act of naming the kitten would seem to be an Adamic or God-like one, which would further unsettle a patriarchal system of power, her act is not located in the power of the Logos. It is certainly not compelled, as is the case with the witches whose confessions come “out of their mouths upon scrolls” in the woodcut. Instead, her power is transformative, conjuring and reanimating a two-dimensional image into a three-dimensional being within the narrative, reflecting the work that the novel itself performs in its play with works of art. Warner’s imagination in this, her first novel, is far more aligned with Satan’s than with God’s. It is one of memory and witness rather than creating (or naming) out of nothing. As Laura muses, there “remaineth a rest” for the people of Satan as for those of God:
		      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">

			  Held fast in that strong memory no wild thing could be shaken, no secret covert destroyed, no haunt of shadow and silence laid open. The goods yard at Paddington, for instance—a savage place! as holy and enchanted as ever it had been. Not one of the monuments and tinkerings of man could impose on the satanic mind. The Vatican and the Crystal Palace, and all the neat human nest-boxes in rows, Balham and Fulham and the Cromwell Road—he saw through them, they went flop like card-houses, the bricks were earth again, and the steel girders burrowed shrieking into the veins of earth, and the dead timber was restored to the ghostly groves. Wolves howled through the streets of Paris, the foxes played in the throne-room of Schönbrunn, and in the basement at Apsley Terrace, the mammoth slowly revolved, trampling out its lair.

			  Anticipating Lucy Swithin’s flights of “imaginative reconstruction” as depicted by Virginia Woolf in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> , this passage restores wildness, savagery, and the natural state of things to civilized and domesticated spaces, superimposing one upon the other. Like Woolf, Warner demonstrates a keen “awareness of the simultaneity of the prehistoric in our present moment”; yet for Warner this awareness is only possible within the memory of Satan, which “was too long, too retentive; there was no appeasing its witness, no hoodwinking it with the present” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 221).<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> The satanic imagination is one that does not forget, and as a result of this act of witnessing, restores the past in the present—a restorative power that poignantly calls to Laura, who has spent the prime of her life living an existence not her own. It is a power to reanimate and transform rather than create out of nothingness; it relies upon multiple visions and re-visions, and is a form of narrative magic practiced by Laura’s landlady, Mrs. Leak, as she conjures her neighbors for Laura through telling their stories. Thus witchcraft in <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span> is more than a mere fantastic element or a useful tool for political allegory; rather, it can be read as an aesthetic principle that mirrors the author’s own and which demands of the reader a retentive memory—to be, that is, on the side of Satan. All this is not to deny the impressive creative force of Warner’s work in <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span>, but to underscore its transformative principle of reanimation, which allows in the shifting from one shape to another, the rippling from one reflection to another, of the displacement from one plane to another, works of art or women some means of eluding the grasp of masculine possession.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
			  In her female appropriation and dispossession of male art (as opposed to the male appropriation of female art that Carol Christ explores in Victorian necrophilic poetry and portraiture) Warner, in her “storyteller’s voice, droll, discomfiting, serene and implacable,” as Beer wonderfully describes it, animates the fixed pictorial image.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Transposed out of their two-dimensional plane, paintings or prints escape the boundaries of their frame or original context and take on a new narrative life that mischievously unsettles and disrupts their original. While at the novel’s conclusion Laura remains under her “Master” Satan’s indifferent possession, the alignment of the narrative’s technique with the satanic imagination indicates a profound indifference <span style="font-style:italic;">to</span> ownership, which Laura embodies. Titus’s “discriminating paw” that attempts to stroke the landscape as if it were a female body is thus nothing more than a paw making an empty gesture. Since what it seeks to grasp cannot ultimately be destroyed or forgotten, can indeed be summoned and given new life—multiple lives, shapes, and forms—by one who can call it forth, the power dynamic behind possession is evacuated, its dominating force deflated. In rewriting the novelistic imagination and exploring the arts of dispossession with a marvelous slyness and subtlety, Warner moves <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span> beyond a feminist manifesto into the realm of narrative witchcraft, offering a radical perspective on the work of art and the work of the novel.

Morell’s photograph foregrounds and intensifies the sense of movement in the pose of the Lady with her ermine, as well as the desire to touch and possess, including a hand (of the photographer?) that probes and touches both the image of the ermine and also the enlarged hand of the woman that holds it, as if to break through the surface of the image—a desire that is partially achieved yet deflected.

      In 2007, the New York Public Library ran an exhibition, “Russia Imagined 1825–1925: The Art and Impact of Fedor Solntsev,” which provided an illuminating view of the beginnings of Russia’s folk art revival. Solntsev was best known for <span style="font-style:italic;">Antiquities of the Russian State</span> , a lavish illustrated catalogue of ancient and medieval artifacts from the Kremlin treasuries. Funded personally by Nikolai I, Solntsev’s catalogue pioneered the use of medieval forms as a means of articulating a distinct national culture. In his inventories and paintings, the artist combined such disparate elements as Scythian weapons, ancient Greek statuary, Byzantine regalia, and medieval manuscripts “into a single, palpable vision of Russian history, a cross section of culture, geography, and time.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>
      The curator of the exhibition Wendy Salmond convincingly argues that Solntsev created a unified synthesis of the cultures that existed before Peter the Great’s westernizing reforms of the eighteenth century. Moreover, as the basis for what became known as the “Old Russian” style, Solntsev’s revivalist vision was an enduring one. What was most striking, however, was how effectively Solntsev’s version of “Old Russia” served the interests of the imperial state, creating an ideological union of pre- and post-imperial Russia. As Salmond writes, Solntsev’s work betrays “an overwhelming emphasis on the hierarchy, symbols, and rites of the Orthodox Church and the Romanov dynasty,” that was designed to “[bind] the peoples of the Russian Empire together around a single ‘Great Russian idea’.”<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>
      The seamless bond between “Old Russia” and absolute monarchy that Solntsev achieved for Nikolai I was often imitated,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> but by the twentieth century such an ideological synthesis was unsustainable. In 1913, Nikolai II presided over numerous lavish events planned to celebrate the tercentenary of the Romanov dynasty. One such event, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition of Cottage Industries</span>, notably echoed the ambitions of Solntsev’s albums by attempting to forge a connection, through visual and material culture, between the legitimacy of the autocrat and the authenticity of “Old Russia.” However, the negative critical response to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span> is evidence that the unified understanding of antiquity and nationality that was created under Nikolai I could no longer be maintained. While the preoccupation with antiquity as a medium of collective identity continued and even grew after Solntsev’s time, the question of what constituted antiquity, and whose traditions were represented, became a point of contention rather than unification.
    </p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Second All-Russian Exhibition</span> was an indication of the failure of the “Great Russian idea” attributed to Solntsev and Nikolai I. Despite its commercial and popular success, the exhibition garnered scathing reviews from both the liberal newspaper <span style="font-style:italic;">Speech</span> and the modern art journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Apollo</span>, both of which were important forums for progressive public opinion. In addition, other exhibitions of folk art that occurred at the same time, such as Mikhail Larionov’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span>, formed an implicit critique of the role of autocracy in “Old Russia.” While liberal and progressive critics outlined the glaring paradoxes of imperial folk revivalism, Larionov presented an alternative vision of “Old Russia” and its relevance to modernity.

	On the afternoon of 10 March 1913, the most powerful men in Russia (with the exception of the Emperor himself) gathered at the grand neoclassical halls of the Imperial Botanical gardens in Saint Petersburg to celebrate the opening of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span>.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Under the patronage of the Empress Aleksandra and organized by the Grand Duke of Oldenburg, the exhibition was part of a series of public spectacles celebrating the tercentenary of the Romanov dynasty.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> The exhibition’s pavilions were filled with all manner of luxury goods, from embroidery produced at the state-run School of Folk Art in Saint Petersburg, to toys from the private Sergiev-Posad workshops, to furniture and carpets produced by the workshops administered by regional councils (<span style="font-style:italic;">zemstva</span>). (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>) Tsar Nikolai himself visited the exhibition on 22 March and was regaled with gifts, but the Emperor’s stamp of approval was not needed to prompt the public to fall in love with the motley display.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Even on the first day, when only the press and people of high social rank were admitted, many of the objects proudly displayed tickets declaring them sold (L, 3). The exhibition opened to the general public three days later, and, even though it was a workday, 1,600 entry tickets were sold by the afternoon.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> The Secretary of State used such statistics to claim a great victory for imperial leadership in Russian crafts.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>
	The passion for Russian folk art took on a different cast when it was staged by the avant-garde painter Larionov. On 24 March, just two days after the Emperor’s visit to the Botanical Gardens, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span> (templates for icon  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> painters and broadsheet prints) opened in Moscow. In a small private gallery, this exhibition had none of the imperial pedigree or regalia of its Petersburg contemporary. Instead of luxury craft goods housed in neoclassical grandeur, the Moscow exhibition displayed far more modest items, crowded into a relatively small space.

</div>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span> was organized by Larionov in conjunction with a group exhibition of avant-garde painting called <span style="font-style:italic;">The Target</span>. The two opened simultaneously in neighboring rooms in Anna Mikhailova’s Salon. At <span style="font-style:italic;">The Target</span>, Larionov exhibited his series of ethnic <span style="font-style:italic;">Venuses</span> and his lubki-inspired <span style="font-style:italic;">Seasons</span>.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> More importantly, both Larionov and his partner, Natalya Goncharova, presented their primarily abstract rayist canvases, an avant-garde gauntlet thrown down in defiance of traditionalists. Across the hall, at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span>, on the other hand, Larionov presented these far more traditional objects, many of which were from his own collection.
      </p>
<p>
	Although Larionov’s exhibitions relied on the contrast between the avant-garde and the traditional, his presentation of the icons and lubki also presented a stark contrast with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span> in Petersburg. The presentations of folk and traditional art at these exhibitions demonstrated the disparity between imperial and avant-garde narratives of national character. Like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span> took advantage of urban Russians’ desire to view examples of “authentic” national art. The framework of this nostalgia, however,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> differed fundamentally from one event to the other. The contrast between the imperial and avant-garde displays of folk art indicated that modernity and the primitive were not simple terms with stable associations. Instead, the politics of late imperial Russia demanded to know what kind of “primitive” was at stake, in order to know what kind of modernity was being forwarded.
      </p>
<p>
	Pairing the icons and lubki with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Target</span>, Larionov, Goncharova, and their cohort connected these traditional and archaic forms with the most advanced art then found in Russia. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Target</span> was intended as an assault on public taste; Larionov’s and Goncharova’s rayist paintings were a provocation that went far beyond the “Cézannist” pictures of their rivals in the Jack of Diamonds, a modernist group to which both Larionov and Goncharova had previously belonged. At the debate organized to publicize the exhibition, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Target</span> speakers condemned their Jack of Diamonds rivals as timid dilettantes. Entitled, “The East, Nationality, and the West,” the debate demonstrated the strange mixture of nationalism, primitivism, and Futurism that characterized the group. Aleksandr Shevchenko began with a lecture on the negative influence of the West on Russian art, contending that Russian art was closer to Eastern and Asian visual culture. Ilya Zdanevich, on the other hand, sang the praises of telephones, trolley cars, and airplanes, proposing that a patent-leather shoe was more beautiful than the Venus de Milo. Both called for nationalism and a final break with the West.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Like the Jack of Diamonds dispute the year before, this evening ended with a brawl and was closed by the police. Larionov and Goncharova, who were deemed responsible for the breakdown and disorder, were arrested and later convicted for disturbing the peace.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> As part of this oppositional <span style="font-style:italic;">Target</span> program, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span> was explicitly anti-academic. And unlike the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span> in Petersburg, Larionov’s icons and lubki in no way celebrated the imperial family’s dynastic anniversary.
      </p>
<p>
	The pointed contrast between the two events raises a series of questions about the role of folk art in the period. How could traditional peasant crafts serve as an argument for the legitimacy of Romanov autocracy in Saint Petersburg, while in Moscow the same category of objects was forwarded by those who claimed to challenge these existing authorities? The objects in themselves may not be able to answer the question, but the logic of the organizers and, especially, the critical reception of the two exhibitions, give a clearer picture. To its critics, the imperial exhibition was transparent autocratic propaganda. Larionov’s icons and lubki, on the other hand, should also be seen in the context of critics and artists who were trying to rethink the concept of authentic national expression as an instrument of political opposition. The organizers of the two exhibitions did not only disagree on what folk art was or how it should be presented, but also on the question of what the “folk” or nationality itself was, and how it could be reified through visual culture.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Critique of the Petrine Reforms and the Russian Folk Art Revival</h1>
<p>
	Despite their differences, the organizers of the imperial exhibition, the schools and workshops whose products were displayed there, and the avant-garde artists who presented the icons and lubki did have one important thing in common: their inheritance of the principles of the nineteenth-century folk art revival. Like craft revivals in other European countries, the Russian revival was a response to crises of collective identity in the face of dramatic economic change. The Russian folk art and craft revival, though, was rife with internal contradictions, partly responsible for the split evidenced by the 1913 exhibitions.
      </p>
<p>
	While Solntsev provided a formal template for the antiquarian and ethnographic bases of the Russian folk art revival, the movement was also a material manifestation of a broad critique of post-Petrine Russia. By the 1880s it was commonplace for educated Russians to believe that Peter the Great’s eighteenth-century reforms (introducing European educational institutions, dress, social customs, and reforming both the Russian language and the Russian Orthodox church) had stripped Russia’s educated classes of any recognizable Russian identity. The identification of pre-Petrine culture with authentic Russianness was an idea with its own distinct intellectual history. Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries official imperial culture cleaved to the idea of Peter I as the founder of the Russian nation. At the same time, however, many major res in Russian thought were beginning to have doubts about the efficacy of Peter’s reforms. As early as 1810, Russia’s first major historian, Nikolai Karamzin, formulated a critique of Peter’s reform that would shape the folk art revival that developed later in the century. By forcing the populace to change their native dress and customs, Karamzin said, Peter enacted a violation of human rights, an act of violence and humiliation. Karamzin’s view of national identity as a human right reflected broader trends within European political philosophy, but he was also among the first to identify Peter’s reforms as a split within the Russian nation:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  Until [Peter’s] reign all Russians, from the plow to the throne, had been alike insofar as they shared certain features of external appearance and of customs. After Peter, the higher classes separated themselves from the lower ones, and the Russian peasant, burgher, and merchant began to treat the Russian gentry as Germans, thus weakening the spirit of brotherly national unity binding the estates of the realm.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Karamzin introduced the idea that Peter’s reforms created an insurmountable rift between the gentry and the masses, the former embodying modern Russia and the latter preserving antiquity. Karamzin’s argument is borne out by the views of the lower classes themselves. From the period of Peter’s reign itself, popular literature, illustrations, and folklore tended to represent Peter as, at best, a foreign usurper, and, at worst, the Antichrist himself.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>
	A generation later, more radical writers expanded upon Karamzin’s critique. Not only were the classes separated by this cultural rift, but the upper classes were more or less devoid of any true culture at all. In 1836, Petr Chaadaev shocked the Russian  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> intelligentsia with his categorically nihilist understanding of Russian history. In his “Philosophical Letter” he described the Russian nation as a historical and cultural black hole, one that “only adopted deceiving appearances and useless luxury from all the things that others have thought out . . . .” Speaking of Peter, Chaadaev said, “One time, a great man wanted to civilize us, and in order to give us a foretaste of enlightenment, he threw us the cloak of civilization: we took up the cloak but did not so much as touch civilization.”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> The westernization of Russia was not only limited in its demographics. Even the aristocracy, bureaucracy, and bourgeoisie who had taken up Peter’s reforms had done so only in the most superficial way. According to Chaadaev, the Russian gentry turned “great truths” into “useless luxuries”; they wore the cloak Peter gave them, but did not touch the substance.
      </p>
<p>
	Both Chaadaev’s and Karamzin’s observations led logically to even starker views of the relationship between the Russian people and the Russian state. The slavophile Konstantin Aksakov referred to Peter’s reforms as “a dangerous and deep-rooted ulcer in the body of our Russia.” Describing the process of westernization Peter imposed on the population, Aksakov argued: “Thus was accomplished the rift between the tsar and his people . . . thus there arose in the place of the previous bond the yoke of the state over the land. The Russian land became, as it were, conquered territory and the state was the conqueror.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> To Karamzin’s notion of the split between the masses and the intelligentsia, and to Chaadaev’s assertion that the Russian intelligentsia were lacking in culture altogether, Aksakov added the provocative claim that Russia was a nation colonized by its own state. With this extended critique of Peter’s reforms, the idea of Russian history as split into Petrine and Muscovite, modern and ancient, European and Asian, rational and spiritual, superficial and authentic, settled into the intellectual ether.
      </p>
<p>
	The negative reassessment of Peter’s reforms, and the resulting belief that only the peasantry had retained native Russian traditions and sensibilities, was most powerfully articulated in the folk art revival. The revival was an attempt to encourage and preserve the physical manifestations of the supposedly authentic Russian culture of the rural masses. In addition to the critique of Europeanization and the belief in the authenticity of the peasantry, the folk art revivalists were prompted by a new sense of urgency. The survival of peasant culture, as they knew it, was threatened by new economic and political forces. Although the abolition of serfdom in 1861 earned Alexander II the title of “Tsar Liberator,” the so-called liberation just as often increased the level of hardship experienced by the rural peasantry. Combined with the beginning of industrialization in Russia, the conditions of liberation encouraged economic migration to urban centers. Considering that, in 1851, less than eight percent of the Russian population lived in cities or towns, urbanization constituted a traumatic change for Russian social life.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> As the old feudal estates began to disintegrate, the traditional estate-based crafts, such as lacemaking, embroidery, pottery, and woodworking, also lost their institutional base. In the 1870s and 1880s, founders of the folk art revival, such as Vladimir Stasov and Elena Polenova, warned that these arts were in danger of permanent extinction; the physical objects that embodied the essence of the Russian nation, they claimed, would be lost forever.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	Subsequently, various private and state-run initiatives were developed to prevent this predicted extermination of national spirit. At the Abramtsevo estate near Moscow, Saava and Elizaveta Mamontov set up craft workshops in an attempt to maintain traditional labor and economic structures. Princess Maria Tenisheva exercised similar efforts at Talashkino, her estate near Vitebsk. Without such opportunities, revivalists argued, the younger members of the local peasantry would migrate to the city to work in industry, losing their native culture.
      </p>
<p>
	The state also took part in this attempt to revive craft as a rural industry, both to help maintain traditional social structures and as a way to supplement agriculture in the face of drought and natural disasters. With growing peasant unrest and the rise of violent political dissent in the cities, the amelioration of rural poverty was an urgent matter. Local and regional administrations set up land management and crafts distribution channels that encouraged the development of urban markets for traditional crafts, thereby establishing a viable crafts industry in the countryside.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>
	In 1905, the imperial state expanded upon these local efforts by establishing the Chief Administration of Agriculture and Land Tenure (GUZZ), a section of the Ministry of Agriculture dedicated to supporting peasant craft industries. In 1913, the GUZZ was the primary organizing body of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span> and of one of its most important exhibitors, the School of Folk Art. Like the Abramtsevo and Talashkino workshops before it, the School of Folk art was dedicated to helping young peasants and workers gain the skills necessary to make marketable crafts—skills that they were no longer learning from their own community. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span> thus had an economic as well as ideological purpose. In addition to celebrating the Romanov tercentenary, the exhibition advertised the products of rural cottage industry. This was a necessary step because, in order to compete with cheaper factory-made goods, craft items needed to be understood as aesthetically and ethically superior. The state itself had an interest in promoting the folk art revival—making craft objects fashionable and desirable was a political and economic imperative.
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Folk Art Revival and the Nationalities Question</h1>
<p>
	By promoting the authenticity and national integrity of peasant crafts, the GUZZ attempted to help craft goods compete in the marketplace, but the correlation of peasant crafts with the Romanov tercentenary had its own ideological function as well. The GUZZ was founded in the height of the unrest that followed Bloody Sunday (9 January 1905) when imperial troops killed hundreds of unarmed strikers attempting to deliver a petition to the Emperor.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Struggling to bring back a modicum of order, as well as heal the increasingly bitter divide between the state and civil society, Nikolai II’s regime introduced a number of reforms. Although the most important was the so-called October Manifesto, which promised civil rights and an elected legislature, enhanced state support for rural crafts was a significant part of the government’s campaign to restore its credibility.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	The importance of the rural aspects of the 1905 revolution should not be underestimated. Though the unrest began with massive general strikes in larger cities like Warsaw, Saint Petersburg, and Moscow, the destruction or seizure by peasants of state and privately held lands was one of the most common forms of dissent during the period (<span style="font-style:italic;">R</span>, 52–56, 139–45). It was therefore urgent that the state address the concerns of the peasantry, who were plagued by crushing land management and taxation policies, as well as drought and other natural disasters.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> In other words, what was under extreme duress in 1905 was the supposedly sacred bond between Tsar and people that Solntsev had so successfully conveyed in his works for Nikolai I. It was this mystical bond that provided the justification for Romanov autocracy. The politics of the GUZZ and its activities, such as the 1913 exhibition, are therefore reasonably transparent: Nikolai II’s regime, with the establishment of the GUZZ and the promotion of rural crafts, was attempting to ideologize away the rift between the Emperor and the “real” Russian people, that is, the non-westernized peasantry.
      </p>
<p>
	The organization and literature surrounding the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span> revealed the ways the imperial state hoped to make folk art serve their interests. In a 1911 address to the All-Russian Crafts Congress, Adrian Prakhov, a professor at the Imperial Academy of Art and a frequent spokesman for the GUZZ, declared, “The artistic education of the common people can have only one goal—allowing the national spirit in all its purity to be expressed in artistic form.”<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> In this statement Prakhov expressed the early revivalist belief that fundamental cultural renewal (the expression of a national spirit) could be coaxed through institutional structures (crafts education). Bureaucrats like Prakhov tried to assimilate the early populist tendencies of the craft revival into the policies of the imperial state. The idea of folk authenticity was, for a time, powerful enough to reconcile Prakhov’s paradoxical claim to authentic folk expression through state intervention.
      </p>
<p>
	However, in his essay introducing the catalogue for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span>, Prakhov revealed that the imperial state had even more pressing obstacles in their creation of imperial nationality than the philosophical hypocrisy of the folk art revival. Explaining the choice of works illustrated in the enormous exhibition catalogue, Prakhov wrote:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	  The selection of examples printed in the eighty-eight plates . . . thought by the [GUZZ] to be the “exhibition of honor” of the best artistic peasant crafts goods—was made without bias. The goods were chosen exclusively for their distinctiveness and aesthetic attraction. The result, it turns out, is that the Great Russian provinces, which are grouped around . . . Moscow, have contributed eighty-four drawings to the book; Little Russia [Ukraine], the center that is second in significance, gave thirty-nine drawings; the Caucasus and the Asian regions gave twenty-two; the Southern provinces of European Russia gave seven; the Polish Kingdom—six, Finland—six.
	</p>
<p>
	  The numbers speak for themselves and confirm the lasting impressions received from visits to the exhibition.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Prakhov’s claim—that the “exhibition of honor” was chosen on the basis of merit, or “distinctiveness,” alone, and for that reason the ethnic Russian works should naturally form the majority—was inherently suspicious. Prakhov’s transparent ethnic Russian chauvinism should be read in terms of the broader imperial treatment of the “nationalities question.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> In such a multinational state as Russia, the status of the ethnic minorities had been a constant source of conflict, and tensions had only increased by the late nineteenth century. In 1897 the state carried out the first complete census of the empire. When the data was finally fully published in 1904, the results showed that ethnic Russians made up less than half the population of the Russian empire. The spiritual ideal of the Russian nation therefore faced a double threat of obliteration: economic destruction of the peasants (the only authentic Russians) on the one hand, and the waning of ethnic dominance through natural demographic change on the other.
      </p>
<p>
	Prakhov’s comments on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span> demonstrate that the anxiety over the “nationalities question” could be used to reconcile the appropriation of a populist argument by the imperial state. In an essay accompanying an earlier exhibition of craft arts, Prakhov explained that the purpose of developing a “national spirit” was, “Not to imitate a pre-existing foreign [culture] but to raise one’s own profoundly national one to universal significance—that is the task of those nations whom Providence has ordained for greatness; and it is the task of the [ethnic] Russian people.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> In this formulation, craft is both a concrete manifestation of authentic national spirit and a guarantor of continued ethnic Russian hegemony in the Empire. Prakhov was reformulating the folk art revival. It was no longer a search for an authentic expression of a formerly repressed national character, but a careful shaping and controlling of that expression to reflect a particular kind of national character—one that would enforce the hegemony of a minority ethnicity while helping to justify continued autocratic rule.
      </p>
<p>
	The situation became even more pressing in the period surrounding the 1905 revolution. While this revolution is often understood as a call for political and civil rights for the lower and middle classes, the “nationalities question” was central to the supposedly universal concerns of democracy and the rule of law. Though many factors contributed to the widespread rebellions of 1905, the question of “national spirit” was in fact a vital point of revolutionary discord. For centuries, the social and political rights for which the 1905 revolutionaries agitated had been distributed along ethnic and national lines. National groups within the empire had largely differing degrees of political autonomy—different rights to travel, own property, and use their own language.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> In his authoritative account of the 1905 revolution, Abraham Ascher admits that, “it is not easy to separate the national from the social and political factors” in determining the cause of various instances of unrest (<span style="font-style:italic;">R</span>, 47). In truth, some of the non-Russian nationalities were already engaged in full-scale revolt before Bloody Sunday, the event that supposedly set off the revolution (<span style="font-style:italic;">RE</span>, 330).<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>
	The political landscape in the aftermath of the 1905 revolution was also deeply affected by the “nationalities question.” Several of the reform measures were national in character: on 21 October 1905 (four days after the October Manifesto), the government granted amnesty to all political prisoners, a move which largely favored the Poles, 1,511  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of whom were being held in Warsaw alone. The next day the state restored autonomy to the Kingdom of Finland (which had been put under direct Russian control in 1899), and in November 1905 the administration added 133 towns to the Pale of Settlement for Jews (<span style="font-style:italic;">R</span>, 80–81). The most important reform, the establishment of an elected legislative body (the Duma), began a political process that further demonstrated the growing power of the non-<span style="font-style:italic;">russkii</span> Russians—220 out of the approximately 490 elected members of the first Duma were not ethnic Russians (<span style="font-style:italic;">RE</span>, 341). Their power actually exceeded their numbers, as the Constitutional Democrats (Kadets), the political party with the largest plurality, relied on the national factions to create a majority voting bloc.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>
	The revolution ushered in a new era of national consciousness among the minorities and civic engagement among the populace as a whole, yet it likewise prompted a huge backlash against non-Russian national groups. The October Manifesto, published on 17 October 1905, declared that all citizens of the empire had inviolability of person, freedom of conscience, speech, assembly, and association. It also announced the distribution of voting rights to formerly disenfranchised classes of people, and the imminent election of the Duma, without which, the manifesto declared, no law could be passed (<span style="font-style:italic;">R</span>, 74). If the October Manifesto had actually been implemented as written, it would have meant the end of Romanov autocracy and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy. Public reaction to the new system was immediate. On 18 October the celebrations that filled the streets were met by an orgy of violence against Jews and other national minorities. The violence threw the country back into a state of anarchy as extreme as that which the Manifesto had been designed to quell (<span style="font-style:italic;">R</span>, 81–82). What is important here is that the supposedly universal ideals of political or democratic rights were, in fact, closely linked to the imperial hierarchy of nationalities. Such reactionary groups as the Union of Russian People and the Black Hundreds saw a natural link between the defence of autocracy and the defence of ethnic Russian dominance.
      </p>
<p>
	Official complicity with anti-minority violence was seemingly confirmed by the government’s actions following the revolutionary period. After the dissolution of the second Duma on 3 June 1907, Prime Minister Petr Stolypin severely curtailed the voting rights of non-propertied citizens and national minorities. This was only the beginning of a far-reaching official backlash against the nationalities. In 1910, Finnish autonomy was again revoked and periodicals were banned from publishing in Ukrainian (<span style="font-style:italic;">RE</span>, 343–44). Agrarian reform, which had been initiated partly to prevent further revolutionary unrest among the peasantry, was enlisted as part of the broad anti-minority policy. In Central Asia, the distribution of land to formerly landless peasants was made at the great expense of Muslim nomads (<span style="font-style:italic;">RE</span>, 346–47).
      </p>
<p>
	The backlash against liberalism and ethnic nationalities continued during the period of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span>. On 9 February 1911, while the Duma discussed the possibility of dissolving the Pale of Settlement (a first step towards granting Jews rights comparable to other citizens), members of the nobility raised the specter of alleged Jewish blood rituals. This political debate regarding civil rights and nationality policy was followed, in March, by the accusation of a Jewish clerk, Menahem Mendel Beilis, of the ritual murder of a Ukrainian boy in Kiev. With the preponderance of evidence  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> supporting Beilis’s innocence, the state nevertheless continued to press charges. The political circumstances surrounding the trial, the fact that few actually believed Beilis to be guilty, and the obvious corruption of the prosecutors have led historians to point to the Beilis trial as a transparent act of political intimidation against the nationalities and the left in general. The connection between the obscure Jew from Kiev and the political left was further cemented by Vasily Maklakov, a prominent liberal politician who served as Beilis’s defense attorney.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> The trial concluded with Beilis’s acquittal in September 1913, but not before the affair had deepened the split within public opinion.
      </p>
<p>
	With the momentum of political reaction and the Beilis controversy raging in the background, the politics of imperial support for the craft revival take on a new transparency. As the political right tried to identify civil rights and the democratic process as a threat to the “Russian-ness” of the Empire, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span> demonstrated the supposed ethnic superiority of ethnic Russians and served as a justification of imperial autocracy.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Critiques of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition of Cottage Industries</span>
</h1>
<p>
	Within the flood of oppositional journalism that followed the October Manifesto, art criticism played a surprisingly prominent role, and it was art critics who exposed the political paradoxes of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span>. Two reviews of the exhibition, in particular, emphasized its failure to provide convincing narratives of either Russian superiority or national spirit. The first review, in the Kadet-party newspaper, <span style="font-style:italic;">Speech</span>, most clearly demonstrated the conflict between imperial and oppositional claims to the authenticity of a mythologized folk.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> The <span style="font-style:italic;">Speech</span> critic, S. Lyubosh’, directly contradicted Prakhov’s claim that the Russian crafts dominated “without bias” and through quality and “distinctiveness” alone. A viewer’s first impression, Lyubosh’ said, was “that the frontiers and the non-Russian areas in general, presented themselves at this exhibition with a brighter expression of the national character of their art than did native Russia” (L, 3). Lithuanian, Polish, Caucasian, Kirgiz, Ukrainian, and Finnish craftspeople, “hardly exhibited anything without a determined physiognomy”; whereas the Russian workshops often produced goods “completely alien to any folk motif” (L, 3). Lyubosh’s observations were borne out by such works as a carpet depicting medieval Russian knights created in a GUZZ-administered workshop. (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>) The clumsy res in the colorful landscape are closer to stylized art nouveau visions of Russian folklore than to any actual native tradition. The fault lay in the government workshops and schools that had been “improving” Russian crafts for so long. These improvements, Lyubosh’ claimed, “met the demands and interests of the market and developed industry in a direction having nothing in common with the revival of folk style.” In contrast, the non-Russian crafts, like the Polish and Kirgiz carpets displayed at the exhibition, still maintained “national character” in their works because they were immune to the improvements and economic support of the imperial state (L, 3). (<a name="3-text" href="#3">. 3</a> and <a name="4-text" href="#4">4</a>) Prakhov may have claimed “distinctiveness” as the measure of quality that set  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the Russian material apart, but this very criterion was just as easily turned back against the Russian material.

	The premise of Lyubosh’s critique was not entirely new. In a 1911 issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Apollo</span>, Aleksandr Mantel’ complained that the ethnic Russian population of the city of Kazan’ had lost all folk creativity. This was not true, he claimed, of the native Tatar population. Mantel’ attributed this Tatar authenticity to “the closedness and fanatical nationalism which coerces the Tatar to estrange himself from everything Russian. And thank God. Otherwise even these crumbs of folk taste would disappear.”<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

	tension over the “nationalities question.” With the intelligentsia and imperial state “improving” native Russian folk culture into a form beyond recognition, and the repression of native languages, customs, and educational institutions for the non-Russian nationalities, critics like Lyubosh’ and Mantel’ had grounds to fear that any form of authentic national character was destined to be destroyed by imperial policies. Official promotion of so-called “Great Russian” nationality was thus also understood as repressive of authentic nationality in general, including Russian nationality.
      </p>
<p>
	By far the most damning indictment of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span> was also found in <span style="font-style:italic;">Apollo</span>. Here, the critic Georgii Lukomskii mocked the absurd juxtaposition of romantic nostalgia for Russian peasant life with the reality of bourgeois Moscow and Petersburg taste:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  The art of the rural craftsman—a gray hut, the light of a candle, the smell of tar, limewood, bright colors, the measured sound of the joiner’s bench, a doleful song . . . and an empire-style exhibition entryway designed by civil engineer Count de Rochefore, a frieze filled with griffons and imperial attributes, bucranias, ionic capitals and similar details of [posh] Moscow homes.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Lukomskii admitted that Sergei Chekhonin’s exhibition design was well-executed. However, he lamented its lack of authenticity:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	  No matter how successful the decorations are in places, no matter how closely Chekhonin approaches the spirit of Russian folk art, it is nevertheless the work of a cultured Petersburg artist, and one would have wanted to see here exactly the work of craftsmen left to their own devices in decorating the walls, ceilings, etc.
	</p>
<div class="attrib">
	  (GL, 39)
	</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  Moreover, Lukomskii’s words echoed Lyubosh’s in that he blamed this absurd falsity on both the aristocratic assumption of superiority in taste and, just as importantly, the market forces driving the crafts revival:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	    From the general number of displays . . . a part appears to be the fruit of spontaneous fantasy and personal taste (not dictated by a school or by urban manufacturing culture) or else full of the throwbacks of good old traditions; the other, significantly larger part relates to the inventions of our high society ladies . . . .
	  </p>
<p>
	    Of course, the exhibition has once again proven that the granting of full freedom in work and possibly a larger demand on production is what would best of all facilitate the development of folk creativity. However, such a course is deemed insufficiently profitable for the craftsmen, and so we have the schools . . . .
	  </p>
<div class="attrib">
	    (GL, 40)
	  </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    As Lyubosh’ and Lukomskii both implied, most of the craft revival institutions dictated forms according to market demand and at the same time justified their state support by claiming to preserve threatened cultural practices. By 1913, this tension between urban bourgeois taste and the narrative of folk authenticity could no longer be reconciled. Even worse, Lukomskii claimed that the craft revival movement had successfully repressed any possibility of true folk creativity. Speaking of the folk art schools, he said:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	      Culture is sown, advice is given, how to make the things that would be successful for a large public and, most importantly, make a good profit. But with this course, alas, only a second rate art is developed, [an art] adapted to the philistine tastes of the urban dweller. The pedagogical course is the most thoughtless and destructive for the development of the original creativity of the folk! [Judging] by the exemplars exhibited by the School of Folk Art, we clearly see how fruitless is the effort by the city to support old rural traditions in art.
	    </p>
<div class="attrib">
	      (GL, 40)
	    </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      Lukomskii complained that the crafts revival movement had betrayed the reformist impulses of its original primitivist aesthetics: it had abandoned the idea of a folk culture generated outside of the top-down Petrine reforms that had imposed European language and dress on the upper classes. Instead, as many critics pointed out, the new crafts revival shaped folk culture to match the very imperial culture from which it was supposed to differ. This false, packaged manifestation of folk creativity reified a homogenous ethnic Russianness, doing nothing to revive the national spirit squashed by Peter’s reforms.
	    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Larionov and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span>
</h1>
<p>
	      From Prakhov’s catalogue essay, it is clear how the imperial court used the evidence of a peasant creativity strongly identified with the empire to justify autocratic rule. That many on the left understood this agenda is indicated by the criticism forwarded by Lyubosh’ and Lukomskii. The question still remains, however, why the artistic avant-garde also chose folk art to forward its own agenda. Larionov’s exhibition and its accompanying literature, while sharing many of the same precepts as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Speech</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Apollo</span> journalists, presented a startling new appraisal of the role of folk art. In his manifestos and catalogues Larionov outlined an anti-imperial strategy that used the “nationalities question” as a path of anti-autocratic dissent, thereby also challenging the folk art appeal in which autocracy had been packaged.
	    </p>
<p>
	      While the critics attacked the imperial exhibition’s presentation of folk art, Larionov’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span> presented an alternative vision of the folk. The choice of objects was certainly significant here, as icons and lubki each had a particular resonance for the Russian public. Icons were often seen as a symbol of Russia’s inheritance of the legacy of Byzantium, an indication that the Empire had a special divine sanction, and evidence of the spiritual bond between the Russian people and their state. On the other hand, lubki had a distinctly anti-imperial quality, and their use emphasized the opposition between “authentic” and official culture that formed the heart of the above-cited critique of the Petrine reforms.
	    </p>
<p>
	      In addition to the objects themselves, the context in which Larionov situated them was distinct. By pairing the <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span> with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Target</span>, a group effort showcasing the most avant-garde painting in Russia, Larionov attempted to reveal a kinship between the primitive art of icons and lubki and that of himself and his peers.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Larionov’s own writing for the exhibition affirms that he imagined an anti-historical framework for the relationship between folk art, modern art, and national  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> history itself. In this way, Larionov attempted to free folk art and folk identity from the linear historical and geographic conceptions of ethnic identity that were used to rationalize such official demonstrations of national revival as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second All-Russian Exhibition of Cottage Industries</span>.
	    </p>
<p>
	      As the legacy of the folk art revival was one of the most contested arenas of culture in late imperial Russia, it warrants examination as the place that official and avant-garde approaches to the broader problem of national identity were differentiated. Larionov had a long-standing interest and investment in traditional and archaic Russian art and his organization of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span> in March 1913 marked a high point in this dimension of his practice. Larionov established his avant-garde credentials as a founder of the Jack of Diamonds group in 1910 and he demonstrated his interest in ethnic and national identity with paintings of Gypsies and Turks and a series of ethnic <span style="font-style:italic;">Venuses</span> in 1912. However, it was in his practice as a collector, organizer, and spokesman that Larionov best articulated an avant-garde approach to the primitive and to nationality at odds with official and academic positions.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Larionov first emerged as a defender of traditional Russian art in an interview with the newspaper <span style="font-style:italic;">Against the Grain</span>. Asked to comment on the 1911–12 All-Russian Congress of Artists, Larionov insisted that artistic organizations were generally useless—but made an exception for the preservation of icons, an urgent task that artists needed to take up.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Larionov’s comments on artistic organization was probably prompted by his recent split from the Jack of Diamonds group, which planned to solidify their loose association into a formal exhibiting society. Two weeks earlier, in an interview with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Voice of Moscow</span> (Golos Moskvy), Larionov explained that he left the Jack of Diamonds because they were already an academic school. Emphasizing that he still considered himself an “extreme realist,” Larionov underlined that his idea of realism was to use painterly methods to represent the essence of things. The Jack of Diamonds painters were also realists, but they cared about the form, rather than the being, of things. In effect, Larionov claimed that the Jack of Diamonds were realists of the “Repin school.”<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> Little could be more offensive for the self-styled progressives of the Jack of Diamonds than association with what was then seen as the reactionary artistic force of didactic realism, in the person of Ilya Repin.
	    </p>
<p>
	      The break between Larionov and Goncharova and their former Jack of Diamonds comrades was flamboyantly consummated at a public debate organized on the eve of the second Jack of Diamonds exhibition in February 1912. Objecting strongly to the use of her work in a slide lecture on cubism, Goncharova wrote an open letter to several newspapers:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		Cubism is a good thing, although it is not altogether new, especially in Russia. The Scythians, in blessed remembrance, made their stone statuettes in this style, and at our fairs, amazing beautiful wooden dolls are sold. These are sculptural works, but in France, too, Gothic and Negro sculptural representations served as a point of departure for cubism in painting.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      In her comments, Goncharova chose not to reject cubism outright, but rather to reorient it as an authentically Russian tradition rather than as a French innovation. With the creation of their new group, the Donkey’s Tail, Larionov and Goncharova were both asserting their commitment to Russian national art and concurrently distancing themselves from the perceived “westernizing” qualities of other avant-garde painters in Russia. Moreover, by comparing them to the “Repin School,” Larionov managed to accuse the “Jacks” of being derivative of both French modernism and Russian academicism, two categories that had previously been understood as opposed.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>
	      The Donkey’s Tail marked a new clarity on the part of Larionov and Goncharova, especially in the importance and function of “primitive” art, native Russian primitive art in particular, for their own creative processes. Folklore and folk art were already part of the Jack of Diamonds repertoire, but Larionov and Goncharova wanted their new group to have a more authentic, “purer” expression of Russian national art, hence the term “purism” (rather than later monikers such as cubofuturism or neoprimitivism) for this new intransigent faction of the Moscow avant-garde. In an address to the above-mentioned All-Russian Artists’ Congress, the poet Sergei Bobrov claimed that the Russian purists “having overcome Cézanne, Gauguin, and Matisse, have returned to their Russian roots, to Russian archaism.”<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Purism, according to Bobrov, found its sources in
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		our amazing icons—those world-class culminations of Christian religious art, our old lubki, Northern embroideries, stone women, bas-relief on communion bread and crosses, and our old shop signs. There is so much here that is new, touched by no one . . . . Russian purists, having seen all this value, became one with it, penetrated into the very soul of it. Henceforth our native antiquities, our archaism lead us towards unknown prospects.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      Bobrov, Goncharova, and Larionov followed these pronouncements with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Donkey’s Tail</span> Exhibition in March 1912, where Larionov showed primitivizing paintings of soldiers, Turks, and urban street scenes. Goncharova displayed work that corresponded more literally to Bobrov’s description: religious paintings, paintings in the style of lubki and embroideries, and peasant themes. However, while the purists claimed a privileged access to their Russian heritage, these “roots” were hardly recognized as legitimately national—eight of Goncharova’s religious paintings, for example, were confiscated by the state on suspicion of blasphemy.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> This conflict between the avant-garde and officialdom anticipated the more stridently oppositional use of folk art that Larionov engineered in the spring of 1913.
	    </p>
<p>
	      The March 1913 <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span> was a follow-up, of sorts, to the <span style="font-style:italic;">First Exhibition of Lubki</span>, which was organized by Larionov’s friend, the architect Nikolai Vinogradov, and was on display at the Moscow School of Painting in February 1913.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Many of the lubki (especially the 170 from Larionov’s own collection) were used in both exhibitions, which meant that the inclusion of icon patterns distinguished the second exhibition from the first. In this change, Larionov indicated his awareness of the different valences attributed to these forms.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	      Lubki had been legitimized as a form of folk art in the late nineteenth century, most notably due to the publication, between 1881 and 1893, of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Russian Folk Picture</span>, by Dmitrii Aleksandrovich Rovinskii.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> By 1909, lubki had become such an apparent influence among the new generation of artists that Aleksandr Benois, arguably the most prominent art critic in late imperial Russia, devoted an entire column in <span style="font-style:italic;">Speech</span> to the subject. “The Turn to the Lubok,” as the essay was called, described the “deliberate effort of artists to rid themselves of virtuosity and . . . return to the rude simplicity of primitive art.” While Benois was not entirely sympathetic to this trend, he also disputed the more conservative position that such art was “simply a sign of brutishness, or descent into the dark depths of ignorance.”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>
	      Benois argued that “lubokness” was a phenomenon predicated on the aesthetic demands and discontents of modernity. The new primitivism, Benois explained, was the latest in a series of reactive turns that were inevitable within the framework of modernism:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		Not too long ago [artists] escaped from the realist countryside to a fantastical Versailles, to golden dreams, to exquisite delight. Now from these same magic palaces into which the crowd penetrated, they escape to the peasant, to his simple-hearted happiness, to his colorful toys. They want to learn from him how to look at objects simply, into their core, to laugh coarsely but cheerfully, to weep coarsely but passionately, to eat black bread with a cucumber . . . .<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      Benois presented the difference between his own refined and cosmopolitan generation and the youth preoccupied with simplicity and authenticity, but the contrast was more pointed than that for many. In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Russian Folk Picture</span>, Rovinskii identified a number of the most popular lubki—<span style="font-style:italic;">The Mice Burying the Cat</span> (<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>), <span style="font-style:italic;">The Cat of Kazan’</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Barber Cutting the Beard of an Old Believer</span>—as satirical critiques of Peter and his reforms. Although more recent scholarship has convincingly disputed the original political content of these works, Rovinskii held great sway over early-twentieth-century artists and critics (Larionov, for example, referred his readers to Rovinskii’s text in the essay he wrote to accompany the two lubok exhibitions).<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> While Larionov scholars have long emphasized the close relationship between these lubki and his paintings, the parallel is usually cited as a demonstration of the “lubokness” of the artist’s work, but the more particular, anti-imperial, resonance of these lubki should not be overlooked in relation to Larionov’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Soldier at the Hairdresser’s</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">Katsap Venus</span>. As lubki became objects of collection and fascination for modern artists, they also had a strong association with the political protest of popular culture against imperial oppression.
	    </p>
<p>
	      In this way lubki were clearly distinct from icons in their cultural associations. Icons were critical to the notion of “Holy Russia,” and of Moscow as the “Third Rome.” They were the conduits through which the identity of the state (as the heir of Eastern Christendom) was experienced by the people. Icons served to reinforce the endangered bond between the peasantry and the Emperor. Not surprisingly, Nikolai II presided over a revival of icon painting and icons played an important role in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition of Cottage Industries</span>.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> The critic Yakov Tugendkhol’d made this  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> contrast explicit in his “Contemporary Art and National Spirit,” an essay prompted by Goncharova’s solo exhibition in the fall of 1913. Tugendkhol’d argued that it was not proper embroidery patterns or carving techniques (forms that demonstrated the continuity of a “national spirit” at such events as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span>), but rather “cynical irony [that is] typical of the Russian folk genius.”<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> This “cynical irony” was expressed most clearly in lubki, which were “the travelling companions of everyday life” and carried “demonic temptation.” In contrast to the “light idealism” of icons, which were “the illuminators of life, the lubok is its mirror, and often, a crooked mirror” (YT, 157).

<p>
	      If for Benois the lubok recalled the coarse laughter of the muzhik, and Tugendkhol’d deemed it a “crooked mirror,” Larionov argued that the lubok had an almost apocalyptically anti-historical force. He introduced his essay for both lubki exhibitions with fictional historical epigraphs, the second of which claimed:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		In the kingdom of the Assyrian King Hammurabi, an exhibition was arranged of lubki from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, from Russia, China, Japan, France and other places. The prints stimulated such an intensity of aesthetic feeling that time was killed by the sensation of timelessness and omnipresence. The arising sensation reigned like self-contained infinity.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      The essay was as strange and puzzling as anything else published in Russia in 1913. Larionov practically overwhelmed his readers with his obtuse illogic. And he was explicit about his rejection of linear temporality:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		It is of absolutely no consequence as to when lubki in general, and Russian lubki in particular, came into being . . . . The most astounding and the most contemporary doctrine—Futurism—can be transferred back to Assyria or Babylon, while Assyria with its cult of the goddess Astarte and the teaching of Zarathustra can be transferred into what we call our own time period.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      In this passage, lubki, monumental Assyrian sculpture, and Futurist scandal-mongering were collapsed into one ecstatic category. Larionov’s equation of traditional Russian art with Futurism and the religious culture of ancient Babylon is quite far from Benois and Tugendkhol’d, with their thoughtful analyses of the lubok. His approach was hardly conducive to practical applications, but Larionov’s anti-temporal history of art was nevertheless an inspired gesture. Through it he rejected the fallacy of cultural continuity that underscored Prakhov’s claim to a resurgence of Russian national spirit. Instead, Larionov called for an artistic identity free of historical or geographical limits. Russianness could be celebrated, but as a classification without boundaries, easily encompassing both Futurism and Babylonian mythology.
	    </p>
<p>
	      While Larionov’s strange approach differed markedly from anyone else working within the craft revival milieu, there were others who looked to the avant-garde as proof of the ideological bankruptcy of revivalism. Using Goncharova’s 1913 solo exhibition as a starting point, Tugendkhol’d, in “Contemporary Art and National Spirit,” generalized that “contemporary Russian artists fell in love with stone women, peasant dolls, and folk pictures, in the hopes of finding a firm, native soil under their feet” (YT, 156). However, like all revivalists before them, he claimed, they failed. “Goncharova,” he said, “dreamed of coming close to folk tradition, to the folk spirit, but, in the end, was unable to approach it. Is this not our eternal ailment of the intelligentsia?” (YT, 153). Tugendkhol’d ultimately questioned the ability of anyone with an urban education to understand the “folk.” The prominent members of the Russian avant-garde, had, for the most part, grown up in the country and been educated in urban centers. “What kind of ‘folk’ are there in the city, anyway?” Tugendkhol’d asked (YT, 158). This question is key to the avant-garde rethinking of folk tradition as dynamic and urban, two characteristics incompatible with the imperial narrative of Russian national identity.
	    </p>
<p>
	      “What kind of ‘folk’ are there in the city, anyway?” The question is worth repeating, because it was exactly what motivated and divided the interest in folk art, peasant culture, and the crafts revival after the 1905 revolution. In their 1913 manifesto, “Rayists and Futurists,” Goncharova and Larionov wrote, “Long live Nationality! We march hand in hand with our ordinary housepainters.”<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> In this formulation, the authenticity of the peasant craftsman is replaced by the comparatively nondescript urban re of the sign painter and house decorator. This is the kind of folk that were in the city—semiliterate economic refugees from the countryside and far-off provinces—dislocated people like Niko Pirosmanashvili, an itinerant Georgian sign painter that Larionov included in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Target</span>.
	    </p>
<p>
	      For the modernist critics of the imperial folk art revival, it was important to find a medium that was recognized as both authentic and resistant. The lubok performed this task admirably, returning to the folk revival the populist agenda that it had lost by 1913.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Larionov’s presentation of the lubok goes even farther in this resistant capacity. Presenting the “folk picture” within the context of the modern and the urban, and insisting, as he did, that there was no difference between the sixteenth and twentieth centuries, or between Russia and Assyria, Larionov was also performing a folk authenticity that could not be located within the conventional historical narratives of ethnicity.
	    </p>
<p>
	      More than anything else, the exhibitions of spring 1913 demonstrated that Russian folk art was not a monolithic category and in this plurality the category of folk art also revealed the fault lines within the concept of nationality itself. While certain projections of the nation or folk could serve to further imperial hegemony, others were ardently anti-imperial, and therefore linked to the ideals of democratization and the broader opposition to autocracy.

	In 1905, peasants were still forced to pay reparations to their former masters, despite the fact that they were often restricted from leaving their original estates. Moreover, the taxation of peasants through their village commune often forced a few working families to pay the tax burden for their whole village.

      Prakhov’s focus on ethnic distinctions may require some additional clarification. There are actually two separate words in Russian that are translated into English as “Russian.” The first, <span style="font-style:italic;">russkii</span>, signifies the Russian language and Russians as an ethnic group. The second, <span style="font-style:italic;">rossiiskii</span>, refers to Russia as a state or governing body—the Russian Empire, a Russian citizen, the Russian imperial academy. The Second All-Russian Exhibition was explicitly <span style="font-style:italic;">rossiiskii</span> (imperial) and therefore inclusive of all the nationalities in the Empire.

      Kappeler’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Russian Empire</span> study reveals that the ethnicities that were considered the most abject (gypsies, nomads, and pagans, primarily) were also often the least regulated, and therefore able to retain a greater degree of autonomy than nationalities that were considered highly cultured and well-educated (Poles and Armenians, for example).

      Kappeler’s assertion is affirmed by Ascher’s description of serious unrest in Warsaw in November 1904, and the defacto secession of the Georgian province of Guriya in 1903, which had ceased to pay taxes or obey imperial authorities, establishing what was essentially a peasant soviet. <span style="font-style:italic;">R</span>, 48–51.
