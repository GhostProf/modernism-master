<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Scholars of modernism employ the notion of rupture in two different
ways. Critics interested in establishing a difference between high and
low cultural productions introduce it emphatically and deliberately,
while many other commentators on English literature use the idea less
self-consciously and more chronologically to partition the Victorians
from the twentieth century. This difference tends to collapse in the
field of the English novel, where scholars do not consider fiction high
art until modernism takes it up. Literary criticism finds a place for most
novels and most novelists to one side or the other of this simultaneously
aesthetic and historical divide. Not so for Joseph Conrad, who usually
ends up in the middle. Michael Levenson, for example, locates Conrad at
English modernism's moment of emergence.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 For Levenson, as
for many, Conrad divides the pre-literary from the literary; his work
announces that the modernist break has occurred. According to Fredric
Jameson, Conrad's writing thematizes "the emergence not merely of what
will be contemporary modernism . . . but, also, still tangibly juxtaposed
with it, of what will variously be called popular culture or mass
culture."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Conrad convinces us that the Victorian era is over,
in other words, by accurately forecasting the shape of the culture to come
next. Because he so effectively represents this "strategic fault line,"
Conrad's place in the literary field is singularly "unstable," Jameson
argues, "his work unclassifiable .  . . floating uncertainly somewhere
in between [that of] Proust and Robert Louis Stevenson."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This characterization of Conrad's position has a long history. We
discover it as early as F. R. Leavis's <I>Great Tradition</I>, where

<B></B>

Leavis describes Conrad's writing as combining literariness
with the extra-literary authenticity based on his experience as
a sailor. Thus the best Conrad texts maintain a relationship with
"ordinariness" even as they mine the aesthetic depths of a profoundly
modernist "heroic sublimity."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Ian Watt testifies to the
classificatory difficulties posed by such an admixture of high and low
when he depicts Conrad as "both more contemporary and more old-fashioned
than his modern peers." Watt's <I>fin de si&egrave;cle</I> Conrad both
leans back toward the "solidarities of human experience . . . much
commoner among the Romantics and the Victorians" and lurches forward
to a modernist interest in "alienation and exile."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Such
unstable allegiances structure Conrad's biography as well. In Frederick
Karl's authoritative version, Conrad's life story breaks into distinct
thirds--Pole, sailor, and novelist--that persistently bleed into one
another and, ultimately, violate their own terms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By canonizing Conrad for the transgressive, ironic quality of his life
and work, modernist criticism has granted Conrad's precarious position
a curious kind of stability. Such stability in instability is, I argue,
precisely the dynamic imagined in Conrad's letters and his aesthetic
writings. Conrad portrayed himself as an author who transformed popular
material into art, who crossed over from high to low and back again in a
never-ending search for raw material. He defined his work as a salvage
operation, as an act of textual rescue.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Scholars who fix
on the mix of high and low in his novels are therefore reiteratating
Conrad's own representation of his writing.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his letters, especially, Conrad made rewriting the specialized focus of
his mode of literary production. By thus portraying his labor as revising,
recrafting, and retooling preexisting narratives, I will demonstrate,
Conrad defined it as a professional task, locating his writing in a
service sector that, at the end of the nineteenth century, was well on
its way to supplanting commodity production and consumption as the engine
of the English economy. In doing so, moreover, he characterized himself
as a manager of literary economics and as conservator of the value
of literature itself. This may seem an odd claim to make, especially
given that Conrad's aesthetic instability was complemented by his
equally well documented poverty. Add to this the fact that Conrad was
never very healthy, and he becomes a distinctly unlikely candidate for
managerial employment. While Conrad's letters do indeed provide ample
evidence, as Frederick Karl and others have shown, that his was a writing
life troubled by chronic mental and physical disability and haunted
by persistent financial calamity, the letters reveal far more than
Conrad's personal suffering. They use that suffering to make a larger
point. When he describes himself as an author in letters to friends,
publishers, and his literary agent, Conrad appropriates the stereotype
of the suffering artist in order to redefine the professional writer in
terms of the difficulty of his labor.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 The severity of the
writer's suffering, in other words, underscores the intensity of his work.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The letters make suffering the hallmark of modernist authorship. They
use Conrad's gout, furthermore, as the primary register for measuring
the value of the professional services that author performs. By giving
evidence of his suffering, the

<B></B>

letters authenticate Conrad's
labor. They make clear that his writing is his property and, regardless
of its circulation in the market, will remain identifiably his own. The
letters solidify the re of Joseph Conrad, finally, and provide the
terms for his canonization. Conrad is not the only modernist novelist
to have been consecrated for his failing health. Woolf, Lawrence,
Joyce, Forster, and Stein have all, at one time or another, had their
respective achievements narrated as genius born of suffering.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

In noting this larger pattern, I want to suggest that Conrad's letters
contain a model for rethinking how modernism broke with its Victorian
past. By observing Conrad as he negotiates his unstable, uncertain,
and incomplete version of that break, we should be able to discover,
moreover, why suffering was such a common ingredient in the making of
the modernist author.

</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even as a child, Conrad struggled with a variety of afflictions. By
all accounts, he was never truly well. As he grew older, the one malady
that began to overshadow all others was his gout, a metabolic condition
characterized by an intensely painful inflammation of the joints. During
one especially severe attack in 1891, Conrad's hands swelled so that
his doctor was compelled to send him off to Geneva, Switzerland for a
special "water-mountain cure."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 This crisis occurred while
he was hard at work on his first novel, <I>Almayer's Folly</I>. From
this moment forward Conrad's letters associate writing fiction with
attacks of gout. Gout accompanies inspiration--"Gout. Brought on by-by-by
agitation, exasperation, botheration--You know; those things you laugh
at and bite your thumbs at--O! Lord! And I write! I write! I write! I
write! Certainly. Write quick"
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
--and is part and parcel of
writer's block as well--"When I face that fatal manuscript it seems to
me that I have forgotten how to think--worse! how to write . . . I knock
around blindly . . . till I am positively, physically sick" (<I>CL</I>, 1,
296-97). It is the author's constant companion--"I got up and went
down again some four distinct times since that time; having nevertheless
managed to do some 13 thousand words--the last paper of the Mirror of the
Sea vol." (<I>CL</I>, 3, 287)--and, ultimately, a metaphor for authorship
itself--"a short story of about 5.000 words . . . like a fell disease got
me under" (<I>CL</I>, 1, 298)--all of which leads Conrad to conclude,
in a letter to John Galsworthy in April, 1906, that "perhaps . . . the
hard, atrocious, agonizing days are simply part of my <I>method</I> of
work, a decreed necessity of my production" (<I>CL</I>, 3, 327).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This description does not represent a simple attempt to naturalize
writing. Rather, when Conrad depicts gout as the vital component of his
writing method, he socializes his disease. He narrates his gout--an
inherited illness no less--as an aspect of his working existence, as
part of what might be called his professional persona. That is, he
indicates the specialized quality of his labor through a representation
of his personal suffering. Although this approach may seem surprising,
Conrad's tactical connection of his work to his person is hardly
unique. Magali Sarfatti Larson notes

<B></B>

that professional work
frequently appears "inextricably bound to the person and the personality
of [its] producer."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Often enough, what makes professionals
working in the same field stand out--what distinguishes one doctor
from another, for example--is the personal flair they bring to the
job. Personality names a service. It makes the service distinctive, rare,
and valuable. Furthermore, it forestalls the alienation that characterizes
nonprofessional labor, since it particularizes the professional's labor
in a way unavailable to most workers. Holding alienation at bay is no
small task, however. Because the service sector is intertwined with that
of manufacturing, distinguishing professional labor from that of the
assembly line is a tricky proposition.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 In fact, "because
they are personally involved in their work," as Marshall Berman notes,
and because professionals effectively "sell themselves piecemeal," in
Marx's apt turn of phrase, capitalism's demands seem to impinge on them
in an especially intimate way.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 The person and personality of
the professional are affected by the market even as they also produce
effects within it. As Conrad's gout makes apparent the specialized
quality of his writing method, therefore, it also proves his membership
in a professional class of uniquely situated market victims. The letters
provide further evidence of the particular animosity the market has for
Conrad when they show how it eagerly commodifies his work and offers him
next to nothing in exchange. Even as the market robs him of his writing,
however, Conrad manages to retain control over his writing method. Though
his texts become commodified, his means of production remain his own.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"All societies turn on their concept of property," Harold Perkin argues,
and professional society turns on a concept of property expressed
in the performance of a professional service (<I>RPS</I>, 377). What
professionals own most securely, according to Perkin, is their ability to
perform specialized work. They possess this ability only so long as they
continue to perform, however. Professional property is, in this sense,
contingent, which puts it at odds with the more absolute property forms
of inherited land or contracted labor (<I>RPS</I>, 377-79). For this
reason, the idea of professional property emerged in England as part of an
opposition to aristocratic and industrial economic thinking. In the last
half of the nineteenth century, Perkin shows, incipient professionals
organized themselves into career hierarchies and competed with the
partisans of those older proprietary ideals. They attempted to shape an
economic and class logic based on cultural capital rather than industrial
and landed capital. Accountants and auctioneers, hospital administrators
and sanitation engineers all sought to distinguish themselves from members
of the working class proper--who supposedly lacked the education and
training required to perform their specialized labor--as well as from the
constituencies of the upper echelon of England's tripartite class system.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As it turns out, they were largely successful. By the turn of the
century, the majority of Great Britain's economic growth came from
services. From their home base in London and outposts around the world,
service professionals reorganized English domestic and imperial politics,
established a new welfare state bureaucracy, and reinvented English empire
according to their guiding precepts of merit-based qualification

<B></B>

and
the value of cultural capital.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Their work heralded a sea
change in the economic outlook of the country. As Britain's economic
center shifted from the factory towns of Manchester and Birmingham
to the southeast portion of England, the City of London became "more
than ever, the switchboard for the world's international business
transactions, so that its commercial and financial services alone earned
almost enough to make up for [Britain's] large deficit in its balance of
commodity trade."
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 The newly dominant professional class made
managerial skill and insider knowledge the preeminent forms of capital
in the world and, furthermore, made itself the only class qualified to
evaluate holdings in this particular form of wealth.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In order to keep the value of services high, professionalism needed
to induce an economics of scarcity. As Perkin reminds us, "that is
why the organized professional bodies . . . operated 'strategies of
closure' including control of entry, training and qualification, and
sought a monopoly of the name and the practice" of their respective
services (<I>RPS,</I> 378). In his letters, Conrad puts in play his
own criteria of qualification by establishing an opposition between
writing in general and his own specialized craft. As he does so, he
shows that even a skill as increasingly common as writing can be made to
appear scarce. Conrad elaborates on the qualifying criteria pertinent
to this field of professionalized writing in a review of the work of
Hugh Clifford, a friend, a decorated imperial officer, and the author
of several well-received volumes of prose on life in the colonies.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1898, the editor of <I>Academy</I>, a literary weekly, contracted
Conrad to review a book of Clifford's entitled <I>Studies in Brown
Humanity</I>. Conrad agreed. In his review, he describes the volume's
prose as full of "sympathy" for its characters, "&Ucirc;mat, the
punkah-puller" and "the coolie, Lim Teng Wah."
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Despite
its obvious merits, however, Conrad urged readers not judge the book
as art. In fact, "to apply artistic standards to this book would be a
fundamental error in appreciation," he cautions, since "art veils part
of the truth of life to make the rest appear more splendid, inspiring,
or sinister. And this book is only truth, interesting and futile, truth
unadorned, simple and straightforward."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Art reconres
"the truth," according to Conrad, a definition that he expands on in his
Preface to <I>The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'</I>. "[I]t is only complete,
unswerving devotion to the perfect blending of form and substance," he
argues in the Preface, "only through an unremitting, never-discouraged
care for the shape and ring of sentences that . . . the light of magic
suggestiveness may be brought to play for an evanescent instant over the
commonplace surface of words: of the old, old words, worn thin, defaced
by ages of careless usage."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 The author privileged by Conrad
in this description does not create texts so much as recreate them. He
revises, rescues, and rewrites them. He makes them better. In a letter
to his publisher, William Blackwood, Conrad provides an example of this
service from his own oeuvre. "The favourable critics of that story [i.e.,
'Youth'], Q[uiller-Couch] amongst others remarked with a sort of surprise
'This after all is a story for boys yet--' Exactly. Out of the material of
a boys' story I've made <I>Youth</I>" (<I>CL</I>, 2, 417). The beauty of
Conrad's specialized mode of rewriting is that it works with all sorts of
texts. It can take adventure

<B></B>

stories, as with "Youth," or, indeed,
any kind of generic prose "worn thin . . . by ages of careless usage,"
and, by servicing it, make that writing into something new.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the months following the <I>Academy</I> review, Conrad and Clifford
began exchanging letters. Clifford paid Conrad a visit at his home
in Kent. And, when his next book came out, Clifford mailed Conrad
a copy.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Like the earlier <I>Studies</I>, Clifford's new
volume, entitled <I>In a Corner of Asia</I>, focussed on the lives of his
colonial subjects in Malaya. Conrad invokes that point of origin in the
October 1899 letter he sent to acknowledge the book's receipt. There,
he congratulates Clifford on his mastery of ethnographic detail and,
once again, chides him for not writing art.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Of course the matter is admirable--the knowledge, the feeling, the
sympathy; it is sure to win perfect and full recognition. It is all
sterling metal; a thing of absolute value. There can be no question of it
not only for those who know but even for those who approach the book with
blank minds on the subject of the race you have, in more than one sense,
made your own. And as to the manner--well! I know you are not a seeker
after mere expression and I beg leave to offer only one remark. You do
not leave enough to the imagination. (<I>CL</I>, 2, 200)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With the suggestion that Clifford has taken possession of the Malay
"race," "in more than one sense," Conrad gestures toward the colonial
apparatus that enabled Clifford's writing. He hints, further, that
imperialism has smoothed the way for the consumption of Clifford's prose
as well. Clifford's status as an authorized narrator of native life grants
his writing a currency matched only by the universally recognizable
pound sterling, according to Conrad. Despite these advantages, Conrad
questions the ultimate authority of Clifford's text. In the last line
of this passage, he chiasmatically reverses the logic of Clifford's
proprietary claim to the "subject of the race [he has] made [his] own."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
According to Conrad's reading, Clifford's text presumes that it has all
of the facts under control and, further, that those facts refer to a
world outside language. There is a crucial flaw in this reasoning, Conrad
asserts. Writers who believe that their work refers to the real mistake
the power of the word. They fail to realize that "the <I>whole</I> of the
truth lies in the presentation" (<I>CL</I>, 2, 200). With this linguistic
turn, Conrad reverses the implicit hierarchy he identifies in Clifford's
privileging of subject "matter" over what Conrad ironically calls "mere
expression" (<I>CL</I>, 2, 200). The real subject of writing, he avers,
is writing. "The things 'as they are' exist in words," he observes, and
"words should be handled with care, lest the picture, the image of truth
abiding in facts should become distorted--or blurred" (<I>CL</I>, 2,
200). Without sufficient expertise in writing, truth fades, the subject
blurs, and the author is left owning nothing at all, as his subject
slips from his grasp. With this move, Conrad proposes a proprietary
relationship that depends entirely on the writer's ability.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To ensure that Clifford understands the distinction, Conrad proposes
to revise several lines from <I>In a Corner of Asia</I>. He selects a
passage symptomatic of what he presents as Clifford's undertheorized use
of language: "When the whole horror of his

<B></B>

position forced itself
with an agony of realization upon his frightened mind, Pa' T&ucirc;a for
a space lost his reason" (<I>CL</I>, 2, 201). For Conrad, these lines
exemplify Clifford's trust in the real. They provide an opportunity to
show why such trust is necessarily misplaced. "In this sentence the reader
is borne down by the full expression . . . The word <I>frightened</I>
is fatal . . . [It] is totally inadequate to express the true state of
that man's mind. No word is adequate," Conrad concludes (<I>CL</I>, 2,
201). In order to convey what Pa' T&ucirc;a feels, a more sophisticated,
and more roundabout, technique must be used. First, Conrad counsels,
excise the word "frightened." Second, refuse to interpret for the reader:
"The imagination of the reader should be left free to arouse his feeling"
(2: 201). The slippage of the word "his" in this sentence--Does "his
feeling" refer to Pa' T&ucirc;a or to the reader?--reinforces Conrad's
argument. The language appropriate to the task at hand should be evocative
without strictly delimiting Pa' T&ucirc;a's fright. Conrad expects his
reader to detect fear without being handed the word "frightened." Reading
depends crucially on one's ability to interpret what a text leaves open
or unsaid.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Here, then, are the results of Conrad's revision: "When the whole truth of
his position forced itself upon his mind, Pa' T&ucirc;a for a space lost
his reason" (<I>CL</I>, 2, 201). "This is truth," Conrad writes. "And look
how finely it goes on with a perfectly legitimate effect," he continues:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
When the whole truth of the horror of his position forced itself
upon his mind, Pa' T&ucirc;a for a space lost his reason. He screamed
aloud, and the hollow of the rocks took up his cries; the bats awoke in
thousands and joined the band that rustled and squeaked above the man
etc. etc. (<I>CL</I>, 2, 201)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By streamlining Clifford's prose, Conrad appears to have succeeded in
making the text more productive. With the rustles and squeaks of those
thousands of bats, Pa' T&ucirc;a's fright bursts from the page. This
exercise in revision provides an object lesson in the efficacy of
what Edward Said calls Conrad's "minimal but hauntingly reverberating
phrases."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 It is as well a prime example of Conrad's own
unmistakable literary style. The newly improved version resonates with the
sort of "oppressive mysteriousness" and inexactitude that so famously
annoyed F. R.  Leavis, and which makes Conrad's writing so easily
identifiable.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 By revising Clifford's lines, therefore,
Conrad took possession of them. By servicing Clifford's text, he made
that text his own and imprinted it with his own reproducible style.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When he unveils the contingent hold a writer has on his writing, Conrad
reverses a century-old effort to legitimate aesthetic work by describing
it in absolute terms. As Mark Rose shows, eighteenth century narratives
of authorship frequently employed the vocabulary of landed capital in
an attempt to elevate the value of literary labor. Rose directs us to
the example of Joseph Addison, who said of one author, "his Brain,
which was his Estate, had as regular and different Produce as other
Men's land."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Litigants in nineteenth century debates over
copyright revisited this aristocratic mode. One, William Dougal Christie,
even imagined "a class of men holding hereditary

<B></B>

estates, not in
broad lands, but in books."
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Victorian authors drew on this
language to give their profession an "aura of gentility" as well as the
moral authority to challenge the Taylorizing tendencies of commercial
publishers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Persistent antagonism between these two
parties notwithstanding, authors and publishers both participated in the
innovations that transformed novel production in the Victorian era. When
the author and publisher Charles Dickens helped make serialization
popular in the 1830s, he gave the novel even greater visibility than
it had previously enjoyed and created a whole new set of conditions
for novel writing. As Mary Poovey shows, part-issue publication red
the author as just "one instance of [the] labor" required to put out a
book.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Publishers attempted to force novelists to write on
schedule, to compose their words in evenly distributed portions, and
to plot their narratives so that each chapter's conclusion would also
function as an advertisement for the next installment.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>

Dickens was the master of this form of writing. He also participated
in that other central trend of Victorian literary production, the
feminization of the novel. By acting as a spokesperson for the doctrine
of separate spheres, Dickens underscored the novel's association with
the stereotypically feminine terms of domesticity, sentiment, and
feeling.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Somewhat ironically, then, Dickens's version of
the novel forged a link between mass marketability and feminization, a
link reinforced, as Andreas Huyssen observes, by the practitioners and
critics of modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As feminist critics ranging from Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar
to Rita Felski and Anita Levy have shown, modernism was "motivated
to a considerable extent by the will to observe and to know the
female."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Modernists did not follow in the footsteps of the
Victorians, however. They rewrote the feminine subject by primitivizing,
aestheticizing, psychologizing, and otherwise subjecting her to an
array of newly professionalized discourses. They detached the categories
of sentiment and feeling from the feminine and made them the property
of the professional.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 For an example of this reclassifying
process we need look no farther than Conrad's letter to Clifford, where
Conrad makes the acts of arousing a reader's "feeling" and discerning
"the true state" of a person's mind the appropriate labor of professional
literary practice (<I>CL</I>, 2, 201).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to usurping what had been the domain of popular writers,
Conrad takes over the space of the domestic itself. Like Dickens before
him, Conrad portrays himself as a guardian of the home. In contrast with
Dickens, Conrad proves less than successful at this task. The conclusion
of his letter to Clifford depicts Conrad struggling to produce writing
that will allow him to secure his family's well-being. The market obliges
him by purchasing his work, but it is clearly the market, and not the
author, who sets the terms for this exchange.

<BLOCKQUOTE>

[These lines are] the sort of thing I write twenty times a day and
(with the fear of overtaking fate behind me) spend half my nights in
taking out of my work--upon which depends the daily bread of the house:
(literally--from day to day); not to mention (I dare hardly think of
it) the future of my child, of those nearest and dearest to me,

<B></B>

between whom and the bleakest want there is only my pen--as long as life
lasts. And I can sell all I write--as much as I write! (<I>CL</I>, 2, 201)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As he subjects himself to the market's terms, Conrad also gives us the
clear indication that, of all the aspects of his work, rewriting is
what takes the most time and energy. To make this point, to establish
the centrality of rewriting to his self-definition as an author, Conrad
paradoxically must run the risk of failing as a domestic provider. Through
its narrative of market dominance, his letter suggests that the Victorian
duties of authorship--securing the values of the home over the values of
the market, making generally available the deep-seated truths of human
subjectivity--are far more difficult than the Victorians let on.

In his letter to Clifford, Conrad addresses the author of imperial
adventure as well as the Victorian narrator of domestic romance. His
anguished scene of writing sublates both of these versions of
authorship. He dismisses the author of parlor fiction by appropriating
the space of the home and by taking over the job of portraying the inner
reaches of subjectivity. As for the adventure author, he can be glimpsed
"between the lines" of Clifford's prose, "like the progress of a traveller
in the jungle that may be traced by the sound of the <I>parang</I>
chopping the swaying creepers, while the man himself is glimpsed, now and
then, between the trees."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Conrad displaces this author by
identifying the desk, rather than the jungle, as the appropriate setting
for literary struggle. He does not simply displace this author, however,
but instead appropriates the trappings of Clifford's adventure model
and applies them to his own situation. He builds struggle and physical
risk into the professional mode of authorial production. As we shall see,
Conrad's writing is every bit as perilous as Clifford's labor amidst "the
great flood" and the "menacing rocks" of the Malay peninsula.

If the author's job in Conrad's letters is to render a distinctive
literary service, the reader's responsibility is to recognize the
value of that service. Readers are investors in the letters, and the
smart ones know to buy into an undervalued author while his price
is still low. In the decade of the 1890s, Conrad certainly fit this
bill. Neither he nor his publisher was satisfied with the sales of his
early Malay novels. While his <I>The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'</I> did
somewhat better than those, Conrad's limited marketability still stood
out at a moment when the bookstores were flush with best-sellers. The
market for fiction was booming in England at the close of the nineteenth
century. Every year, more novels found publishers and more new novelists
emerged on the scene. As one commentator observed, "Most moderately
well-educated people nowadays are actual or potential authors. They
have dabbled in literature for purposes of pleasure or profit, they
have published a book, or they have written magazine or newspaper
articles."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 This was the moment when the term "best-seller"
began to take on its contemporary meaning. The <I>Book Monthly</I> was
one of several

<B></B>

periodicals that tracked novel sales in Britain at
the turn of the century, but the journal's editor, James Milne, seemed
far from comfortable with this method of evaluating fiction. He took
care to assure his readers that the <I>Book Monthly</I>'s lists were
"prepared by a high authority," and that they were therefore sanctioned
by more than public opinion alone.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Conrad's letters also pondered the relationship between market value and
literary taste. In a 1913 exchange with the publisher Blackwood's, for
instance, Conrad sought to fix the relationship between aesthetic worth
and the price of a novel. Blackwood's suggested that "the inclusion of
Lord Jim in our 1/- Editions might be a successful undertaking," and might
bring both publisher and author the profits that had eluded them when the
novel was first published in 1900.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Conrad responded promptly
to this proposition. In his answer, he noted that he too was concerned
that the novel was increasingly difficult to find. He disagreed, however,
that a new cheap edition would help Blackwood's target an appropriate
readership for the text. "I have been hearing for some time now that the
booksellers tell people <I>Lord Jim</I> is out of print," he observed,
"[but] I would much prefer a new edition at 6/- leaving the Democracy
of the bookstalls to cut its teeth on something softer" <I>(LWB</I>
193). Price, for Conrad, indicates quality. By elevating the cost of
his books, he apparently hoped to signal their aesthetic value and
snag art-conscious consumers. More than a promotional tool, price helps
to identify a readership. By thinking taste and cost together, Conrad
imagines the market less as one mass entity and more as an amalgamation
of niches. The market for him is not a mysterious, amorphous thing guided
by an invisible hand, then, but a knowable, and therefore manipulable
organization of demographics, each with its own specific tastes. In this
conception of the market, aesthetics and economics are not enemies. They
are complementary diagnostic matrices for analyzing and predicting the
behavior of these demographics.

This is a market theory uniquely suited for a literary field in which
book readers were also book buyers, which had not always been the
case, we should remember. During the nineteenth-century hegemony of the
triple-decker and the lending library, readers rented. In the 1890s,
however, the libraries decided that the triple-decker had outlived
its usefulness, and they pressed publishers to begin printing novels
exclusively in single-volume editions. With this move, the libraries
sealed their own fate as well as that of three-volume publication. For,
as technological innovation and marketing strategies made printing
and distributing one-volume fictions more and more cost-effective for
publishers, they began to bypass the libraries and sell to consumers
through retail outlets instead.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Conrad presented a fuller version of his market theory in a letter he sent
to Blackwood's in May of 1902, just after he arrived home from a meeting
with William Blackwood, the head of the family business. At this meeting,
Conrad had asked Blackwood to grant him a loan. Blackwood turned him
down and made it clear in the process that publishing Conrad had so far
proven "a loss to [his] firm" (<I>CL</I>, 2, 421).
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 Conrad
responded by suggesting to Blackwood that he had missed the point. It
mattered

<B></B>

less, he said, how many books Blackwood sold than who
he was selling them to. In his letter, Conrad produces the names of
several influential--or soon to be influential--literary res who,
he says, buy his fiction, res like W. H. Henley, the publisher of
the <I>New Review</I>, George Bernard Shaw, and H. G. Wells. He tells
Blackwood that his incipient readership is hardly limited to such
sophisticated readers alone. It also includes the likes of "Yrg&ouml;
Hirn of the Finland University," "Maurice Greiffenhagen a painter
. . . the skipper of a Persian Gulf steamer who wrote to the papers of
my 'Typhoon' . . . [and] a charming old lady in Winchester" (<I>CL</I>,
2, 416). This is an eclectic bunch to be sure, but what they all had in
common was a certain willingness to invest in Conrad's work. More than
this, they have all understood and recognized the revisionary service
his work provided. They were able to see, for example, that in "Heart
of Darkness" Conrad made "of that story something quite on another
plane than an anecdote of a man who went mad in the Centre of Africa"
(<I>CL</I>, 2, 417). They knew that his texts were different and that
they were undervalued in the current market. Cultivating such a loyal
readership takes patience, Conrad tells Blackwood. It takes time.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Time was a particularly sensitive subject between Conrad and Blackwood. In
the correspondence that led up to their meeting, the author and publisher
had engaged in a dispute about how long it was taking Conrad to finish his
novels. William Blackwood was concerned that Conrad wrote so erratically
and slowly that it was impossible to put him on any kind of publishing
calendar. William's nephew George, a junior editor at the firm, reiterated
this point and expressed his own concern about the narrative pacing
of Conrad's fiction. George complained in particular about a story
entitled, appropriately enough, "The End of the Tether," which his uncle
planned to run serially and then publish with two other fictions under
the title <I>Youth</I>. When, on May 20, Conrad submitted the first
installment of "Tether," George was the assigned reader. After paging
through the manuscript, he alerted Conrad that, "as far as [his reading]
goes at present"--some fourteen-thousand words--"one can hardly say one
has got into the story yet" at all.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 If this were true, if
fourteen-thousand words represented only the beginning of the narrative,
then all of the publisher's production schedules were in danger. George
was right to be worried. Conrad had a bad habit of starting such stories
as "Jim: A Sketch" that turned out to be books. In this case, <I>Lord
Jim</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his letter to William, Conrad grudgingly concedes George's point,
saying that it was "in measure correct but, on a large view, beside the
point" (<I>CL</I>, 2, 417). His narrative pacing and writing time did
not detract but added to the value of his manuscript. "I am long in my
development," he admits to William. "What of that?"

Conrad scores "three hits" in this elaborate self-defense, as Frederick
Karl and Laurence Davies point out in their editorial notes to the letters
(<I>CL</I>, 2, 418). The Blackwood's company published all but one of
George Eliot's novels, William Blackwood's father was a great friend of
Thackeray's, and the heroic re of Sir Walter Scott loomed large over
the literary and intellectual culture of Edinburgh, where Blackwood's
publishing house was based. In addition to good aim, Conrad also evinces
a gift at subtle displacement in this passage. He responds to a question
about his production with an answer concerning the issue of his texts'
consumption. He blames the literary market for his unimpressive sales. The
novel-reading public has changed since the era of Scott and Eliot and
Thackeray, Conrad contends. It has become more hurried, more demanding,
one might even say more savvy in pursuing its needs.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Victorian literary field Conrad describes could not be more different
from the modern one in which he worked. It is a peaceful, homogeneous
place and almost primitive in the closeness it maintained between
producers and consumers. Eliot and Scott are perfectly in tune with their
audience. Or, more precisely, their audience has not yet transformed
into the exacting market that dominates at the turn of the century. By
thus flattening the Victorian field, Conrad makes market competition
into a modernist phenomenon. Because Blackwood relies on a pre-modern
conception of the market, Conrad suggests, the publisher mistakenly
treats the novels he sells as if they were Victorian texts. Modern
texts are different. "I am <I>modern</I>," he announces, implying that
work like his neither fits into a ready-made category, nor will find a
readership right away. Victorian novel-production is the wrong analogy
for his kind of work, then. As a more fitting comparison, he explains,

By designating Rodin and Whistler as his predecessors, Conrad finds

 All producers there
pass through a stage in their career when they are underrecognized
and underappreciated, and this they must do if they are to gain a
following. In order to succeed, paradoxically, they need to fail. They
need to put themselves in a position to lure investors who understand
that the risk involved in supporting an unpopular artist can lead to
tremendous rewards. By borrowing this model of patron and artist, Conrad
redefines the publishing business. Publishers should act, he suggests, as
investment brokers. "[A] writer may be taken up as an investment," Conrad
wrote to Alfred Knopf in 1913, and should be treated accordingly. "An
investment must be attended to, it must be nursed--if one believes in
it."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In marked contrast to the notion of a fragmented and niched market,
nineteenth century commentators tended to think of their reading public
in broad-based national terms. Ian Duncan traces this conception to Sir
Walter Scott: "The Waverly novels had done much to define that re
of a unified public imagination--a society brought together in the act
of reading the same book--as they charted an expanding . . . literary
market."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 This national audience generated a novelist who
was, oddly enough, rarely portrayed writing. The early scene of literary
production was often occluded, while the act of writing itself took on a
supernatural, gothic air. A telling example of this mystification occurs
in Lockhardt's <I>Life of Scott</I>, when the novelist at work appears
to a stunned observer as a free-floating, unattached hand.

<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 As they enter the realm of commodities and
take on a life of their own, books leave their authors behind. The author
remains in the background, fragmented--disembodied as Lockhardt portrays
him--his connection to the text ambiguous at best. How different is this
process of alienation from Conrad's portrayal of the tight bond between
author and writing? Conrad's author is radically embodied, a fact which
announces his participation in an economy that focuses on the writing
rather than the book, on the service rather than the commodity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By depicting suffering as an expression of artistry, Conrad imbues that
suffering with value. He makes of it a badge that the author displays
in order to prove that he or she is not simply disembodied, that he or
she is not, that is, an ordinary commodity producer. Suffering identifies
writers as professionals in search of investors. Suffering tells potential
patrons that an artist is willing to sacrifice for art, that he or she is
in it for the long term, and that the payoff will eventually come to the
patient investor. Presented this way, suffering becomes cultural capital
and begins to behave in the manner that capital has been theorized by
Pierre Bourdieu. "[S]ymbolic capital

<B></B>

is credit . . . in the broadest
sense, a kind of advance, a credence" that investors give when they
recognize and acknowledge the work of outstanding participants in a given
field.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Cultural capital may seem <I>merely</I> cultural,
Bourdieu allows, but it exerts economic effects. It is "denied capital,"
capital that has no overt economic value but nevertheless behaves in
economic ways.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 Cultural capital can be invested, it can
be traded, and, most importantly, it can accumulate--"the exhibition of
symbolic capital . . . is one of the mechanisms which make capital go to
capital."
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 We have an opportunity to witness the operation
of this mechanism in the letters where Conrad uses his suffering, and
particularly that associated with his gout, to fend off the disembodying
tendencies of commodification.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the letters of the 1890s, which depict Conrad in the early stages
of his writing, gout supplements the market value of his work. In these
letters, we frequently see the author requesting and receiving advances
on incomplete work. Soon after selling Blackwood the short story,
"Youth," for example, Conrad thanks Blackwood for a &#163;5 check "on
account of the story (yet unfinished) entitled <I>Jim: A Sketch</I>"
(<I>CL</I>, 2, 67). As he begins writing "Heart of Darkness," some six
months later on, Conrad solicits Blackwood for more advance funding. He
asks for and receives &#163;40 (<I>CL</I>, 2, 145), then &#163;60 more
(<I>CL</I>, 2, 163), which, he writes "will probably overpay it as I do
not think it will run to 40000 words" (<I>CL</I>, 2, 164). The letters
are full of these sorts of calculations, as Conrad attempts to maintain
a balance of "words v. sovereigns" (<I>CL</I>, 2, 237).
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>

Despite all his effort, Conrad rarely ends up in the black.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In a December 1909 letter to his agent, J. B. Pinker, Conrad tries to
rectify this situation by factoring in the hardship involved in his
labor. He attempts, in other words, to give his suffering a monetary
value. In 1907 Pinker and Conrad had taken steps to standardize
the author's finances. They had agreed that Pinker would pay Conrad
&#163;600 each year, in return for which he would write eighty-thousand
words.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
Conrad was unable to keep to this schedule. Although
he wrote more words in total than were expected of him, not enough
were towards novels, the only type of writing Pinker was interested
in. Conrad discovered, further, that &#163;600 was not enough money
to satisfy his needs. He required extra cash to pay his medical bills,
among other expenses. So, in late 1909, he attempted to renegotiate the
contract. He wrote to Pinker,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[I]n the last 23H months I've written 187,000 words (of  which 130,000 in
round numbers of Razumov [<I>Under Western Eyes</I>]). In the course of
these 23H months as two <I>honourable</I> professional men can testify,
from July last year to August of this I've had five severe attacks of
gout . . . Thats twelve months: but as I often worked when far from
fit--yes with temp at over 100&#186;--when most men would be utterly
unable to do anything--yes and creative work too--let us deduct only 8
months; which would leave 16 months of effective health and works out
at the average of 11630 w. per month. (<I>CL</I>, 4, 302)
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Conrad makes the case that he should be paid above and beyond what he has
already received from Pinker for his work over the last two years. This is
the only reason why

<B></B>

he introduces his illness, he tells Pinker. "I
am not a confounded hypoc[h]ondriac in search of sympathy. I didn't
write of my health in a conventional way . . . I alluded to it because
it has a direct bearing on the situation" (<I>CL</I>, 4, 303). His
reasoning runs as follows: he has produced far more, first of all,
than the eighty-thousand words a year Pinker had agreed to. If one
factors in the time he was sick, Conrad shows Pinker, he has written
at a rate that, had he been healthy, would have allowed him to produce
even more. 11,630 words per month, over twenty-four months, works out to
upwards of 279,000 words. Given this, Conrad implies, Pinker should not be
denying him advances. He should, if anything, offer him a raise. If we use
the numbers Conrad provides as our guide, Pinker should be paying twice
again the amount he had already disbursed for the two years in question.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Conrad failed in this attempt to persuade Pinker to pay him for the time
he was down with gout, and, given the circumstances, this is hardly
surprising. Pinker had been waiting for <I>Under Western Eyes</I> for
close to two years by the time Conrad wrote him the letter I have cited
above. He was also frustrated by the fact that, with the end of the novel
in sight, Conrad had put the book aside to start a completely different
project, the short story "The Secret Sharer." As this displacement
suggests, Conrad could write, though not the book he had promised to
deliver. Like his attacks of gout, the act of redirecting his attention to
"The Secret Sharer" allows Conrad to delay the completion, and subsequent
publication of his novel. It is interesting to note, in light of this
observation, that Conrad's gout tends to worsen as he is finishing books,
as his work is about to leave his hands and enter the commodity market. He
comments on bodily distress at the very moment when alienation, or to
use the term made available by the hand of Walter Scott, disembodiment,
is about to take hold.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The development economist Jagdish Bhagwati argues that a "disembodiment
effect," like that Lockhardt documents, is a usual part of what happens
when professional services "splinter," as he puts it, into the commodity
market.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[T]he services, initially embodied in the person providing them (for
example, Placido Domingo singing at the Metropolitan), and requiring
the physical presence of the provider of the services at the time of
use, are disembodied as a result of technical change and encapsulated
into what we call goods (such as the invention which brings Placido
Domingo via records--that is, goods--into our homes) . . . [This]
goods-from-services splintering process, reflecting the disembodiment
effect, generally leaves behind a residue  of service activities which
are technically unprogressive and generally labour intensive.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Because they find themselves on the labor-intensive side of the bargain,
Bhagwati shows, many successful service providers become victims of their
own good fortune. If their services are valuable enough to commodify
and distribute to a wide audience, their share of the profits often
goes down. Domingo gets rich from his CD sales, of course, but one
suspects that his record company profits substantially more from the
venture than he does. The discrepancy between the profits of service
professionals

<B></B>

and commodity producers may be even wider in a case
like Conrad's, where the total amount of revenue involved is so much
smaller. The letters reveal that Conrad has, relatively speaking, little
trouble getting critical recognition for his writing, which helps him
find publishers for his work. The problem is that book publication seems
a difficult place to turn that recognition, that cultural capital, into
economic capital, or monetary profit.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In order to address this problem, Conrad attempts to articulate a method
for readers to use in consuming his work as a service, an alternate way
for them to invest in the author and his work. To this end, he gives
the readers of his letters access to his scene of writing and shows them
the disembodiment effect as it occurs. He lets them experience the toll
that turning his writing into commodities takes on his body. By thus
reembodying his work, Conrad directs the attention of his readers to the
mode of literary production itself. He defines a channel through which
the cultural capital represented by their recognition of his work will
flow. He hopes that economic capital will also follow. Nowhere does this
theoretical answer to the disembodiment effect appear more clearly than
in the letters surrounding the writing of his novel <I>Nostromo</I>. In
the author's note to that text, Conrad describes the book as "the most
anxiously mediated of [his] longer novels."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 His letters give
a rather less understated account of <I>Nostromo</I>'s completion. They
depict the final days of writing in all their gory detail, and give
us a wonderfully evocative account of the moment when Conrad's writing
splinters from its life as a service into its incarnation as a commodity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
There are two versions of the events leading up to <I>Nostromo</I>'s
completion. One appears in a series of short letters to the agent
Pinker. These letters reproduce the familiar fits and starts of Conrad's
work method. The first in the series, dated the 24th of August, includes
a promise from Conrad that he will finish <I>Nostromo</I> in two days
time. He asks for a &#163;2 check in advance, because, he tells Pinker, "I
haven't the price of railway fare in the house" (<I>CL</I>, 3, 156). Two
days pass and Conrad writes again to say that he is not yet done. He
has had a sore tooth, he claims, which "made him unfit to work," but he
guarantees that copy will be in the mail the next morning, a Saturday
(<I>CL</I>, 3, 156-57). Saturday comes and goes, as does Sunday,
and the next letter Conrad sends is dated the 31st, which would be a
Wednesday. In their editorial notes, Karl and Davies produce evidence
to suggest that in fact the day was Tuesday, early, around four o'clock
in the morning. Conrad explains, "I could not resist the temptation
of a Sunday intervening and keep the MS to work at it a little more"
(<I>CL</I>, 3, 157). "I may just as well thank you for this work being
finished," he remarks rather pitifully, "for thanks are due to you
undeniably. And if I don't say more it isn't that I grudge you the words
but because I am tired--done up" (<I>CL</I>, 3, 158). These letters surely
make Conrad into a victim of the book-production process. In finishing
his novel, he expends the scant resources in his possession, his words
and his health towards the dismal prospect of commodification. To make
matters worse, when the proofs of <I>Nostromo</I> arrive, Conrad discovers
that his publisher has treated his words in a decidedly slipshod manner:
"I am disgusted with the slovenliness,

<B></B>

meanness of the book's get
up," Conrad complains to Pinker, "the horrid misprints, the crooked
lines, the dropped punctuation marks. By Jove a fourth of the page
slants!" (<I>CL</I>, 3, 171-72). Commodification is a losing
proposition all around.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The other version of these same events appears in a letter Conrad sent
to the novelist John Galsworthy. If the letters to Pinker provide an
origin story for <I>Nostromo</I> the commodity, this letter represents a
competing narrative in which <I>Nostromo</I> survives as a service. The
letter to Galsworthy opens with Conrad's declaration that the novel is
"finished! Finished on the 30th in Hope's house in Stanford in Essex,
where I had to take off my brain that seemed to turn to water" (<I>CL</I>,
3, 159). With this, Conrad records the moment when splintering occurs
and the disembodiment effect sets in. The paragraphs that follow build
on this image of Conrad literally losing his head. They portray his body
coming loose at the seams.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
His brain is the first part to go. A decaying tooth is next. "On the
27th had to wire for dentist (couldn't leave the work) who came at 2 and
dragged at the infernal thing which seemed rooted in my very soul. The
horror came away at last, leaving however one root in the gum. Then he
grubbed for <I>that</I> till I le[a]pt out of the chair" (<I>CL</I>,
3, 158). Conrad uses "horror," one of his more identifiable words and
one half of what is easily his most famous line, to a darkly comedic
effect. He invokes all the rhetorical force of the narrative often hailed
as his masterpiece, "Heart of Darkness," to describe a sore tooth. It is
as if Conrad were letting Galsworthy in on a joke. The stakes are high
in the events he is describing--there is nothing so important in the
letters as finishing a book--but Conrad wants to make sure Galsworthy
knows that he, and not the commodity market, is in control.

Conrad continues to play with the gravity of his situation in the lines
that follow, as he depicts himself settling down to write at his desk:

At 11.30 something happened--what it is I don't know. I  was writing, and
raised my eyes to look at the clock. The next thing I know I was sitting
(not lying) sitting on the concrete outside the door. When I crawled in
I found it was nearly one. I managed to get upstairs and said to Jessie:
We must be off to-morrow. (<I>CL</I>, 3, 158)

The disembodiment effect is in its advanced stages. After Conrad loses
consciousness, his body takes on a life of its own. It begins, much
in the fashion of Scott's hand, to carry on all by itself. At the last
moment, however, Conrad resists. He takes back his magically reanimated
corpse and, upon regaining control, charges out of the house with his
wife in tow.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A car arrives for them at ten o'clock on the morning after Conrad's
out-of-body experience. Their destination, we learn, is the home of
Conrad's friend G. F. W. Hope. Along the way, the tenuous quality of
Conrad's control over his body gets the attention of his driver--"I
sat by the man's side like a corpse . . . [H]e said to me You look
ill sir; shall I stop?" At this point, the letter produces its most
telling evocation of splintering. Just as Conrad threatens to collapse
altogether, a stranger appears at

<B></B>

the side of the road. Conrad's
car strikes him and, suddenly, Conrad springs back to life.

In Chatham, street crowded, packed. Going dead slow knocked down
a man--old chap, apparently a bricklayer. Crowd around cursing and
howling. Helped him to my front seat and I standing on the step got him
to the hospital in 10 minutes. No harm. Only shaken. Saw him all comfy
in bed for the rest of the day. (<I>CL</I>, 3, 159)

It is as if Conrad hands off the effects of disembodiment to this startled
old man. One moment near death, the next Conrad is hoisting himself up
on the running board as his car careens through a hostile mob. After
pausing at the hospital, the car speeds on and, in the evening, arrives
at the house of Conrad's friend. By then, Conrad is well on his way to
beating back Bhagwati's disembodiment effect and to gaining control over
his self-representation in the literary market. He eats food and, for
the first time in over a week, "<I>tasted it too</I>" (<I>CL</I>, 3,
159). He sleeps, goes to work, and finishes the novel. He sleeps again
and then writes the letter to Galsworthy. "I had not the <I>heart</I>
to write to you that same night," Conrad informs him (<I>CL</I>, 3, 159;
emphasis added), suggesting the effects of splintering still linger and
he has yet to regain control over his entire body. "Wasn't sure I would
survive," he continues. "But I have survived extremely well . . . I am
quite recovered and ready for work again" (<I>CL</I>, 3, 159). One last
act remains, however, before Conrad is willing to declare the adventure
a success. He awaits Galsworthy's recognition. "There is wanting to the
finish of this undertaking the sanction of your presence and voice," he
writes in conclusion. "Drop me a line. Come down if you can!" (<I>CL</I>,
3, 159).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the letters that follow, Conrad rehearses the story of his
disembodiment and subsequent reembodiment for the other members of
his growing circle. He shares the tale with H. G.  Wells, Edward
Garnett, Ford Madox Ford, R. B. Cunningham Graham, and others,
invoking for each of them his "half-delirious state," his "two blank
hours . . . on the concrete," and his horrible tooth--"It broke!" he
exclaims to Ford (<I>CL</I>, 3, 162-69). All respond to his pleas
for recognition--"I receive magnificent letters," Conrad tells Pinker
(<I>CL</I>, 3, 178). Their acknowledgement of his struggle brings to
completion the process of reembodiment begun in the letter. Cunningham
Graham's response in particular brings the pink back to Conrad's cheeks,
as it were: "Your letter was indeed worth having and I blush deeply as I
re-read it," Conrad tells him (<I>CL</I>, 3, 175). Conrad's renewed health
signifies the recognition his work has received, which itself represents
an accumulation of cultural capital that compensates for the capital
loss represented by the decidedly mixed reviews <I>Nostromo</I> received
in the popular press and for its sluggish sales as well.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>

Arnold Bennett, in a belated acknowledgement, dismisses the importance
of such forums. "[P]eople are so blind, and so infernally obstinate
in complaining because a book is not something that an author never
intended it to be. Only other creative artists can understand a creative
artist." After sharing this sentiment, Bennett reinforces Conrad's

<B></B>

reembodiment: "if one could but convey to you the <I>passionate</I>
comprehension which some of us have of your work, I think the effect on
your health would be good."
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As the years pass and the narrative of Conrad's letters progresses,
the number of his correspondents grows, as does the number of readers
qualified to assist in his reembodying project. Soon after Conrad's
death, Gerard Jean-Aubrey published a two-volume biography that included
hundreds of his letters. Collections from select correspondents, longtime
friends like Edward Garnett and Richard Curle, soon followed. These made
Conrad's scene of writing generally available and increased exponentially
the number of readers whose recognition would lend cultural capital to his
writing. Though the author himself had died, this recognition continued to
enliven his work. His institutionalization in Karl's biography and in the
major critical analyses of Guerard, Sherry, and Moser certified Conrad's
method of accounting for suffering. Later criticism preserved Conrad's
depiction of his mode of production, as one passage from Said's <I>The
World, the Text, and the Critic</I> makes clear: "Loneliness, darkness,
the necessity of writing, imprisonment: these are the pressures upon the
writer as he writes, and there is scarcely any I have read who seems so
profligate in his complaining."
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 Not so profligate as all
that, I have shown, for with each complaint Conrad gave another reader
the opportunity to invest in his work.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We can deduce that when Conrad backs away from his declaration that he is
"extremely well" and returns again to a refrain of illness and depression,
he does so in order to reproduce the means of his literary production. In
Conrad's understanding of writing as a professional service, there can be
no reembodiment without a prior disembodiment. This insight represents
Conrad's major contribution to literary economics. With it, he alters
the normative relationship between writing and commodification and makes
intelligible his own particular mode of production. The debilitating,
humiliating, and ultimately disembodying process of commodification
necessarily comes first, he theorizes. Before he can perform the service
of rewriting, or literary supplementation, there has to be a commodified,
worn-out narrative for him to rewrite. Before his work can receive
recognition from correspondents and critics, it must first be subjected to
the rigors, the horrors even, of market-driven production. The commodity
market has to kill the author before his consumers can resurrect him.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Herein lies the adventure of Conrad's professionalized writing
practice. Conrad presents his writing as a voyage into the nether regions
of pulp fiction. His salvage operations are journeys that imperil
his reputation as a serious artist. Each time he tries to transform
a text, he runs the risk of going native, of giving in to the lures
of mass culture. Each time he rewrites a story, he gambles that he
will be able to manage his object, that it will not ultimately manage
him. Conrad describes this hazardous gambit in his Author's Note to
<I>Nostromo</I>. "[M]y sojourn on the continent of Latin America," he
recounts, "lasted for two years . . . [which included] many intervals
of renewed hesitation, lest I should lose myself in the ever-enlarging
vistas opening before me as I progressed deeper in my knowledge of the
country."
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 Conrad

<B></B>

wrote this note more than a decade
after <I>Nostromo</I>'s initial publication in a style that echoes
the cover copy on the dust jacket of the novel's first edition. That
cover proclaimed <I>Nostromo</I> "a moving tale of high adventure--of
revolution, romance, hidden treasure, and a hero of the most vivid
personality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 The Author's Note reproducing this rhetoric
thus implies that the real hero of the tale is none other than the
author himself.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Far from undermining this mythic narrative of authorship, Conrad's
letters provided their readers with ample evidence of the physical and
psychic costs that were part and parcel of the adventure of literary
production. Conrad's gout, along with his other ailments, proved that
writing was a very real struggle, even if the author did not truly
travel to Latin America to complete his novel, even if the author did
not even leave his house. Though his letters complemented the more
public account of his literary labor, Conrad was emphatic that these
two descriptions be kept distinct. He regularly denied requests from
literary detectives interested in publicizing the details of his working
life. "The Author's method of work should remain an intimate thing," he
wrote to one reviewer in 1903. "I would just as soon think of laying
bare coram populo my method of home life . . . as my method of work"
(<I>CL</I>, 3, 12). By enforcing this injunction, Conrad guaranteed that
both versions of his authorship would remain in play. He also helped
to ensure that the version articulated by the letters would remain the
property of his most privileged readers: the scholars and critics deeply
invested in his work, his mode of authorship, and his modernism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Through these means, the professional author represented by Conrad's
letters keeps one foot planted in mass culture and the other resting in
high art. The letters thus place Conrad astride the great divide. By
managing his literary persona, moreover, they manage the terms for
understanding his literature. The letters show us that in order for the
difference of the modernist novel to emerge, Conrad's distinctive service
of novel-writing had to become recognizable. Conrad's letters establish
the specificity of that labor as they describe an author who, through his
struggle to transform popular narratives, enacted the modernist rupture
every time he set pen to paper. By bringing Conrad's mode of production
to the attention of his correspondents, the letters provided a way for his
readers to sanctify his efforts and assist in the creation of a market for
his services. The letters thus show that breaking with the literary world
of the Victorians in large part depended on the willingness of specialized
readers to give credit to suffering. More even than his literary style,
Conrad's gout provides us with special insight into the transformation
of cultural production that marks the onset of English modernism.

Despite, or perhaps because, Conrad so roundly chastised him for
his unartistic writing, Clifford became a loyal supporter of Conrad's
work. He helped to dramatically change Conrad's publishing fortunes
by persuading the editor of the <I>New York Herald</I> to serialize
<I>Chance</I> in 1909. The novel turned out to be Conrad's first popular
success. Although Clifford appears to have granted Conrad the authority
to rule on all aesthetic matters, he reserved the right to critique
Conrad for inaccuracies in his ethnographic knowledge. In September 1898,
Clifford published an unsigned review on the topic in the <I>Singapore
Free Press</I>. He followed it up on his visit to Clifford's home in

This was hardly an unusual move. Christopher Butler provides ample
evidence that modernist writing located its influences in any number
of extra-literary locales (<I>Early Modernism: Literature, Music, and

Investment was not simply a metaphor. Karl documents the
development of a profitable trade in Conrad manuscripts and literary
ephemera that began with John Quinn's 1911 purchase of the manuscript
drafts of <I>Outcast of the Islands</I> and several other early pieces
(<I>Conrad</I>, 702). Lawrence Rainey shows that a logic of investment
shaped the initial readership of Joyce's <I>Ulysses</I>, whose original
book form was a small run, collector's edition ("Consuming Investments:
Joyce's Ulysses," <I>James Joyce Quarterly</I> 33.4 [1996]: 533).

What Conrad may or may not have known is that Blackwood had once
thought he had spotted such investment potential in Conrad's work. See

Bourdieu, <I>Logic</I>, 118. Perkin shows that cultural capital is
"manifestly more tangible than corporate shareholdings, less destructible
than buildings and machinery, and capable of self-renewal and improvement"
(<I>RPS</I>, 379). Ehrenreich and Ehrenreich observe that these kinds of
capital holdings give professionals an interest in preserving the terms of
capital production as a whole, even if they take up positions designed to
rework or dissolve specific forms of capitalization ("Professional," 12).

Because his works so often mutated from story to novel, and because
they were nearly always published serially as well as in book form,
Conrad's accounting proved complicated. These complications can be seen
in a "Draft of arrangements and payments for Lord Jim and Volume of Tales"
that Conrad submitted to Blackwood's on May 22, 1900. <I>CL</I>, 2, 274.
