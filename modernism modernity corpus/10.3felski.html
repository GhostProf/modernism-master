<p>
Cultural studies has paid scant heed to questions of modernity, modernism,
and modernization. The leading journals in the field, such as <i>Cultural
Studies,The International Journal of Cultural Studies,</i> and <i>Social
Text,</i> very seldom publish essays that engage substantially with
such ideas. Of the forty contributors to the massive <i>Cultural
Studies</i> volume edited by Lawrence Grossberg, Cary Nelson, and Paula
Treichler, none expresses even a cursory curiosity about modernity or
modernism. Apart from one essay by Edward Soja, a similar indifference
pervades another widely used collection edited by Simon During. Sifting
through the ever-expanding pile of samplers, summaries, introductions,
and overviews of cultural studies, one is easily persuaded that it is
a field devoted entirely to the immediate present.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>

<p>
What might seem like an unfortunate sign of historical hubris or academic
oversight is in some eyes the singular virtue of the cultural studies
project. "Cultural studies," writes Simon During, "is the study of
<i>contemporary</i> culture."
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
It is a field that is adamantly yoked to the new and the now, a method
matched to its own moment, an approach tied to the epochal uniqueness
of our own image-saturated, consumption-crazed, globally connected yet
politically fragmented age. Since the mid-1980s, the lure of the word
"postmodern" has proved almost irresistible; when "modernity" appears
at all in cultural studies, it is often there to be refuted, derided,
or denounced, a handy catch phrase for conservative politics, old hat
metaphysics, and snobbish aesthetics.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p>
While cultural studies may seem oblivious to modernist studies, the
reverse is far from true. In literature departments anxious to remake
themselves, cultural studies has become a much

<b></b>

favored way of announcing that one is moving away from business as usual;
it is widely used shorthand for social relevance and political urgency,
for a clamorous movement to reconnect word and world. Although cultural
studies often gives short shrift to history, in literature departments,
paradoxically, it has come to signal a return to history. The "new
modernisms" are a much heralded part of this critical turn, speaking to a
sense of weariness with reverential rereadings of modernist masters and an
eagerness for broader, more expansive maps of the modern that can locate
texts squarely in the political fault lines and fissures of culture.
<p>
Yet the growing use of "cultural studies" as a catchall synonym for
"the study of culture" should give us pause. Not long ago, I heard a
well-known literary scholar remark in response to a question after his
talk: "of course, we're all doing cultural studies now." The proliferation
of such comments indicates that a specific rubric is being bloated and
distended beyond all recognition, in danger of becoming as ubiquitous
as it is useless. A phrase that once named a distinct project, an
intellectual tradition, a core cluster of ideas and arguments, is now
being stretched to subsume a grab bag of differing and often incompatible
textual methods. Cultural studies may seem like a useful umbrella term,
but if too many people try to cram under the umbrella, everyone will
end up getting very wet.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
Cultural studies, it must be said, has not been overly anxious to rein in
the rampant, kudzu-like proliferation of its name. It is a much favored
gambit in the field to argue that any attempt to specify and hence limit
its agenda must be strenuously resisted. The downside of this claim
that cultural studies cannot be defined is that it becomes impossible
to show the wrongness of any particular definition. "Cultural studies,"
writes one critic, "is a whirling and quiescent and swaying mobile which
constantly repositions any participating subject . . . a project whose
realization . . . is forever deferred."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
For other scholars it is the model for "an interpretative politics with
no limits."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
This aversion to circumscribing the parameters of cultural studies often
goes along with a fervent denunciation of disciplinary straitjackets
and institutional orthodoxy. Insisting on the utterly nonroutine nature
of cultural studies is now a quasi-obligatory professional ritual.
<p>
To grasp what is at stake here, we need to reverse the optic, to realize
that modernist studies can throw light on cultural studies as well as
the other way around. Although cultural studies may pride itself on
being postmodern, many of its assumptions are in fact quintessentially
modern. Indeed, cultural studies is one of the latest avatars of the
spirit of the avant-garde. At first hearing, this claim may sound counter
intuitive; after all, doesn't cultural studies urge intellectuals to
renounce the arrogant assumption of superior wisdom and critical insight,
and to protest the all too common portrayal of ordinary people as mindless
masses and "cultural dopes"? Isn't its ethos, then, the very opposite of a
vanguard politics? In principle, yes; and yet this stalwart defense of the
popular can easily tip over into a new form of status-seeking distinction,
a covert bid for moral superiority and cutting edge radicalism in the
highly charged fray of academic politics. The vanguardism of cultural
studies takes a distinctive form; it lies not in vaunting the authority
of intellectuals vis-&agrave;-vis the people but in trumping its own
superiority as a field vis-&agrave;-vis the conventional disciplines.

<b></b>

<p>
The idea of the avant-garde, according to Matei Calinescu, yokes a
progressive and future-oriented vision of time to a cataclysmic splitting
of the world into opposed camps.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Assuming their own inevitable victory, avant-gardes define themselves
against the tyranny of the past, the forces of stagnation, the benighted
ignorance of old ways of thought. A parallel rhetoric runs through
cultural studies. Proclaiming itself the wave of the future, cultural
studies sees itself waging a form of guerilla warfare against the
tyrannical forces of the reactionary and hidebound disciplines. Cultural
studies is conjured in the future tense, as the certain culmination of
the righteous hopes of the present. Think, for example, of the title of
Anthony Easthope's book <i>Literary into Cultural Studies</i>; literature
departments may still be institutionally dominant, Easthope concedes,
but their days are numbered. Cultural studies is their manifest destiny
and salvation, the means by which a stodgy and conservative field of
study will be transformed into a suitably progressive one.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>
Moreover, cultural studies shares with the avant-garde a yearning for the
vital, the intensely immediate, the bracing fervor of commitment. Both
are enamored of the language of crisis, rupture, and transgression;
both yearn to smash the aura of the artwork, to topple the masterpiece
and tear down the walls between art and everyday life. F. T. Marinetti's
famous call to destroy "the museums, libraries, academies of every kind"
is echoed in cultural studies' contempt for the ivory tower and its
longing to reconnect the humanities to the wider world.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Marcel Duchamp hoped that the provocation of his ready-mades would
expose the fraudulence and hypocrisy of the art world. Similarly,
contemporary critics hail the study of Oprah and MTV as an assault on
the sacrosanct values of tweedy, out-of-touch mandarins.
<p>
It is a feature of avant-garde movements that they deny their own
precursors, claiming to be utterly new and without precedent. The much
noted presentism of cultural studies thus stems from the very modernity
that it claims to have surpassed, as it repeats the quintessentially
modern gesture of disavowing and disclaiming the past. Modernity holds
the blueprint for the insurrectionary impulses of cultural studies,
which are easily traced to the antinomian spirit of modern bohemianism
and the avant-garde. At the same time, modern history also contains
countless reminders of the gulf between revolutionary rhetoric and
social realities. According to Peter Burger's well-known thesis, the
enshrining of Duchamp's urinals and bottle racks in the museum exposes
the hollowness of the claim that changing the nature of the art work
will do away with the institution of art.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
It is equally misguided to think that studying soap operas instead of
Sophocles will efface the boundaries between scholarly knowledge and
everyday life. Cultural studies has done much to invigorate approaches
to popular culture, but it does so from a position squarely inside,
rather than outside, institutional frames.
<p>
Here I agree with Tony Bennett, one of the most astute theorists of
cultural studies as well as one of its most astringent critics. Cultural
studies, he argues, likes to cast its project in a heroic, even
redemptive, light, defining itself as a phantom social movement, a form
of politics by proxy. It appeals to two contradictory ideas; the myth
of marginality, exemplified in its critique of the institution, and the
myth of wholeness,

<b></b>

embodied in its claim to transcend rarified forms of academic
specialization. Bennett argues that neither of these myths has much
to do with the actual practice of cultural studies, even as they
perpetuate a misleadingly static, reified, and unhistorical view of
the disciplines. Instead of relying on a rhetoric of political charisma
and aesthetic transgression, he writes, we need "to fashion a clearer
sense of the specific and therefore limited frameworks of analysis and
inquiry that cultural studies might claim as its own in relation to,
and alongside, the concerns of more established humanities and social
science disciplines."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<p>
In spite of the mutual misapprehensions outlined above, some scholars
of modernity are drawing on the methods of cultural studies while
steering clear of its oft-cited deficiencies: an excess of political
hubris and too cheaply bought radical righteousness, a dispiriting lack
of historical perspective, and an indifference to the archive. Whether
this cross-pollination of cultural studies with recent histories and
theories of modernity should still be designated cultural studies
or something else (cultural history? cultural theory?) is beyond the
scope of this essay. However the new work on the culture of modernity
is clearly indebted to two key ideas of cultural studies that are often
ignored or misunderstood: an expanded notion of the aesthetic field and
a theory of articulation.
<p>
I will argue that these two ideas define the distinctive parameters of
a cultural studies approach, a thesis that I pursue by contrasting such
an approach to two other ways of linking the aesthetics and politics
of modernity: the sociology of literature and culture and what I call
political formalism. To survey a sample of recent publications in
modernist studies is to realize that all three approaches are currently
in play in critical discourse, even as they lead to differing, and
sometimes diametrically opposed, conclusions. Only by circumscribing
cultural studies and distinguishing it from other methods can we hope
to discern its distinctiveness as a project. Cultural studies is not an
all purpose panacea or the only valid way of thinking about culture and
power. Stripped of its romantic-revolutionary rhetoric and its dubious
messianic teleologies, it can be reenvisioned not as the utopian future
of literary studies but as a specific part of its present.
<p align="center">
* * *
<p>
Much of the work that currently goes under the name of cultural studies
is more accurately filed under other categories. One of these rubrics,
the sociology of literature, is admittedly short on contemporary
charisma. In the United States, especially, it ekes out an existence on
the margins of sociology departments and the peripheral vision of most
literary critics. Yet its endeavors are important and resonate at many key
points with the current catchphrases of literary studies. Sociologists of
literature ask questions about the profession and politics of authorship;
the institution of publishing; the relationship between literature
and the marketplace; the mechanisms of canon formation; the history of
reception; and the networks of connection and influence, discipleship,
and affiliation, all of which shape literary achievement and reputation.

<b></b>

Some sociologists also engage in textual interpretation, exploring
the links between art and ideology and the various ways in which texts
allude to or obscure social, political, or economic realities. In short,
sociologists define art as a field that is shaped by political interests
and struggles for power and legitimation.
<p>
To redescribe some influential trends in literary study as part of
the sociology of literature is to connect these trends to a long and
distinguished lineage of modern thought that stretches from Georg
Luk&aacute;cs to Lucien Goldmann to Pierre Bourdieu.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
In the study of Anglo-American modernism this tradition has been cast
into deep shadow by the dominance of high formalism. As a result,
recent sociological readings of modernism have burst on the scene with
insurrectionary novelty; given the equal newness of cultural studies
and its similar association with politics, it is tempting to equate
the two. And yet, as I hope to show, the sociology of literature and
cultural studies diverge significantly on the question of aesthetics.
<p>
An excellent example of a sociological approach to modernism is Lawrence
Rainey's <i>Institutions of Modernism.</i> "For sociologists," writes
Rainey, "institutions are the structures that interpose themselves between
the individual and society; they are both social subdivisions of human
beings and the regulative principles that organize various zones of
activity and behavior."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
Such institutions play a vital role in mediating between the artwork
and its meanings and effects in the public sphere. Rainey's book brings
modernism squarely down to earth. Rather than an austere artifact,
a recondite and semisacred hieroglyph, it is just another commodity
traded in certain venues and social milieus, brokered by key movers and
players, imbricated in the logic of patronage, collecting, speculation,
and investment.
<p>
Thus, Rainey deftly dismantles a reigning myth about the publication
of <i>Ulysses,</i> according to which, as he writes, "Joyce and Beach
are cast as heroic res who have succeeded despite a benighted legal
system, philistine publishers, and a hostile or indifferent public."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
The success of Joyce's novel had less to do with a small band of
prescient readers alert to signs of literary genius than with the
pecuniary interests of speculators in the rare book trade. Through a
meticulous reconstruction of its publication history, Rainey documents
the calculations that went on behind the scenes, showing that most of
the early purchasers of <i>Ulysses</i> were investors buying deluxe
copies with an eye to resale. Modernism did not transcend the market
so much as market itself as transcending the market; its prestige was
closely associated with an aura of expense and exclusivity that bound
together discerning patron-readers and the writers whose work they
supported. At a time when aesthetic norms were under siege, cost became
a crucial touchstone of artistic worth; "the substantial price of the
first edition," writes Rainey of <i>Ulysses,</i> "inevitably dictated
a certain psychic investment, demanding assent to strong claims about
the work's literary or aesthetic value."
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>
In this and similar examples of modernist criticism we see techniques
and methods from the social sciences being brought to bear on works of
art. Sociology offers a rich repertoire of concepts for contextualizing
and embedding aesthetic objects: institutions and public spheres,
capitalism and commodification, alienation and anomie. To work in
the sociology of literature is to slot artistic works into social and
political frames

<b></b>

rather than the other way around. According to one definition of the
field, literature is of interest only insofar as it can be used "to
reveal, exemplify or interpret social process." Whereas literary criticism
may evoke the critic's fervent identification with the text, "no social
science instills comparable psychic investment in the literary object."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>

<p>
In fact, sociological attitudes to the literary work are more varied than
such a claim suggests. Early sociologists of literature, for example,
Leo Lowenthal and Lucien Goldmann, drew a firm and unabashed distinction
between great and minor works of art. Such scholars often engaged in close
readings of canonical works, even as they ultimately sought to explain the
internal features of literature as mediated reflections of a social whole.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
Often tied to Marxist or neo-Marxist frameworks, such text based
interpretations have fallen out of favor as the weaknesses of reflection
theory have become apparent. Sociologists of literature today are much
more likely to carry out empirically grounded analyses of institutional
mechanisms of production and reception that shape literary meaning.
<p>
There is a similar diversity of sociological responses to the
question of aesthetic value. First of all, a scholar may simply opt
to suspend judgment, claiming that the question of aesthetics goes
beyond her professional purview and disciplinary competence as a social
scientist. This doctrine of "aesthetic neutrality" is perhaps the most
common response within the largely positivist orientation of American
sociology.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Alternatively, she may actively endorse and underwrite traditional
criteria of aesthetic value, as in the example of Lowenthal and
Goldmann cited above. Writing in a similar vein, Diana Laurenson
and Alan Swingewood claim that "on this point, most sociologists of
literature and literary critics are agreed: one studies great writers
precisely because their greatness implies deep insights into the human
and social condition."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
Finally and conversely, she may see a sociological approach as actively
undercutting the authority of aesthetic categories by accounting for
them in nonaesthetic terms. Pierre Bourdieu for example adopts this
position when he portrays artistic appreciation as little more than
class-based symbolic violence.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
It is a commonplace of contemporary criticism that cultural studies is
anti-aesthetic, seeking to replace the truth of art with the truth of
politics. (Eugene Goodheart's recent assertion that cultural studies
"means the ideological interpretation of a text" typifies this
quasi-ubiquitous belief.)
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
Against this view, I argue that the tradition of cultural studies
reveals not a rejection but an expansion and pluralization of the
aesthetic field; it seeks to enrich our sense of what counts as art
by taking popular culture seriously. Whereas sociology brings out the
political dimensions of even the most rarefied art works, cultural
studies attends to the symbolic, expressive, and aesthetic aspects of
the most mundane cultural artifacts and activities. Unlike sociology,
cultural studies neither ignores, rejects, nor endorses the prevailing
discourse of the aesthetic; rather, it intervenes in that discourse in
order to alter its guiding assumptions and frames of reference. Clearly,
such an intervention goes beyond a strictly Kantian framework; popular
art, almost by definition, does not count as autonomous art. And it
is no doubt because of the ready association of aesthetics with an
exalted corpus of great works that cultural studies has often defined
its approach as political rather than aesthetic.

<b></b>

Yet this dichotomy leads us seriously astray. In its attentiveness to
convention and form&#8212;the <i>how</i> as well as the <i>what</i>
of meaning&#8212;and to the intensely charged affect that surrounds
the experience of popular art, cultural studies owes a clear debt to
techniques of aesthetic interpretation.
<p>
In other words, cultural studies bears the unmistakable marks of its
dual parentage, literary criticism and sociology. It is as much about
form as about content, as much about pleasure as about politics. It does
not abandon close reading but requires it. One of the central tenets of
cultural studies is that popular culture is more than just a delivery
system for ideology, an argument that calls for careful attention to
formal devices and conventions. To equate cultural studies with content
analysis and ideology critique is to seriously shortchange its history
and traditions. Think, for example, of Dick Hebdige's readings of the
avant-garde elements of subcultural style, of Michel de Certeau's interest
in the elusive poetics of everyday life, and of Paul Willis's concern
with the dramaturgical and expressive dimensions of popular culture. Nor
do scholars of cultural studies shy away from value judgments; to read
Angie McRobbie on dance or Simon Frith on popular music is to be persuaded
that such forms matter, not just because they can be read politically,
but because they hook up so powerfully to the imaginative and expressive
lives of their consumers.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>

<p>
How does this expanded vision of the aesthetic field change our view of
the culture of modernity? As Michael North shows in <i>Reading 1922:
A Return to the Scene of the Modern,</i> it decisively undercuts
the antithesis of art versus society that still tends to shape our
understanding of the modernist period. Charting the multiple flows of
connection and influence among individuals, ideas, and fields that are
often kept apart, North brings together anthropology and philosophy,
psychoanalysis and public sphere theory, avant-garde art and music
hall, archaeology and advertising, in a powerful synoptic sweep. In
this thoroughly entangled and hybridized universe, many once clear-cut
distinctions no longer make much sense. North gives us an anthropology of
modern culture in which the aesthetic bursts out of solitary confinement
in order to saturate the social field. "When even the most mundane product
is marketed as an experience," North writes, "aesthetic considerations
have penetrated the market to an extraordinary degree."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

<p>
Whereas sociologists stress the determining power of institutions
and systems, North points to the mediation of everyday experience
via mass-produced texts as a quintessential fact of modernity. And in
contrast to literary critics who champion a supremely self-conscious
modernist art against the drab, dulled sensibility of mass culture,
North argues that mediation carried strangeness into the heart of popular
culture and everyday life. The relationship of modern individuals to
their world was filtered through a dizzyingly eclectic array of ideas,
images, and narratives circulating in the public sphere. "As society
becomes progressively aestheticized," writes North, "as audiences begin
to consume imaginative and symbolic materials as they had previously
consumed material goods, then everyday life acquires an inherently ironic
distance from itself" (<i>RAR,</i> 208). Thus, the popular culture of the
1920s was often highly self-reflexive and fully aware of the mediating
status of language and form.

<b></b>

<p>
North steers clear of any explicit reference to cultural studies,
yet the common ground is a shared conviction that popular culture
and everyday life are not just explanatory context, but resonant,
ambivalent, polyvocal text, richly deserving of formal scrutiny in their
own right. "The common opposition of an ironic, aestheticized modernism
to mass culture," he writes, "thus depends on a prior generalization
about mass culture that seriously oversimplifies it" (ibid). We can no
longer cling to a view of modernity as an era when avant-garde and kitsch
faced off across the great divide, while postponing the blurring of high
and low to the period known as postmodernism. Rather, North concludes,
"it may be a certain self-conscious formalism, then, that most closely
links modernist literary works with modern society" (<i>RAR,</i> 210).
<p>
In <i>Reading 1922</i> the culture of modernity is read anew through
the template of aesthetic modernism. Dissonance and estrangement are no
longer distinguishing markers of the modernist masterpiece but are woven
deep into the warp and woof of vernacular culture and everyday life. In
North's compelling analysis, the ordinary is rendered extraordinary;
defamiliarization is no longer just a specialized poetic device but
an inescapable component of modern living. And yet, cultural studies
also reminds us that aesthetics is conjured in the plural. It pushes us
to look beyond our professional predilection for irony and artfulness
and to explore other registers of aesthetic experience: the euphoria of
escapism, the somatic charge of identification, the spine-tingling thrill
of vicarious terror, the cathartic relief of narrative closure. Such
pleasures have not disappeared in the modern era, though they have often
been sidelined by modern criticism.
<p>
Melodrama is an example of a genre once viewed as hackneyed and
old-fashioned that is now being reevaluated as a distinctively modern
form of cultural expression. In <i>Melodrama and Modernity,</i> Ben
Singer carries out a major work of cultural retrieval, uncovering a
largely unknown corpus of American sensational melodrama that spanned the
period from 1880 to 1920. Turn-of-the-century stage melodrama drew on the
latest technological innovations in order to showcase suspenseful scenes
of train wrecks, car races, storms at sea, collapsing hot air balloons,
tornados, Alpine avalanches, and burning buildings. By 1910 it had been
displaced by its cinematic equivalent at the local movie theater where
the spectator enjoyed an even wider range of spectacles and thrills for
a much lower entrance fee.
<p>
Singer shows that the melodramatic aesthetic spoke to modernity's
"experiential qualities, its ideological fluctuations, its cultural
anxieties, its intertextual cross-currents, its social demographics,
and its commercial practices."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
Yet it also suffered critical disdain because of its sensationalism
and violence, formulaic yet disjointed plotlines, lack of interest
in psychological depth, and appeal to a mass audience. Accordingly,
melodrama is conspicuously absent from most accounts of modern
aesthetics; indeed, it is often the counterfoil against which the
modernity of modern art is defined.
<p>
According to Singer's useful definition, melodrama is a "cluster
concept" that allows for different combinations of five elements:
strong pathos; heightened emotional expression; moral polarization;
nonclassical narrative mechanics&#8212;outrageous coincidence, convoluted
plotting&#8212;and spectacular effects. Several of these elements also

<b></b>

clash with what are often seen as quintessential elements of modern
style. Thus, the lurid exaggeration and emotional extravagance of
melodrama are patently at odds with a "cool" aesthetic of irony,
knowingness, and detachment. Melodrama also defies the critical
commonplace of a secularized and disenchanted modernity, giving
us a morally schematic and providentially ordered universe, and
inviting a sense of agitation and outrage at the spectacle of extreme
injustice. Moreover, the aesthetics of melodrama hinges on the adrenalin
rush of fast-moving action and cliff-hanging suspense. Such features
receive short shrift in classic theories of modernism, where the
mechanics of plot are disdained as a sop to the masses or a tired
Victorian holdover.
<p>
And yet Singer shows how the formal features of melodrama were intimately
linked to the social conditions of modernity. Contemporary newspapers
repeatedly invoked the sensory overload, heightened stimulation,
and unexpected dangers of modern urban life. These same features were
echoed in the sensational film melodrama, with its thrills and spills,
fleeting impressions, constant shocks, and visceral stimulation. The
plotline of melodrama spoke to anxieties about the unpredictable and
often brutal rhythms of modern capitalism by conjuring up scenarios of
individual powerlessness, social atomization, and ruthless competition,
even as it helped to assuage such anxieties by subsuming them within a
morally legible framework. And the sensational film melodrama was also
a prime vehicle through which to explore a distinctively modern vision
of woman. As intimated by such titles as <i>The Exploits of Elaine,The
Hazards of Helen,The Perils of Pauline,</i> and <i>The Adventures of
Dorothy Dare,</i> melodrama offered a new script of female heroism
that allowed women to engage in brawls and fistts, knock villains
out stone cold, jump from speeding trains, and rescue men from burning
buildings. It captured the paradoxical nature of femaleness at a pivotal
phase of modernity, celebrating the excitement of women's new mobility
outside the home, while also depicting lurid scenarios of assaults,
abductions, intimated rape, and torture arising from their movement
into the mixed-sex, mixed-class, and mixed-ethnicity chaos of the modern
urban milieu.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>

<p>
Singer makes a compelling case for both the formal richness of melodrama
and its quintessential modernity. To make the latter claim, as he points
out in his unusually tough-minded reflections on method, is to confront
difficult questions about how to link aesthetic forms and social norms,
how to shuttle between fine grained textual analysis and larger historical
pictures. How does one justify a claim for the political import or
effects of aesthetic objects? What kind of evidence is needed in order
to present a text as exemplary, emblematic, or symptomatic? What is the
rationale for establishing a structural correlation between very different
phenomena&#8212;for example, a lyric poem and the fact of empire&#8212;and
at what point does correlation serve as persuasive evidence of causality?
<p>
Such questions go to the heart of the differences between cultural studies
and another method with which it is often confused: political formalism. I
coin the term "political formalism" to describe a loose assemblage of
reading techniques that are selectively deployed in approaches ranging
from neo-Marxism to feminism to queer theory. (The word <i>selectively</i>
is important here; my point is to show that political perspectives

<b></b>

can be articulated via a range of differing, often conflicting,
methodologies). In contrast to the sociology of literature, political
formalism insists on the primacy and preeminence of aesthetic form,
which it strives to decipher with a formidable array of analytical
devices. It calls for a patient poring over poetic conventions, a
relentless scrutiny of rative language, a neverending labor of
reading between the lines. This textual hypervigilance is understood
as not just aesthetic work, but also as political work. Form is not
merely a container for content but a vital means of accessing the
invisible intricacies of ideology. Metaphors, binary oppositions,
narrative syntax, and visual schemas all carry patterns of hierarchy,
exclusion, and inequality encoded in their DNA; a close reading of an
innocuous and seemingly inconsequential textual thread can thus lead
deep into the labyrinthian workings of power.
<p>
Alternatively, the plasticity of artistic form may allow it to resist
such power, to set language askew and to estrange us from habitual
schemas. Poststructuralist theories have helped breathe new life into
the study of modernism, such that many of modernism's stylistic features
(poetic language, narrative rupture, heightened ambiguity, nonlinear
syntax) have acquired a newly audacious sheen. Progressive critics who
might once have lamented the elitist, apolitical mind-set of modernism
are now more likely to argue that the politics of modernism lies precisely
in the perverse detours and ellipses of its form.
<p>
For example, in <i>Libidinal Currents: Sexuality and the Shaping of
Modernism,</i> Joseph Boone pursues a meticulous analysis of modernist
fiction from Virginia Woolf to William Faulkner. Boone marshals an
eloquent defense of the technique of close reading as a way of engaging
with what he calls, after Eve Sedgwick, the "numinous and resistant power"
of aesthetic objects.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
In the wayward trajectories and deviant narrative energies of modernism,
he writes, we can find traces of queer alterity and the polymorphously
perverse. In their indeterminate slipperiness and their fascination with
sexual and textual ambiguity, modernist works anticipate many of the
insights of poststructuralism. Their aesthetic is one of contradiction,
ambivalence, and crisis, unleashing a plurality of voices that undermine
the authority of any single master narrative. Thus, the perceived
difficulty and obliqueness of modernist fiction is intimately linked
to its questioning of hegemonic discourses.
<p>
In a parallel project, though one more wary of attributing qualities of
resistance to aesthetic forms, Rachel Blau DuPlessis seeks to connect
modernist poetry to political modernity. DuPlessis also defends the value
of close reading, arguing for a repositioning rather than a rejection
of the formal techniques of New Criticism. Pointing out that contextual
approaches to literature usually slight the qualities and texture of
poetic language, she advocates a "social philology" able to mediate
between social ideologies and aesthetic conventions. Reading the work of a
wide range of modernist poets, DuPlessis aims to show how social meanings
are embedded and condensed in the deep structure of verbal artifice.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
These methods of political formalism differ in key respects from those
of cultural studies, where one does not find the same commitment to
close reading as a source of political insight. At the heart of cultural
studies lies the idea of articulation, best described

<b></b>

as a theory of social correspondences, non-correspondences, and
contradictions or alternatively as a theory of how contexts are made,
unmade, and remade.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
First developed by Ernesto Laclau, the idea of articulation was taken
up in cultural studies in the late 1970s and is widely considered to
be one of its most generative and influential concepts.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
An articulation is a hookup, a temporary linkage, a forged connection
between two or more elements. It is a contingent link between phenomena
that do not share a unifying or essential identity and one that is
unmade and remade over time. "Articulation," writes Larry Grossberg,
"links this practice to that effect, this text to that meaning, this
meaning to that reality, this experience to those politics. And these
links are themselves articulated into larger structures."
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
Culture is neither organically unified nor radically fragmented and
dispersed; rather, it is a multijointed and multihinged composite of
often disparate elements. Articulation thus seeks to explain how segments
of the social field may join together to form temporary unities without
resorting to a view of the social whole as an expressive totality whose
essential features are mirrored in every one of its parts. The "so-called
unity of a discourse," notes Stuart Hall, "is really the articulation
of different, distinct elements which can be rearticulated in different
ways because they have no necessary 'belongingness.' . . . A theory of
articulation is both a way of understanding how ideological elements
come, under certain conditions, to cohere together within a discourse,
and a way of asking how they do or do not become articulated, at specific
conjunctures, to certain political subjects."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>

<p>
The idea of articulation has obvious consequences for
interpretation. According to cultural studies, the political import
of a text cannot be inferred from its internal form or logic, but
derives from its position in a constellation of texts, practices, and
interests. The moment of production is less salient than the vagaries
of reception; that a work is a capitalist commodity or the creation
of a male-dominated culture does not determine ahead of time what
its meanings and effects will be. Textual analysis thus needs to be
extensively augmented by an account of practices, and here one may find
one's hypotheses disrupted by disorderly and recalcitrant facts that
do not fit a favorite theory. This constant checking of interpretation
against empirical data is one obvious way that cultural studies departs
from the tradition of aesthetic interpretation. Rather than synthesizing
aesthetics and politics into a textual politics, it juxtaposes and
adjudicates between literary and historical forms of evidence.
<p>
Perhaps we can now see why the readings of cultural studies will never be
deep enough or close enough to satisfy the political formalist. Cultural
studies is often accused of insensitivity to the intricacy, singularity,
and complexity of the aesthetic object. Scholars in the field are, I have
argued, much more attentive to formal questions than such a complaint
suggests. And yet, it is also true that they rarely engage in the kind
of dazzling, chapter-long exegeses of a single work that are so beloved
of political formalists. Such tour de force readings strive to show how
textual details can open up onto social wholes, how thick description of
a particular work can be profoundly revealing of the defining patterns
of a culture.

<b></b>

<p>
From the standpoint of cultural studies, however, there is insufficient
payoff to justify such a degree of attention to aesthetic objects, given
the lack of any necessary or clear-cut correspondence between specific
works and the broader social field. To carry out a symptomatic reading is
thus, in Grossberg's view, to see the world in a grain of sand, to proceed
as if a text were a microcosmic representation of social relations that,
if deciphered correctly, will yield the hidden truth of the social whole.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
By contrast, cultural studies seeks to detotalize the social field and
hence rejects the assumption that any individual work can represent
that field. The political pulse of a culture is not to be found in
the depths of a single work but rather in a mobile and discontinuous
constellation of texts as they play off, influence, and contradict each
other. Rather than reading <i>into</i> texts, cultural studies seeks
to read <i>across</i> texts.
<p>
Laura Doan's <i>Fashioning Sapphism,</i> for example, accumulates a
formidable density of historical detail to question the myth of the
lesbian as a transgressive outsider and martyr to modernity. Indeed, in
a deft act of defamiliarization, she shows that our common sense schemas
of gender and sexuality were once conred otherwise. By embedding
photographs of Radclyffe Hall and other mannish women within a thick
description of the visual culture of the 1920s, Doan shows that what now
seem like provocatively lesbian images were often read very differently,
as a sign of modernity and up-to-dateness, or bohemian eccentricity, or
aristocratic hauteur. It is precisely because of the multivalent coding
of such images that Hall was such a respected and respectable re, her
lifestyle widely feted in women's magazines and the popular press. Rather
than delving into the hidden meanings of an aesthetic object&#8212;<i>The
Well of Loneliness</i>&#8212;in order to show how it supports or subverts
modern sexual ideology, Doan traces out its often surprising articulations
with other texts and practices to reveal that modern sexual ideology
was itself more differentiated than we may have realized.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>

<p>
Thus, even as the mainstream of cultural studies has often maligned or
misconstrued the modern, its own method of articulation offers an implicit
rebuke to such knee-jerk dismissals. In fact, another common complaint
about cultural studies&#8212;that it relies on a self-righteous rhetoric
of unmasking and debunking&#8212;strikes me as largely misplaced. For
example, Stefan Collini writes in a notorious review of the field:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
texts are interrogated (a favourite term) to demonstrate how they distort,
occlude (another favourite), or in other ways inadvertently reveal the
ideological pressure which shaped them. These pressures are in turn
taken to be symptomatic of the way in which power operates in society
to the systematic disadvantage of certain marginalized or oppressed
groups. One effect of these combined developments is that cultural
studies, particularly as practised in the United States, is in constant
danger of turning into "Grievance Studies."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
While this caricature is not unrecognizable, cultural studies strikes me
as less guilty of the charge of holier-than-thou political correctness
than other contemporary critical methods. Because it sees meaning
as thoroughly enmeshed in practice, it does not conceive of texts as
malevolent, all-powerful devices for the interpellation and manipulation

<b></b>

of human subjects. And because it is interested in the making and
remaking of culture in daily life, it is not especially drawn to a
self-righteous rhetoric of unmasking or a hypervigilant hermeneutics
of suspicion.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<p>
Let me illustrate this point with some concluding comments on a
forthcoming book by Liz Conor entitled <i>The Spectacular Modern
Woman.</i> Conor takes as her subject the pervasiveness of the female
image in modernity and as an index of modernity. She begins from a
premise familiar to feminist scholars: that modern mechanisms of looking
are predicated on gender asymmetry, such that it is women, above all,
who are defined by their visibility. The best-known development of this
insight is of course the feminist formalism of Laura Mulvey.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
Historically inflected versions of this thesis concur with Mulvey's
view of woman as object, but refer to the changing perceptual field of
modernity rather than the psychodynamics of male sexuality, invoking
such ideas as the society of the spectacle and the modern hegemony of
vision. In this view, women are barred from the modern subject position
of the spectator because of their existence as embodied, specularized,
objects.
<p>
Conor concurs that becoming a spectacle was deeply implicated in modern
forms of subjectivity. For women in particular, to enter the modern
scene was to make a spectacle of oneself, to apprehend oneself and
be apprehended as an image. But Conor rejects the usual reading of
this fact in terms of a subject/object dichotomy anchored in sexual
difference. To become a spectacle, she insists, is not to be barred
from the role of spectator, nor is it to be consigned to a passive or
inactive condition. Conor's development of the notion of "appearing"
is a conceptual milestone in rethinking the position of women in the
visual scene of modernity. Appearing refers to the ways in which women
articulated themselves as modern subjects by constituting themselves
as spectacles. That is to say, it is a theory of representation that
allocates an active verb to those who are seen by others and thus opens
up a space for addressing female agency, desire, and investment in the
image. Appearing, writes Conor, is precisely the conflation of object
and subject, the syncretic moment of the subject experiencing itself as
object or the object experiencing itself as subject.
<p>
Conor's extraordinarily rich compendium of archival material suggests
there was no clear-cut correspondence between female visibility and
male power. The rapidly multiplying images of the modern woman in film,
advertising, magazines, photographic portraits, and display windows
unleashed a wide range of responses from voyeuristic pleasure to moral
outrage. Female visibility could be articulated as sexual availability,
political assertiveness, personal vulnerability, women's association with
the commodity, or a lost essence of femininity. Tracing out a typology
of images of the modern woman, including the city girl, the flapper,
the business girl, the beauty contestant, the screen star, and the
screen-struck girl, Conor shows how feminine spectacle carried a volatile
burden of meaning as connoting both verisimilitude and illusion, both
the pleasures and the perils of modernity. This exploding repertoire of
images was in turn taken up, negotiated, and modified by women themselves
in their own quest to be modern.

<b></b>

<p>
Conor's work is a consummate calibration of female visibility as
allowing for new possibilities of self-fashioning, sexual expression,
mobility, and display as well as for surveillance, harassment, and
punitive self-scrutiny. Aboriginal women, for example, were presented
as visual anomalies on the modern scene, unable to enter modernity as
self-conscious subjects invested in their own image. Conor reproduces a
remarkable 1928 cartoon showing an encounter between a young Australian
woman and the Aboriginal servant "Mary" who is scrubbing her floor. The
mistress is elegant, slim, striking; she is dressed in the garb of
an aviatrix, stylishly turned out in airplane goggles as well as high
heels. By contrast, as Conor notes, "Mary sits in a puddle in sartorial
indefinition, her hair unruly, her features projected in a kind of
simian, fleshy excess compared to the precisely rendered lines of her
missus." The mistress has just returned from her far-flung plane travels,
soaring icarus-like into the brave new world of scientific modernity. Her
maid crouches on the ground, firmly rooted in the drudgery of domestic
space and the na&iuml;ve literalism of primitive belief. Conor concludes,



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Mary is unfashionable because, as primitive, she is torpid, against the
visual flux and transience of modernity. She evinces no mastery over her
appearance. . . . Her mistress stands, almost in long shot before her
like a Screen Star, holding her gaze and not bothering to return it. Her
understated features are cool and reserved; she appears modern. Through
these binarisms, Mary does not really "appear" as primitive. She does not
appear in the sense I have been using the term&#8212;she does not emit
the signs of intentionality and control over her visual effects. Nor
does she evince an awareness of the modern perceptual field and how
to achieve visual congruence within it. Mary appears as "primitive"
through not appearing.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As Conor shows, some forms of articulation are widespread and relatively
stable, sutured into place by deep-rooted political interests and
sedimented ways of seeing. For example, Australian legislators of the
1920s debated the merits of banning aboriginal people from movie theaters,
on the grounds that their na&iuml;ve understanding of the image would
cause their passions to be dangerously inflamed by what they saw on
screen. Here again we see how the aboriginal woman was deemed to lack
the self-consciousness that would allow her to appear as an authentically
modern subject.
<p align="center">
* * *
<p>
I take it as self-evident that not every commentary on the aesthetics and
politics of modernity can be neatly slotted into the three categories or
ideal types that I have outlined. Boundaries exist only in order to be
crossed and categories are never pure. Indeed, a hybridization of critical
methods can be highly productive, providing it reveals some knowledge and
critical awareness of the competing frameworks that are being juxtaposed
and put into play. I would contrast such a self-conscious interrogation
of method to the practice of naming any political reading of a text
"cultural studies," often in disregard of thirty years of debates about
methodology within the field.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
For example, in popular surveys of cultural studies such as Patrick
Brantlinger's <i>Crusoe's Footprints,</i> one can find Stuart Hall cheek
by jowl with Elaine Showalter and Larry Grossberg nestling up to Roland
Barthes. Such mappings of the field strike me as both too broad and too
narrow in their ambitions. On the one hand, by labeling virtually any
political approach to literature or culture as an example of cultural
studies, they skim over fundamental disagreements about frameworks and
methods. On the other hand, even as lip service is paid to cultural
studies as an interdisciplinary project, almost every scholar cited in
such surveys turns out to be based in a department of English literature.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>

<p>
My own view is that methodological similarities among scholars in
different disciplines are more salient to the definition of cultural
studies than the mere fact of being a literary critic who is interested
in politics. Liz Conor, for example, is a cultural historian, while Ben
Singer teaches in a film and communication program. Sociologists and
anthropologists have also played a crucial role in redrawing the map of
modernity via the method of cultural studies.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
Such a method, I've been arguing, is characterized by a distinctive and
productive tension between an expanded notion of the aesthetic field
and a model of articulation that draws on social theory and historical
method. This disciplinary hybridity is jeopardized by attempts to
turn cultural studies into the future of literary studies, a move that
will all too quickly sever its links to the social sciences and turn
it into a form of pan-semiotics. (We can see such a future prered
in Jonathan Culler's recent assertion that cultural studies is just
another word for structuralism).
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>

<p>
Hence to present cultural studies as the telos, redeemer, or utopian
future of literary studies strikes me as doubly misguided. It is bad
news for literature departments because it rides roughshod over the many
interests of scholars&#8212;formalist, rhetorical, philosophical, literary
historical, bibliographical, deconstructive, Marxist, psychoanalytical,
etc.&#8212;that cannot be subsumed within a cultural-studies rubric,
however defined. If cultural studies were to apply its own theory
of articulation toward a more sophisticated account of institutional
knowledges and the history of the disciplines, it would soon recognize the
inadequacy of many of its quick-fire pronouncements about the reactionary
role of literary studies.
<p>
Moreover, this argument is even worse news for cultural studies, undoing
the very interdisciplinarity it seeks to support by arrogating cultural
studies as the property of literature departments and designating English
professors as self-evident experts on culture. Such a move would be
especially unfortunate for modernist studies, where interdisciplinary work
is still in its infancy. Modernity is one of the few terms that resonates
across the disciplines, and yet there is remarkably little dialogue
between sociologists, political theorists, historians, anthropologists,
art historians, and literary critics about their differing conceptions
of the modern. The project of cultural studies, surely, is neither to
overthrow nor to transcend the disciplines. Rather, it is to encourage
forms of traffic across disciplinary lines that will in turn expand our
understanding of the multifarious and many-sided cultures of modernity.
