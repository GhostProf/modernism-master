<p>
Globalization is bound to change the field of cultural and literary studies, and it poses a serious challenge to modernist studies. More significantly, it also represents a major challenge to various traditional and current notions of culture itself. But so far, processes of globalization as distinct from historically comparable, earlier phenomena such as internationalization or empire building and colonization have been studied primarily in terms of economics (financial markets, trade, transnational corporations); information technology (television, computers, the internet); and politics (the waning of the nation state, civil society, the rise of NGOs). The cultural dimensions of globalization and its history remain poorly understood, often for the simple reason that "real" or "authentic" culture&#8212;especially if framed in an anthropological or post-Herderian context&#8212;is seen as that which is subjectively shared by a given community and therefore local. Only economic processes and technological change are perceived as universal and global. This global/local binary, however, is as homogenizing as the alleged cultural homogenization of the global it opposes.

<p>
How does the concern with  fit into this debate? Most modernist research in the U.S. academy is still largely bound by the local. It remains predominantly tied to the traditional North Atlantic canon and its disciplinary codification in national or regional departments of language, literature, and culture. The canon has indeed been expanded in recent 
<b></b>
years by the inclusion of phenomena such as the Harlem Renaissance or Caribbean modernism; but processes of translation and transnational migrations and their effects remain insufficiently studied outside of local specializations. We lack a workable model of comparative studies that goes beyond traditional approaches and that still takes national cultures as the units to be compared. Tim Mitchell has argued that modernity has always presented itself as a stage of history and as a stage for historiography in relation to the temporally and geographically non-modern.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 Modernist research has long focused on the former, but neglected the latter: the modernity of the geographically "non-modern."

<p>
Clearly, globalization provides the horizon for the work of comparative modernisms today. But how can the transition be made from the often bland considerations of the global in much of the literature&#8212;where the global appears either as threatening specter or as beneficial invisible hand&#8212;to the study of cultural genealogies of language, medium, and image as they undergo transformations under the pressures of the global?

<p>
In this essay, I revert to a model of literary and cultural studies that, for rather parochial reasons, has been prematurely put to rest by U.S. postmodernism: the model of high and low art or elite and mass culture. High/low should here be seen as a cipher for a much more complex set of relations that always involve palimpsests of times and spaces that are anything but binary. I suggest that this model, once freed from earlier parochialisms stemming from its embeddedness in U.S./European constellations, may well serve as a template through which to look comparatively at phenomena of cultural globalization&#8212;including that earlier phase of non-European modernisms in Asia, Latin America, or Africa. For too long, such non-Western modernisms have either been ignored as epistemologically impossible&#8212;since only the West was considered advanced enough to generate authentic modernism&#8212;or dismissed as lamentable mimicry and contamination of a more genuine local culture. Such "studied ignorance," as Gayatri Spivak once called it, is no longer acceptable.

<p>
However, the high/low problematic also extends to the realm of tradition and its activation in the present, taking very different forms at different historical times and often inflected by radically different politics. This becomes clear when you consider, for example, the political role played today by classical Brahmin epics in India, epics written in Sanskrit ages ago but endlessly displayed on television and circulated in many languages in oral culture today; the renewed struggle in China over what in Mao's times was relegated to the margin as feudal culture; and, also in China, the turn to traditional popular culture as a defense against the influx of Western mass culture&#8212;a debate heavily invested with politics; or for that matter the complex mix of Spanish and Portuguese baroque culture within indigenous Indian, African, and other European immigrant traditions in certain countries of Latin America. The permeability of the borders between high and low beginning in the period following high modernism cannot be limited to the West (although this is one of the favorite tropes in the Northern debates that some twenty years ago made us read the Latin American boom novel as a kind of postmodernism avant la lettre).
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
  Indeed, a strong and stable literary high 
<b></b>
culture cannot be assumed to have existed everywhere on the model of European nation states such as France, England, or Germany. Such different pasts will inevitably shape the ways a specific culture will negotiate the impact of globalization and its attendant spread of media, communication technologies, and consumerism. In many parts of the world, the legacies of imported <i>and</i> indigenous modernisms are very much part of such negotiations. Even while media and consumerism may spread everywhere in the world&#8212;although with different intensities and widely divergent access&#8212;the imaginaries they produce are far from homogeneous.

<p>
As comparatists, however, we do have a problem. At a time when literary studies is asked to cover ever more territory both geographically and historically (thus overloading any individual critic's circuits), the discipline is in danger of losing its coherence as a field of investigation, of becoming bogged down in ever more local case studies, or of becoming superficial in its negligence to maintain a methodological and theoretical project. The U.S. model of cultural studies in particular can not adequately face the new challenges. Among its critical limitations are a reductive focus on thematics and cultural ethnographies; a privileging of consumption over production; a lack of historical depth; and an abandonment of aesthetic and formal issues coupled with its unquestioned privileging of popular and mass culture.

<p>
The recurrent call for a return to the facts or to traditional philology is certainly no solution. However, the increasing demand for a return to disciplinarity may be more promising, depending crucially on how "return" is defined. If it is meant to annul the changes in the humanities brought about by "theory" and the "cultural turn," it would simply be a regression. But if the return to disciplinarity was meant to counter the premature anti-disciplinarity of so much cultural studies by merging recent theory with traditional critical practices of the disciplines, it could play a salutary role. For if globalization requires one single thing from the cultural critic, it would be a model for comparative study across borders, languages, and cultures that might help nurture a new sense of connectedness in difference, perhaps even a new kind of cosmopolitanism. A major task, then, is to create a set of conceptual parameters for such comparisons that would lend coherence to a field of study in danger of becoming either too amorphous or remaining simply parochial. My tentative reflections in this essay, therefore, are meant to move us into that crucial cultural space between the local, the national, and the global. And here it may be important for humanists and literary scholars to draw on the recent attempts to revitalize social science area studies that are themselves searching for new transnational and transregional paradigms.

<p>
The demand for an alternative model of comparison that would transcend an older, European-style comparative literature paradigm may be new, but not all tools need to be invented from scratch.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 Ultimately, the issue of globalization remains very much tied up with the rich debate about modernity and aesthetic modernism and their respective historical trajectories. For the political and cultural developments of the 1990s have not been kind to the postmodernists' confident prediction that modernity was at an end, let alone the even more triumphalist claim that history had ended.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Further, the equation of modernity and even modernism with fascism, totalitarianism, and genocide
<b></b>
has been similarly ineffectual. Modernity is now (and has been for some time) everywhere, and the discourse of postmodernity seems only an episode (if a significant one) within a certain transformation of Western modernity itself. The issue facing critics, therefore, is no longer modernity vs. postmodernity (although this inevitably reductive binary still underlies much of the currently popular anti-modernity thinking that issues from a narrowly understood postcolonial approach).
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 The issue is rather what Arjun Appadurai has identified as modernity-at-large, and what others have described as alternative modernities. As Dilip Gaonkar wrote in a recent special issue of <i>Public Culture</i> on alternative modernities, modernity

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
has arrived not suddenly but slowly, bit by bit, over the <i>longue dur&eacute;e</i>&#8212;awakened by contact; transported through commerce; administered by empires, bearing colonial inscriptions; propelled by nationalism; and now increasingly steered by global media, migration, and capital.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<p>
Indeed, the critical focus on alternative modernities with their rich histories and local contingencies now seems to offer a better way to understand the here, there, and now than either the notion of postmodernism in Asia and Latin America, or current globalization theories in the social sciences that uncannily resemble Cold War, U.S. generated modernization theory. Even if the West remains a major powerbroker and "clearinghouse" of world-wide modernities, as Dilip Gaonkar puts it, it does not offer the only model of cultural development (as both cyber-utopians and the dystopian McDonaldization theorists seem to believe). Nor does the West possess the only model of political development toward civil society and human rights. The standard tale of the two modernities in which aesthetic modernism and avant-gardism in Europe are cast as adversary cultures directed against bourgeois society now appears very place- and time-specific. We need only consider "Shanghai modern" in the 1920s as the space of emergence of Chinese communism, or the explosion of modernism in Brazil in the 1920s and 1930s and its instrumentalization for a national proto-fascist project to know that the oppositional European model between social and economic modernity and aesthetic modernism does not translate seamlessly into other contexts. Indeed, it no longer applies today as an interpretive model for European culture itself, and it was never an apt model for colonial or communist societies in which cultural and political modernization was shaped by very different constellations. Such historical and geopolitical differences are at stake with the notion of "modernity at large" that avoids the trap of homogenization claims as strongly as it rejects the illusion of a happy plurality of modernities&#8212;a kind of theoretical Benetton effect.

<p>
The same need to argue in place- and time-specific ways applies to the relationship between high art and mass culture that accompanied the trajectory of Western modernity from romanticism to postmodernism and that is intimately connected to the idea of modernism as adversary culture. Much valuable recent work on the editing, marketing, and dissemination of modernism has misconstrued my earlier definition of the Great Divide as a static binary of high modernism vs. the market. My argument was 
<b></b>
rather that there had been, since the mid-nineteenth century in Europe, a powerful imaginary insisting on the divide while time and again violating that categorical separation in practice.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 After all, the insight that all cultural products are subject to the market was already advanced by Theodor Adorno, key theorist of the divide, in the late 1930s.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 Thus the recent, detailed documentation of the high modernists' involvement with the marketing of their works, their bickering with publishers, and engagement with small journal enterprises&#8212;even with fashion magazines&#8212;will not do away with the issue of the divide as a central conceptual trope and energizing norm of the post-World War II period that took hold in the context of Cold War cultural politics and the explosive acceleration of consumerism and television culture. It was that post-war version of the divide that was primarily at issue in the postmodernist debate of the 1970s and early 1980s, not what certain modernist authors and artists did or did not do at an earlier time. Finally, there was another dimension to the debate in the early 1980s. The critique of the divide in postmodernist discourse allowed the historical avant-garde to emerge retrospectively as an alternative to high modernism and legitimated a variety of neo-avant-garde enterprises of the 1960s and 1970s.

<p>
All of that is history. The modernism vs. mass culture problematic once central to the emergence of postmodernism and its project to break down the walls between high and low has since vanished from our screens. But it may have vanished for not entirely good reasons. To recall it now in more than just an archival way will require that the argument be freed from its limiting postmodernist connotations so that the high/low relation may be deployed in a geopolitically expanded frame.

<p>
I suggest that the model of high vs. low can be productively rethought and related to cultural developments in "peripheral," postcolonial, or post-communist societies. The high/low relationship has taken very different shapes and forms outside of the Northern Transatlantic which may enable comparative analyses of cultural globalization today as well as a new understanding of earlier and alternative roads taken within modernity. For example, it captures aspects of cultural hierarchies and social class, race, and religion; gender relations and codifications of sexuality; colonial cultural transfers; the relation between cultural tradition and modernity; the role of memory and the past in the contemporary world; and the relation of print media to visual mass media. In other words, the discourse about alternative modernities in India or in Latin America can be expanded profitably to include the assessment of alternative developments in the relations and crosscurrents between indigenous popular culture, minority cultures, high culture (both traditional and modern), and mass mediated culture. Historically alternative modernities have existed all along and their trajectories continue into the age of globalization.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>


<p>
Further, the reinscription of a complex and multi-layered high/low problematic into our discussions of cultural modernity in transnational contexts and across borders could counteract the widespread notion of cultural unity ascribed indiscriminately by such writers as Alan Bloom, Benjamin Barber, and Samuel Huntington to the culture of the East or the West, Islam or Christianity, the U.S. or Latin America. It could thus counter the bad heritage from cultural anthropology and a Spenglerian, American 
<b></b>
style Kulturkritik. The high/low dynamic might problematize the all too evident need to create an inside/outside myth maintaining a <i>Feindbild</i> (enemy image), an absolute other, that can be read itself as a heritage of the Cold War in current theories about clashing civilizations. Moreover, it could also oppose and complicate the equally limited argument that only local culture (or culture <i>as</i> local) is "good," authentic, and resistant, whereas global cultural forms should be condemned as manifestations of cultural imperialism&#8212;a frequent stand-in for Americanization. Every culture, after all, has its hierarchies and social stratifications, and these differ greatly according to local circumstances and histories. Unpacking such temporal and spatial differentiations might be a good way to arrive at new kinds of comparisons that will surpass the clich&eacute;s of colonial vs. postcolonial, modern vs. postmodern, Western vs. Eastern, center vs. periphery, global vs. local, the West vs. the rest. To de-Westernize notions such as modernity and modernism will require much more theoretically informed descriptive work about modernisms world-wide, including their interaction or non-interaction with Western modernisms; their relationship to different forms of colonialism (different in Latin America from South Asia and again from Africa); and their codings of the role of art and culture in relation to state and nationhood. It may well turn out that despite our best intentions, such de-Westernization of  will always remain limited or seem less pertinent than it does now.

<p>
However, for me, there is yet another significant reason to rethink the high/low relationship today. For it also points us back to the leftist modernism debates of the 1930s (those of Brecht, Luk&aacute;cs, Bloch, Benjamin, Adorno) and their never abandoned concern with issues of aesthetic value and aesthetic perception in relation to politics, history, and experience.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 Revisiting the high/low problematic in a transnational context might then enable us to reinscribe the issue of aesthetic value and form into the contemporary debate, prompting us to rethink the historically altered relationship between the aesthetic and the political for our age in ways surpassing both the debates of the 1930s and the postmodernist and postcolonial debates of the 1980s and 1990s.

<p>
Indeed, in view of the fact that an aesthetic dimension shapes not just the high arts but also the products of consumer culture via design, advertising, and the mobilization of affect and desire, it is simply retrograde to claim that any concern with aesthetic form is inherently elitist. Moreover, those earlier debates were primarily organized around a linear temporal axis (modernism vs. realism, postmodernism vs. modernism) and focused on media of high culture such as literature and painting. The condition of globality, however, requires considering the strong geographic and spatial dimension as well as recognizing its different intertwinings and aesthetic effects. We might want to explore further what Arjun Appadurai has usefully described as the "production of locality" and locality-as-producing as a key ingredient of modernities-at-large.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 Central to such a discussion might be the analysis of city cultures and the aesthetic perceptions and social uses of space they produce. Indeed spatial metaphoricity of the high/low distinction itself might be linked quite pragmatically to the different urban spaces of cultural production and consumption such as the street, the neighborhood, the museum, the concert hall and the opera house, the tourist site and the shopping mall. 
<b></b>
Reconsidering the high/low dynamic would reintroduce the issue of aesthetics and form that cultural studies in the U.S. (as opposed to cultural studies in Brazil or Argentina) has all but abandoned in its move against the alleged elitism of aesthetics. The politically legitimate attack on an earlier social-cultural elitism embodied in the re of the aesthetic connoisseur does not take into account the fact that today aesthetic "value" and the complexities of representation in cultural production can easily be uncoupled from the socially coded elitism associated with Bourdieu's "distinction." An apprehension of the aesthetic dimension of all image, music, and language production remains crucial to a better understanding of how cultural markets function under conditions of globalization.

<p>
Cultural studies in its current conration does not provide a good model for understanding globalizing cultures. From the vantage point of a U.S.-style cultural studies, it is easy to claim that the high-low debate has outlived its purpose. Following the events of 1989-90, postmodernism as a concept, like the concern over high and low culture, was swallowed up by an emerging new set of social, political, and economic conrations. The vast expansion of cultural markets, a new museum and gallery culture, and the electronic media have made evident the extent to which the postmodern high/low debate was still predicated on the stability of literacy and print as dominant medium, on the notion of architecture as building style, on the visual arts as high marker of culture, and on the nation state as guarantor of high culture in Western&#8212;especially North Atlantic&#8212;societies.

<p>
To revive <i>this</i> debate today would be futile. In the U.S. context&#8212;market triumphalism, lifestyle revolution, the victorious march of pop cultural studies through the institutions&#8212;low has won the battle and high has been relegated to the margins, the American culture wars notwithstanding. However, it has been a Pyrrhic victory, marred by continuing ressentiment toward the vanquished realm of high culture. A significant part of the left academia still decries high culture as elitist and Eurocentric, denounces aesthetics as totalitarian, and refuses a debate about cultural value. By contrast, the right ossifies traditional culture before modernism while rejecting contemporary high culture in much of the arts as well as in the literary and theoretical fields. The outcome has thus not been the creative merger of high and low, as it once was imagined by some in the postmodernist debate of the 1970s and early 1980s&#8212;a new democratic culture that would couple aesthetic complexity with mass appeal, abolish hierarchies of taste and class, and usher us into a new age of cultural pleasure beyond either the entropies and minimalisms of late modernism or the numbing hegemony of Cold War mass culture. If there ever was a postmodern utopianism, this would have been it. But, as always with utopias, we have had to settle for much less.

<p>
Today, as we all know, the binary in its emphatic sense has been abolished by a new logic of cultural circulation brought about by media technologies, new patterns of marketing and consumption, and their radical effects both on cultural tradition and on 
<b></b>
the structures of fashion and entertainment. Adorno had intimated these developments in the late 1930s. There are also, however, social changes that no longer give even minimal support to a politically and socially relevant notion of high culture. The high turnover velocity of low culture has by now engulfed even the production of traditionally low-velocity high culture. Once solid cultural traditions (high) are set into motion by the rapid turn-over of museum blockbusters, museal asset management &agrave; la Guggenheim with its spectacular building projects; theater spectacles that become media shows; ancient epics that are turned into TV series and comic books; and festivals of classical music based on the star system, in which the global mobility of international actors, directors, orchestras, and art works matches that of global capital flows.

<p>
None of this is to claim that the distinction between high art and mass culture no longer exists, either in Western societies or elsewhere, as some might argue, for it very much does. Differences will always remain in quality, ambition, and complexity between cultural products, in demands on the attentiveness and knowledge of the consumer, and in diversely stratified audiences. But what used to be a vertical divide has become in the last few decades a horizontal borderland of exchanges and pillagings, of transnational travels back and forth, and all kinds of hybrid interventions. Complexity does not reside only on one side of the old binary.

<p>
Another aspect sets us apart from, for example, the situation in the 1980s. The largely national bases of both high and low cultures are fraying as a result of the cultural flows accompanying waves of migration and diasporas <i>and</i> as a result of the increasing number of corporate mergers in the culture industries across national borders. For those reasons alone, the high/low divide can no longer provide the field of battle for an alternative social or political imagination as it did in the twentieth century, first in the interwar years in Europe, and then again in the 1960s in Europe and the U.S. To see low as a threat to social and cultural cohesion is a conservative phantasm deployed for political maneuvering in the never-ending t of U.S. conservatives against the effects of the 1960s on secular culture and changing lifestyles. But this phantasm, of course, feeds the mirror phantasm of the rebel consumer and a left American populism.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>


<p>
How to get out of this dead-end? In a very preliminary way, I would suggest the following:

<p>
1. We abandon the high/low distinction in its traditional ration that opposes serious literature and art to the mass media, and replace this hierarchical or vertical value relation by a lateral or horizontal conration. This would de-dramatize the notion of high and acknowledge that high is as much subject to market pressures as low (and perhaps because of that in need of some support and protection). We no longer face a hegemonic culture industry and its autonomous high other (as suggested in the writings of Adorno or Clement Greenberg), but a quantitatively and qualitatively differentiated mass <i>and</i> niche marketing for all kinds of cultural consumption.

<p>
2. We should raise the issue of medium (oral/aural, written, visual) in all its historical, technical, and theoretical complexity rather than continue to rely on the traditional binary notion of media culture as low and its high literary other in traditional 
<b></b>
modernist fashion. For example, in a country such as Brazil where culture is shaped more by musical and visual traditions of the popular realm than by what Angel Rama has called the lettered city, such a focus on mediality would be more pertinent than the high/low distinction itself.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>


<p>
3. We should reintroduce issues of aesthetic quality and form into our analysis of any and all cultural practices and products. Here the question of criteria is obviously key: rather than privilege the radically new in avant-garde fashion, we may want to focus on the complexity of repetition, rewriting, and bricolage. The emphasis might then be on suggestive intertextuality, creative mimicry, the power of a text to question ingrained habits through visual or narrative strategies, the ability to transform media usage, and so forth. This suggestion argues for a modernism in the Brechtian sense, but it is a modernism with a difference.

<p>
4. We should abandon the notion that a successful attack on elite culture can play a major role in a political and social transformation. This was the signature of the avant-garde and still lingers in certain academic-populist outposts. Instead we should pay close attention to the ways in which cultural practices and products are linked to the discourses of the political and the social in specific local and national constellations. Here, for example, the issue of how major exhibits, museums, and cultural mega-events are funded and whether or not funding determines content yields a more fruitful field for investigation than the focus on the purity of high vs. the contamination of low. At the same time, we need to acknowledge that culture is no longer organized according to habitus and distinction as described by Pierre Bourdieu. When everything becomes available (although not always accessible) to the consumer's choice, it becomes that much harder to find a place for effective political critique.

<p>
5. In all of this, comparatists can draw on a combination of a non-reductive cultural studies with the disciplines of cultural history (including a sociological and economic dimension), the new anthropology, and the traditions of literary and artistic criticism. Key will be a sustained focus on the operations and functioning of public cultures and the changing role of critique within them. Here, it seems to me, we need to draw on the debates about civil society, imagined communities, gender, subalternity, and the emerging debate about transnational urban imaginaries.

<p>
If we succeed in making our reading skills available to those other projects, we will have expanded the field of literary criticism without abandoning what we do best.

<p>
Thinking back to the high/low problematic today points to the distance we have traveled since the heady days of postmodernism and the emergence of new forms of cultural studies. But it also reveals the underlying American parochialism of the postmodernism craze. Postmodernism thought itself global, but was perhaps nothing more than the belated attempt to create a U.S. International against the model of the European International Style of high modernism belonging to the interwar period (1918-39). And yet, the postmodern decades in the U.S. from the 1960s to the 1980s 
<b></b>
generated a new relationship between high culture and mass media culture that resonates, however differently, in other cultures of the world. However, the simple reversal of the old high/low hierarchy advanced by U.S. cultural studies is not the solution. It may even be perceived as a betrayal of the original promises of the postmodern itself.

<p>
In a global context, therefore, the question about the relationship between high culture (both traditional and modern), indigenous and national popular culture, minority or subaltern cultures, and transnational mass media culture may still provide an impetus for a new kind of comparative work. This new comparative study would draw our attention to the very different forms such constellations take, for example, in India or China as compared with different countries in Latin America or Eastern Europe. A number of interesting theoretical questions emerge in this context. We may ask whether and how postcolonial theory applies unproblematically to Latin American countries whose colonial and postcolonial history is fundamentally different from that of India or African countries.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 We may also ask whether or not the notion of the subaltern can be transferred unproblematically from one geographic context to another, and whether notions of hybridity and diaspora&#8212;the latest master-signifiers&#8212;are sufficiently rigorous to describe the complex racial, ethnic, and linguistic mixings in different parts of the world.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 Attuned to the vicissitudes of traveling theory, we must guard against the facile translation of critical vocabularies from one intellectual and geopolitical context into another.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 And we must always secure deeper historical knowledge in order not to capitulate to the market and to the obliviousness of the present.

<p>
Clearly, the role of high culture today varies greatly from country to country, and in each case it is deeply embedded in local and national traditions, the different roles of state and private sectors in cultural politics, systems of national education, the strength or weakness of cultural institutions, and so forth. Yet some sectors of high culture, such as opera, classical European music, or contemporary art and Western architecture, have become transnational in organization and dissemination, as opposed to the theater or literature, which remain bound by language and thus more limited in reaching broad transnational audiences. Simultaneously, high culture itself has become ever more commercialized and spectacularized, much more so than even an Adorno could have imagined in the mid-twentieth century. The problem remains that some, both on the left and the right, still want to force us to choose between high and low, or, as Susan Sontag put it in the 1960s, between Dostoevski and The Doors. This choice, then and now, is to be rejected. Of course, postmodern practices in literature and the arts have rejected it all along, producing all kinds of fascinating hybridizations of high and low that seemed to open up new horizons for aesthetic experimentation. But today the celebration of a postmodern hybridity of high and low may itself have lost its once critical edge. Cultural production today not only crosses the borders between high and low, but has also become transnational in major new ways, especially in the music industry, but also in certain sectors of film and television (e.g., Indian cinema in Africa, the export of Brazilian telenovelas).
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 Hybridization of whatever kind now happens increasingly under the sign of the market. But markets, even elite niche markets, as Nestor Canclini has pointed out in his recent book <i>La globalizaci&oacute;n imaginada,</i> 
<b></b>
tend to domesticate and equalize the rough and innovative edges of cultural production.

 They will go for the successful formula rather than encouraging the not-yet-known, experimentation, and unusual modes of aesthetic expression. The danger is that by now most of high culture is as much subject to market forces as mass mediated products. Big mergers in the publishing industry shrink the breathing space for ambitious writing. Literature itself, as we once knew it, becomes ever more an untimely enterprise. But this may also be literature's opportunity. For we need a space of writing to explore issues of aesthetic complexity, formal experimentation, the vicissitudes of representation, and radical political content. We need to ask whether or not the market can secure new traditions, new forms of transnational communications and connectivities. Finally, however, we would abandon our role as critical intellectuals if we were to exclude prematurely from such considerations the question of the complex imbrication of aesthetic value and political effect, a question fundamentally posed by the traditions of high culture that needs to be rescued for contemporary analyses of all culture under the spell of globalization.

See especially the introduction to Huyssen, <i>After the Great Divide: Modernism, Mass Culture, Postmodernism</i> (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986). I should add that the term the Great Divide not only referred to the imaginary divide between mass culture and modernism, but also to that other divide so central to the debates at the time, namely that between modernism and postmodernism. A main argument of the book was that both divides were generated by very specific political and aesthetic constellations and were always belied by the complexities of real relations in artistic practices.

See for example Adorno's 1938 essay "On the Fetish Character in Music and the Regression of Listening," in <i>The Essential Frankfurt School Reader,</i> ed. Andrew Arato and Eike Gebhardt (New York: Urizen Books, 1977), 270-299.

The term "alternative modernity" may appear problematic to some. So let me say that it is not meant to suggest that there is one real and authentic modernity which, in its spreading across the world, created those alternative modernities in Latin America or in Asia. At the same time, our attempts to de-Westernize or to de-Europeanize the concept of modernity may ultimately run up against a real limit set by the genealogy of the concept itself. This tension is to be acknowledged rather than defused.

<p>
By now, there is a vast literature on "alternative modernities." Apart from the still challenging earlier work by Arjun Appadurai in <i>Modernity at Large</i> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1996), see for instance the special issue on multiple modernities, <i>Daedalus</i> 129, no. 1 , especially the essays by Stanley J. Tambiah and S. N. Eisenstadt.

And within Latin America, one would need to distinguish, for example, between countries such as Argentina and Uruguay with very sparse indigenous populations and the Andean countries which have large Indian populations.

Here it might be useful to distinguish historically and theoretically between very different notions of the hybrid&#8212;say, between Homi Bhabha's <i>The Location of Culture</i> (New York: Routledge, 1994) and the earlier work by Nestor Garcia Canclini in <i>Culturas hibridas: Estrategias para entrar y salir de la modernidad</i> (Mexico, D.F.: Grijalbo, 1989).

See Edward Said, "Travelling Theory," in <i>The World, the Text, and the Critic</i> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1983), 226-47. Through such a process of translation, "cultural studies" in the U.S. has turned out to be a quite different thing from what it was in the hands of the Birmingham school, or critics such as Stuart Hall or Dick Hebdige.
