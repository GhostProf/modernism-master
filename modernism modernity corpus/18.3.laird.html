      </div>
</blockquote>
<p>
	In Samuel Beckett’s early story “Love and Lethe,” from <span style="font-style:italic;">More Pricks than Kicks</span>, Ruby Tough asks Belacqua his reasons for proposing that she aid him in committing suicide—though the word “suicide” is never uttered and the proposal is therefore obscure. Parsing the reasons he gives would require extensive reading, as Belacqua’s list goes well beyond the standard “Greek and Roman reasons” that remain relatively well known today, most commonly, those known as death before dishonor and agent’s choice before patient’s suffering. For the purposes of this essay, one thing that stands out in Beckett’s list is an absence: its lack of reference to any of the reasons usually advanced for suicidal ideation in the lives or works of modernist writers. That is, Belacqua does not mention existential despair, crisis in norms or values, or wasteland senselessness and alienation. Aside from the final comment, that “true reasons” do not “exist, at least not for  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the purposes of conversation,” which hints at suicide’s lasting mark of taboo, Beckett’s list is both scholarly and neutral in affect.
      </p>
<p>
	How did Belacqua arrive at his particular set of reasons for suicide? Tracing the etiology of his list involves a thick historicization of the rise of suicidology in the first modern suicidological texts. Suicidology, so-called since the 1960s but nameless before then, emerged, as I will argue, from among more prominent emergent social sciences, particularly psychology, sociology, anthropology, and the new methodology of statistics. Suicide also remained in the territory of philosophy, history, the law, and literature. Physiology, though increasingly subordinated or simply side-stepped by pre–World War II proto-suicidologists, also played a role. In addition to the intellectual definition and social formation of discrete modern academic disciplines, interdisciplinary collaboration and competition combined to create modernist suicidological discourses. Non-academic commentators played major roles in these discourses as well, and a number of the most influential texts were aimed equally at the lay reader and the scholarly audience; they sought to persuade and guide ordinary readers as well as to shape and change the disciplines.
      </p>
<p>
	In the modernist period, suicidology emerged sufficiently to become what one might call an “inter-discipline.” Modernist discourses about suicide often emphasized a need to traverse different disciplines to deal with the vexing phenomenon and thus formed the basis for contemporary suicidology. While overlooked by most contemporary modernist critics, these deliberately self-modernizing proto-suicidological discourses formed the ideational background for representations of suicide in modernist literature, from that literature’s beginnings in the last decades of the nineteenth century through high modernism in the 1920s and ’30s. Literature itself played a varied role in those discourses, even as—together with literary criticism—it gradually became a disciplinary player in its own right.
      </p>
<p>
	Contextualizing suicide among the academic disciplines, however, entails reconsideration, first, of suicide’s status both as taboo and as symptom of an alleged modernist crisis.
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">“The Repressive Hypothesis,” Redux</h1>
<p>
	  When cultural and literary critics write of suicide in the modernist era, they usually contextualize it as A. Alvarez does in his classic study <span style="font-style:italic;">The Savage God</span>. Alvarez aligns suicide with Eliot’s “waste land” of chaos, alienation, numbness, and despair and with Conrad’s “horror.” Even when qualifying these admittedly sensationalizing terms (as Alvarez also does), suicide is offered as a symptom of the “crisis” of “modernism.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> So, indeed, is death. Inspired by Philippe Ariès’s discussion of all death having become gradually both “terrifying” and “invisible”<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> in the long turn-of-the-twentieth-century (from the 1850s to the 1950s for Ariès), one critic comments of modernist literature: “No longer natural and culturally acceptable, fictional death became attenuated, denied, or horrific.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> With application to its narratology, he continues, “[s]ubverting suspense, modern novels became circular and self-reflexive, returning repeatedly and ultimately to  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> terminal events they rarely confront or transcend. Modernists elide the dying process.”<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Not merely “invisible,” though occurring in ever-increasing numbers as populations and wars grew in size, modern death had, Ariès argues, become so taboo that people “no longer dare[d] say its name.” Once “tame,” death had become “wild.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> While Ariès later acknowledges the sexual innuendo of this phrasing and agrees with Geoffrey Gorer in linking this innuendo to persisting Victorian “prudery” about sex, such charged rhetoric invites a considered second look.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Amid Ariès’s discourse on “prudish” suppressions of death, George Minois finds “voluntary death,” ironically, “conspicuously absent” in Ariès’s study; Minois concludes his own study with a call to debate.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Perhaps modernist suicide did operate as a site of horror and taboo, but if it did, was this the only way it operated? Belacqua’s list hints at contexts in which suicide might seem the reverse of shameful self-abnegation, contexts in which suicide might seem or be romantic, heroic, or aesthetic. I do not in what follows adjudicate among these revaluations, nor try to weigh the relative worth of one view of suicide over another, but instead describe the many ways in which suicide was written, after and surrounding suicidal events, and written prolifically. As Beckett writes, Belacqua’s list of rationales does not include his own reason, for “reasons . . . he had none.” No reasons, yet plenty of ideas to offer his would-be partner in suicide.
	</p>
<p>
	  Particularly after a suicide when no author is left to write about it, even a suicide note, if there is one, strikes its readers as suspect, insufficient, or empty. Suicide has defied diagnosis by doctors and is viewed by many contemporary suicidologists as enigmatic or, again, so overdetermined as to defy rational explanation.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Lacking voice, it seems also to lack origin—a seedless birth. As such, it has functioned as a wild vortex of manifold writings. Reminiscent of Foucault’s repressive hypothesis,<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> suicide’s taboo status did not make it a topic on which writers were silent. Rather, like some northern cultures’ names for snow, ways of speaking it proliferated. In the modernist period, thanks in part to the emerging social sciences, numerous accounts of its causes and processes were produced from within and without the universities of Europe. Modernist literature’s contributions to these discussions become especially evident when one constructs literary modernism broadly, as beginning with the aesthetic and discursive innovations of the later nineteenth century, that is, the time of most major “modernist” authors’ early cultural formation (Yeats turned 25 in 1900; Joyce turned 18).<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> But these contributions are also observable when one constructs literary modernism narrowly, as beginning just before or during the First World War in tandem with the height of global social crisis and modernist experimentalism.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> In either context, modernist literature played a more multifaceted part in thought about suicide than A. Alvarez recognized. Alvarez underrepresented modernist treatments of suicide—considering neither the diverse range of representations nor even the most renowned literary portraits of suicide (nor, for that matter, the texts of writers who verifiably killed themselves). Instead, he addressed, selectively, Dostoyevsky’s novels, the “extremist” tactics of Dada, and the war poet Wilfred Owen, treating the latter as a writer and victim of a suicidal modernist wasteland. In this article, I focus on something Alvarez largely ignored: modernist literature’s reliance on professional discourses of suicide that had arisen gradually over the course of the previous century.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	  I limit my discussion to developments in England, the United States, and (to a lesser extent) France, Belgium, and Germany. Rather than definitively answering the controversial question of how to define the “inter-discipline,” this essay explores how different emergent disciplines interacted with each other around the suicide issue, using contemporaneous publications from Europe and the United States to track the development of these multidisciplinary and disciplinary discourses. Broadly modernist social science texts about suicide, particularly by British and American intellectual workers who have been overlooked within literary studies because they were so thoroughly superseded by post–World War II suicidology, merit revisitation not only for their narratives of modern suicide but also for their roles in cross-disciplinary argumentation and knowledge production in the modernist era. This article recovers their intellectual work. “Intellectual” admittedly did not sit easily on British tongues as a social label, as Stefan Collini stresses,<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> but I intend a capacious idea of intellectual work: most of the texts discussed here were designed for an educated literate public, not exclusively for scientific or academic circles. While this history of modernist suicide is in some ways a story of emergent professionalization, modernist discourse on suicide engaged virtually all the intellectual classes in public textual conversations. Modern doctors, lawyers, philosophers, ethicists, and artists published their conversations with each other. While usually not emanating directly from the academic “departments” that were emerging in England and America, these psychological, statistical, and sociological studies already displayed two characteristics of nineteenth-century disciplinarity: deference to mentor-precursors in scholars’ particular fields of study and observance of general rules or explicit methodologies. These texts position themselves in argumentative relationship to each other more often than in reportorial relationship to patients or events, though they occasionally cite direct testimonials or individual cases. They are generally multidisciplinary and frequently interdisciplinary, in that they seek to combine or intertwine, not merely compound, the methodologies of variant fields.
	</p>
<p>
	  Developing rapidly from the mid-Victorian era onward, multidisciplinary collaboration and disciplinary competition advanced simultaneously and self-consciously around the suicide question, as around other major issues of that time such as labor, women, and industrialism. Amid these developments, literature functioned as an (inter)disciplinary player, serving up not only representations of suicide for dramatic value but also inquiry into and indications of how it might—and might not—be known. In the limited frame of this article,<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> I seek to sketch this confabulation of suicide knowledge-productions and, as indicated above, to draw upon just one literary example—from Beckett’s “Love and Lethe.” This sketch will emphasize the point that suicide, while enigmatic, became a node around which turn-of-the-century discourses entertained abundant possibilities for analyzing and coexisting with, preventing and surviving, the suicidal.
	</p>
<p>
	  Within the rise of suicide studies, one can discern continual tendencies to defend writing about suicide (acknowledging it as a taboo subject arousing discomfort) and to confront the taboo (as a personal and/or social fact demanding scrutiny). In what follows, I historicize salient episodes in suicide studies’ rise, starting in the late eighteenth century and charting the push and pull between traditional thought and its  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> critics and between one emerging discipline and another. Literature threads in and out of the suicidological texts, sometimes serving up evidence or argument, sometimes acting as bad guy in a text’s moral narrative, sometimes providing uplift. Literature also had its own clichés to trot out as well as its own carefully contextualized narrative webs to weave about suicide, and it clearly provided a vehicle (for the literate) to learn and think as well as feel and worry about suicide. Beckett’s particularly intricate story of suicide indicates how well-informed modernist writers often were about the history of suicidological thought and how much they could contribute beyond literary conventions that had been in place since classical times. Not all of the threads of this story—modernist crisis, suicide’s discursivity, disciplinary and interdisciplinary development, non-academic professional investigation, and literature (and literary studies) as itself a competitive, emergent “discipline”—align neatly. Nor do I wish to force such alignment. But this history can, with its several threads crossing each other, offer a somewhat different picture from the dominant paradigms of suicide as silenced through taboo, of modernism as numb (and dumb) with crisis, of the early history of disciplinary suicide discourses as irrelevant to contemporary suicidology as well as to modernist literature, and of literature as irrelevant, subordinate to, or even dismissed by both the other self-modernizing disciplines, in general, and by early suicidology, in particular.
	</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Emerging Modern Disciplines in the History of Suicidology</h1>
<p>
	  From its beginnings, the study of suicide has been closely linked to the establishment of new fields. Emile Durkheim remains today the best-known thinker on suicide, and his work in 1897 on the sociology of suicide is often thought of as foundational. Like other founders, however (Freud and Marx, for example), Durkheim built his treatise on prior studies.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> The rhetorical energy in Durkheim’s study is directed not at explaining suicide but at carving out sociology as an autonomous new field. If there is an origin to the modern medical study of suicide, arguably it is the French doctor Philippe Pinel’s early psychological writings and asylum work, prompted by a friend’s self-destruction in the 1780s.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Pinel is viewed by many as the “father” of modern psychiatry, and his work was followed by a number of psychological studies of suicide in France, most notably by the psychologists Jean-Etienne Esquirol, Pinel’s student, and Jean-Pierre Falret in the 1820s and 1830s.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Durkheim used suicide to found sociology precisely on the ruins, as he hoped, of psychology as a social science; though psychology’s rise had been slow at first and fraught with difficulty, by the end of the nineteenth century it had become almost thoroughly institutionalized in European universities. Durkheim flew in the face of this seemingly unstoppable advance and, in doing so, distracted attention from a no less dangerous, younger competitor with sociology for prominence in social explanation: evolutionary biology.

	  Commentators on the history of suicide tend to cite <span style="font-style:italic;">The Anatomy of Suicide</span> by Forbes Winslow in 1840 as the first British book dedicated to the science of suicide.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Some prior English studies had emphasized metaphysical and logical arguments for and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> against suicide, for instance, Donne and Hume’s famous essays.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Others had focused on the theological, like Charles Moore’s lengthy historical and Christian moralization of suicide in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Full Inquiry into the Subject of Suicide</span> in 1790 and Simon Piggott’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Suicide and Its Antidotes, A Series of Anecdotes and Narratives, with Suggestions on Mental Distress</span> in 1824, which framed its multidimensional study of suicide’s causation with theological sermons and advice.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Although Winslow, a member of the Royal College of Surgeons who dedicated his study to the late king’s “Physician Extraordinary,” concurred with the Christian viewpoint, he endeavored to legitimize science as the primary modality for studying suicide, and he deployed suicide to argue specifically for psychology as a legitimate field of study.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Despite its ultimate institutionalization by the end of the nineteenth century, psychology had struggled at its inception in the late eighteenth century and through much of the nineteenth, especially among the English public, from identification with its subject of lunacy as well as from lingering British moral resistance to Enlightenment thinking.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Winslow sought explicitly to present the psychologist as a scholar and a doctor, focused on a mental and physiological space, apart from yet congruent with the divine’s sphere of the soul. Though psychologists studied lunacy and idiocy, he emphasized that they were not themselves lunatics or idiots.
	</p>
<p>
	  Durkheim, seeking at the turn of the twentieth century to wrest suicide studies from psychology, claimed statistics as the supreme instrument for suicidology and framed statistical methodology as specifically sociological. But these connections were not new. André-Michel Guerry, a lawyer, and Adolphe Quetelet, a mathematician and astronomer, had established statistics in the 1830s in part through the study of suicide, which they linked to crime and marriage in a single set of statistically analyzable problems. Considered at that time as moral problems, this set of issues resulted in the new field’s appellation of “Moral Statistics.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> (Earlier writers, like Charles Moore and Richard Hey [1785], had linked suicide with dueling and gaming.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a>) As statistics developed, psychologists drew ever more readily on statisticians’ findings for their arguments, until, gradually, sociologists and social-evolutionary biologists seized both the ground and the method from them. By the 1880s, sociology had begun to assert its legitimacy in England, at least outside the university system, through the efforts especially of Herbert Spencer. The publication that most influenced the late-nineteenth-century study of suicide in England—a translation in 1881 of Italian professor Enrico Morselli’s treatise <span style="font-style:italic;">Suicide, An Essay on Comparative Moral Statistics</span>—expressed direct indebtedness to Spencer, alongside, eclectically, Charles Darwin, Henry Buckle, Henry Maudsley, Alfred Russel Wallace, and other British scientists. Morselli devotes the introduction to this book to making the arguments for scientific theory and the methodology of statistics. Along with his French nineteenth-century peers, he termed his field “social physics.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Morselli’s treatise stood for decades as the best resource for comparative statistics on suicide.
	</p>
<p>
	  Modernist suicidology, then, was wrought both from within and across the lines of several fast-developing, self-reflexive intellectual fields—psychology, sociology, evolutionary social biology, and statistics. Winslow and the late nineteenth-century proto-suicidologists viewed their approaches to knowledge as “modern,” no longer  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> following classical, medieval, or Renaissance paradigms. These precocious self-modernizers consciously contributed to the Enlightenment activities of data-gathering and interpretation, even when deferring (in ever more qualified ways) to a final religious or humanistic moral viewpoint on suicide’s meaning or prevention. Their intellectual discourses thus paralleled theological developments of that time, including the discourses of skeptical Enlightenment theologians in Europe, which were decried by Pope Pius X as constituting “the Doctrine of the Modernists” and were regularly referred to (then and now) as “the crisis of modernism” or “the modernist crisis.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> (Pius intended the entire discursive phenomenon of Enlightenment skepticism by these phrases, commenting on “modernism” in a series of encyclicals from 1903 to 1914.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a>) Historically, the specter of suicide had played a critical part in Christian admonitions against the sin of despair (recall the nadir reached, for example, by the Redcrosse Knight in Spenser’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Faerie Queene</span><a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a>); as the argument went, if one failed in faith, nothing remained to forestall despairing self-destruction. In the nineteenth century, however, Schopenhauer’s metaphysics famously challenged both the motivational concept of a Christian afterlife and the negative moral valence (and taboo) applied to suicide, reconstituting suicide as a sane option. In pursuing a logical and empirical approach, the social scientists of suicide themselves sought both to alleviate moral crises associated with suicide and to open suicide as a topic for rational discussion.
	</p>
<p>
	  Like Durkheim, these earlier writers had disciplinary antagonists. For Winslow, metaphysics needed confrontation and absorption; for Morselli, it required dismissal.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> For the British barrister, S. A. K. Strahan, “morality” (and theological arguments) required sustained, rational opposition;<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> in addition, Strahan opposed psychology insofar as its proponents had settled on “insanity” as the diagnosis for all attempted or actual suicides.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> At the same time that suicidology was developing within competing disciplines, however, it was also deliberately interdisciplinary. Morselli’s list of influences, for example, indicates the extent to which late Victorian social scientists had merged naturalism and physiology with sociology, psychology, and history to produce a potent interdisciplinary blend of evolutionary determinism. The increase in statistical numbers of suicide over time in so-called civilized races signaled to these analysts a concomitant degeneration in Western, white peoples—a decline that they increasingly blamed on modernity. Like Morselli, when Winslow advocated for psychology, he did not divorce his study from physiology; then again, he did not privilege the biological either. Rather, he viewed psychology as encompassing mind and body, the nervous system and the entrails alike.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> In contrast, Strahan’s book, published in 1893, adopted evolutionary biologism as its primary model, and it thereby took exception to psychology, though unlike Morselli, Strahan regarded heredity studies as a more important tool than statistics.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> (This is the historical medical context in which Marx’s brilliant daughter Eleanor Marx [1855–98] and her artistic peers Amy Levy [1861–89] and Charlotte Mew [1869–1928] killed themselves, and in which Virginia Woolf’s early suicide attempts [1904] killed themselves, and in which Virginia Woolf’s early suicide attempts [1913] were diagnosed. Woolf’s doctor, George Savage, contributed directly to this discourse, from as early as 1884 to as late as 1911.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a>)  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	  But such (con)fusion of approaches was just one way in which interdisciplinarity worked. Philosophy and literature had, of course, been age-old companions in describing suicide: nineteenth-century English and French medical studies of suicide often began, as Belacqua does, with the “Greek and Roman reasons.”<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> In the opening decades of the twentieth century, suicidology found itself, on one hand, between the social and physiological sciences, and, on the other hand, between the sciences and metaphysics, ethics, history, and literature, with frequent cross-hatching across the lines. Another influential study on suicide published in the same year as Morselli’s by the British forensic scientist William Wynn Westcott framed his observations on suicide as <span style="font-style:italic;">A Social Treatise</span> and, though Westcott was a medical worker, analogized his study to a “textbook” of approaches, views, and findings.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Despite the terms “treatise” and “textbook,” Westcott’s book was intended to address what “may be legitimately regarded as one of our Social Problems” for a broad “community” of literate readers.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> Designed thus as a type of reference work, yet one more accessible than Morselli’s—whose text Westcott denigrates as “hardly a readable book, consisting almost entirely of statistics”<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a>—Westcott’s study approaches in some sections the status of an annotated bibliography, with brief discursive commentary subordinated to citations. It allots chapters to suicide’s ethics, history, literature, and jurisprudence, as well as to its “causation and prevention” (Westcott’s subtitle includes all these categories except suicide’s ethics). In Westcott, a semi-Comtean model took sociology as its overarching field, circumscribing history, literature, and economics (Comte is also viewed as a founder of sociology for his coinage and definition of the term in the early nineteenth century, though he saw anthropology as the supreme social science). A similar sort of compilation takes place in the 1882 book by a New York doctor, James O’Dea: <span style="font-style:italic;">Suicide: Studies on Its Philosophy, Causes, and Prevention.</span> While that title declines to advertise how scientifically oriented his study is, its aim nonetheless is a careful balance of “social” and “medical” causes—that is, external, social, statistically correlated causes as opposed to internal, individual, physical, and psychological ones.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> In addition, his book begins with a cross-cultural anthropological discussion that is indebted to Edward Burnett Tylor and others, and that includes deferential citations of Wordsworth, Carlyle, and Shakespeare along the way. Finally, it offers a pragmatic therapeutics at the end (without condemning atheism, O’Dea nonetheless recommends reading the New Testament among other helpful aids to prevent suicide).<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> Even Strahan’s treatise initially positions itself in negotiation among several disciplines, as indicated by his title: <span style="font-style:italic;">Suicide and Insanity: A Physiological and Sociological Study</span>. For O’Dea, the very fact that suicide must be understood from various perspectives argues for its “propriety” as a topic for general reading: “Suicide,” he explains with his first sentences, “is a question partly social, partly medical; hence it may with propriety be discussed in a volume intended for intelligent readers generally.”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Though deliberately excluding traditional strains of thought and adopting what he viewed as a coherently scientific approach, Morselli too had intended his English translation for a British public, which he perceived as broad and “prudent”:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    As to this English edition I think it right to remark that it differs in many points from the Italian. The book, which originally reached 512 pages, was reduced by desire of the publisher to more moderate proportions. Thus many parts have been suppressed, and amongst them almost all the introduction which turned upon statistics as applied to moral phenomena . . . .To keep still more within the new limits imposed upon me, I have shortened to the utmost the theoretical part, judging it more useful to leave to the prudent English reader the application of the facts than to reduce the number of facts themselves . . . . I have thus, if I do not deceive myself, rendered the work more attractive to the English reader.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  As for Strahan, his book leaves no doubt about his intended audience and problem-solving aims: “The remarkable prevalence of suicide in England this summer brought the painful question of self-destruction prominently before the public. . . . It is in the hope that people may be induced to use intelligently, in the propagation of the human race, some of the knowledge, care, and forethought so successfully exercised in the breeding of the lower animals that this book is given to the public.”<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  As O’Dea’s work illustrates, the emergent anthropologists of the late nineteenth century had also been attending to suicide in their comparative studies. In 1869, for example, the renowned historiographer W. E. H. Lecky produced a two-volume <span style="font-style:italic;">History of European Morals</span>, which—starkly contrasting with Moore’s late-eighteenth-century treatise—treated suicide, among innumerable other human activities, as part and parcel of a “natural history.”<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> It was not until 1922, however, that Alfred Bayet (an avowed sociologist) published a book-length study of suicide that broke new ground largely by employing an anthropological analysis. Bayet began his book with a pointed critique of Durkheim’s disciplinarily exclusive model, emphasizing literature among Durkheim’s omissions (which also include philosophy and jurisprudence).<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> Bayet believed it high time the world outgrew “suicide horror,” and he offered theories of the primitive origins of that horror.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> These theories formed the basis, in turn, of a highly readable, Alvarez-like book by British travel-writer and historian Henry Romilly Fedden, <span style="font-style:italic;">Suicide: A Social and Historical Study</span>, in 1938. Fedden’s study contrasts sharply with Alvarez’s in arguing for a more relaxed and nuanced ethics of suicide. His history of “moral attitudes” climaxes with chapter 8, “Mr. Bloom’s Father,” where analysis of Leopold Bloom’s thoughts about his father’s suicide in James Joyce’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> exposes a paradigm shift Fedden wants to mark from Victorian moralistic social gossip (and the harm he argues it did to the discourse about suicide) to modern secular rationalism.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Fedden’s final chapter, “Theories and Ciphers,” however, turns away from the anthropological and social history that had governed his text to that point and sets forth the “modern theory” most likely to affect his own contemporaries’ attitudes toward suicide. “Two schools, psychological and sociological, independently claim to account for suicide,”<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> he dispassionately notes, then proceeds to survey  the psychological “theories” from Jean-Etienne Esquirol to Freud (for the latter, Freud’s theories of the death instinct and the repetition compulsion in <span style="font-style:italic;">Beyond the Pleasure Principle</span><a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a>) and  the “ciphers” of sociological theory from Brierre de Boismont , Morselli, and Westcott, to Durkheim, Ruth Cavan , and Maurice Halbwachs ,<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> among others.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	  Liah Greenfeld sees the emergence of the social sciences as disciplines as an academic phenomenon, in contradistinction to the natural sciences, which emerged from other professions. Suicide studies do not fit her findings, however, and even the broader field of sociology arguably arose from outside academe. Studies of suicide like Winslow’s, Westcott’s, Morselli’s, Durkheim’s, and Bayet’s sprang from various professions, situated outside as well as within universities; their discussions unfolded in part as arguments aimed at an educated public beyond their specialized peer audiences, in part as metanarratives of nineteenth-century disciplinarity and multidisciplinarity. In England, the field of sociology in general and suicidology in particular grew largely through the assiduous work of social scientists who played what Greenfeld terms “social roles” rather than professorial ones—the social roles in suicidology, for example, of asylum physicians (Winslow), coroners (Westcott), and lawyers (Strahan).<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  In the United States, this phenomenon is even more marked. Frederic L. Hoffman, a German teenage immigrant whose work history included shop-keeping, making do as a hobo, and collecting premiums for insurance companies, one day found himself fascinated by the statistics of African-American deaths and, through publishing on this and other subjects, including suicide, was eventually hired by Prudential Life Insurance as its company statistician. His annual “The Suicide Record” moved during the four decades of his greatest involvement, 1894–1934, from the later to the opening pages of the insurance periodical <span style="font-style:italic;">The Spectator</span>.<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> Aware of the scientific studies that preceded and surrounded him, he frequently acknowledged his debts to the books mentioned above and recommended eclectic further reading. In several issues between 1907 and 1917, for example, Hoffman urged readers to refer to the findings of the ophthalmologist C. Ernest Pronger, who had linked eye refraction problems both to insomnia and suicide.
	</p>
<p>
	  Although U.S. suicide studies were published primarily in specialized American professional journals in the first decades of the twentieth century, in the 1920s and ’30s several major books emerged, all of them from the margins of academia or entirely outside it. These outsiders-turned-insiders created the field of U.S. suicide study. Nonetheless, these writers also read their European precursors assiduously and adhered to what essentially now represented a collaboration, rather than a merger, of psychology with sociology, with statistics showing where socially situated psychological aberrations were likely to develop. Adolph Dominic Frenay, a Roman Catholic priest, published the first of these, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Suicide Problem in the United States</span>, in 1927.<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> A year later, Ruth Shonle Cavan published, as her first book, a study titled simply <span style="font-style:italic;">Suicide</span> .<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> Although she had received her PhD from Chicago and worked on projects for a number of years afterward with Professor Ernest Burgess in sociology, the university declined to appoint her to a faculty position. (Eventually she became the sole sociologist at Rockford College, Illinois; today, a prize named after her is offered by the American Society of Criminology for the best scholarship by a young, emerging scholar in criminology.<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a>) Another American, Louis Israel Dublin, a Jewish-American who had immigrated to the U.S. as a child from Lithuania, received a PhD from Columbia and taught as a lecturer at Yale, but his primary career was as vice president and statistician for the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. With his co-author and research assistant, Bessie Bunzel, he published <span style="font-style:italic;">To Be or Not To Be: A Study of Suicide</span> in 1933.<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> Meanwhile, although financial ruin as a cause of suicide had appeared almost as regularly as love in scientific studies of suicide, only with the work of the Americans Hoffman and Dublin/Bunzel did the economics of suicide come into its own or, rather, stake its claims in this multidisciplinary terrain. (<span style="font-style:italic;">To Be or Not To Be</span> is not quite as literary as its title would suggest: aside from quoting <span style="font-style:italic;">Hamlet</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Richard III</span> and mentioning Carlyle and Goethe, Dublin and Bunzel ignore literature.)<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  As this timeline indicates, more than two decades passed in the twentieth century before any more new book-length studies of suicide appeared. Extensive scientific attention in combination with sensationalist newspaper reportage of suicide at the turn of the century seem temporarily to have exhausted the subject in the scientific-book market: as contemporary historian Olive Anderson notes of the periodical literature, “[S]uicides (like homicides, daring robberies, conflagrations, and other disasters) were used to provide mass entertainment [by journalists]; but by 1911 so much else had been trivialized that these traditional topics were necessarily reported more selectively in order to make room for a whole range of foreign and home ‘stories.’”<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> Still, Anderson continues, “the ethics of suicide long continued to be enthusiastically debated by the avant-garde.”<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a> In an Ariès-like argument, Anderson says that the significant changes wrought by professionalization of the coroner’s office and of the inquest system—removing the former from the popular electoral process and the latter from pubs to the less accessible “post-mortem room” and “coroner’s court-house,” equipped with professional witnesses and no jury<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a>—contributed to silence about suicide in public and to underreporting. In addition, these transformations permitted official linguistic formulations and professionals’ charitably euphemistic expressions to supplant blunter language. Yet while these changes may have succeeded in diminishing suicide as an open conversational topic, it is worth noting that the added mystery, “shrouded in an atmosphere of officialdom, expertise, and formality,” and continued newspaper coverage of inquests intensified the scandal in the public mind.<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> Even as dealing with suicide became a more orderly, impersonal affair of trained professionals, families of the dead shunned the necessarily public character of these official proceedings (as Anderson also indicates), reporting cases less frequently, while noticing them all the more.<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Amid the concourse of partly disjunctive, partly coalescent disciplinary projects and professionalized inquiry, literature flowed as often as it ebbed. Its discursive competition could be fierce. At the turn of the twentieth century, as A. H. Halsey explains, literature effectively seized the field of sociology generally from the social sciences. (Halsey does not discuss suicide studies.) In 1910, S. K. Radcliffe published “Sociology in the English Novel” in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sociological Review,</span> the official journal of the Sociological Society, and argued “that modern fiction was descriptive sociology in a larger and truer sense than the term possessed when it was used by Herbert Spencer.”<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a> Beatrice and Sidney Webb, H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, and T. S. Eliot all play large parts in Halsey’s narrative (res often at odds, however, with each other on the scientific and philosophical sources for literary sociology: whether, for example, in Comte and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Spencer, as the Webbs believed; or in Plato, according to Wells). On suicide, Beatrice Webb said little and that little was mildly Christian; H. G. Wells advocated not merely the right to die but euthanasia.<a name="f63-text" href="#f63"><sup>63</sup></a> Ultimately, Halsey concurs with his predecessor historians of sociology, Wolf Lepenies and Krishan Kumar, in locating “the rise of sociology”—from Trollope, Dickens, and George Eliot to the Webbs, Wells, and T. S. Eliot—as “<span style="font-style:italic;">Between Science and Literature</span>” (his italics and capitalization).<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> Halsey sees the poet Charles Madge as emblematic of this history, Madge having joined “the British sociological professoriat” in 1950.<a name="f65-text" href="#f65"><sup>65</sup></a> The educated layperson, meanwhile, was more likely to get social information and analysis from literature and periodical sources than from a social science treatise.
	</p>
<p>
	  Suicide is a dauntingly conventional trope in literature: a device to end a plot line, to start one or, digressively, to introduce a note of pathos or warning. Nonetheless, throughout the rise of modern suicidology, literary authors persisted in writing about suicide in fresh detail, tragically, comically, romantically, satirically, and dead-pan, both informed and not by the scientific literature but, when informed, reluctant to take its conclusions as the last word. No decade passed without abundant literary representations, and numerous critical studies have discussed suicides in texts not only by writers who killed themselves (like Hemingway and Woolf) but also by writers who did not commit suicide, including books on novels and stories by Thomas Hardy, Joseph Conrad, and Henry James.<a name="f66-text" href="#f66"><sup>66</sup></a> In the most famous example of the kinds of scandalized attention literature could demand, Goethe became internationally renowned with his publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sorrows of Werther</span> in 1774 (during the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sturm und Drang</span> period in Germany to which Belacqua refers), which apparently produced what both suicidologists and the public referred to as an “epidemic” of copycat suicides.<a name="f67-text" href="#f67"><sup>67</sup></a> Scientists like Winslow argued intently against <span style="font-style:italic;">Werther’s</span> influence.<a name="f68-text" href="#f68"><sup>68</sup></a> Nearly a century later, the popular sensationalist novels by Mary Elizabeth Braddon, <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Audley’s Secret</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Aurora Floyd</span> , drew epidemiologist J. N. Radcliffe’s moral angst about “the aesthetics of suicide”; his response took the form of charting these novels’ statistically frequent allusions to suicide—despite the absence of any actual suicide narrative events.<a name="f69-text" href="#f69"><sup>69</sup></a> But literature also drew scientists’ admiration (including Winslow’s) for its insights; across the ocean in 1866, Abner Otis Kellogg published <span style="font-style:italic;">Shakespeare’s Delineations of Insanity, Imbecility, and Suicide</span>, which reads not merely as early psychological literary criticism, but as an understanding of Shakespeare as psychologist.<a name="f70-text" href="#f70"><sup>70</sup></a> The long chapter on suicide mostly sets aside <span style="font-style:italic;">Hamlet</span>’s soliloquy to focus instead on the lesser-studied representations in <span style="font-style:italic;">Othello.</span><a name="f71-text" href="#f71"><sup>71</sup></a> Westcott’s chapter “Literature” in his 1881 study actually conjoins scientific and literary discourses,<a name="f72-text" href="#f72"><sup>72</sup></a> distinguishing literature “on suicide as a fact” under the broader rubric of “literature” and cataloguing the literary and factual documents on suicide in a single list.<a name="f73-text" href="#f73"><sup>73</sup></a> Inspired by Ibsen’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Hedda Gabler,</span> Tolstoy’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Anna Karenina</span>, and Flaubert’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Madame Bovary</span>, as well as by the new sciences and philosophy of suicide, numerous poets, dramatists, and novelists collectively made suicide part of scandalous English fin de siècle aestheticized morbidity. Although these writers in turn inspired the early twentieth-century modernists, this English cohort was ultimately framed, and othered, as suicidal by W. B. Yeats’s 1922 essay “The Tragic Generation.”<a name="f74-text" href="#f74"><sup>74</sup></a> Its facts,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> however, were shaky: just one of the poets Yeats discusses, John Davidson, deliberately took his life, and he was the least “aesthetic” of this group.<a name="f75-text" href="#f75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  In this context, it might seem inevitable that the post-World War II poet A. Alvarez should mourn twentieth-century modernism as the climax in suicide history, from the classical age to Alvarez’s own moment, which was haunted by the suicide of Sylvia Plath. Suicide had seemed, to generations of scientists and artists alike, on the increase within civilized nations. On the pseudo-Darwinian links advanced among suicide, modernity, and civilization, diverse scientific thinkers and writers had agreed.<a name="f76-text" href="#f76"><sup>76</sup></a> (We now believe that the numbers of suicides did rise proportionally with modernization, except during times of war, but that the rise was far less steep than turn-of-the-twentieth-century scholars thought. Their suicide statistics had risen in step with improvements in record keeping.<a name="f77-text" href="#f77"><sup>77</sup></a>)
	</p>
<p>
	  Meanwhile, situating itself in contradistinction not only to physiology, sociology, and the other social sciences but also to nineteenth-century psychology, psychoanalysis was struggling to emerge. In her essay “Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown,” Virginia Woolf locates the moment when “character” changed as the year 1910 and sees character changing from being constituted by external data to being constituted by the inner psyche.<a name="f78-text" href="#f78"><sup>78</sup></a> In dating the moment when Edwardians became Georgians, Woolf happens to have highlighted the year also in which an important suicide symposium of psychologists—catalyzed by an “epidemic” of suicides in the secondary schools—was led off by the classicist David Ernst Oppenheim in Vienna, with Freud as chair. The symposium members traded notes on, theorized, and sought to disseminate their sketchy new views on the possible psychological causes of suicide.<a name="f79-text" href="#f79"><sup>79</sup></a> In the course of this symposium, little seemed clear about the psychological motivation and dynamics of suicide, but several participants intrepidly divulged correlations between, for example, libidinal despair, masturbation, or homosexuality with attempted or completed suicides.<a name="f80-text" href="#f80"><sup>80</sup></a> The prior nineteenth-century psychologists had not omitted these Belacqua-like “erotic, anterotic” reasons for suicide, but they had, like Belacqua, spoken of them in considerably less graphic detail. But if for Freud too, eros and thanatos eventually arose as inextricable prizeters of the psyche, he said little at the Viennese forum about this, beyond indicating the groundwork of his later theorization of suicide in “Mourning and Melancholy” .<a name="f81-text" href="#f81"><sup>81</sup></a> The questions for Freud in his concluding remarks to the symposium were, “how it becomes possible for the extraordinarily powerful life instinct to be overcome: whether this can only come about with the help of a disappointed libido or whether the ego can renounce its self-preservation for its own egoistic motives.” He went on to suggest that “[w]e can, I think, only take as our starting-point the condition of melancholia, which is so familiar to us clinically, and a comparison between it and the affect of mourning.”<a name="f82-text" href="#f82"><sup>82</sup></a> He insisted, however, that suicide’s psychic origins remained wholly obscure: “The affective processes in melancholia, however, and the vicissitudes undergone by the libido in that condition, are totally unknown to us. Nor have we arrived at psycho-analytic understanding of the chronic affect of mourning.”<a name="f83-text" href="#f83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Less widely known today than Freud’s theory of mourning and melancholia is the extent to which his language reflects terminology used repeatedly by nineteenth-century  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> psychologists (excepting “libido”). The British suicide studies frequently concerned themselves with how to explain what motivates someone to overcome an “instinct” for “self-preservation”; and they theorized a “suicidal impulse” (Morselli), “instinct” (Strahan; Morselli), or “tendency” (Westcott; Morselli)<a name="f84-text" href="#f84"><sup>84</sup></a>—depending on the sociopsychological context—as operating in human minds, bodies, and societies. “Melancholy” in particular had been singled out from the start by Philippe Pinel and, for that matter, by the Renaissance writer Robert Burton<a name="f85-text" href="#f85"><sup>85</sup></a> and to a lesser extent by George Savage,<a name="f86-text" href="#f86"><sup>86</sup></a> though most theorists saw the suicide affect as considerably more multidimensional than this. For psychoanalysts, however, a powerful motive for explaining suicide may be found in the temptation to discriminate their work not only from modern psychology but from the externally derived, statistically driven determinism of Morselli and Durkheim. They hoped to substitute a definitive hermeneutics of the inner mental life of the suicidal person. At this early date, Freud himself did not exclude external factors from blame: in opening his remarks, he suggested that, much as the symposium participants might wish to excuse the schools from charges leveled at education by the news media for the rash of student suicides, they must not be in too great a hurry to “acquit the secondary schools.”<a name="f87-text" href="#f87"><sup>87</sup></a> The urgency to set the suicide question to rest, exhibited by century-end British scientists as well as these symposium members, probably also derived from their affiliations with educational institutions (if only through the degrees they had earned) along with the “modern” and “civilized” trends that their statistics ironically targeted as major social sources of suicide.<a name="f88-text" href="#f88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Somewhat more beholden to academic institutions than the other American suicidologists mentioned above, Kansan Karl A. Menninger—the son of an immigrant Freudian psychiatrist—developed his specialty in psychiatry through U.S. universities, receiving his education from Washburn, then Indiana University, followed by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and finally Harvard Medical School, where he taught while working at the Boston Psychopathic Hospital. Within two years of this appointment, however, he returned to Kansas to help his father found and operate the Menninger Clinic, followed by the Menninger Sanitarium and the Menninger Foundation for study and treatment of psychiatric patients. Twenty years after his return to Topeka, he wrote his influential book on suicide, <span style="font-style:italic;">Man Against Himself</span>, in 1938. Emerging from German psychoanalysis rather than American sociology or an American insurance company, Menninger nonetheless postulated a global sociological foundation for suicide and suggested that a social framework could itself be pathological. One year prior to the outbreak of World War II, Menninger saw the “death drive” writ large. Terming his approach “human phenomenology,” he argued: “Our best defense against self-destructiveness lies in the courageous application of intelligence to human phenomenology. If such is our nature, it were better that we knew it and knew it in all its protean manifestations. To see all forms of self-destruction from the standpoint of their dominant principles would seem to be logical progress toward self-preservation and toward a unified view of medical science.”<a name="f89-text" href="#f89"><sup>89</sup></a> Applying this theory to the world, he wrote,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    Men fly above ancient and beautiful cities dropping explosive bombs upon museums and churches, upon great buildings and little children. They are encouraged by the official representatives of two hundred million other people, all of whom contribute daily in taxes to the frantic manufacture of instruments designed for the tearing and ripping and mangling of human beings similar to themselves, possessed of the same instincts, the same sensations, the same little pleasures, and the same realization that death comes to end these things all too soon.<a name="f90-text" href="#f90"><sup>90</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  That notion of a “unified science” that could bring an end to war, from within or through “intelligent” application to the study of our “instincts,” proved a transient dream. In the postwar era of academic disciplines and related professional specializations, medical, psychological, physiological, metaphysic, social, and literary discourses became, of course, increasingly divided from each other and subdivided within disciplines themselves, and they found little common cause.
	</p>
<p>
	  Menninger’s dedication stresses that Freud’s re-formulation of a death drive represented a dual formulation of thanatos and eros: he dedicates the book “[t]o those who would use intelligence in the battle against death—to strengthen the will to live against the wish to die, and to replace with love the blind compulsion to give hostages to hatred as the price of living.”<a name="f91-text" href="#f91"><sup>91</sup></a> As moving as Menninger designed his book to be, even this reiteration of Freud’s work could have struck some of his learned readers as a romantic cliché; love had been routinely viewed as the prime motive, not romantically salvational, behind suicidal death. Four years earlier, in Beckett’s story-series, one dimension of the absurdist anti-conventional irony in the scene excerpted in this article’s epigraph is that the reasons for suicide that Belacqua propounds to his lover have nothing to do with love; indeed, they apply to individual, not double, suicide. Or do they?
	</p>
<p>
	  Erotic love had been routinely considered among suicide’s primary motives, and lovers’ suicides had operated as among the most conventional of suicide’s literary conventions. But none of the reasons Belacqua advances explains the type of double suicide he is proposing to his partner, and he makes no effort to romanticize it for her.<a name="f92-text" href="#f92"><sup>92</sup></a> Aside from the fact that no tragic separation of lovers is at stake, he does not love her: “He cultivated Ruby, for whom at no time did he much care, and made careful love in the terms he thought best calculated to prime her for the part she was to play on his behalf . . . . How he had formed this resolution to destroy himself we are quite unable to discover. The simplest course, when the motives of any deed are found subliminal to the point of defying expression, is to call that deed <span style="font-style:italic;">ex nihilo</span> and have done.”<a name="f93-text" href="#f93"><sup>93</sup></a> Beckett frames Belacqua’s planned suicide not as an act of love or sexual obsession but “<span style="font-style:italic;">ex nihilo</span>,” punningly, as is his wont: both the ultimate act of creation and lacking any explanation—a Nietzschean farewell, perhaps. The narrator declines to theorize it, admitting simply, as a scholar might, that “[h]ow he had formed this resolution . . . we are quite unable to discover.” Eventually, after they have downed a bottle of whisky together, the gun they have brought along to kill each other accidentally fires, missing them both. From the “subliminal” through the biblical “<span style="font-style:italic;">ex nihilo</span>” to the nihilist, the accidental deliverance prompts as many reasons, for Belacqua, and as little reason, as had the suicide attempt: “‘Digitus Dei’ he said ‘for once,’” amid the “shock” and “the silence.”<a name="f94-text" href="#f94"><sup>94</sup></a> From the narratorial perspective, the source  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> or mechanics of this rescue remain equally undecidable—and more likely to be understood by Beckett’s reader as the age-old theatrical artifice of <span style="font-style:italic;">deus ex machina</span> than as divine fate. But then, after “the silence spent its fury,” a “turmoil of life-blood sprang up in the breasts of our two young felons, so that they came together in inevitable nuptial.”<a name="f95-text" href="#f95"><sup>95</sup></a> Love, it seems, is not to be excluded from this multipronged attempt at suicide, after all. In later years, the semi-omniscient narrator concludes, sentimentally, that “when Ruby is dead and [Belacqua] an old optimist,” Belacqua will have for once “achieved what he set out to do; <span style="font-style:italic;">car</span>, in the words of one competent to sing of the matter, <span style="font-style:italic;">L’Amour et la Mort</span>—caesura—<span style="font-style:italic;">n’est qu’une mesme chose.</span>”<a name="f96-text" href="#f96"><sup>96</sup></a> Quoting pre-Freudian, sixteenth-century poet Pierre de Ronsard, Beckett’s Belacqua has re-achieved Wagner’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Liebestod</span>, but with yet another twist to this ancient tradition; for immediately after the pistol shot, he and Ruby are more alive than ever.
	</p>
<p>
	  As vexing or as engrossing as the questions of cause and motive might be, or of social and psychological diagnosis, there was also the crucial question—to which Beckett’s appellation of “felons” to his young heroes alerts us—of suicide’s legal status. Concern about its legality alone was sufficient for the American lawyer Rocellus Sheridan Guernsey to devote a pamphlet to suicide’s legal history, <span style="font-style:italic;">Suicide: [A] History of the Penal Laws Relating to It in Their Legal, Social, Moral, and Religious Aspects, in Ancient and Modern Times</span> , and as that title emphasizes, this history examined suicide’s multidisciplinary, sociocultural contexts.<a name="f97-text" href="#f97"><sup>97</sup></a> Winslow, Westcott, and Strahan all angled their books toward an attack on suicide’s controversial legal definition. In years when it is hard to find full-length nonliterary books about suicide in the English-speaking world (1901–26), discussion proceeded apace in medical, psychological, sociological, legal, and ethical journals. Writing for <span style="font-style:italic;">Transactions of the Medico-Legal Society, For the Years 1902, 1903 &amp; 1904</span>, R. Henslowe Wellington, a barrister-at-law and deputy coroner, pled “to commit suicide or self-murder the person must be a responsible agent possessing the power of knowing right and wrong, a reasonable and a sane being”;<a name="f98-text" href="#f98"><sup>98</sup></a> “not only is it incorrect to return a verdict of ‘Suicide whilst temporarily insane,’ but to say <span style="font-style:italic;">committed</span> suicide is a double error of legal phraseology, for the meaning of <span style="font-style:italic;">commit</span> in Johnson, with reference to this use of the word, is ‘to perpetrate, to do a fault, to be guilty of a crime,’ and this we have seen is an impossibility with the insane.”<a name="f99-text" href="#f99"><sup>99</sup></a> Practically no one anywhere was being charged and punished by the courts for <span style="font-style:italic;">felo de se</span>. As Wellington notes, “During the ten years 1893–1902 the verdict of <span style="font-style:italic;">felo de se</span> has been returned in less than 2 per cent. of the total number of verdicts of self-destruction.”<a name="f100-text" href="#f100"><sup>100</sup></a> The public was nonetheless aware of the law. Where Wellington wished to reinstate and uphold the basic verdict of <span style="font-style:italic;">felo de se</span> in cases of rational self-murder, most people and most courts pitied suicidal people and suicide survivors so much that they put persistent moral and traditional Christian scruples as well as legal issues aside in order to sympathize with and acquit suicides on the grounds of “temporary insanity.” In comic reversal, again, of this public concern, Belacqua—grabbing a number plate as he departs to kill himself along with his fellow “connive[r] at his felo de se”—paints the notice “Temporarily Sane” to post at their death site.<a name="f101-text" href="#f101"><sup>101</sup></a> This tight, troubled linkage of suicide with insanity cried out for more nuanced descriptions and diagnoses. Yet British law did not change until 1961, and the laws remain unchanged in some American states today.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	  About the rich corpus of discursive legal and ethical inter-texts, it would seem folly to generalize. But one can discern fault lines in discussions of suicide’s ethics and legality—between the determined and free, external and internal, irrational and rational, insane and sane, pessimistic and optimistic, egoistic and altruistic, cowardly and courageous, despairing and stoic, fanatical and self-martyring,<a name="f102-text" href="#f102"><sup>102</sup></a> idealist and pragmatic—which were productive of enormous dissension. The questions raised by Empedocles’ late-life jump into a volcano, to which Belacqua alludes, seem as unanswerable in this period as at earlier times. It was repeatedly debated within several of these conceptual frames, especially the cowardly versus courageous and the despairing versus stoic. For some sociologists, the psychology of suicide was determined by external circumstance; Morselli, for example, had written, “[A]s to the intention and application of the statistical method to the phenomena of the moral world, it is the objective demonstration of modern determinism. . . . [H]aving devoted many years to the observation and the treatment of mental disease, I am convinced more and more every day of the universality and regularity of the laws which influence human actions.”<a name="f103-text" href="#f103"><sup>103</sup></a> By contrast, ethicists clung to a notion of free will. In one Medico-Legal Society discussion in 1922–23, for example, a participant insisted, despite the prevalent deterministic view, that “[m]any doctors will not admit that [there is freedom of the will]; nearly all lawyers deny it. . . . [T]he proper view is to regard the will as a means for improvement. . . . [A]s ordinary conduct in ordinary life is motivated by pleasure or pain, so the same sort of thing takes place in the domain of ethics.”<a name="f104-text" href="#f104"><sup>104</sup></a> For the latter reasoner, moreover, the determinism of Freudian psychology, not of sociological statistics, was the ethical target. For philosophers of pessimism, optimism was the enemy of the true, even if (or especially when) pessimism led to a justification for suicide: as Schopenhauer writes, “Therefore whenever we have contradiction and falsehood, we have ideas that have not sprung from objective apprehension, e.g., in optimism.”<a name="f105-text" href="#f105"><sup>105</sup></a> For the most traditional Christian theologians, pessimism was the enemy of the good, and suicide remained a vicious crime against God. Theologians were not above deploying logical positivist methods to argue their case, as in James Gurnhill’s painstaking treatise <span style="font-style:italic;">The Morals of Suicide</span> .<a name="f106-text" href="#f106"><sup>106</sup></a> Then again, Belacqua’s John of the Cross is equally characteristic of Christian views: an antirational mystic, remembered in part for his poetry, his “Dark Night of the Soul” offers a Job-like argument for sheer endurance. For William James—who became caught up in 1895 in the decades-long pamphlet arguments that were published under the title, “Is Life Worth Living?” —idealism (“idealities”), no matter how ungrounded in scientific fact, offered a critical article of belief, and an optimistic affect, which could and necessarily must be embraced for its own sake by anyone with a wish to live.<a name="f107-text" href="#f107"><sup>107</sup></a> For Freud, disappointed over-idealism was often a major culprit in triggering a suicide’s death drive: “[T]he loss of some abstraction which has taken the place of [a loved person], such as fatherland, liberty, an ideal, and so on.”<a name="f108-text" href="#f108"><sup>108</sup></a> The fiction writers, playwrights, and poets were, of course, far from silent on precisely these thorny questions.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">“Diligent Enquiry” and “Crisis,” Revisited</h1>
<p>
	  “Diligent enquiry” (to borrow from Belacqua) into rationales for suicide in the modernist period leads one into an intricate interdisciplinary nexus that, as I have argued, merits thicker description than has been available heretofore. Is suicidology a “discipline,” given that it appears never to have generated academic departments? Today, suicidology comes close, yet stops just sort of territorial autonomy; it does count as a medical specialty in the health sciences, psychiatry and psychology, and criminology, and it enjoys its own professional association, associated clinics, and certifying programs—if only a couple of journals.<a name="f109-text" href="#f109"><sup>109</sup></a> Recently, the topic of the association’s 2012 annual conference has been announced and, with this announcement, the association stakes out its terrain in between: “Collaborations in Suicidology: Bridging the Disciplines.” But if it now is a recognized academic interdisciplinary specialty, it clearly was not one during the modernist period, when these disciplines were gathering steam. We might term it merely a “sub-discipline” since it had acquired its own canon of scholarly literature and the first Samaritan clinics by the First World War. Yet it was intimately connected with the rise, even birth, of several full-fledged social-science disciplines: psychology, sociology, psychiatry, and statistics, even while remaining, as in the pre-Enlightenment centuries, tightly linked to theological, philosophical, and legal developments. In this sense it has operated over time as a kind of “inter-discipline,” eroding attempts to create boundaries not only between academic disciplines but between imaginative literature and social science. An intellectual history of the emergence of suicide as a topic of modernist “diligent enquiry,” which this essay provides in condensed form, suggests that as a discursive phenomenon, suicidology shows us another side to the way literature and literary studies themselves coalesced as an inter-discipline in the modernist period.
	</p>
<p>
	  Predictably, one finds two primary patterns of cross-disciplinary discourse emerging during the early history of suicidology, both of them oppositional: antinomies between establishment-oriented traditionalist belief and skeptical, methodological investigation, and opposed practices of collaborative integration and competitive disaggregation. Suicidology played a relatively small part in these processes of academic cooperation and competition. Still, amid the ever-hastening and deepening drive to knowledge, suicidology in particular was driven—not only obstructed—by its associations with shame and taboo and by the way explanations of particular suicides led into areas of private shame: money and alcohol, insanity and immorality, sex and death. Because taboo, suicide both attracted and deflected the attention of scholars. The modernist period—embedded as it was in financial crisis and alcoholic brinksmanship, subjectivist exploration and secular investigation, sexual experimentation and war- and disease-related mass deaths—witnessed an ever-increasing desire<a name="f110-text" href="#f110"><sup>110</sup></a> to fathom the “death drive” in individual persons and in human social structures.
	</p>
<p>
	  In addition, modernist suicidologists repeatedly sought to appeal to an audience beyond the academic: the “intelligent reader.” Suicide numbers appeared for a while to be rising steeply, in tandem with advances in civilization and education, so literate readers of the kind these scholars desired were increasingly abundant and, many scholars  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and professionals thought, endangered. The scholars themselves emerged as often as not from various professions outside universities. To this day, suicidology is as much a phenomenon of extracurricular study and practices by the literate non-university person as by the academic, and suicide is a subject to which the lay writer and reader is (sometimes passionately) drawn. As such, the study of suicidology has crept over and through the walls between the university and its multitudinous surrounds, sometimes emerging from without to change disciplinary behavior or ideas within.
	</p>
<p>
	  About literature’s role, Alvarez says of the “transition to the twentieth century,” “Suicide did not disappear from the arts; instead, it became part of their fabric. . . . Once suicide was accepted as a common fact of society . . . simply as something people did, often and without much hesitation, like committing adultery, then it automatically became a common property of art.”<a name="f111-text" href="#f111"><sup>111</sup></a> Yet as “common” or “ordinary” as suicide became, Alvarez persists in characterizing the suicide trope as “a sharp, narrow, intensely dramatic light on life at its extreme moments” and “the whole of twentieth-century art [as] dedicated to the service of this earthbound Savage God . . . . producing an art which is more extreme, more violent and, finally, more self-destructive than ever before.”<a name="f112-text" href="#f112"><sup>112</sup></a> While devoting a chapter to Dada’s socio-aesthetic destructivity and actual suicides, he says only about Woolf that she “drowned herself, a victim of her own excessive sensitivity”;<a name="f113-text" href="#f113"><sup>113</sup></a> about Hart Crane that he “devoted prodigious energy to aestheticizing his chaotic life—a desperate compound of homosexuality and alcoholism—and, finally, thinking himself a failure, jumped overboard from a steamer in the Caribbean”; and about Malcolm Lowry and John Berryman that they “were alcoholics who finally committed suicide.”<a name="f114-text" href="#f114"><sup>114</sup></a> The social science texts of the turn of the century elucidate the peculiar conflation here of drunkenness with suicide, for alcohol was habitually included in the lists of suicide’s causality.<a name="f115-text" href="#f115"><sup>115</sup></a> That gender and sexuality also appear in Alvarez’s rhetoric as pungently segregated categories—with the female suicide chalked up to “sensitivity” and the gay suicide to an “aestheticized” “homosexual” “failed” life—similarly reproduces the gendered discourses of those earlier decades. As contemporary suicide studies are increasingly demonstrating, race, ethnicity, age, and religion operated alongside gender as baked-in category assumptions in modernist suicidology, premises from which analysis began and to which it tautologically returned.<a name="f116-text" href="#f116"><sup>116</sup></a> Then again, to return to Alvarez’s initial comment on the pervasiveness of suicide in modernism, “common” and “ordinary” are not derogatory terms when employed by contemporary historian Olive Anderson, because in her view perceived ordinariness helped calm emotions on both sides of suicidal events. In these respects, especially, the considerably more elaborate, critical, and multi-tonal ways in which the literary writers represented suicide merit re-inscription in this period’s myriad discourses.
	</p>
<p>
	  Alvarez’s “crisis” can itself be taken as a border breached rather than a dead-end. For various modernist thinkers and writers, articulation of crisis broke open doors to altered discourse and arenas for speculation, freeing modernists to think anew. In Stephane Mallarmé’s classic Oxford lecture in defense of experimentalism in modern poetry, “Crisis in Poetry,” “crisis” did just that. Suicide appears far from his mind in this 1896 essay, yet the essay recaptures the context I have sketched—in the terms of “literature” as a competitive field of thoughtful endeavor:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    A fundamental and fascinating crisis in literature is now at hand. . . . This [change] is disconcerting for the French reading public, whose habits were interrupted by the death of Victor Hugo . . . . Hugo reduced all prose—philosophy, oratory, history—to poetry; and since he was himself poetry personified [for that public], he nearly abolished the philosopher’s, speaker’s, or historian’s right to self-expression. In that wasteland, with silence all around . . . . [I]n a crypt of equal silence lay the divinity of this majestic, unconscious idea: namely, that the form we call verse is itself, quite simply, literature; that we have verse so long as we have diction, rhythm so long as we have style. Poetry, I think, waited patiently and respectfully until this giant . . . had disappeared; then it broke up. The entire language was fitted out for prosody, and therein it re-discovered its vital sense of pause. Now it could fly off, freely scattering its numberless and irreducible elements. Or we might well compare it to the multiple sounds issuing from a purely verbal orchestration. . . . [F]or the first time in the literary history of any nation, . . . any poet with an individual technique and ear can build his own instrument, so long as his fluting, bowing, or drumming are accomplished—play that instrument and dedicate it, along with others, to Language. Thus we have won a great new freedom. <a name="f117-text" href="#f117"><sup>117</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  A symbolist, Mallarmé is often grouped with the so-called decadent French writers and their literary “morbidity.” The French decadents influenced the English modernists directly. A case could thus be made to link Mallarmé to the suicide “fads” of the 1890s and to modernist morbidity more generally.<a name="f118-text" href="#f118"><sup>118</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Perhaps, however, something both more ordinary and more extraordinary was happening “between the acts.” Mallarmé declares literature “freed” in this passage by a “crisis in [modern] poetry” from other ideational, rhetorical, and proto-disciplinary discourses or traditions of thought, with those discourses implicitly “freed” also from literature’s domination—in the shape of Hugo’s massively multidisciplinary poetry. While Mallarmé emphasizes form and “technique” in this passage rather than content and ideas, positioning literature amid allied arts (especially, metaphorically, in alliance with music), that formalist gesture wrests literature, as an age-old vehicle of knowledge, from the growing dominance of the other knowledge-based fields. Mallarmé’s fervent declaration of liberty for literature does present an “idea” about it: the idea specifically of discursive, proto-disciplinary distinction for “literature.” In envisioning it as something free and distinctive, Mallarme assumed for literature a continuing place among the emergent intellectual disciplines and a compelling role there as the agent <span style="font-style:italic;">par excellence</span> of language—fundamental as language is to all discourses, shape-shifting in its artful genres and ideational systems. In numerous modernist writers’ hands, as in Beckett’s, the horror of suicide yielded to something peculiarly literary and distinctively modernist: a kind of play, chatty or profound, cheerful or desolate, with suicide’s often traditional, often irrational rationales.

	      An obvious period-designator, war often demarcates new eras of knowledge and experience for their societies: prior to World War I, the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 served as “the war [that] gave rise to Durkheim and his followers,” according to A. H. Halsey in <span style="font-style:italic;">A History of Sociology in Britain: Science, Literature, and Society</span> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), 204. For England in the last decades of the nineteenth century, a flurry of imperial wars abroad changed the national temper; the two twentieth-century world wars are generally viewed as productive of “high” modernism. Suicide itself tended to decline during wars, resurging afterwards.

	      Not translated into English until 1951, Durkheim’s study may owe its acclaim, in part, to its semi-structuralist organization, with suicidal phenomena divided into four conditions, dependent on binary social states (integrated or not). Because he gives unequal space to the four, they are sometimes read as three. His arguments and terminology, however, perpetuated those of his predecessors. The argument (now shown to be erroneous) that the stricter Roman Catholic church produced fewer suicides than the more liberal Protestant church and the concepts of “egotism” and “altruism,” Durkheim’s two foremost conditions, were embedded in the conceptualization of his predecessors (“heroic” and “self-sacrificial” were the terms generally used by the British as opposed to the Comtean term “altruism”). See Emile Durkheim, <span style="font-style:italic;">Suicide: A Study in Sociology</span>, trans. John A. Spaulding and George Simpson, ed. Simpson (New York: The Free Press, 1951), 152, 217.

	    In his 1966 foreword to the English translation of this symposium, Paul Friedman describes the year 1910 as “a definite turning point” in the “evolution of our thinking about suicide,” for it was a year in which “one of the last meetings of the original group of associates [the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society] at which Freud presided” took place; shortly after this meeting, this group also began to part company, with Alfred Adler and Wilhelm Stekel leading the “secession.” See Paul Friedman, ed., <span style="font-style:italic;">On Suicide: With Particular Reference to Suicide Among Young Students</span> (New York: International Universities Press, Inc., 1967), 11.

In the 1890s, the American comparative anatomist Burt Wilder had taken a direct interest in the brain of the “educated suicide” and, in conjunction with the 1894 exhibition of his collection of brains at Cornell University, had made known his discovery of unusual central fissures. In 1900 he retracted his view of anything remarkable about them.

	    In the introduction to a collection devoted to questions of disciplinarity in modernist studies, Caughie cites Marjorie Garber’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Academic Instincts</span> to note that “interdisciplinarity might” itself derive from “disciplinary envy, a term [Garber] uses to designate a mechanism or structure, specifically <span style="font-style:italic;">a structure of desire</span>, not simply the desire of an individual scholar” ; in the case of suicide, this drive would derive especially intimately from such psychoanalytically located sources.
