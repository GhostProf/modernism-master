<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
By the term ambulatory automatism is understood a pathological
syndrome appearing in the form of intermittent attacks during which
the patient, carried away by an irresistible impulse, leaves his home
and makes an excursion or journey 
justified by no reasonable motive. The attack ended, the subject
unexpectedly finds himself on an unknown road or in a strange town.
Swearing by all the gods never again to quit his penates, he returns
home but sooner or later a new attack provokes a new
escapade.

<p>
Ambulatory automatism, by whatever name--<I>dromomanie</I>,
<I>poriomenie</I>, <I>Wandertrieb</I>, <I>determinismo
ambulatorio</I>, psychogenic fugue, or, in the parlance of the current
<I>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual </I>of the American Psychiatric
Association, 
dissociative fugue--is exemplary for, even a caricature of,
late century madness. It is also a distorting mirror of one of the
middle class obsessions of the modern world, the world of Thomas Cook
and Son, the world of the comfortable traveller. For <I>les</I>
<I>alien&eacute;s voyageurs</I>--to use the title of the
first medical thesis about these men--were compulsive
travellers, solid artisans or honest men of the laboring classes, who
on hearing the name of a distant place would set out, on foot, or by
fourth class 
carriage, not knowing why they went. So far as casual passers-by could
tell, they behaved, en route, quite sensibly, yet they knew not what
they were doing, or, in some cases, who they were. That is the
prototype.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Rich men had fugues, and so did knaves, but the
central examples for nineteenth-century fugue were humble, decent men,
who remained humble and decent on their deliberate yet unwanted trips,
of which they later had <b></b> almost no memory. Hysteria has been
called the body language of female powerlessness. Fugue was a body
language of male powerlessness.

<p>
<I>Fugueurs</I> did not wander. They travelled with perseverance, in a
straight line, so to speak. At the end of 1899 a Swiss psychologist
published a once famous book about a middle-class medium, hysteria,
and multiple-personality: <I>From India to the Planet
Mars.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 This captured the imagination of a public
already dedicated to spiritualism and Thomas Cook. <I>Fugueurs,</I>
who were usually men of a more humble 
station in life, did not get to Mars, but they got to India, to
Moscow, to Algiers, or to Constantinople, although most were more
modest in their purposeful meaningless expeditions. <I>Fugueurs</I>
felt compelled, and were fixated on a single idea, a destination, a
variant, as would once have been said, of an <I>id&eacute;e fixe.</I>
They had but one idea, and yet when we look back at them a century
later, a whole cornucopia of ideas 
tumbles out. I shall manage to discuss, under the single heading of
fugue, not only hysteria but also multiple personalty, epilepsy,
hypnosis, the military, the vagrancy scare (or homeless men in the
1890s), the police, anti-Semitism (wandering Jews), photography, art
collectors, archaeology, the bicycle, the Olympic Games, and Proust.
People have gone on strange unmotivated trips forever, but at the time
when fugue became a medical entity, we had truly become modern.

<p>
Ambulatory automatism is an extreme example of a modern malady. It is
not quite extinct. It is parlous to identify any clinical diagnosis of
current psychiatric medicine with a mental illness from times gone by.
Who will say which complaints today match the florid hysteria of the
late nineteenth century? But plainly the official American definition
of dissociative fugue in 1994 was a lineal descendant of the slightly
more colorful definition of my epigraph, stated in Birdhouse a century
earlier: 

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
A. The predominant disturbance is sudden, unexpected travel away from
home or one's customary place of work, with inability to recall one's
past.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
B. Confusion about personal identity or assumption of new identity
(partial or complete). 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
C. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of
Dissociative Identity Disorder (the new name for multiple personality
disorder) and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a
substance (e.g., a drug abuse, a medication) or a general 
medical condition (e.g., temporal lobe epilepsy).
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
D. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in
social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
The 1992 guidelines of the World Health Organization often sound more
sensible to the lay person than those of the American Psychiatric
Association. There we find a greater emphasis on amnesia. "For a
definite diagnosis," we are told, "there should be":

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
(a) the features of dissociative amnesia;
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
(b) purposeful travel beyond the usual everyday range (the
differentiation between 
travel and wandering must be made by those with local knowledge); and
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
(c) maintenance of self care (eating, washing, etc.) and simple social
interaction with strangers (such as buying tickets or petrol, asking
directions, ordering meals).
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 <b></b> 
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
<I>ICD-10</I> further explains that "although there may be amnesia for
the period of the fugue, the individual's behaviors during this time
may appear completely normal to independent observers."

<p>
A first respect in which dissociative fugue is exceptional is that
hardly any psychiatrist in the world today maintains that it is an
autonomous, free-standing mental 
illness. "Fugue episodes" are taken to be symptoms or behaviors
associated with other psychological or neurological problems. Yet if
you turn to the cited page in the standard, up-to-date American
<I>DSM-IV,</I> or European <I>ICD-10,</I> there it is, as if 
dissociative fugue were something you could simply have, like measles.
This 1994 diagnosis is a curious historical relic, grandfathered from
a past that psychiatrists have forgotten, the fugue epidemic of the
1890s.

<p>
Ambulatory automatism really was more autonomous in its homeland,
France, in a precisely defined period, 1887-1909. I am content to
make too fine a dating, in order to highlight how specific the ailment
was. The first celebrated case of fugue as a complaint in itself was
written up, in Bordeaux, in 1887.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Albert, the central
example, was an extraordinary compulsive traveller, who, like the
other men in his 
family, was employed by the local gas company. The last extended
discussion was at a psychiatric conference held in Nantes in
1909--a conference with two themes, fugue and desertion from
the army.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 This was no accidental putting together of two
topics for a single meeting. In order to gain acquittals for some of
the hapless conscripts who deserted in peacetime, military doctors
would diagnose them as <I>fugueurs.</I>

<p>
We see from the <I>ICD-10</I> definition that fugue is, among other
things, a curious special case of the topic so well studied by Michael
Roth--forgetting.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 We may even wonder why fugue
is not simply a species of amnesia--amnesia with travelling.
The distinction is enforced at present, by both <I>ICD-10</I> and
<I>DSM-IV,</I> not because fugue is somehow an independent disorder,
but because of how fugue and ambulatory automatism emerged as a
distinct disorder in the late nineteenth century. And here we have to
note another remarkable fact, that the psychiatric profession itself
exhibits a kind of collective amnesia. There is now a distinct
diagnosis, fugue, only because of what happened a century ago. Dozens
upon dozens of cases of fugue were published in France alone between
1887 and 1909, and there have been excellent recent survey articles in
the psychiatric literature, running through past cases. Yet in the
present systematic literature all but two of the nineteenth-century
studies have been lost, forgotten, abandoned.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>


<p>
For the primarily European <I>ICD-10,</I> the main problem for people
with dissociative disorders is amnesia. For the American
<I>DSM-IV,</I> the main problem is multiple personalty.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<I>DSM-IV</I> reminds us that fugue was not only a disorder of
forgetting but also, to a lesser extent, a disorder of personal
identity: "Confusion about personal identity or assumption of new
identity (partial or complete)." A definition is used to keep
dissociative fugue distinct from dissociative identity disorder
(multiple personality). A mere definition cannot draw a sharp line
between the two types of behavior, either now or a century ago.
Although complete identity confusion was rare, in the 1890s, there was
usually, during a fugue, at most a foggy sense of who <b></b> one was. In
particular, the <I>fugueur</I> tended to lose touch with exactly those
facts that bureaucrats use to identify us: proper name, place of
birth, domicile, married or 
single?, relatives, educational history, job. Compulsory identity
cards had not yet been introduced. <I>Fugueurs</I> crossing borders
would commonly carry some sort of passport, but, it seems, simply as a
way to cross borders, not as a token of identity.

<p>
Yet there is a fundamental difference between fugue and multiple
personality. You seldom find it stated explicitly in summaries of
clinical experience, although it might be smuggled in under the
discreet heading of "Epidemiology." The fact is that multiples are
women. <I>Fugueurs</I> are men.

<p>
Today there is a great cry among those who treat the dissociative
disorders: "Where are the men with multiple
personalities?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 This is because nine out of ten diagnosed
multiples are women. Why is this a question at all? Is a disorder
stigmatized by being "female"? Or is it rather that the practitioners
fear that the fact that nearly all recent multiples have been women
will be used as a ground for arguing that the disorders have been
suggested to their patients? Or that multiple personality, like
hysteria long ago, is less of a mental illness than a confused
expression of female powerlessness? At any rate, there has for some
years been a popular explanation for the missing male multiples. They
are, it is claimed, not in the mental health system, but in the
criminal justice system. Or, as we say in English, they are in jail.

<p>
One hundred years ago, it was also true that most persons diagnosed
with 
multiple personality were women. But there was an easy answer to the
question "where are the men?" The male multiples were out on trips. On
my account, almost exactly nine in ten fugueurs were men. The 1907
presidential address to the American Neurological Association stated
the matter more strongly. In the course of 
arguing that ambulatory automatism was a type of hysteria, the speaker
observed that:

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
Early on in my investigations I was struck by the enormous
preponderance of men. In the very considerable number of reported
cases, I have found only two women. . . . Why no ambulatory automatism
in women? . . . It is quite natural that a hysterical woman should not
go off on a long and complicated journey but, for her attack, should
have one of the "regular" manifestations of the disease.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
Quite natural, indeed. Fugue is here seen as a male expression of
hysteria, a type of expression that it would be improper or dangerous
for a woman to adopt. It was no literary trope to say that fugue is
the body language of male powerlessness: here our neurologist implies
the same thing. Fugue was at the literal cutting-edge of hysteria. A
chief diagnostic issue, in 1890, was whether or not ambulatory
automatism was a type of hysteria or a type of epilepsy. The happy
hyphen in the then-common diagnosis, hystero-epilepsy, has to be
severed. A case of fugue had to be either hysterical or epileptic.
Hystero-epilepsy was replaced by hysteria/epilepsy, with a sharp
divide between them. <b></b> 

<p>
This is in itself a remarkable small tale in the history of
psychiatry. It is well known that although Charcot by no means
originated the notion of male hysteria, he did legitimate and
popularize it. He is also the man who gave us the label, ambulatory
automatism. So we might expect him to say that his men who took
irrational journeys confirmed the idea of male hysteria. Not at all.
Charcot fiercely and firmly diagnosed latent epilepsy. Even when there
were no seizures, and no family history, the trips of a man afflicted
with <I>automatisme</I> <I>ambulatoire</I> were "epileptic
equivalents." I won't do more than mention a couple of his arguments
here.

<p>
Charcot was a neurologist. He believed that hysteria was part of a
structure of hereditary defects, which could also include epilepsy and
alcoholism. It was produced by occasioning causes. In women these
could be emotional or moral, but in men the causes were physical
trauma, typically either injury to the head, neck or spinal column;
poisoning by industrial or artisanal use of lead, mercury, or silver;
or alcohol. Charcot's <I>fugueurs</I> had no history of physical
trauma, ergo, they were not hysterical. He confirmed that as fact by
clinical questioning, a practice which, we are today convinced, could
at his hands incite or remove symptoms of hysteria at the dictates of
theory. In addition to his clinical analysis, Charcot also claimed
that his men stopped travelling when given large doses of sodium
bromide, a specific for epilepsy, and largely worthless for hysteria.
He was in fact wrong about that: his classic patient wandered off,
never to be seen again, when stuffed full of bromide. Whatever the
merit of his arguments, he put in place a little paradigm: ambulatory
automatism is latent epilepsy.

<p>
According to <I>DSM-IV,</I> dissociative fugue by definition cannot be
frontal lobe epilepsy. <I>ICD-10</I> states more carefully that:

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
Differentiation from post-ictal fugue, seen particularly after
temporal lobe epilepsy, is usually clear because of the history of
epilepsy, the lack of stressful events or problems, and the less
purposeful and more fragmented activities and travel of the epileptic.
[<I>ICD-10</I>, 155]
</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
Hence my claim that today's diagnosis of dissociative fugue is the
lineal descendant of ambulatory automatism looks suspect. Charcot,
after all, argued that ambulatory automatism is latent epilepsy (but
the travels of his own favorite patient were, 
contra <I>ICD-10,</I> thoroughly purposeful). However, there was
another, anti-Charcotian, little paradigm set up in Birdhouse the year
before Charcot invented the very phrase "ambulatory automatism." The
Birdhouse <I>fugueurs</I> had many of the florid symptoms of hysteria,
such as restricted fields of vision, partial anaesthesias,
inexplicable headaches, trance preceded by globus, and exceptional
suggestibility. Above all, although they usually could not remember
where they travelled, they could recall many specific details under
hypnosis. Hypnosis and hysteria had been firmly joined by Charcot
himself. The recovery of lost itineraries by hypnosis was standard and
striking. This proved--in the second little
paradigm--that fugue was a type of hysteria. <b></b> 

<p>
So two stories were in circulation about
<I>fugueurs</I>--they were epileptics, or they were
hysterics. Instances of both types of men were adduced by rival
parties. After Charcot died in 1893, all but his most faithful
acolytes climbed on the hysteria bandwagon. Sage opinion had it that
there were two types of fugue, but that most <I>fugueurs</I> could be
expected to be hysterical rather than epileptic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 That did
not last long. Fugue was found among an extraordinary range of mental
illnesses, and finally within that new German diagnosis, <I>dementia
praecox</I> itself. Fugue ceased to be a type of hysteria, or a type
of latent epilepsy, and became simply a symptom or manifestation of a
superordinate disorder.

<p>
That is a snippet from the French story. Fugue powerfully illustrates
the role of national tradition and spheres of influence. Whereas Italy
had its spate of mad 
travellers directly after the disorder erupted in France, there was no
such diagnosis in Germany until 1898, when a doctor declared that
German psychiatry was derelict in its duty: it reported no clinical
studies of ambulatory automatism. The golden age of this disorder
began in Germany, a decade after the French one. It stopped only with
the Great War. The same is true of Russia. The Germans and Russians
were faithful Charcotians: fugues were epileptic equivalents.
Italians, on the other hand, inclined to the hysteria opinion.

<p>
Why were German-speaking doctors Charcotian, holding
<I>Wandertrieb</I> to be epileptic in nature? That leads us to the
next point, the military. A number of military doctors all over Europe
were repelled by the swingeing punishments handed down for
conscript-deserters during peacetime. So the army and navy physicians
fastened 
on automatism as a way of getting men off. Male hysteria
never had the role in the German or Slavic speaking worlds that it had
in France and Italy. By 1905, when fugue really caught on in Central
Europe, hysteria was dying, for reasons so well described by Mark
Micale.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Hence latent epilepsy was the best hook on which
the military could hang <I>Wandertrieb.</I>

<p>
Incidentally, fugue never did catch on in the English-speaking world,
despite the fame of Ansel Bourne. Bourne was a born-again preacher who
was re-born as someone else, who was not a preacher but a grocer named
Brown, somewhere else.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 He was described as a multiple
personality, not as a <I>fugueur.</I> William James and other
spiritualists interviewed him. In his Lowell lectures in 1896, James
went so far as to take ambulatory automatism as the central idea of
dissociation, with multiple personality as
peripheral--precisely the opposite of what was done, then or
now, by every other theorist of dissociation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Charcot's
lecture on ambulatory automatism was widely reported in Britain and
America, and a few cases did attract brief attention, but aside from
William James it was seldom taken seriously.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 A few
instances of what would in France have been reported as classic
ambulatory automatism were described as multiples. Two phrases readily
explain why fugue was unimportant in America: No conscript army, and
"Go West, young man." Fugue requires, as the 1994 <I>DSM-IV</I> puts
it, a home or customary place of work, or, as my epigraph from 1891
said, it requires penates. But there is a third reason. Hysteria,
epilepsy, and hystero-epilepsy all fell under the sign of degeneracy,
an especially French obsession. <b></b> The portfolio of the nineteenth
century took stock in different ways at different times. At the
beginning of the century, suicide, madness, crime, and prostitution
were favored choices, for they helped to keep down the French birth
rate, relative to that of Germany or Britain. After 1870
vagrancy--<I>vagabondage</I>--began to enter, and
by 1885 it was deemed a major social problem. To exaggerate, it became
the "universal of mental pathology, the prism through which all the
categories of 
madness and abnormality could be distributed."
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Thus
vagrancy was straight away medicalized. Vagrants were degenerates,
sure enough. And many must suffer from <I>automatisme ambulatoire.</I>
Jean-Claude Beaune has gone so far as to describe the medicalization,
and medical incarceration, of tramps and hobos as a species of
"genocide."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 The population was not literally killed, but
it was extinguished in asylums and jails.

<p>
Enter the police. In fact, Charcot's first and classic case of
ambulatory automatism had been subject to police harassment.He was a
delivery man for a company that manufactured brass ornaments. On his
first fugue, he was on a train crossing the Seine when the ticket
collector approached. Having no ticket, he jumped out of a window into
the river. He could not swim, but he was fished out and taken to a 
hospital. Within an hour he was reached by the long arm of the railway
police, demanding the fare. On his next fugue he got to the seaside,
and was there detained for some days. Because of these events Gilles
de la Tourette proposed that every person diagnosed with
<I>automatisme ambulatoire</I> should have a medical tag with clear
instructions about his disease and his home physician.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>

That was the way in which innocent deviants could be fitted into the
growing system of surveillance of an increasingly mobile public.
Notice, incidentally, how Charcot's patient was, in terms of social
class, a prototypical <I>fugueur,</I> a hard-working delivery man,
who, in his fugue state, was so shocked to find that he was travelling
without a ticket that he risked drowning over dishonor.

<p>
Those were early days, when philanthropy and concern for the patient
were paramount in the minds of the physicians. At the end of the
ambulatory automatism 
period we find a very different political philosophy of fugue. It was
stated by the head doctor at the Paris Police Prefecture and an
alienist at a mental hospital who served regularly as an expert
witness in prosecutions: "Fugue," the two men insisted, "is an
anti-social act."

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
Every individual has obligations under which he lives. From the moment
that he breaks the social contract, be it instinctively or
voluntarily, he puts himself outside legality. That is the case of the
<I>fugueur</I> who abandons his domicile, and that is why fugue is an
anti-social act.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
Then they gave a brisk distinction of fugue from the problems that had
perplexed the clinicians. Fugue is to be distinguished from
"procursive epilepsy, automatic somnambulism, alcoholic and all other
displacements which <I>are not accompanied by the disappearance of the
subject."</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 In short, the police don't care about the
medical niceties. If the person stays at home or at work, fine, no
matter what ails him. But if <b></b> he flies for whatever reason or
cause, that's fugue, it is anti-social, and subject to detention and
punishment.

<p>
Our strange topic seems not to miss a single issue of the day. Our
decade is that of the Dreyfus case, but Jews were also deemed to be a
pressing problem at a much lower stratum of society. The great pogroms
in the East sent Jews all over Europe. Albert, the first Birdhouse
<I>fugueur</I> of 1887, had been casually compared to the Wandering
Jew. (He was not Jewish.) Charcot's students, working in a public
hospital, saw many poor Jewish refugees. Charcot and his assistants
were fascinated by what they called the iconography of the mad. They
were delighted to compare representations of the insane in medieval
art with photographs prepared in their clinic. One thesis from
Charcot's clinic is rich in copies of mostly seventeenth-century
woodcuts of the Wandering Jew. "The Wandering Jew of the old prints is
indeed a true wandering Jew, none other than the wandering Jew of the
Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>


<p>
A French medical thesis consisted of an opening discussion, some
general description, a number of cases presented in clinical detail,
and a conclusion. Here we find five detailed cases, four men and a
woman. Several of them have standard 
hysterical symptoms of partial anaesthesia and restricted vision. The
overall diagnosis is hystero-neurasthenia. (Beard's American
diagnosis, neurasthenia, has recently become prominent in the clinic.)
This being Charcot's clinic, these patients could not suffer from
ambulatory automatism, which was a species of epilepsy. There is an
odd twist here, because in the course of surveying the literature,
Charcot's student decides that the patient closest to the wandering
Jews is none other than Albert, the original <I>fugueur</I> of
Bordeaux. By implication Albert did not suffer from Charcotian
ambulatory automatism--while for Pitres, quoted in my
epigraph, the hysterical Albert was the very model of ambulatory
automatism. All of which reminds us, on the side, that you can't
retain ownership of the names that you invent.

<p>
The wandering Jews in Charcot's ward were duly photographed, although
the photographs were not reproduced in the thesis. Photography is an
essential modern art. The very first multiple personality in
history--that, is with more than two distinct and diagnosed
personalities--was photographed in some ten supposed
distinct 
personality states. Albert, the first <I>fugueur,</I> appeared only as
a drawing in a thesis about him. (Medical theses had only drawings,
not photos, which explains why the thesis on wandering Jews merely
refers to the photographs taken at the Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re, but
includes many reproductions of old woodcuts.) For published
photographs of Albert we must turn to the textbook by
Pitres.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 There we see Albert as normal, as natural
somnambulist, as hypnotized, and as <I>fugueur.</I> Thus the very
first case of fugue was presented to the world with what was called an
iconography.

<p>
I should say a little more about the medical culture in which Albert
made his way. The first French double personality to be studied in
depth was F&eacute;lida X, known to hospitals in Bordeaux from 1858,
but presented as a double personality only in 1876.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 Her
doctor was Eug&egrave;ne Azam. Philippe Tissi&eacute;, who wrote up
Albert, was a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Azam's. For twenty years
Bordeaux, progenitor of double personality, also produced almost half
the roster of written-up cases of fugue, or ambulatory
automatism, <b></b> in France. The doctors there were true bourgeois.
Azam had a notable 
collection of paintings, objects from the ancient world, and local
archaeological 
discoveries. Azam and Tissi&eacute; knew each other best not as senior
and junior doctor, but because Tissi&eacute; was honorary secretary of
the Bordeaux archaeological society, over which Azam presided. It was
these thoroughly modern res, the small bourgeois collectors, who
gave us multiple personality and fugue.

<p>
It may seem a large jump to another modern instrument, the bicycle.
The bicycle has for too long been crushed between the steam locomotive
and the automobile in accounts of the modern world and its machinery.
In the 1890s the bicycle was the thoroughly modern middle-class
sporting instrument of choice. Tissi&eacute; was able to discover
<I>fugueurs</I> on bicycles. His <I>fugueurs</I> on foot often did
eighty kilometers a day; we have no endurance record for the bicycles.
But, just possibly because he was fascinated by these feats of
endurance, Tissi&eacute; made physical education, rather than
psychiatry, his forte. Not that he saw these as being distinct. He
devised a remarkable cure for severe hysteria, which involved riding
endlessly on a bicycle.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 It worked.

<p>
Another great product of modernism is the Olympic Games. There was
once a real question, fought out in the 1890s, about the nature of
sport. There was the Swedish system, which opposed competition, and
favored individual development by gymnastics. Pierre de Coubertin
famously took the opposite view, that the English (and ancient Greek)
model of competitive sport should rule. Coubertin nearly lost.

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
Tissi&eacute; was dead set against what he saw as the excesses of
competitive sport, the very elements of enthusiasm, liberty and
schoolboy association that Coubertin so vigorously endorsed. Their
rivalry grew, until, by the early '90s, they were implacable enemies,
and when Coubertin again pleaded for athletic games at a conference of
the French Association for the Advancement of Science at Caen, in
l894, Tissi&eacute; strenuously attacked him and carried the day. The
conference resolved "to encourage physical exercise, but to make war
on sports in school establishments."

<p>
Tissi&eacute;, as we all know, may have won the battle, but he lost
the war, terribly. He did, in a way, have the last, if forgotten,
word. Having trained as an alienist, he could name the mental illness
from which his opponents suffered. They were afflicted by
ludomania.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>


<p>
Middle-class travel, photography, the bicycle, and the Olympic Games
are parts of the ideas of the modern that have been too much neglected
in our concern with, for example, painting and the novel. But I had
better return to stories. Here is one about a man more prosperous than
your typical <I>fugueur.</I> Emile, a Paris lawyer aged thirty-three,
"presents all the manifest signs of hysteria." He was "almost
instantaneously hypnotizable"--he had only to be asked to
fixate on a point in space, or to hear a sharp sound (the clap of a
hand), and he would fall into hypnotic sleep. He even went into a
trance when he caught himself looking into a mirror in a caf&eacute;
by the Bourse. It was perhaps not too surprising that every once in a
while he lost his memory. "A new life, a new memory, a new me, begins.
He walks, takes the train, makes visits, buys things, gambles, etc."
Some of the events in Emile's second state were not <b></b> altogether
unrelated to events in his normal state. Thus he visited his
stepfather, with whom he had a t, before changing state on 23
September 1888. He returned to his normal state in the middle of
October. Meanwhile he had, for example, visited one of his uncles, a
bishop in Haute-Marne. There he had broken furniture, torn up books
and even manuscripts. He also incurred 500 Fr of "debts" during his
peregrinations, which led to a charge of swindling. Since no one knew
exactly where he was, he was tried and convicted in absentia. The
decision was reversed once medical 
evidence had been heard.

<p>
He did it again, and also stole a small sum of money, and was again
apprehended. Two well known expert witnesses made a favorable
deposition. The charge was dismissed. In the first incident the man
recalled, under hypnosis, that he had borrowed 500 Fr to gamble, and
he described in detail the games he had played and how he had lost.
The second incident furnished even more compelling evidence of the
power of hypnosis (and hence of the hysterical nature of the case).
Emile knew he had, before he lost consciousness in his normal state, a
wallet containing 226 Fr. It disappeared during his second state. He
had no idea where or how. Six months later, under hypnosis, he
recalled the hotel in which he had left it. Awakened, he was told to
write to that hotel, and next day he received the wallet in the mail.
Here we find what was to become the central criterion for hysterical
fugue: amnesia for or 
confused memory about the trip, which could be resolved under
hypnosis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>


<p>
This story was presented to the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences Morales
on 20 January 1890 as a case of ambulatory automatism in an hysteric.
It was thereby an anti-Charcotian case. Emile had been treated by an
eccentric Parisian alienist and 
magnetizer, Dr. J. B. Luys, but it was the highly respectable
professor of medicine and hygiene, Dr. Adrien Proust, who reported the
case. Henri Ellenberger, that exemplary and encyclopedic student of
the history of dissociation, recalls "idle talk in Madame Verdurin's
salon" about a double personality, and writes, "It is noteworthy that
this very story had been published by Marcel Proust's father, Adrien
Proust, as a significant psychopathological case."
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 That
may be pushing things, because 
ambulatory automatism, the very point (and title) of Proust's report,
is not mentioned by Marcel Proust, and the disorder had, indeed,
disappeared in France by the time Marcel Proust published the story.
For the passage occurs in <I>Le Temps retrouv&eacute;,</I> in the
voice of Dr. Cottard, who, "with the delicacy which reveals the man of
distinction," is changing the course of conversation from a
disagreeable subject. He "relates in more philosophical terms than
most physicians can command" how the trauma of a fire changed Madame
Verdurin's footman into a new man, with new handwriting and an
intolerable character that led to his being dismissed. Then, as they
moved from the dining-room to the Venetian smoking room,

<p><!--_extract--><blockquote>
Cottard told us that he had witnessed actual doublings of the
personality, giving as example the case of one of his patients whom he
amiably offers to bring to see me, in whose case Cottard has merely to
touch his temples to usher him into a second life in <b></b> which he
remembers nothing of the other, so much so that, a very honest man in
this case, he had actually been arrested several times for thefts
committed in the other 
during which he had been nothing less than a disgraceful
scamp.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

</blockquote><!--_/extract-->
<p>
Is this the specific story of Emile, reported in 1890 by Adrien
Proust? Or is it more of an amalgam? No matter. Emile himself is not a
prototypical <I>fugueur</I> because he was of the middle classes, a
lawyer. And in his fugue he was dishonest, a swindler. The
prototypical <I>fugueur</I> was an honest craftsman, artisan, clerk,
or regularly employed laborer--or a conscript. He was not
your Paris lawyer, nor was he a tramp. In his fugue state he never
stole unless it was out of necessity, a piece of food or clothing.

<p>
Hence I may return to my opening remarks. The <I>fugueur</I> is a
distorting mirror of the classier stuff that we call modern, for the
modern is assuredly bourgeois, and when modern men and women traveled
compulsively, they hired Thomas Cook &amp; Son to make the
arrangements. After a fugue the prototypical <I>fugueur</I> does not
ask, am I far from home? He does not ask, where is where? When he
wakes up he knows where, and wants to go home to family, unless
compulsion strikes again and he moves on. We do not find this humble
man in the impeccably controlled Proust, who at most frames a man,
possibly Emile, in a conversation. The <I>fugueur</I> is more a re of popular culture. His descendant appears in trashy stories as the
man who wakes up in a strange town, with no idea how he got there, but
with a train ticket in his pocket. In television thrillers his
descendant is run together with amnesia, contrary to the intentions of
<I>ICD-10.</I> I should expect <I>fugueurs</I> to occur in the
ephemeral popular writing of the 1890s, but I do not know of any. I
should be grateful to any 
reader who can direct me to examples.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>


<p>
My first and favorite <I>fugueur,</I> Albert of Bordeaux, red not
in Proust but in a popular book, complete with illustrations. He was
well worth the tale. On his greatest trip he was arrested in Moscow as
a nihilist. (How right the police of Moscow were: what is a
<I>fugueur</I> but the ultimate unwitting nihilist?) After several
months of incarceration, he was released with some three hundred
others (the remainder of his 
fellow nihilists were executed or sent to Siberia). He and his gang,
mostly Gypsies, were force-marched to the Bosphorus. That is a story
to tell elsewhere. I should like to conclude not with Albert, the
first <I>fugueur,</I> but with another man, the last of the French mad
travellers.

<p>
The last <I>fugueur,</I> as I think of him, was a compulsive deserter;
the military doctor who examined him called him a <I>deserteur
voyageur.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 I take him to be my own 
mirror image, because his routes were ones of which I am deeply fond.
His first desertion was from the barracks at Perpignan. From there he
walked over the smuggler's trails between France and Spain, a network
of glorious rocky walks in the Alb&egrave;res, the foothills of the
Pyrenees. There on a flowery slope or on a windblown outcrop you may
still encounter a nervous man who was hoping not to be seen. Today he
is more likely to be a confused Moroccan making his way gingerly
through to France than a dazed French conscript heading for the safety
of Spain.

Between 1980 and 1994 there was an intense debate among American
psychiatrists who treat dissociative disorders, as to whether amnesia
should even count among the defining conditions of multiple
personality or fugue. It was first included, then excluded, and then
reinstated as a condition for multiple personality. Such parochial
inting, which represents an unattractive internal power struggle,
should not detain us here.

David Jorawsky points out a literary use of fugue in Arthur
Schnitzler's <I>Traumnovelle</I> . There the hero
self-consciously contemplates become like a <I>fugueur:</I> "He
recalled certain strange pathological cases which he had read in books
on psychiatry, so-called double-lives. A man living in normal
circumstances suddenly disappeared, was not heard from, returned
months or years later and didn't remember where he had been during
this time" (<I>Dream Story,</I> trans. Otto P. Schinnerer [Los
Angeles: Sun &amp; Moon Press, 1990], 139). This is no simple case of
a man considering whether to feign fugue as a way of absconding,
because the hero is (ambiguously) already in a trance state.
