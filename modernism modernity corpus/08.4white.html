The First International Dada Fair held in Berlin in 1920 holds a most
significant place within the history of the 20th-century avant-garde
(<A HREF="8.4white_1.html"> 1</A>). It marks the point where
modernist practices of fragmentation, disruption and shock were aimed
directly at the German public by utilizing the strategies of contemporary
journalism and advertising. Political protest was combined with attack on
the exalted status of art, the death of which was famously proclaimed by
one placard at the exhibition. A German soldier's uniform with a pig's
head was hung from the ceiling, provoking legal action and ensuring
good tabloid coverage. The walls of the exhibition rooms were covered
with posters and banners which competed for attention with the more
traditional paintings of Otto Dix and George Grosz, although their
subject matter--crippled war veterans and urban disorder--was suitably
confrontational. Photomontage, a new medium recently seized upon by the
dadaists, was prominently placed, recycling imagery from the illustrated
press for satirical or absurd ends. And in the midst of all this could
be found a tower of found objects, newspapers, and textual fragments
assembled by Johannes Baader and known as the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I>
(<A HREF="8.4white_2.html"> 2</A>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Some objects from the Dada Fair have subsequently become museum pieces and
are now iconic images of the period, an example being Hannah H&ouml;ch's
large photomontage <I>Cut with the Kitchen Knife</I>. In fact, art
historians have slaved long and hard to identify as many of the sources
for this montage as possible and offered sustained interpretations of
it on the basis of their findings.
<SUP><A NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Baader's sculpture has a very different status, given that it did not
 survive the exhibition and is only known through

<B></B>

photographs. Even so it is widely considered to be a crucial object in
the history of modernism: "definitely the first assemblage-environment
in the history of art," for Helen Adkins, "one of the first large
assemblage-environments," according to Eberhard Roters, "an assemblage
of, until then, unparalleled proportions," in Stephen Foster's words.
<SUP><A NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 It has also been described as "the most audacious of the diverse array
 of assemblages at the <I>Dada Fair</I>" and, according to Hanne Bergius,
 it deserves a new category of its own, <I>d&eacute;montage</I>, because
 of its unique, deconstructive nature.
<SUP><A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Even though it has not been preserved, it is surprising that no similar
 attempt has yet been made to produce a close reading of Baader's
 object. It is my intention here to redress this situation so that the
 <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> might be more accurately situated within
 our current understanding of Dada and modernism in general.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first point of redress is to give the assemblage its full title,
not often quoted alongside reproductions: <I>Das gro&szlig;e
Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama: Deutschlands Gr&ouml;sse und Untergang
oder Die phantastische Lebensgeschichte des Oberdada</I>(The Great
Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama: Germany's Greatness and Decline or The Fantastic
Life of the Superdada). It did have, therefore, a very specific subject
matter. It was intended to be

<B></B>

read both as a description of recent German history and as autobiography
(Baader was known amongst his colleagues as <I>der Oberdada</I>). In
the first case the assemblage was a record of the fall of the German
empire, and in the second Baader's rise to fame. We shall see how
in both instances a departure was made from predominant models of,
firstly, history as rational progress, and secondly autobiography as
self-revelation. To the two movements which Baader aimed to represent,
decline and ascent, he gave the form of a sculptural and architectural
hybrid part tower, pyramid and spiral. The ultimate function of the
object was to be "Dada monumental architecture," and I will conclude by
considering how Baader's conception of death and remembrance was also
red in the object.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At first glance the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> appears to be totally
chaotic, an arbitrary collection of objects and texts stacked up in no
particular order. However, given the large amount of textual material
it is comprised of, it demands to be read. For its original public in
1920 there were two tools to assist them in this task. The first was
the exhibition catalogue. It described the piece as:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

 SRC="button/8.4white_3b.gif"> </A>

This draws our attention to the numbered labels attached to the
assemblage, dividing it into the sections specified. In the best
known photograph we can see numbers 1, 2, and 5. A second photograph of
unfortunately much inferior quality shows the assemblage from the reverse
angle and reveals that the number 4 was placed next to the hanging carbide
lamp (<A HREF="8.4white_3.html"> 3</A>). It is safe to surmise
therefore that 3 completed the pattern, and that the viewer was expected
to follow the numbers around in an ascending spiral. Baader imaginatively
incorporated both the floor on which the spectator stands and the empty
space above into the work. His reference to it as monumental architecture
has connotations of both commemoration and potential scale.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The key to the work that the full catalogue entry provided was further
enhanced by the appearance in the <I>Dada Almanach</I>which was published
to coincide with the end of the exhibition, of a "closer description"
of each story.
<SUP><A NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Here Baader offered various references which explain some but not all of
 the items in the assemblage. The first story, for example, connects his
 birth in 1875 to the emergence of the unified German state represented by
 Kaiser Wilhelm I's express train, erroneously misled by the assumption of
 an ever-unfolding future. Symbolically depicted, it continues traveling
 around the powder keg on a circular track until it finally explodes.
<SUP><A NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 The second story 
is 

<B></B>

intended to represent the emergence of a "collective artistic culture
. . . in the tunnel of the doomed Reich," above which appears "a museum
of masterpieces through the ages" represented in the assemblage by two
arched gateways and a mousetrap.
<SUP><A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 At the end of the tunnel stands Baader himself, seized by Platonic ideas
 which are "violating him, overpowering him," and he is only saved by the
 "spectre and outcome of the World War."
<SUP><A NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 The third and fourth stories concern the declaration of war, interpreted
 by Baader in terms of Revelations, and the war itself which he, seventy
 years before Baudrillard had the idea, declares to have been a media
 event: "a newspaper war. In reality it never existed."
<SUP><A NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 The newspapers included to represent this statement carry us on up
 to the fifth story, World Revolution, which emerges from the peace
 declared at Spa. Broadcasting into the ether via the aerial which is
 the final component of the work, Baader proclaims "the final redemption
 from suffering and death."
<SUP><A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Some items that are identifiable in the assemblage but not directly
 mentioned by Baader include, at the bottom, Raoul Hausmann's sound poems,
 cuttings from Dada journals such as Franz Jung's <I>Die Freie Strasse</I>
 (<I>The Free Street</I>), to which Baader had been a contributor,
 and at the summit an issue of <I>Die Pleite</I> (<I>Bankruptcy</I>).

"Germany's Greatness and Decline: or the Fantastic Life of the
Superdada," therefore, can be interpreted autobiographically, and it
stages a strange <I>Bildungsroman</I> which takes us from Baader's
childhood through to maturity. This is red in the object by the
transformation from Hausmann's sound poems, deliberately primitivizing
and perhaps mimicking baby talk, to the newspaper texts and their
"adult" language. That this route leads ultimately to <I>Die Pleite</I>
is an idea that will be returned to. From what we can see in the
photograph, we also have representations of Baader himself, first as
a small drawing to the right of the cog wheel with his name underneath
(<A HREF="8.4white_4.html"> 4</A>), and then in the middle left
standing next to the assemblage in the form of a tailor's dummy from whose
hand hangs the number "2" (<A HREF="8.4white_5.html"> 5</A>). The
appearance of a moustache on the latter is another means of representing
the passage of time. That this passage has now become the rejection of
reason rather than the adoption of it should not deflect from the formal
model with which Baader was playing.

Simultaneously, Baader intertwined images of the Wilhelmine empire keyed
to particular ideas of modernity. The express train already mentioned
can be understood as a reference to the rapid expansion of the railway
network under the <I>Kaiserreich</I>. Just behind the number "1"
on the assemblage, the toy train used to represent this can be seen
(<A HREF="8.4white_6.html"> 6</A>). An important policy of
the Wilhelmine government, investment in the rail infrastructure,
was brought to a grinding halt by the war, quite literally Wilhelm's
express train going nowhere. Baader may also have picked up on the use
of a similar image used by Jakob van Hoddis as the climactic line of
his 1911 poem <I>Weltende</I> (<I>End of the World</I>) which reads,
"trains tumble from bridges everywhere."
<SUP><A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Another point of reference may have been the fact that Wilhelm II, seeing
 his role in the First World War as military rather than political,
 spent much time away from Berlin near the front line. His preferred
 means of transport on these occasions was the royal train which doubled
 up as the imperial residence for much of 1914--1918.
<SUP><A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 At the summit of the assemblage is a railway carriage,
 separated from the engine down below, stranded at Spa (<A
 HREF="8.4white_7.html"> 7</A>).

 SRC="button/8.4white_8b.gif"> </A>
Between first and second story is another reference to a major Wilhelmine
construction project, the "museum of masterpieces through the ages." The
architectural fragments and mousetrap undoubtedly refer to Baader's
previous career as an architect specializing in funerary monuments,
with the <I>Mausefalle</I> (mousetrap) punning with <I>Mausoleum</I>
(<A HREF="8.4white_4.html"> 4</A>). Pinned just above to
the right, however, we find a reproduction of Dirk Bouts' <I>Christ
in the House of Simon</I>, a fifteenth-century Flemish masterpiece
which had been purchased for the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in 1904
(<A HREF="8.4white_8.html"> 8</A>). The placement of the
mousetrap/mausoleum over the tunnel cleverly refers to the construction of
the <I>Museum-Insel</I> (Museum Island) in Berlin, an ambitious attempt to
confirm the cultural as well as political significance of the new capital
city. By positioning it over an empty space, Baader satirizes its lack
of foundation both literally and metaphorically. This cultural center in
Berlin had been begun with the building of Schinkel's <I>Altes Museum</I>
(1823-1830) (to the cupola of which the shape of the mousetrap may
also allude) and the <I>Neues Museum</I> (1843-1850), but the rapid
expansion of the royal collection led to the addition of the <I>Kaiser
Friedrich Museum</I> (1898-1903) and the <I>Pergamon Museum</I>
(1909-1930), all on the same site. The last of these museums,
designed specifically to house antiquities transported from Turkey,
clearly expressed a desire to place Berlin ahead not only of national
rivals Munich and Dresden, but also other European capitals in the
arts. It was also a famous characteristic of the <I>Museum-Insel</I>
that it was bisected by a major railway line leading in and out of
Friedrichstrasse Station, and that passengers were given fleeting glimpses
of the great collections as they passed through. That the museum should
follow the railway in Baader's assemblage is a cunning reference to
Berlin topography.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Perhaps the most significant marker of modernity in the assemblage,
though, is its collection of newspapers. Baader has carefully
selected for inclusion local Berlin newspapers renowned for their "new
journalism." Prominent in the center of the construction is a copy of the
<I>Lokal-Anzeiger</I> which, as Peter Fritzsche has demonstrated, was the
first paper to bring "urban reportage" to Berlin. It was a paper through
which to understand the growing and ever more confusing metropolis:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
New arrivals depended on newspapers to find work and housing, to sell
goods and services, and to identify urban types and negotiate local
institutions. Increasingly elaborate local reportage provided readers with
sketches of homelife in tenement buildings, public life along fashionable
streets, and work discipline inside factories and department stores. Over
time newcomers--readers--filled in the blank spaces of their mental maps
of Berlin. Not to read the newspaper was to risk losing orientation.
<SUP><A NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Also prominently displayed by Baader is <I>BZ am Mittag</I>, a Berlin
tabloid founded as recently as 1904 which was sold on the street as a
"boulevard" newspaper. It takes its place alongside the Dada periodicals
some of which, such as <I>Die Pleite</I>, were also sold directly on the
streets. At the top, Baader created a signpost from newspaper cuttings:
<I>K&ouml;thener Strasse</I> in one direction, <I>Die Freie Strasse</I>
in the other (<A HREF="8.4white_7.html"> 7</A>). K&ouml;thener
Strasse is one of the roads adjoining Potsdamer Platz, Berlin's busiest
junction, which was a favorite location for journalists to linger and
report on the state of the traffic.
<SUP><A NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<B></B>

Once again, Baader integrated local topography into the assemblage,
this time connected to journalism and its role in guiding the public
through the chaos of the city.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While it is interesting to consider the significance of the newspapers
and Dada journals in regard to urban orientation, it should also be
noted that, by 1920, Baader had himself become something of a tabloid
celebrity in Berlin. One of his most infamous acts, the disruption of a
service in the Berlin Cathedral in 1918, was reported in not fewer than
three of the local Berlin papers.
<SUP><A NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 In addition to the reporting of this and other public stunts, Baader
 often played practical jokes through the Berlin press, such as the
 announcement of his death as an April fool's joke in 1919, followed up
 a little later by the notice of his resurrection.
<SUP><A NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 The <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> was itself preceded by a similar
 prank, the announcement in two Berlin papers, <I>BZ am Mittag</I> and
 the <I>Berliner-B&ouml;rsen Courier</I> of the loss of the manuscript
 of the <I>Fantastic Life of the Superdada</I>in the following absurd
 circumstances:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
While the Superdada was traveling home after his ascension on the evening
of the 13 May on the "W" train from Stettin station to Steglitz, in the
company of two angels who escort him, he left behind in the carriage
the manuscript of his Fantastic Life Story, due to be published
in five installments by Ernst Rowohlt. The finder is requested to
deliver the manuscript of the Superdada to Ernst Rowohlt Publishers,
Potsdamerstr. 123b, Berlin W.35 in return for a superdadaistic reward.
<SUP><A NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To read the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I>, then, involves understanding
how Baader had begun to live his life through the press and was no longer
interested in distinguishing

<B></B>

reality from reportage. In the assemblage, he has literally constructed
his subjectivity from tabloid journalism. In the context of the Dada
Fair, we can compare this to the appearance of another copy of the
<I>Lokal-Anzeiger</I><I>,</I> which George Grosz collaged into his
painting <I>Germany, A Winter's Tale</I> (visible in the background of <A
HREF="8.4white_1.html"> 1</A>). Here, a good <I>B&uuml;rger</I>
is depicted sitting in a caf&eacute;, drinking a glass of beer and reading
the local newspaper, oblivious to the violence and chaos surrounding
him. The newspaper is represented not as the key to interpreting social
conflict, but as escape from it; to read the <I>Lokal-Anzeiger</I> is
red by Grosz as a marker of bad faith. When exhibited at the Dada
Fair, the painting was accompanied by a large banner stating that "Dada
is Political," which confirmed Grosz's opinion that the role of Dada
should be to counter the misinformation disseminated by the press by
representing all the brutality of contemporary circumstances. Grosz's
attitude to the press was confirmed by his inclusion in a later
painting, <I>Pillars of Society</I> , of a newspaper editor
depicted alongside other instigators of the bloody repression of the
German revolution such as the clergy and the military. Once again the
banner of the <I>Lokal-Anzeiger</I> was prominently featured.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The difference in attitude between Grosz and Baader to the mass media
is indicative of the divide between the politically committed wing
of the Berlin Dada group and its rather more anarchic side. By 1920
Richard Huelsenbeck, the erstwhile leader of the Berlin Dadas, had
become distinctly irritated by Baader's self publicizing antics and
was almost certainly responsible for the stinging attack in the <I>Dada
Almanach</I>, where he described him as "a comfort-loving Swabian pastor
or petit bourgeois [who] attempts to exploit his mania for godliness
simply in order to line his pocket."
<SUP><A NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 He continued this line of criticism in his later memoirs where he again
 disparaged Baader's "psychotic exhibitionism," calling him "an itinerant
 preacher, the Billy Graham of his time, a mixture of Anabaptist and
 circus owner."
<SUP><A NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 However, Stephen Foster finds Baader's dadaism to be more radical than
 that of Grosz in that he attempted to find "an extracultural position
 from which to speak."
<SUP><A NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 This, Foster contrasts to Grosz's "more orthodox politicizing" which
 did not challenge the accepted roles of art and literature but merely
 used them in a satirical fashion. How Grosz responded to the inclusion
 of his own cover for the journal <I>Die Pleite</I>, exhibited at
 the summit of the <I>Plasto-Dio- Dada-Drama</I>, is unrecorded (<A
 HREF="8.4white_4.html"> 4</A>).
<SUP><A NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Baader's engagement with the role of the media in the construction
of reality has one final arcane reference in the assemblage. Having
transformed the Dada montage principle from a two- to a three-dimensional
experience, the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> alludes in its title to
the diorama, a form of spectacular entertainment invented in the early
nineteenth century which had been conceived by Daguerre as a challenge
to the then quite common panorama. Daguerre took the panorama's concern
for illusion or fidelity to nature and added the excitement of witnessing
a scene apparently unfolding in real time. Through clever backlighting
of a transparent painting, the spectator could enjoy "the many momentary
changes of mood which he knew so well from nature--from the hazy morning
to the clear light and from the calm beauty of a sunny day to the brooding
and stormy sky."
<SUP><A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 The "performance" of an image would last approximately fifteen minutes,
 and the audience was seated on a revolving platform so that

<B></B>

they could be turned to view a second scenario. In 1834, Daguerre devised
the "double-effect" diorama, where not only could changing light effects
be produced but, with the use of certain filters, res could be
made to appear in the scene who had at first been invisible. The craze
for such entertainment spread to London and also to Germany. The Berlin
diorama developed in a rather extraordinary way with the emergence of the
Pleorama, a kind of moving panorama. The designers of this attraction,
Carl Wilhelm Gropius and Gottfried Langhans, the latter the architect of
the Brandenburg Gate, seated the audience in a ship and took them on a
small "voyage." As Helmut Gernsheim records, "the illusion of movement
was achieved by the back-cloth slowly traversing the stage, giving the
impression of a moving viewpoint on the part of the spectator."
<SUP><A NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While these forms of moving narrative unfolding in time seem extremely
pertinent to the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I>, it is difficult to
judge what knowledge Baader may have had of them, as the diorama did
not survive much past 1850. The term has remained in common use,
especially in English, to describe any form of illusionary model
against a backdrop. German dictionaries are far less promiscuous with
their definition of the term, limiting it to either the illusionistic
show devised by Daguerre or to the building which might have housed
such an event. The Berlin diorama was in fact situated in a grand
building designed by Schinkel at the intersection of Georgenstrasse
and Universit&auml;tstrasse, midway between Friedrichstrasse and the
<I>Museum-Insel</I>directly along the route through which the railway
was driven.It is tempting to interpret this as yet another reference by
Baader to the actual topography of the city.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Furthermore, as Jonathan Crary has noted, the transition from the panorama
to the diorama is a key moment in the creation of the modern spectator.
<SUP><A NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 No sooner had the panorama broken with the traditional perspectival
 box and created a new ambulatory audience, than the diorama
 removed this freedom of movement, placing the seated viewers in
 front of a screen on which movement was depicted. Walter Benjamin's
 description of such spectacles in his notes for <I>Paris Capital of the
 Nineteenth-Century</I> conflates the two forms, a product it seems of
 his ambivalence regarding the active or passive roles adopted by the
 cinema audience.
<SUP><A NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 The dominant mode of distraction, which he identifies as the effect of
 the modernization of vision, had its parallel for him in Dada montage
 techniques. As early as 1920, Hausmann had claimed that he was producing
 a kind of cinema, and the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> does have the
 feel of a strangely inverted panorama. Instead of the spectator placed
 at the center of the world, turning to view the scene all around him,
 he now circles around an object which has attempted to collect a whole
 world in itself.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With the idea of the diorama as a scenographic unfolding narrative in
mind, we can now turn to the second main narrative which Baader invited
the audience to read into the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I>, namely his
autobiography. What I wish to pursue further now are the ways in which
this autobiography would have been understood within

<B></B>

the longstanding German tradition of the <I>Bildungsroman</I>, a
fictionalized account of the development of a subject in connection to a
cultural education. The <I>Fantastic Life of the Superdada</I> did indeed
mention a key text in this tradition, Goethe's <I>Italian Journey</I>,
a diary recording the famous author's grand tour of Italy and assimilation
of classical culture. Goethe appears in the text at the start of the third
story where he "arrives in Weimar, lays his <I>Italian Journey</I> on
teacher Hagendorf's lectern and tells the Swabian pastor [Baader himself]:
'One cannot understand a word of literature without this lectern.'"
<SUP><A NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first part of <I>Italian Journey</I> was originally published as
an appendix to Goethe's autobiography <I>Dichtung und Wahrheit</I>
(<I>Poetry and Truth</I>) and was then reprinted several times
independently. It functions as an interesting model for Baader in that
it combined travelogue with an account of personal development and
education. We have already noted how the cultural pretensions of the
Wilhelmine empire and its museum building programme are mocked in the
<I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I>, how "the museum of masterpieces through
the ages" is something that Baader depicts himself as passing through,
and how Baader uses a reproduction of a Flemish masterpiece from the
Kaiser Friedrich Museum. Goethe's <I>Wilhelm Meisters Lehrjahre</I>
(<I>Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship</I>), which founded the tradition of
the <I>Bildungsroman</I>, dealt with the artistic training of a young man
through his appreciation of the art of the past. In fact, Goethe began
to write this novel while on his Italian trip, and its development is
recorded in his diary entries, leading to an intriguing conflation of
his personality with that of Wilhelm Meister and both their simultaneous
cultural educations. This was taken up by successive imitators, such as
Ludwig Tieck's <I>Franz Sternbalds Wanderungen(The Wanderings of Franz
Sternbald</I>), which again combined travelogue with the study of Italian
and Flemish masters.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
An anecdote told by Raoul Hausmann reveals Baader's interest in another
very particular version of the <I>Bildungsroman</I>, Gottfried Keller's
<I>Der Gr&uuml;ne Heinrich</I>(<I>Green Henry</I>). Walking along the
street together one day in summer 1918, Baader suddenly informed him that
it was Keller's one hundredth birthday. Hausmann continues: "I made up my
mind at once. 'Have you got anything by Keller on you?' 'Yes, I've got
<I>Green Henry</I>.' 'Good, let's celebrate.'" Standing in the middle
of the street, the two proceeded to take turns to read from the book
"at random and read scraps of sentences with no beginning and no end,
changing our voices . . . leafing backward and forward, spontaneously."
<SUP><A NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Performing a typical dada subversion of sense, the two transformed the
 text into a form of sound poetry. The logic of the life described in the
 novel as an emotional and intellectual development was metamorphosed
 into a haphazard chain of accidents. But the text they were using was
 not only a classic <I>Bildungsroman</I>, it was also known to be again
 a thinly veiled autobiography on Keller's part. Running to four volumes
 it included all kinds of material drawn from the author's own life,
 not all of which was flattering. The novel details the ambitions of an
 artist whose quest for fame destroys his family, a story that strangely
 parallelled Baader's own neglect of his wife and children. Just as with
 his attitude to the press, Baader was ever reluctant to draw the line
 between fiction and reality.

<B></B>

In the context of the negative <I>Bildungsroman</I> that the
<I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> was, it is important to note that Baader
had experienced traumatic losses of selfhood, none more painful than
his persistent identification with the re of Christ. Although he
is perhaps the only dadaist to have been actually certified insane,
I do not wish to undertake a retrospective diagnosis of him through
his work or normalize his personality by matching it to a recognized
psychiatric condition. His testing of the boundaries of personality is
far more interesting as a cultural phenomenon and should be considered
alongside Dada's broader examination of the modern subject. In
the assemblage, Baader used a typical Dada motif in the image of
the mannequin or dummy which stands in for himself and holds the re "2" in its right hand. Mannequins
frequently appear in Dada imagery as metaphors for the rejection of
the expressionist concern for the uniqueness of the individual; they
register the dehumanizing effects of industrial society, or they signify
aspirations to what Michael Hays has called a post-humanist subjectivity.
<SUP><A NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 In the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama,</I> the mannequin features at the end
 of the second story, described in the text as "The Metaphysical Test,"
 where Baader finds himself "violated by Platonic ideas." He is rescued
 only by the appearance of "Herr von M&uuml;nchausen's beanstalk,"
 via which he climbs to the next story. In Baader's biography, this
 is the moment he published his first book, the <I>Fourteen Letters of
 Christ</I>, written in the form of a series of letters to eminent people
 signed by himself as Christ. A copy of the book is described as included
 somewhere in the lower section of the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I>,
 although it is not visible in the photographs. Significantly, he reused
 an image of the very same mannequin for a 1920 photomontage, <I>The
 Author of the Book "The Fourteen Letters of Christ" in his Home</I>. The
 outcome of "The Metaphysical Test" is the rejection of a metaphysical
 separation of the real from the apparent along with the notion of a
 stable subjectivity. The result for the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I>
 is that it cannot be seen as a self portrait so much as Baader's self-
 construction. There is no real Johannes Baader beyond the assemblage.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One final important piece of autobiographical writing should be mentioned
here which again contested the construction of the subject formulated
by the <I>Bildungsroman</I>, namely Nietzsche's <I>Ecce Homo</I>. Both
Baader and his closest associate in the Dada group, Raoul Hausmann,
were enthusiastic readers of Nietzsche, and the latter is known to have
owned a copy of <I>Ecce Homo</I>.
<SUP><A NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
The text proposes itself as a reflection back on the philosopher's life
and career giving short accounts of all his books prefaced by sections
titled "Why I am so Wise," "Why I am so Clever," and "Why I Write such
Excellent Books." It is immediately obvious that Baader's <I>Fantastic
Lifestory of the Superdada</I> follows certain traits of <I>Ecce
Homo</I><I>.</I> In the early sections of <I>Ecce Homo</I>, Nietzsche
relates his family history and childhood to the political life of Germany,
such as sharing his birthday and name with King Friedrich Wilhelm IV
of Prussia. In the opening sections of the text, Nietzsche also makes
clear that his life story is as much one of decline as progress. He casts
himself as a decadent, a <I>Doppelg&auml;nger</I> with at least two faces:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> integrates both ascent and decline
in its ostensible subject matter: the fall of the German empire, and
the rise of the Superdada. It also makes use of the spiral form curving
around the tower or pyramid structure to signify these two movements. At
the summit stands the banner of <I>Die Pleite</I>, but we are asked
to imagine the cylinder revolving endlessly into the ether. Baader
found a form to accommodate the dual movements present in Nietzsche's
philosophy; the linear passage from man to superman, and the cycle
of eternal recurrence. The first term takes an evolutionary model,
the second a circular one. The spiral, as movement without progress,
fits perfectly with the antirational nature of this dynamic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In <I>Thus Spake Zarathustra</I>, Nietzsche introduced eternal
recurrence as a deconstruction of idealist interpretations of history as
teleology. Central to the same book is the doctrine of the superman as
destiny of mankind. How the two might be compatible has created problems
in Nietzsche scholarship ever since. However, in the prologue to the
book, Nietzsche has Zarathustra state quite clearly that the passage to
the superman is both a "going-across" and a "down-going."
<SUP><A NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Similarly, eternal recurrence has no status in Nietzsche's writings as a
 cosmological explanation of existence. Rather, he is interested in the
 psychological burden of repetition. These notions are red in the
 <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> by the express train "erroneously misled
 by an assumption of an ever-unfolding future" and, in the second story,
 "the wheel of events (for furthering the transformation of the round
 by means of new lives--albeit still tied to the wheel)."
<SUP><A NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Baader was not alone in using the spiral as a re for the active
nihilism summoned up by Nietzsche's thinking. The architect Henry van
de Velde was commissioned by Elisabeth F&ouml;rster-Nietzsche to build
the Nietzsche Archive in Weimar in 1902-1903, and he spent the next
years devising plans for a Nietzsche temple and monument for the same
location. One of the surviving drawings shows how he planned to use
a section of <I>Thus Spake Zarathustra</I> entitled <I>The Way of the
Creator</I> as an inscription on the monument, a text which praises the
solitary artist who places himself above the law, beyond good and evil:
"Are you a new strength and a new right? A first motion? A self-propelling
wheel? Can you also compel stars to revolve around you."
<SUP><A NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 The only decorative element van de Velde conceived for the monument
 was the inscribed motif of a spiral on a square base expressing the
 movement described in the text which is, once again, dynamic without
 being progressive. The significance of the number five for the stories
 of the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> is that the spectator is lead around
 the square base and returns to the side where he began.

A few commentators on the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada Drama</I> have made the
connection between it and Baader's earlier career as an architect who
specialized in mausoleums

<B></B>

and funereal architecture.
<SUP><A NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 As noted earlier, the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada Drama</I> was to be considered
 "Dada monumental architecture" and it contained numerous references to
 recent building programs in Berlin. The image of a tower or pyramid that
 it conjures up is very much connected to his earlier visionary projects
 such as the <I>Cosmic Temple Pyramid</I> which he planned in 1906 (<A
 HREF="8.4white_9.html"> 9</A>). This unfeasible construction of
 colossal size (1000m wide at the base and 1500m high) was to contain
 "free universities, libraries and archives, modern world museums and
 world collections, arenas and plazas for international games, music
 festivals and dramas, public parks, pilgrimage centers, garden cities,
 and villas and gardens and forests and fields and mountains and meadows
 and steams and lakes and rivers and the sea."
<SUP><A NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 The pyramid was the ultimate collection of world culture and knowledge,
 a <I>Gesamtkunstwerk</I> of astonishing ambition. It was also, as Baader
 conceded, "a new Tower of Babel," an image I would suggest is preserved
 in the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada Drama</I><I>.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Baader's response to modern architecture appears to have been drawn
largely from the satirical writer Paul Scheerbart. From the 1890s onwards,
Scheerbart had been developing in his blackly comic novels the image of
a new fantastic architecture of color and glass. Combining apocalyptic
with utopian themes, he dreamt of crystal palaces set on mountain tops
constructed through the force of sheer genius. He appears in Baader's text
in the third story: "Paul Scheerbart pulls up in a coach of crystal and
lies down--as a bomb--beside the dusty crate of architecture," possibly
a reference to

<B></B>

Scheerbart's death in 1915.
<SUP><A NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Baader is reputed to have known him well, and it is likely that he was
 mimicking the megalomaniacal characters of Scheerbart's novels when he
 appointed himself President of the Globe.
<SUP><A NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Scheerbart had also come up with the vision of the Earth as a star,
 <I>Der Stern Erde</I>, which Baader used in his later cosmologies. Baader
 also took over Scheerbart's adoption of a monistic philosophy and
 rejection of the Christian explanation of death, an idea which has
 interesting implications for the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I>. As
 mentioned before, the fifth story is not conceived by Baader as the end
 of the narrative. Above it he imagines the cylinder soaring into the
 sky from which he broadcasts "into the ether the final redemption from
 suffering and death." The spiral form of the assemblage is important
 for developing its energy to continue ever upwards, spinning by force
 of its own momentum. The inspiration for this idea may well have been
 derived from Scheerbart's 1910 novel <I>Das Perpetuum Mobile</I>, which
 recounts in first person form the attempts of its narrator to invent a
 machine which conserves all of its energy and keeps moving eternally. As
 he steadily approaches bankruptcy, the narrator fantasizes more and more
 on the potential of such a device to solve all the world's problems,
 but also to conquer death as we know it, finally introducing the image
 of the Earth Star as the ultimate perpetuum mobile.
<SUP><A NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Hanne Bergius, in her account of Baader's family history, tells us that
 his father was a carpenter who went bankrupt in 1891 after neglecting
 his work in favor of trying to build a similar device. Once again we
 are faced with a blurring of the lines between reality and fiction, as
 Scheerbart could have taken the plot of his book from Baader's own life.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Finally, it has not gone unnoticed that the form of the
<I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> bears an uncanny similarity to Tatlin's
<I>Monument to the Third International</I>, both in its tower form and the
dynamic rotational aspect. There is no evidence to suggest that Baader may
have seen a photograph of the model that Tatlin had recently completed,
but a written description of Tatlin's project had been published in
Germany shortly before the opening of the Dada Fair. Konstantin Umanskij's
<I>Neue Kunst in Russland1914-1919</I> has long been acknowledged
as the source for the placard displayed at the fair of "Die Kunst ist
tot--Es lebe die neue Maschinenkunst Tatlins" ("Art is dead--long live
Tatlin's new machine art"), but the text also commented on the enormous
scale of Tatlin's project and his plans for it to contain a radio station,
cinemas, telegraph and space for art exhibitions.

 <IMG ALT=""#660066" re 10. " ALIGN="LEFT"
 SRC="button/8.4white_0b.gif"> </A>

The synchronicity between Baader and Tatlin may also be explained by
their common adoption of the Eiffel Tower as image of modern engineering
and architectural ambition. While this may be rather more literal in
Tatlin's case, it is interesting to note Baader's incorportation of
Henri Rousseau's <I>Self-Portrait</I> into the collage <I>Club der Blauen
Milchstrasse</I> of 1920 (<A HREF="8.4white_0.html"> 10</A>).
<SUP><A NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Here, Raoul Hausmann's face has been inserted in place of Rousseau's
 and the famous background, which included the Eiffel Tower, has been
 partially covered over by Baader's leaflet protesting against the
 constitution of the Weimar republic and declaring himself President
 of the Globe. Also included in the collage is a reproduction of the
 <I>Cosmic Temple Pyramid</I> in the top left hand corner, and in the
 lower right a flyer explaining the significance of the <I>Handbuch</I> 

<B></B>

<I>des Oberdadaismus</I>, Baader's version of the Bible. On the right
of the collage, emanating from behind Hausmann/Rousseau, and where we
would have originally seen the Eiffel Tower, is a cone reaching up into
the heavens and to a cosmological ying/yang symbol. In the same way that
Tatlin attempted to make the <I>Monument to the Third International</I>
calendric and astronomically aligned, both he and Baader produced readings
of the Eiffel Tower that were thoroughly utopian rather than concerned for
the practical engineering possibilities. This was to be architecture that
could relieve mankind from the alienation of urban life by reconnecting
it to the cosmos rather than increase its disempowerment in the face
of technology.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Furthermore, as we trace the passage of communication in the
<I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> from phonetics to journalism, we should
not forget the aerial at the summit that would transform these words
into radio signals that could be broadcast into the ether. The Eiffel
Tower was used in its earliest years for meteorological experiments and
as a giant aerial. Tatlin took up the theme to suggest that the message
of international communism could be broadcast from his colossal tower
across otherwise insurmountable boundaries. If Baader's monument is
viewed as a pyramid and his background as a designer of mausoleums is
borne in mind, then it may be that the route of the spiral is meant
to suggest the transformation of matter into invisible energy. Given
that we have been obliged to consider this as Baader's autobiography,
the <I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> becomes a tomb which will preserve
his presence after his death. However, its ephemeral nature contradicts
everything that a tomb should be; instead we

<B></B>

are left with the conclusion that Baader is commenting on his own
transformation into a trail of newspaper headlines, into a set of
references in the media--into what he has in fact become almost half a
century after his death.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We have clearly seen that beyond its reputation as the
largest, most audacious assemblage of the 1920 Dada Fair, the
<I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> was also an object loaded with meaning
rather than the unintelligible heap it has previously been taken
to be. Moreover, it was aimed at a very particular urban audience,
the tabloid reading Berliner, and used visual strategies adopted from
montage that related very specifically to the presentation of narrative
in new media such as film. Spatial and temporal narratives connected the
assemblage to the topography of the city center and represented the manner
in which the contemporary subject navigated it. Most importantly, the
<I>Plasto-Dio-Dada-Drama</I> presented itself a <I>perpetuum mobile</I>
not because it actually moved, but because it was projected into the
future as an object through which Baader would be remembered. If the
main message of the Dada Fair has been read until now as the death of
art, the staging of the death of the author and his resurrection as a
media construction which Baader enacted through this assemblage will
ultimately be seen as far more radical.

In the notes accompanying the recently translated version of the <I>Dada
Almanach</I> it is suggested that the division into five stories parodies
"Spengler's <I>Decline of the West</I>, in which the history of mankind
is divided into five developmental stages." (Malcolm Green, ed., <I>Dada
Almanac</I> [London: Atlas Press, 1993], 98). I am certain that Spengler
is one of Baader's reference points but <I>The Decline of the West</I>
uses period divisions of four (world history as the seasons) or three
(preculture, culture and civilization).

The montage of Hausmann's face onto Rousseau's <I>Self-Portrait</I> was
first carried out by John Heartfield and George Grosz in 1920 which they
titled <I>Corrected Self-Portrait</I>. It is one of a series of games
concerning authorship amongst the Berlin Dadas at the time. Hausmann
was himself responsible for using Grosz's profile for the montage <I>The
Art Critic</I>, also of 1920, which was then stamped with Grosz's name
into the bargain. The reappropriation of Grosz and Heartfield's montage
by Baader further complicates the issue.
