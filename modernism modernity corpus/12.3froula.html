Unlike many speakers at memorial panels this past year, I did not know Hugh Kenner personally or work with him as a student. But I knew him. When <i>The Pound Era</i> appeared in paperback in 1973, I invested in it on my starveling student budget and read it, riveted, transported, from the stunning Gaudier-Brzeska panther crouched on the cover to the very last page. Of all the intellectual experiences that shaped my decision to center my scholarly work on modernist art and thought, <i>The Pound Era</i> was one of the most immediate. It helped impel me toward my early work on the manuscripts and texts of Ezra Pound's <i>Cantos,</i> and it played a role in my first academic appointment. During my MLA interview with a large half-circle of English department faculty from the University of Alabama, their chair asked what I thought of <i>The Pound Era.</i> "Oh," I said, "it's full of amazing moments," and gave for example the song from <i>Cymbeline,</i> "Fear no more the heat o' the sun"&#x02014;its last lines, "Golden lads and girls all must, / Like chimney sweepers, come to dust," lit up as if by an illuminator's brush by Kenner's anecdote (via William Arrowsmith and Guy Davenport) about the twentieth-century Warwickshire denizen who blew the head off a dandelion saying, "We call these golden boys chimneysweepers when they go to seed." My interviewers seemed to share my delight in the critical sensibility that could so deftly weave this trouvaille of Elizabethan local knowledge into a modernist cultural history&#x02014;at least, nobody asked me what it had to do with Pound or modernism, and I got the job.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
I could have called up any number of such moments in <i>The Pound Era:</i> the photograph of San Zeno's column in Verona, its carved words "Adaminus . . . me fecit" glossing a line in <i>The Cantos</i>; the tracing of poetic affinities from Li Po and other Chinese poets through French Jesuit missionaries to Thoreau, Emerson, Ernest Fenollosa with Japanese scholars Mori and Ariga, and, through the chance gift of Fenollosa's papers, Pound; the dazzling exposition of Pound's and Aldington's translations of Sappho's broken papyri; the red-weskited Henry James inquiring of Pound whether his bride, Dorothy Shakespear, was "a compatriot?" and more. Parlaying Pound's poetics of the luminous detail into a critical method that sets the significant detail in its historical surround, Kenner inaugurated a new historicism <i>avant la lettre</i> for an international, multidisciplinary modernism that, like Gaudier's crouched panther, now seemed to leap from its New Critical cage into history, its own and ours. At the same time, one could resist Kenner's grand literary historical claim, instead seeing in <i>The Pound Era</i> a provocative illustration of Paul de Man's theoretical point that "what we usually call literary history has little or nothing to do with literature" while "what we call literary interpretation&#x02014;provided only it is good interpretation&#x02014;is in fact literary history."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
That was not all I knew about Hugh Kenner as I sat talking with my MLA interviewers. Through my research in the Ezra Pound Archive at Yale's Beinecke Library on <i>The Cantos'</i> text&#x02014;one of the most complex editorial challenges in twentieth-century English literature, not excluding <i>Finnegans Wake</i>&#x02014;I had learned that Kenner and the German scholar Eva Hesse had formed an ad hoc editorial committee to recommend changes for the New Directions text. Many of these changes had actually been made, notwithstanding that Pound was too old and ill to approve them; that the editorial committee had no clear policy or principles, no systematic method or procedures; and that their working assumption that <i>The Cantos</i> ought to be "correct" with respect to its sources did not comport with Pound's own stance toward error in his poem.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  In <i>The Pound Era</i> Kenner fondly evokes these impressionist editorial endeavors: "Fantastic and great men loom in time's mists. As we edit and annotate them (for the Early English Texts Society perhaps) we funnel time's romance through the very printing houses whence newspapers issue" (<i>TPE,</i> 24). In funneling time's romance through the New Directions presses, Kenner and Hesse introduced a new dimension of substantive error into Pound's text. Yet in doing so they contributed to a contemporary rethinking of bibliographical studies that shook that seemingly staid and rock-solid discipline's foundations. As my adviser Jerome McGann (then Kenner's colleague at Hopkins) and I soon understood, Kenner and Hesse's editorial interference in <i>The Cantos'</i> text foregrounded not just local problems of editorial method but deeper questions about conceptions of textual authority that helped to revitalize editorial theory in its complex relation to historical and social conditions, conceptions of authorship, and pedagogic, critical, and readerly practices.
</p>

<p>
Alarming as it was, as a young graduate student facing a job market no more promising then than today, to find oneself possessed of the awful knowledge that Hugh Kenner had made a big, a really big, mistake, Kenner's editorial romancing of the fantastic great man who was our common subject had given my countless hours of drudgery 

<b></b>

in the Beinecke a tremendous payoff. For (wondering how to put it) I slowly came to see that Kenner's guiding epistemological assumption that Pound's text <i>ought</i> to be correct with respect to its (presumed) sources, <i>ought</i> to be a locus of curricular and historical authority for its readers, entailed an unexamined, perhaps even unconscious moral assumption about the nature of the poet's authority&#x02014;<i>one that Pound himself did not share,</i> that the conditions of modernist aesthetic creation contradict, and that <i>The Cantos</i> itself silently discredits. As I pondered the gaps between Pound's and his editors' stances toward error in his "poem including history"&#x02014;a history inseparable from error as from epic wandering (<i>errare</i>)&#x02014;I came to see that error, chance, fallibility, divagation are inwoven in Pound's epic "record of struggle" in ways that illuminate the historical conditions of modern art and thought; and that to embrace modernity is to relinquish illusions of certainty, to make one's wandering way in the world unguided by any "Aquinas-map." Kenner's errors, in short, proved no less illuminating than the myriad things great and small that he got inimitably right. When I reflect now on the accidental gift of his editorial forays, I see that no small consequence of that gift was having to think for myself&#x02014;being forced to do so by the facts of the case. If great scholars often inspire a certain transferential awe, for me Hugh Kenner was a great teacher not only because of his brilliant exposition of <i>The Cantos</i> and its era but because his own work freed me to understand its limits.
</p>

<p>
To take an example near to hand: in her talk in Vancouver, Marjorie Perloff reported that her early appreciation of Woolf was derailed by Kenner's derisive treatment of Bloomsbury in <i>A Sinking Island.</i> Whether inoculated by Kenner's editorial misadventures, too deep in my own reading of Bloomsbury to be much interested in the clever-schoolboy mockeries of that astonishingly bad essay, or just lacking in the gene for hero-worship, I am so far immune to the influence Marjorie describes as (in the interest of full disclosure) to have just published a book titled <i>Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Avant-Garde: War, Civilization, Modernity.</i> Was Kenner avenging himself on Oxbridge, as Marjorie suggested? fending off a challenger to the Pound era? Certainly his attack recalls the red-faced professor in <i>A Room of One's Own</i> whose monumental <i>The Mental, Moral, and Physical Inferiority of the Female Sex</i> reads "as if he were killing some noxious insect," making Woolf wonder why he is so angry. ("Could it be his wife? . . . Was she in love with a cavalry officer?")<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  It betrays more than a little anxiety about the burgeoning reputation of a modernist genius he can contemplate only as mired in "depression and lifelong guilt," whose work, he makes clear, he has not read and need not, since much of it "can't even be read" (<i>ASI,</i> 167, 179). "Save for Maynard Keynes's <i>The Economic Consequences of the Peace,</i>" he writes, "Bloomsbury writing implied little direct awareness that the war had happened" (<i>ASI,</i> 164). That Woolf created war veteran Septimus Warren Smith, that Joyce "cursed" and vivisected "the system which had made [his mother] a victim,"<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  that both were Ibsen's heirs&#x02014;such aspects of modernism were lost on Kenner, who coyly makes <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> out to be an effete afterimage of Dorothy Sayers sans "the vulgarity of a sleuth" ("why did Septimus take that fatal plunge?") (<i>ASI,</i> 178). In prose bristling unnaturally with exclamation points he excludes this "gifted vulnerable woman" from "the great critics," 

<b></b>

marvels that "she lasted fifty-nine years to fuss so tensely over so much paper," and finds in Leonard's collection of her essays, Quentin Bell's indispensable biography, and the (superb) scholarly editions of her diary and letters a dark conspiracy: "It all amounts to an assertion she'd not have made, that she was her time's regnant sensibility" (<i>ASI,</i> 165, 169, 166). Who wouldn't wish that this well-known Canadian mathematician and conjurer of fantastic great men lost in time's mists had quit while he was ahead?
</p>

<p>
Yet if <i>A Sinking Island</i> flaunts the limitations that prevent some of us from ranking Kenner with the greatest twentieth-century critics&#x02014;Eliot, Pound, Woolf, Auerbach&#x02014;even his failures have been salutary for modernist studies. At our Vancouver roundtable, Suzette Henke recalled an early Dublin Joyce conference where Bonnie Kime Scott addressed a question about Molly Bloom to Kenner&#x02014; "and he simply could not hear her." Frustration at being unheard aside, what could be more generative of important work than to find a critic of Kenner's eminence promoting a position with which one utterly disagrees? What better provocation to get the issues on the table, focus the argument, make clear its urgency, think critically where Kenner inclined to intuitive leaps? Our newer readings of Molly Bloom owe something to the self-revealing blindnesses of Kenner and the Thirty Shilling Whore school. So too Kenner's early take on <i>Ulysses</i>&#x02014;incoherent if ingenious, and highly influential&#x02014;conjures a conservative Joyce at the radical Stephen's expense by deriving an ironic distance between author and character from Joyce's presumed religious politics&#x02014;a position as yet only indirectly rebutted, though Kenner himself reportedly repudiated it.
</p>

<p>
As I think what I most wish to honor in Kenner's work, the famous aphorism of that great modernist Mies van der Rohe comes to mind: "God is in the details." At its best&#x02014;as in Kenner's masterpiece, <i>The Pound Era</i>&#x02014;his fine and supple exposition moves between significant details and the great issues they unforgettably illuminate. At its best, so does ours, however different our analytic modes and the understanding of modernism they yield. Kenner mapped an international modernism; we contest and refine those maps of an inexorably shrinking world. In some ways our critical radar is more sophisticated, more worldly, in Said's sense: attuned to a wider frequency range, registering issues of class, gender, ethnicity, race in sharper, subtler detail. Yet both moments in the reception of Anglo-American modernism, Kenner's and ours, resonate with Fenollosa's vision of a twentieth century that "not only turns a new page in the book of the world but opens another and a startling chapter. Vistas of strange futures unfold for man, of world-embracing cultures half-weaned from Europe, of hitherto undreamed responsibilities for nations and races."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  For many of my generation, the Kenner of <i>The Pound Era</i> unveiled a modernism little known and very much untamed: awesome in the beauty and daring of its artifacts, inextricably rooted in its historical moment yet still so new as to seem almost pristine, everything remaining to be understood. If this impresario-magician could no more keep from projecting his shadow upon the objects of our common fascination than we can ours, we can only wish that our own errors and prejudices might prove half as fruitful as his.
