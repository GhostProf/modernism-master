1 Introduction
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Georg Klaus (1912-1974), a philosopher and cybernetician from East
Germany, is not a re whose scientific legacy is celebrated today. He
directed the Institute of Philosophy of the East Germany Academy of
Sciences, worked on developing a Marxist semiotics and cybernetics,
influenced East German economic reform in the 1960s, and supported the
development of a microelectronics industry, the only one to develop
significantly in the eastern bloc outside the Soviet Union.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
This is an impressive list of achievements, especially when one considers
the five years from 1933 to 1939 he spent as a political prisoner, two
of them in the Dachau death camp, for organizing Communist resistance
in upper Bavaria, his compulsory Wehrmacht service on the Eastern Front,
and, multiply wounded, his internment as a prisoner of war in Belgium.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
But they remain negligible achievements in the sense that the entire
social legacy of the German Democratic Republic remains negligible after
the cold war. The GDR failed on certain persuasive scales of modernity:
it did not create a state based on popular legitimation, it did not
accumulate the material wealth to challenge the liberal industrial
model of development in the West, and it did not set new standards for

<b></b>

the quality of life. Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen caution that "When
standards are chosen to assess the quality of life of people in different
parts of the world one has to ask whose views as to the criteria should
be decisive. Should we . . . look to the local traditions of the country. . . or should we, instead, seek some more universal account of good
human living . . . ?"
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
Regarded locally or universally, the GDR offers little by way of new
standards, hence the nearly unanimous judgment on its failure, and the
oblivion to which someone like Georg Klaus is assigned.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
I want to give the GDR a closer look, however, and understand it not as
establishing new criteria, but as demonstrating something important about
the limits of the criteria of modernity that decided (on) the outcome
of the cold war and now seem so self-evident. These are such familiar
criteria as openness, pluralism, experimentalism and incrementalism,
the same criteria warily celebrated by Max Weber as constitutive of the
disenchanted modern world view and emphatically celebrated by Karl Popper
as the bulwark of the open society.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
In particular, the GDR helps us to see that the criteria that were
efficient causes in determining the cold war outcome have to be subtly
distinguished from the criteria by which that outcome was subsequently
judged as valid or just, and that those latter criteria cannot comprehend
and supercede the distinctions relevant to the former.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Whether or not the GDR's standards for building and assessing a modern
quality of life fit Nussbaum and Sen's view of universality, they were
on the face of it congruent with the standards of the West&#8212;what
was different was the social complex whose function was to maximize
over those recognizable standards. The qualitative rupture that bisected
cold war modernity into first and second worlds took place at the level
of operative totality that I call, in reference to the cybernetic and
systems theoretical traditions, "the system." The challenge that GDR
modernity posed&#8212;and as a historical legacy still poses&#8212;is
not the challenge of alternate criteria per se, but of understanding
how roughly the same criteria could refer to two distinct systems of
modernity and to the qualitative difference between those systems.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
In a manner suggestive for the way I am addressing the specific problem
here, Walter Benjamin once asked whether, after translating from one
language into another, a translator could ever hope to find a third
language in which the difference between the two translations could
itself be translated.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
Likewise, the res I am looking at, Georg Klaus, and the most
analytically imaginative of East German creative writers, Franz
F&uuml;hmann (1922-1984), are not concerned with the empirically achieved
and measurable quality of daily life in East Germany, but the possibility
of apprehending an underlying qualitative difference between their system
and that of the West, where their system res for them as both present
actuality (<i>energeia</i>) and future potential (<i>dynamis</i>).
<p>
The problem of whether standards can ever do justice to qualitative
difference, one of the most characteristic intellectual challenges in
a centrally planned socialist culture, first emerges in the simple and
powerful formulation of Plato's <i>Protagoras</i>.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
Inquiring into the possibility of living a consistent, holistic
good life&#8212;a well-ordered life, where well-ordering implies the
commensurable ranking and coordination of priorities&#8212;Socrates
describes the paradox of <i>akrasia</i>: if I am offered a choice between

<b></b>

two goods, where one is apparently greater than the other, would I not
always choose the greater good?
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
Yet one can imagine cases where I might choose, say, one glass of wine
over another more ample one, because I like the way it reflects the
light. Plato resolves the paradox by explaining my choice as submission
to weakness, or <i>akrasia</i>, because the light, an extrinsic,
incommensurable quality, has distracted me from ranking my priorities
with respect to a disciplined discernment of the greater and lesser good
of comparable values. A science of measurement (<i>metretike techne</i>)
would allow people to make reasonable, far-sighted choices consistently
in their own and society's best interests by bringing all possible
choices into relation with each other on a common yardstick and thus
allowing for a rational ethical decision.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>

<p>
One socialist version of this classical problem might be apparent. In
a state organized around a planned economy, a science of measurement
by which individual desires are rationally and ethically coordinated
would surely give the planners and their economy an edge over the
non-scientifically organized capitalist competition. The version of the
problem that concerns us here, however, is more existential. If there
is a commensurability of values across modernity, in East as in West,
socialism as in capitalism, is there room for a qualitative difference
between the two systems, and how would one recognize or describe that
quality in the standardized terms of commensurability? If there is no
common yardstick supplied by modernity, then are there rational means
for each system to establish its own qualitatively unique measure? And,
finally, if each system somehow fosters its own valid measure, is there
ever any reasonable way to choose among them, or are disjunctions between
systems presentable only in terms of sovereignty and force?
<p>
The thesis I propose is that a modernity other than that embodied
by the West is possible, one whose values set a reasonable standard
for its own self-description, but which at the systemic level is
separated by incommensurate elements from the familiar modernity
that serves as the proving ground for our common sense decisions
today. The emphasis on distinct modernities is important here, because
it suggests that a consensus around rational, open, experimental,
i.e., modern, categories is not enough to ensure peaceful transitions
between systems and rational communication about rival values. Rather,
material or qualitative differences will persist as dynamic disequilibria
that always threaten force, without necessarily entailing its violent
application. To demonstrate this thesis I will look at the once parallel,
now <i>ex</i>-modernity of socialism as it was conceived and questioned
by Klaus and F&uuml;hmann in the GDR of the 1960s and early 1970s. This
late modernity did not succeed in setting new criteria by which it
could operate as a system with autarchy, complexity and the potential
to reproduce itself and its own way of seeing and parsing the world. But
to establish my thesis I am content to suggest that socialism's culture,
haunted by the insufficiency of its difference from the West, momentarily
attested to the non-uniqueness of modernity by raising, in a rational
idiom, deep problems about organizing society that are compelling,
but largely invisible, to our own. Furthermore, since the end of the
cold war and the demise of the eastern bloc, the issue of qualitative
discontinuities between systems has refused to disappear in a liberal
narrative of the end of history and

<b></b>

perpetual peace.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
As the problem of qualitative difference has reemerged in social
relations, discourses of rational commensurability&#8212;concerning,
for example, technology-driven globalization, representative democracy
or international law&#8212;have been supplemented by those of sovereignty
and force.
<p>
The non-uniqueness of modernity is a fundamental paradox for a
technical-rational thought, hence the haunting pain of socialism's
double vision of itself in its difference from the West. For modernity,
if it is equal to its own description as open and experimental, is
a superlative of social evolution, and the superlative is always a
definite singular. According to Popper, the cold war's most eminent
theoretician of science and society, modernity's openness is epitomized
by its restless falsification of all its provisional truth claims,
leaving only the best standing.
<p>
Modernity in the rational, progressivist account drops what fails
and selects what succeeds, describing the latest and best we have: the
optimum, if not the <i>optimum optimorum</i>, for the world. If socialism
was also a rational modernity, then it was somehow once contemporaneous
with the present singular modernity from which we survey our globe today;
it was, then, also once a superlative of time and space, the latest and
the most forward. Not an "insimultaneity of time" in Ernst Bloch's famous
formulation for the imbrication of old and new worlds, but precisely a
"simultaneity," simultaneous and sharply distinct.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
It then bears asking how a position&#8212;an x, y, z at time
<i>t</i>&#8212;that claims for itself the singularity of the most
advanced and fitting could have been shared by an x', y', z' at time
<i>t</i>' that makes the same legitimating claim?
<p>
Lest I be taken as appealing to too narrow and rationalist a definition
of modernity in defining its singular, progressive path, even so forceful
a critic of logical positivism and scientific reductionism as Edmund
Husserl argued that "to be human at all is essentially to be a human
being in a socially and generatively united civilization; and if man
is a rational being, it is only insofar as his whole civilization is a
rational civilization . . . ." European modernity must bear within it,
according to Husserl, "an absolute idea, rather than being merely an
empirical anthropological type like 'China' or 'India,'" or, I might add,
like the East or West bloc.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
Can two or more proper modernities then be thinkable, coordinated within
by the same rational values, but separated from each other by a gap
that cannot be described, let alone forded, in accordance with those
values? Are there questions that socialism&#8212;that is, modernity
<i>prime</i>&#8212;asks of itself that are as universal as they are
untranslatable into the circumstances, if not the idiom, of our most
contemporaneous present? Can this briefly multiplied modernity&#8212;the
existential possibility of a radically different way of answering our
same urgent questions&#8212;ever be resolved back into a single immanent
process, into a single open community of reason and transparency, or does
modernity prime always haunt our progress as an invisible road not taken?

2 Cybernetic mathematization and qualitative leaps
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In 1961 at a crucial turning point for an industrial world already divided
into two hostile cold war blocs, East German Party chief Walter Ulbricht
ordered the erection

<b></b>

of the Berlin Wall. With this sharp demarcation of East and West German
sovereignty, Ulbricht's Politb&uuml;ro felt that East Germany at last
had the breathing room it needed to build socialism, and proceeded to
encourage a reformist spirit to experiment with organizations capable
of maximizing the GDR's potential for innovation.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
In 1963 the Council of Ministers announced "Guidelines for the
New Economic System of Planning and Managing the People's Economy"
(NES). Over the next seven years, until Ulbricht was deposed by Erich
Honecker in 1971, the state repeated that "the fundamental task that
our Party, the GDR working class, and its allied classes must solve is
mastering the socialist economy and the scientific-technical revolution."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
Associated with this revolution was not just the development of new
engineering cadre, technological processes and industrial machinery,
but the scientific organization of production, exchange, administration,
education and politics in a socialist society.
<p>
This task of coordinating society on a new basis ultimately fell to the
emerging information science of cybernetics to solve.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
The use of cybernetics for this purpose is not obvious, because
cybernetics&#8212;a science first developed in the 40s and 50s in the
U.S. by Norbert Wiener and John von Neumann&#8212;implied to many critics
in the socialist world an abandonment of the Marxist vision of a practice
based in the experience of class struggle in favor of "system-neutral,"
"value-free" technocratic reason.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
The rivalry between technical and political rationality for preeminence
in shaping socialist society was bitter. The eventual acceptance of
cybernetics by the Party hierarchy in the mid-1960s meant that social
subsystems would in principle be left to find their own efficient means
of developing and coordinating themselves, and would not rely on steering
mechanisms based outside the feedback loops of system optimization;
would not, that is, rely on ideologically governed Party decisions,
but on self-generated information.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
The buzz words for ascendant cyberneticians were "self organization,"
"self reproduction," "automatic steering," "automatic coordination," and
"goal orientation"&#8212;not exactly comforting words to ideologically
oriented functionaries.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>

<p>
In the entry for "goal orientation" ["Zielstrebigkeit"] in the 1969
<i>Dictionary of Cybernetics</i>, Georg Klaus, then the director of
the Institute for Philosophy at the Academy of Sciences, notes that
"if we could observe just the effect of disruptions and the oscillation
of system values around the target state (goal), it would be impossible
to decide whether the coordination mechanism were a mechanical element
or whether its functions were being exercised by a human-being."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
This definition refers to Alan Turing's pioneering essays on artificial
intelligence in which a machine has the capacity not only to reproduce
itself, but to evolve to a higher level.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
Klaus elaborates the definition by contrast to the Aristotelian
teleological doctrine that he sees cybernetics as superceding,
holding that a dynamic system is capable of realizing a potential
(<i>dynamis</i>) not observed, measured or caused by its current
state (<i>entelecheia</i>, <i>energeia</i>), but constructed solely
through the reciprocal causality of system and environment (see:
"Wechselwirkung"). With the Berlin Wall buffering it from overwhelming
disruption by a hostile environment, Klaus and his allies in the
Politb&uuml;ro hoped that the cybernetic "black box" of the New Economic
System would not only run smoothly, but evolve intelligently toward an
interactive goal of ever more simply organized complexity,

<b></b>

GDR subsystems regulating themselves according to their adaptive dynamics
(see: "selbstt&auml;tige Regelung"). As the entry on "Trial and Error"
notes: "many organic cybernetic systems have failed because they did
not have time to reach an adaptation."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
Cement Wall and cybernetic reform promised socialism that adaptive time.
<p>
Alas, the Wall did not do the trick for the New Economy. Though it
seemed to protect it from "external dialectical contradictions," it
could not save it from its own "internal dialectical contradictions,"
where "oscillations become ever stronger, eventually leading the system
beyond its stability boundaries until its quality is destroyed," as
Klaus' <i>Dictionary</i> cybernetically reformulates the Marxist notion
of dialectical contradiction.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
The contradiction that a system whose measure was meant to be the
non-alienated species being of humanity should be regulated by a
mechanism that was indifferently human or machine was too much for a
Marxist party to adapt to: contradictions on that scale were best left
for the West to choke on. So, with the abandonment of the New Economic
System in 1971, "the non-political coordination of individual economic
and social interests fell in favor of exclusively political-ideological
steering," effectively terminating socialism's&#8212;I cite the entry
for "self organization"&#8212;"capacity . . . to improve its structure
either to attain greater stability or to defend its internal milieu
better and more purposefully against environmental disruptions or
inner depreciation."
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>

<p>
In order to clarify how the difficulties raised by the New Economic System
relate to the problems of rational measurement and qualitative difference
in modernity, I want to consider more closely a series of paradoxes that
emerged in Klaus' publicity work on behalf of cybernetics. I start with
Klaus' 1960 article in the Communist Party's national press organ<i>Neues
Deutschland</i>, in which he tentatively offers a cybernetic world
view to a socialist public while showing appropriate deference to the
views of official materialist philosophy. Then I look at a confident
interview in <i>Einheit</i>, the theoretical organ of the Party Central
Committee, given in 1967 when the New Economic System enjoyed strong
official support. I end with Klaus' embattled defense of cybernetics in
1970 when the conservative handwriting on the wall was already legible,
shortly before Ulbricht's, and the New Economics System's, defeat. The
paradoxes encountered at these moments describe fundamental challenges
socialism poses to itself that are simultaneously unanswered challenges to
our modernity. Though the systemic antinomies of socialism are radically
different than those generated by the liberal market system, the value
scale in which they are addressed is familiar: modernity calibrated
in the rational units of equality, freedom and prosperity. Our inquiry
into Klaus' predicament will help us to see the deep discrepancies these
values are unable either to apprehend or to ignore.
<p>
In his 1960 <i>Neues Deutschland</i> article "Control Circuits and
Organisms" Klaus reasons more ideologically than scientifically in
popularizing cybernetics, which was still being attacked in many circles
as a bourgeois pseudoscience and only just beginning to find official
patronage.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
Describing the roots of cybernetic theory in engineering technology,
he goes on to explain how the technical regularities of cybernetics
effectively apply to the organic world, elaborating the importance of
human-like computing and

<b></b>

feedback mechanisms for organizing complex systems. "It is characteristic
of cybernetics that it subjects to quantitative observation many process
that were assumed to be only qualitatively comprehensible."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
Such technological optimism was possible in what was, after all, the
dawning computer-enabled space age and the age of industrial automation,
and Klaus had only to point to the success of the Soviet Sputnik to find
confirmation for his hopes. The ideological task of the article, however,
was not simply to commend cybernetics' capabilities for integrating
technology and human society, but more subtly, to not <i>over</i>praise
cybernetics lest it be seen as a pretender to dialectical materialism's
role as the truly human arbiter of the sciences. Throughout the
article he cautions against overextending analogies between machines
and human intelligence. The idea that self-regulating machines could
replace government plans might easily have been seen as sacrificing the
very <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> for a non-market economy, namely, that
human priorities, self-consciously deliberated, assume control over the
hitherto blind mechanisms of economics. Or, to put the stakes in terms
familiar in Western debates, the risk was that cybernetics might be taken
as a proposal for allowing the quantitative "system-world" to dominate
over the qualitative "life-world." Thus, Klaus aims tactically to limit
the capabilities that one might ascribe to smart machines: while it must
be recognized that in some sense the new robots can think like humans,
they nonetheless "cannot think <i>dialectically</i>," as he concedes.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
They can thus serve, but, for the time being at least, not replace human
dialectical materialism. Klaus' argument limits the use of cybernetics to
the pragmatic goal of most efficiently realizing the party's politically
determined aims.
<p>
Yet there is a deep implication to Klaus' argument. What is it
about dialectical thought that is not matched by cybernetic feedback
circuits? The dialectic of quality and quantity, significantly, begins
Hegel's <i>Logic</i>.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
Being, according to Hegel, begins as quality given to the senses without
mediation. It assumes its first mediation as a specific quantity of what
is apprehended. Quantity, however, always threatens to negate Being as
purely external to it. Hegel writes: "Number is a thought, but thought
in its complete self-externalization. Because it is a thought, it does
not belong to perception."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
Only in a dialectical third term&#8212;measure&#8212;do qualitative
perception and quantitative apprehension overcome their opposition.



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Measure, where quality and quantity are in one is thus the completion of
Being. Being, as we first apprehend it, is something utterly abstract
and characterless; but it is the very essence of Being to characterize
itself, and its complete characterization is reached in Measure. Measure,
like the other stages of Being, may serve as a definition of the Absolute:
God, it has been said, is the Measure of all things.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
By conceding dialectics to humans, in this case, to the Communist Party,
Klaus suggests that cybernetics, while it is driven by information,
quantification and coordination, still needs to seek its valid measure
outside itself. That measure is given by the Party; a society organized on
socialist party principles, therefore, has no reason to fear cybernetic
technocracy. The crucial question left hanging, however, is exactly how
the Party is to find modernity's truly universal measure, the synthesis
of what is qualitatively

<b></b>

new about socialism and what is quantitatively commensurate across its
various social tasks; for if Hegel's Absolute is too mystical a yardstick
for the Party's materialism, then the question of where the Party can
ground a universal, socialist measure, which is also technically precise
in the most modern sense, is unanswered.
<p>
By the time of his 1967 <i>Einheit</i> interview, Klaus is ready to set
a more ambitious agenda for cybernetics. He emphasizes the urgency, and
the opportunity, of establishing what he calls "a new style of thought. . . corresponding to the time and the concrete requirements of the
plan-based application of modern sciences, especially mathematics."
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
After touching on the importance of developing a "Marxist semiotics"
in order to make socialist ideas "maximally effective," Klaus turns
to cybernetics as the key to realizing Marx's eleventh thesis on
Feuerbach. "In that we maximally scientifically shape the activity
of human beings, we fill the imperative Marx set out in his famous
Feuerbach theses: the philosophers have only variously interpreted the
world, the point however is to change it."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
With all the maximization involved in Klaus' rhetoric, it seems that
technical reason is winning the upper hand over dialectical reason,
an appearance confirmed by Klaus' recasting of Marx's thesis in
terms that sound suspiciously technocratic. Here, Husserl's famous
critique in <i>The Crisis of European Sciences</i> of the reduction
of the life-world to the terms of the system-world illuminates the
problem Klaus is heading toward. "The material plena&#8212;the
'specific' sense-qualities&#8212;which concretely fill out the
spatio-temporal shape-aspects of the world of bodies <i>cannot</i>,
in their own gradation, be directly treated as are [ideal geometric]
shapes themselves. Nevertheless, these qualities, and everything that
makes up the concreteness of the sensibly intuited world, must count
as manifestations of an 'objective' world."
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
Contrary to Hegel, Husserl believes that the progressive subordination
of the world to a Platonic "metretike techne," a science of measurement,
leads not to overcoming the opposition between quality and quantity,
but to the effacement of qualitative experience in the name of a
spurious objectivity.
<p>
Klaus, however, now serving as the GDR's philosopher-in-chief, confidently
reclaims socialism's proper measure from the all-too-human Party for the
mathematized world of cybernetics. "The relationship between quantity
and quality is described exactly by mathematics and logic," according
to the <i>Dictionary</i>.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
Thus, Klaus observes to his interviewer that "in the complex intersection
of nested cybernetic systems" which make up the emerging socialist
world, only cybernetic theory truly addresses "the unity of laws of
socialist development."
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
Such an assertion of cybernetic sovereignty can be followed by the
interviewer only with an awed question about cybernetics' insight into
"the essence of socialism's social laws."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
Klaus answers by describing a once insurmountable philosophical paradox
that socialist cybernetics now dissolves. On the one hand, the individual
human is the subject of objective laws; in a modern society, the laws
of information, coordination and control. On the other hand, the free
individual creatively participates in shaping these laws.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
For Klaus, cybernetics is able to dissolve the ancient paradox and
simultaneously illuminate the essence of socialism's social laws by
recasting the dialectic of necessity and freedom in game theoretical
terms. At socialism's core, then, is a resourceful game in which each
player follows a five-year

<b></b>

plan and at the same time creatively shapes the plan in anticipation of
the other players' decisions. For him, no high-spirited game could be
more different from capitalism's hostile, chaotic, and counter-productive
competition, whose rules, precisely because they are unplanned, are the
equivalent of natural laws to which the individual is merely subject.
<p>
The resolved paradox of necessity and freedom gives way, however, to
another paradox, that of continuity and discontinuity.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
On the one hand, cybernetics is a "more exact and modern mode of
thought," (<i>EDHS</i>, 165) and Klaus everywhere emphasizes its
precision. Its goal is to mathematize social processes, as the ideal form
of quantification, so as to control them more exactly, and, ultimately,
to coordinate them as a single non-self-contradictory process, namely,
as socialism, with humanity at its base. As we have seen, Klaus is
quite willing now to suggest that dialectics can be mathematized;
that the organic-robotic split of the 1960 <i>Neues Deutschland</i>
article no longer applies. "Mathematics," he now believes, "can well
grasp and represent the essence of things, the quality of things."
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
On the other hand, the very precision and mathematical exhaustiveness
of cybernetic control is designed to produce a discontinuous
leap&#8212;"eine sprunghafte Steigerung"&#8212;in human potential.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
That is, the intensification of quantification in each aspect of life,
plus the homogenization of measurement across subsystems, leads not to
mechanistic stasis, but on the contrary to a discontinuous release of
potential that is essentially qualitative and, as such, unquantifiable
("transformation of quantitative change into qualitative").
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
This problem of exactly how, when and where a qualitative leap occurs
becomes a central theme of socialist self-observation, especially in
its literary culture. It also has another paradoxical dimension in that
it appears that the transition from one state to the next involves an
irrational flash somewhat like a religious conversion. Such apparent
leaps between continuous systems are as unacceptable to dialectical
materialists as they are to rational realists like Popper and Imre
Lakatos. Popper admits "that an intellectual revolution often looks
like a religious conversion." Yet it would be "simply false to say
that the transition from Newton's theory of gravity to Einstein's is
an irrational leap and that the two are not rationally comparable."
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
The transition of an entire social system to a new qualitative level
appears even more mysterious than the transition across intellectual
programs.
<p>
As if these aporias of cybernetic socialism were not enough, as the New
Economic System comes under increasing ideological pressure shortly before
the removal of Ulbricht, Klaus finds himself having to defend cybernetics
from two related charges&#8212;that it promotes value-neutral social
science, and that it implies in its neutrality that system optimization
is tantamount to system convergence; in other words, that cybernetics,
as opposed to Marxism, is not partisan in its application, but constructs
a unitary, technocratic modernity. In the 1970 <i>Einheit</i> article,
Klaus responds to these accusations in two ways, one substantive and
one stylistic. Cybernetics does not efface differences between socialism
and capitalism, he argues, because of "the opposition of their goals,"
and more importantly, because of "the way in which the elements and
individual laws of cybernetics are applied to reach the goal."
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
Cybernetics, he claims, only maximizes systemic potential over a certain
quality of relationships and values.

<b></b>

"Capitalism, for example, forms a social system with a corresponding
class content, class ideology, etc. Its subsystems by no means function
to promote an optimization of the whole system. In the socialist system,
by contrast, the human stands in the middle point and the development
of each subsystem always proceeds with reference to the whole."
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
The paradox here is that for all of cybernetics' precision and
mathematical abstraction, there is still at its core a qualitative value,
a subjective <i>qualia</i> or an Aristotelian <i>entelecheia</i>, that
gives the absolute measure of its coordinated functions: namely, the
human. Not God, but as Protagoras claimed, "<i>man</i> is the measure
of all things."
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
Capitalism, for Klaus, as much as it strives for efficiency and
optimality is merely maximizing profits, not people. Cybernetics is now
conceived as a useful instrument, applied to systems that themselves
are not spontaneously generated (autopoietic) organizations, but
represent and maximize certain incommensurable realities. The distinct
identity of each system derives from the qualitative difference of its
underlying value-giver: and this qualitative discontinuity vouches for
the partisan incommensurability of capitalist and communist systems,
even as they share the project of measurable optimization.
<p>
As humanistic as Klaus' sentiment is here, he knows his New Economic
System is under threat, and responds with a correspondingly militant
rhetoric, writing that cybernetics is "a weapon in the hands of the
victorious revolutionary working class and its allies . . . a means for
developing its offensive in the struggle against imperialism."
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
Cybernetics and its scientific values are transformed in the crisis of
the New Economic System into a weapon of metaphorical violence. They are
offered allegorically as a way to carry on class war by other means,
means appropriate to an enlightened social formation: by virtue of
superior human potential. This potential, however, remains crucially
unquantifiable and revolutionary: a discontinuous leap. Precisely
cybernetics, which coordinates, measures, mathematizes, cannot articulate
the discontinuity of the human quality whose liberation is its reason for
being: except, that is, in this metaphorical violence. Of the paradoxical
inability of a new paradigm&#8212;or, in this case, an entire new social
formation&#8212;to ground its values in its own commensurable terms,
Thomas Kuhn writes that "in a debate over choice of theory, neither
party has access to an argument which resembles a proof in logic or
formal mathematics . . . their recourse is to persuasion as prelude to
the possibility of proof."
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
The violence of Klaus' otherwise so measured rhetoric exemplifies
a switch from a realm of syllogistic reason within a system to a
realm between systems, where values can only confront each other
with persuasive force, what Plato called rhetorical <i>peithos</i>
in contrast to the <i>episteme</i> of science that relies only on the
gentle coercion of the better argument.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
For rhetoric serves its end where there is no common standard of
validity, and according to Plato, "when you call things fair, such as
bodies and colors and res and sounds and institutions, you must do
so surely with reference to some standard."
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>

<p>
Klaus' advocacy for cybernetics, as it is pushed up against the wall,
hints at the uncanny double reference in socialism's self reference,
a doubling that haunts the otherwise familiar values of socialism's
pragmatic rationality. Because the vocabularies of modern scientific
rationality are modest in their ontological commitment to the measurable
evidence of daily life, the chasm of <i>im</i>measurable violence that
separated

<b></b>

the socialist and non-socialist worlds remained perforce inarticulate in
the idiom of daily trial and error. Socialism's insecure culture, however,
unlike that of the confident, even solipsistic West, characteristically
doubted its underlying structural integrity&#8212;its <i>differentia
specifica</i>&#8212;just seriously enough to throw into question
whether or not it was really&#8212;qualitatively, quantitatively and
dialectically&#8212;distinct from capitalism. It needed to pose to itself
the question of difference and its trepidation and vehemence cast into
deep relief the ghostly menace of the imponderable abyss between worlds.
<p>
If Klaus' desperate apology takes on a touch of the comic in its
grandiloquence, our subsequent reading of a comic story by Franz
F&uuml;hmann is rather more eerie. Where Klaus' technophilia presents a
red reflection of our blue-blooded modernity with deadpan literalness,
F&uuml;hmann's fiction recognizes the aporias, the undecidability that his
society has opened in modernity without being able to close again. His
story does not so much mirror similar genre pieces in the West with
symmetrical values, but, because socialism never secured itself as
an autarkic alternative, its literature reflects, as scarcely another
does, the intensity of a system whose simultaneously real and impossible
difference from modernity causes the violence of sovereignty to turn in
on itself.

3 Suddenly, F&uuml;hmann's Heap
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
"The Heap", like many F&uuml;hmann stories, seems remote from GDR politics
and Cold War conflict.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
Its theme is the classical Greek paradox of the <i>sorites</i>: if
an element of a heap&#8212;say, a grain of wheat&#8212;is a discrete
quantity, then the gradual addition of one discrete element to another
discrete element can only add up to a discrete quantity and never to a
heap. In terms of mathematical induction: since two are few, and three
are few also, and since for any number n that are few, n+1 are few also;
then, a thousand are few as surely as are two. The ancient physician
Galen, accordingly, concluded "there must not be such a thing in the
world as a heap of grain, a mass or satiety, neither a mountain nor
strong love, nor a row, nor strong wind, nor city nor anything else
which is known from its name and idea to have a measure of extent or
multitude, such as the wave, the open sea, a flock of sheep and herd
of cattle, the nation and the crowd."
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
Yet socialism&#8212;F&uuml;hmann's historical reality&#8212;is
existentially predicated on the possibility of a qualitative distinction
in modernity, a class consciousness, a species being, a secular
redemption in human life. How then do the relentless quantities of
daily perceptions precipitate suddenly into a socialist quality?

<b></b>

<p>
"The Heap" examines this classical problem in the quintessentially
modern setting of a laboratory in the improbable year 3456. The
Philosopher-in-Chief is asked unexpectedly whether the "Truly Liberated
Society" of 3456 has solved the unsolved problems of the ancients, and,
caught off guard, affirms they have been answered fully. He subsequently
commissions an underling named Janno with producing one of the purported
solutions, namely, that for the sorites. The following narrative takes the
form of a brief, escalating series of conflicts in Janno's lab. One day,
Janno's colleague Jirro comes to visit the lab where Janno is taking
snapshots of screws he is dropping one by one into a basin in hopes
of catching the precise moment when their number becomes a heap. The
preposterously literal experiment ignites a conflict between the obsessed
Janno and his tactically-minded colleague Jirro. When a siren summons
the institute members to the parade grounds for a routine inspection,
the two colleagues' methodological conflict promptly escalates into a
social conflict: the terms, to speak with the philosophy of science,
switch from Karl Popper's doctrine of methodological individualism to
Thomas Kuhn's model of social constructivism.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
Bound by his vision of a principled solution to the sorites, Janno
refuses to conform to ritual procedure, much to the horror of his
expedient colleague who has reconciled himself to the reigning
paradigm. Eventually, scientific and police authorities converge
simultaneously on Janno's lab, where the two colleagues remain
struggling over quantity and quality, principle and expediency. The
ensuing confusion, anticlimactically, supplies no clear resolution to the
sorites. On the contrary, confusion, complexity and cross-purposes are
the dubious conditions under which quantity alchemizes into quality. The
resolution comes in spite of itself: the contending parties at the
institute are heaped together in Janno's messy lab by circumstances
beyond their control.
<p>
If this confusion is a disappointing answer to the sorites, a closer look
at F&uuml;hmann's story brings more satisfaction than one might expect
from such murky proceedings. "The Heap" translates Klaus' cybernetic
paradoxes from logic into literature, a cognate medium for F&uuml;hmann,
for, as he remarks in his diaries, "the world can be expressed in poetry,
because it can be mathematized."
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
Thus, the "hypertrophy of feeling" in his science fiction is, as his
preface has it, "the emotional counterpart to thinking a thing logically
through to its end, except that thinking has a different stringency and
objectivity than fearing, dreading, anticipating or repressing. 'Fearing
to the end' aims at catastrophe; 'anticipating to the end' banishes
alternatives; 'repressing to the end' means destruction; 'dreading to the
end' not only conjures ghosts, but makes them omnipotent, omnipresent,
and absolute."
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
The ghosts haunting F&uuml;hmann's scientists, I hope to show, arise
from the equally dreaded and anticipated possibility of another system,
uncannily familiar in its modernity, but visible only as a specter in the
sudden rupture of the current system's pragmatic, adaptive, maximizing
functions. Like all such incommensurabilities, this qualitative
interruption escapes both ethical and material calculi; its ambiguous
value is to be sought only in its openness and potential. Let us see
how F&uuml;hmann's scientists develop the implications of a qualitative
turning point in quantitative continuity.
<p>
Seeing the absurd experiment Janno is conducting, his colleague Jirro
asks him who has paid for the film and screws. Janno, aware that his
superiors would hardly be

<b></b>

so financially forthcoming, has paid out of pocket. But Janno's one-time
expense, as Jirro realizes, threatens to become a precedent if word gets
out. "If the administration, as is only to be expected, generalizes
from your bad example and makes every Ph.D. pay research costs out of
pocket, we'd have only Janno to thank" ("TH," 36). Intuitively grasping
how the particular transmutes into the general under the watchful eyes
of power, Jirro sets himself against Janno's idealistic attempt to
isolate the sorites in his basin of screws, determined instead upon two
more materialist goals: preventing Janno's sacrifice from setting an
institutional precedent, and getting a hold of 10 of his screws while
the getting is still good.
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
Both objectives necessitate escaping detection. Janno, meanwhile, remains
obsessed with capturing on film the moment a quantity of screws becomes
a quality. Detection&#8212;systemic observation&#8212;it seems is the
precise spot where the qualitative transformation matrix comes into
play. Jirro, however, is canny enough to realize that what Janno is
seeking, the pure qualia, is an illusion&#8212;Jirro is a materialist,
not a phenomenologist, and "the thing in itself" holds no attraction
for him.
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
He steers Janno back to quantity by asking him crassly "what the solution
is worth to him." A price? Janno stammers. Unperturbed, Jirro names it
himself: "twenty pounds" ("TH," 38).
<p>
Although he coughs up the sum to his friend, Janno's mind is
elsewhere. Not prices, but qualia alone will deliver him from the
infinite plasticity of the social system: a self-subsistent quality,
a kingdom for a quality, and he will burst asunder the relentless
constructivism of numbers, prices, salaries, authorities, and social
systems. So as Jirro, in exchange for his fee, tiresomely reiterates
his constructivist belief that for their purposes only the "Kameraden
Klassiker" (of Marxism-Leninism) can reliably determine a quality,
Janno becomes aware of the wan light filtering through his dirty office
window. After enduring Jirro's vain dialectics a while longer, he has had
enough, "no, . . . we can no longer understand each other, Jirro. It's
as though I've just now made a leap into another existence: that one
suddenly doesn't want to go on as one did in the past, regardless what
happens . . . the problem, Jirro, the pure problem beyond any purpose,
in pure freedom" ("TH," 46). The siren wails, Janno refuses to answer the
hailing system, Jirro panics over losing his money and cut of the screws,
and, without warning, Janno smashes the dirty window, blood pours from
the backs of his hands, the pure blue of sky streams in, as do two columns
of control troops, the Control Commander and the Philosopher-in-Chief.
<p>
As story and experiment draw to a catastrophic end, F&uuml;hmann
seems to side with Jirro that the sorites has no ideal, only a
constructed solution, with quality asserting itself in precisely the
manner Jirro feared, as state sovereignty and panoptic violence. It
is simply a pre-modern relic, the dark underbelly of threatened
rationality. Quality&#8212;which humanists might have been predisposed
to embrace as their essence&#8212;turns out to be a reactionary value,
sheer unlegitimatible power.
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
When the Commander and the Philosopher-in-Chief see a political scandal
in the wreckage of Janno's lab&#8212;an uncooperative philosopher,
perhaps one of many, and an "unbelievable waste of productive
capacity"&#8212;they quickly hit upon an inverse function that can
serve as a mutually satisfactory bureaucratic resolution to the problem:
"as great as is the harm

<b></b>

caused by this heap of inner enemies, so infinitesimally small is its
actual number" ("TH," 54). It is an official formulation that Jirro easily
carries over to Janno's private experiment: "a heap&#8212;or more exactly,
the quantity of its quality&#8212;is always exactly what it has to be
in order to count as the appropriate quantity of a heap in the interests
of the Truly Liberated Society" ("TH," 55). Overwhelmed, but determined
to the last to capture on camera a qualia, even such an unpleasant one,
Janno has Jirro snap a picture of the Commander, his control troops, the
Philosopher-in-Chief, and his wayward underlings in this jolly moment of
reconciliation in the classless society. But Janno notices that the heap
is incomplete, the Commander&#8212;naked police force&#8212;has somehow
eluded the photo-image, and in his naivet&eacute;, Janno reaches out
to pull him back into the circle. The troops panic, pistols are drawn
all around. Jirro, meanwhile, sees his chance to sneak past the metal
detector with his cut of ten screws&#8212;for who would notice that
little heap in the midst of such great events?&#8212;and he bolts.
<p>
This is the moment of revelation, and it appears to vindicate the
machinations of individualists and pragmatists such as Jirro. Yet Jirro
falls on the inert side of the dialectic of necessity and free will that
Georg Klaus claimed cybernetics could resolve. "In the case of natural
laws a person is more or less irrelevant," ("EDHS," 170) Klaus comments,
and the same holds true for Jirro's conformism to social law. Janno,
by contrast, rejects interpellation. By literally refusing to respond
to the siren, the "Institutsappell" ("TH," 48), he sets a limit to
social constructivism. In a single moment, he causes a qualitative
transformation of his environment: poetry emerges from the blood, the
shards of glass, the crystalline revelation of a sudden interruption
of mechanical routine. F&uuml;hmann, in a 1971 letter to his editor,
points out the importance to him of the word "sudden." "It is in fact
the basic experience of my time on earth."
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
After describing the abrupt interruptions that have characterized
his life&#8212;from Bohemian Catholic school boy, to Nazi SA member,
soldier, prisoner of war, Communist&#8212;he reflects: "Now, one could
say with horror: what a spongy world, in which ruptures are ceaselessly
occurring! I could answer: what a robust world that it can stand it! But
I believe it is true about the ruptures. It is a world of being handed
over and exposed, a world of being objectified. I could say: it's to
escape it, or to first become aware of it, that I write."
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>

<p>
While it would seem that "The Heap" only confirms the danger of
qualitative reason and substantive ontology, there is another side of
the story represented by Janno's stubborn refusal to be constructed
by systemic imperatives. In a flash of broken glass, "the human"
briefly exceeds the system's measure, an incommensurate quality
that shatters its machinery of optimization. The flash, however,
illuminates ambiguously. The quality escapes functionalization in
the continuous metrics of one system, but lasts no longer than the
light of intuition. Here we are reminded of Kuhn's retort to Popper
that he never meant the flash of intuition that leads one to transfer
allegiance from one paradigm to another to be understood as an ontological
revelation. That quality seems to transcend one system does not imply
that it is an ontological absolute for all possible systems. Janno's
irreducible qualitativeness exposes his system's optimum as relative
merely to it, not an <i>optimum optimorum</i>, grounded once in for all
in value beyond measure. Yet it likewise supplies no basis for a final
measure or first

<b></b>

substance. In the ruins of Janno's lab, the only certainty is that no
quality exists outside each heap and as the criterion for them all. Far
from despairing that no system subsumes all alternatives, F&uuml;hmann's
modernity, his experimental and gradualist sensibility, draws him to
the sharp point where measure reveals itself as a construction and the
opportunity for recalibration emerges. At that point, and it is a risky
one, quantity tilts past a system's limits, either as violence or as hope,
always as radical discontinuity: "the turning point can only be grasped as
'sudden,'" F&uuml;hmann writes his editor. "That can also be demonstrated
mathematically. There are curves, hyperbola (of the type: y=1/x
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
), for example, where with the least change in the curve, the addition
or subtraction of the smallest imaginable unit, the differential quotient
explodes from positive to negative infinity."
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
The question, then, posed by the qualitative, is whether the breach in
the commensurable shall be filled with what Hegel called "the wrong or
negative infinity" or with a positive one that yields to qualitative
transformation.
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
And the answer to that question F&uuml;hmann, and the history of
alternatives to liberal capitalist modernity, has left to us.

4 Cosmopolitan commensurability and sovereign incommensurability
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
F&uuml;hmann puts his readers before a stark choice: an infinite
destructive regression or an infinite asymptotic convergence. In
a sense, however, the two options are not options at all, but the
conditions of systematicity. A dynamic system, as Klaus made clear, can
always be disrupted or protected, correcting itself to converge on a
finite stability or exploding into chaos. F&uuml;hmann, in the battle
of sensibilities between Janno and Jirro, asks whether stability,
equilibrium, order and mediation are the optimum goal ["Sollwert"],
or whether crisis is a worthwhile risk for finding an optimum outside
of the target states of the given system. Thus, Klaus writes in his
1960 <i>Neues Deutschland</i> article that "man is not content just to
maintain the conditions of his environment, he wants rather constantly to
improve them, and not only that, he also strives to ensure the security
and stability of human relationships against chances of every sort."
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>
Precisely this question, whether the goal of science and thus of
humanity is stability or risk, is addressed by Nietzsche in "On Science,"
where his antagonists argue whether they seek Zarathustra to find more
security or insecurity. Zarathustra himself believes that science is
not a refinement of fear in search of security, but a refinement of
courage in search of risk and change.
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
F&uuml;hmann's two scientists play out this dialectic, where Janno's
destructive courage finally seems a risk worth taking. The crisis he
induces exposes the sovereignty of his system as a formal constraint
on all its possible states. In the sudden light of crisis, sovereignty
is hypostatized for Janno as a form of control rather than a medium
of self-realization. It is the positive historical form (and hence
practical negation) of any ideal universality.

<b></b>

<p>
Another way to see the force of F&uuml;hmann's story&#8212;and socialist
culture's intensive exploration of alternate forms for a positive
sovereignty that is nonetheless disposed to a universal modernity&#8212;is
to examine the fortunes of sovereignty in several key debates after the
fall of historical socialism. Since the end of the Cold War a series of
transatlantic discussions have shaped the way we talk about sovereignty
and the prospects of universal, boundless systematicity. The first set
of debates, conducted against the background of the 1990-91 Gulf War and
European-American engagements in the former Yugoslavia, turned around a
comparison of national with international institutions for securing global
order. The outcome was an emphasis on the importance of international
institutions. Multilateralists argued that the traditional mechanisms of
state sovereignty&#8212;economic autarky, the military, the friend/foe
distinction, ethnic identification, and religious homogeneity&#8212;were
becoming outmoded in an increasingly globalized world in which order could
be more effectively maintained through a common legal framework. Unlike
state sovereignty, international law appealed to reason, debate, and
limited corrective force, rather than to power, religion, ethnic loyalty,
or national interest. Even Marxist thinkers such as Michael Hardt and
Anthony Negri, apparently so far outside of any popular consensus,
argued that the era of sovereignty and spatio-temporal borders of power
had ended with the end of the socialist second world, gradually being
replaced by unlimited capital mobility and "a single logic of rule."
<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>

<p>
After September 11th, however, the tenor of the times switched,
sovereignty becoming the preferred rubric under which policy and opinion
makers conceive the strategic world order.
<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>
It is argued that a strong state, with a credible military force, is
necessary to guarantee not only the security of its citizens, but also
the order of relationships between states and populations in the world.
<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>
Although the tenor of the two debates is different, as are the specific
challenges of the world events to which they refer, the two consensus
positions are not as divergent as they might at first seem. In the former
debate, as idealistically as thinkers from John Rawls in the U.S. to
J&uuml;rgen Habermas in Germany argued for the primacy of reason and its
institutionalization in international law, the clear understanding was
that jurisdiction in the world would center on the U.S., as both the most
powerful state and the most influential model for legality, <i>primus
inter pares</i>. Similarly, in the latter debate, today's return to
"the state" does not mean a return to many states, each <i>par inter
pares</i> in a multi-polar world of alliances and spheres of influence,
but a return to a forthright projection of U.S. might. There are
advantages and disadvantages to the emphases of each consensus. If the
first consensus indeed held up the laudable idea of universal justice
as a system for resolving disagreements between states, it had the
drawback of obscuring the factual concentration of legislative, judicial
and police powers in a few states that had by no means repudiated the
sovereign use of force. If the second consensus seems more cynical in
its appeal to a narrow idea of national interest and in the eclipse
of humanitarian ideals in favor of strategic calculations, it has the
merit of removing the ideological camouflage from international actions
that are credibly explicable in categories of national self-interest.

<b></b>

<p>
Although the assertion, in the second consensus, of the rights of
aroused power over those of just procedure is harsher than that which
followed the Gulf War, its way of validating itself shares essential
features with the earlier consensus, especially its articulation
in terms of the humane values that all such strategic thinking is
intended to serve and protect. Whether good laws or smart missiles
secure their viability, the humane values themselves&#8212;openness,
pluralism, gradualism and consumerism; or Max Weber, John Dewey, and Karl
Popper&#8212;remain without credible challengers in the transatlantic
public, defining a good life to which strategists must appeal to win
their positions. Contemporary elites, lofted on a platform of global
markets, democracy, and technology, have learned to do business without
fundamental truth claims and to accommodate a diversity of ideas and
practices. Intellectuals as disparate as Rawls, Richard Rorty, Michael
Walzer, Samuel Huntington, Francis Fukayama, Louis Menand, Nussbaum and
Sen, attest to the ascendancy of reason over identification, pluralism
over totality, skepticism over certainty, reform over rupture.
<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>
In German public letters, <i>Die Zeit</i> editor Josef Joffe fits into
this mainstream as surely as does Berlin Academy of Arts President
Gy&ouml;rgy Konr&aacute;d, and as do Karl-Heinz Bohrer, Henryk Broder,
and Hans Magnus Enzensberger; the quarrelling camps of Habermas and
his late rival Niklas Luhmann are also reconciled here.
<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>

<p>
These familiar ideas constitute in fact the core of what is generally
regarded as the modern worldview. In his famous 1918 talk "Science
as a Vocation" Weber, as we have seen, gave modernity an influential
formulation as a worldly disenchantment and secular responsibility that
forgo secular salvation.
<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>
After the subsequent century's violent eruptions of nostalgia for (or
messianic anticipation of) the fundamental, the pure, and the total,
Weber's disciplined forfeiture of transcendental satisfactions has been
all-but-decisively vindicated against persistent romantic claims for
fundamental ontologies, against Herder's "Volksgemeinschaften," Fichte's
"geschlossener Handelsstaat" or any number of "Schicksalsgemeinschaften"
["communities of fate"] of both left and right provenance.
<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>
Thus, for Habermas, the imposition of a liberal state form on half
of the defeated Third Reich was not an ontological imposition&#8212;a
controlling order in the contingent form of American-style constitutional
sovereignty&#8212;but truly an emancipation of Germany from its
pre-modern particularity.
<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>
Historically saddled with ponderous appeals to "special German
paths"&#8212;and special Teutonic qualities&#8212;Germany was thenceforth
liberated into a cosmopolitan modernity that is rightly not special
at all, except in the degree to which it is advanced along the path of
universal development.
<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>

<p>
I want to return to the debates between Karl Popper and Thomas Kuhn
to propose looking at the bifurcation of our times differently than
one between an open, universal, and globalizing modernity, on the one
side, and a conventional, qualitative and closed pre-modernity, on the
other. Popper, as we have seen, based his cold war animus on the belief
that Western industrial democracies founded on a modern experimental ethos
were open societies, whereas Marxist states, guided by an unfalsifiable
ideology rather than scientific reason, were terminally closed. This
postulate expresses a faith in rational communication and the possibility
of reasonable adjudication of competing views. "Thus in science, as
distinct from theology, a critical comparison of

<b></b>

the competing theories, of the competing frameworks, is always
possible. . . . In science (and only in science) can we say that we have
made genuine progress: that we know more than we did before."
<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>
As much as Popper based his position on transcendent rationalism while
social theorists like Habermas and Rawls base theirs in an immanent
sociology of undistorted consensus, they all have an optimistic belief
in the ability of rational discussion, rooted in individual development
free from coercion by irrational power, to overcome, through the gradual
give and take of positions, the sharp qualitative differences that
distinguish between categories and systems.
<p>
Kuhn likewise believed that scientific communities were good models for
rational modernity, but he also held that their defining characteristic
was not their openness. They are enclosed by their own paradigms
and beyond these frameworks their conclusions cannot be rationally
adjudicated. Thus, John Watkins characterizes Kuhn's view as maintaining
that "the scientific community [is] an essentially closed society,
intermittently shaken by collective nervous breakdowns followed by
restored mental unison."
<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>
With this view of Kuhn's position in mind, we can see how the socialist
east might indeed have been a relatively closed ideological system
that <i>precisely for that reason</i> resembled a modern scientific
community. In <i>Closed Worlds: Computers and Politics of Discourse
in Cold War America</i>, Paul N. Edwards uses the phrase 'closed-world
discourse' "to describe the language, technologies, and practices that
together supported the visions of centrally controlled, automated global
power at the heart of American Cold War politics."
<sup><a name="REF79" href="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>

<p>
Now, one should emphasize that what is at stake in the discussion
of socialism is not a distinction between two views of the world, but
between two ontological totalities, each systematically organizing their
worlds. In this sense, the view that Klaus and F&uuml;hmann afford us from
within socialism shows that power, however constructed, internalized, and
decentralized is always necessarily articulated at its borders as a form
of hypostatized sovereignty. Such sovereignty, however, no more implies an
external imposition than the skin of a body implies a constraint upon its
extension. I do not mean to naturalize sovereignty; indeed, the validity
of power and force is continually reassessed in terms of legitimacy,
efficiency, happiness, or any other powerful guiding value&#8212;and the
essence of the political is to contend power's validity. But between
systems, the rational terms of contention necessarily confront the
forceful perimeters of sovereignty. Systematicity, as Luhmann has
commented, is unable to see its own exterior and thus the conditions
of its sovereignty. "Observation is any kind of operation that makes a
distinction so as to designate one (but not the other) side. . . . Every
description of society must take place within that society."
<sup><a name="REF80" href="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>
Ultimately, both systematicity and sovereignty are contingent, and
contingent precisely upon each other as their own preconditions and
limits. What F&uuml;hmann's story indicates is that the suddenness and
illumination of crisis is a moment, not necessarily of apocalypse, but of
risk. This choice between systems can only be rationally reconstructed
in retrospect on a quasi-juridical model in which specific, given
facts and postulates are assessed. It cannot be made prospectively on
apodictic grounds. Prospectively, the best one can do is be attentive
to the ontological construction of quality, or, what amounts to the same

<b></b>

thing, circumspectly commitment oneself at one moment or another, one
place or another, to a specific difference. To exhibit this prospective
openness, this reception to the temporality of suddenness, rupture and
change, is not nihilistically to repudiate the retrospective attitude
of judgment. Nor is it to devote oneself to a messianic, and pre-modern,
redemption. For as firm as open-ended commitment must be for qualitative
difference to matter, it still must accept that quality and measure are
always immanent to a provisional and closed system of coordination.

This idea of the GDR's failure should be understood as a paradox that the
following article explores. As Imre Lakatos, otherwise very close to Karl
Popper, has pointed out, Popper is inconsistent precisely with respect
to the question of the failure or refutation of Marxism, which leads
Popper to make "such confusing formulations as 'Marxism is irrefutable'
and, at the same time, 'Marxism has been refuted.'" Imre Lakatos,
"Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes,"
in <i>Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge</i>, eds. Imre Lakatos and
Alan Musgrave (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1970), 91-196,
n119. The point might be made more clearly outside of the Popperian
program of falsifiability. In the same volume, Thomas Kuhn ("Logic of
Discovery of Psychology of Research?" 1-23) argues that rival models of
knowledge (paradigms)&#8212;and, more fundamentally, the communities that
support their respective frameworks&#8212;are mutually incomprehensible to
each other. They cannot be tested, and thus cannot fail, in each others'
terms (13, and for Lakatos' characterization, 179). The failure, then,
of the GDR, must be seen, as I suggest below, as a failure of historical
state socialism to establish persuasive criteria for its own effective
and legitimate <i>self</i>-description.

Martha Nussbaum distinguishes four distinct constituent claims in Plato's
ethical science of measurement (<i>metretike techne</i>). Metricity
implies that in a situation of choice there is a common value,
varying only in quantity, to each choice. Singleness implies
there is one metric for all situations of choice. Consequentialism
implies that these comparable values reside in the outcome of the
choice. Maximalization implies that there is a value that (either
in each case, or&#8212;for example happiness or pleasure&#8212;in all
cases) can and should be maximized. Martha Nussbaum, "The Discernment of
Perception: An Aristotelian Conception of Private and Public Rationality,"
<i>Love's Knowledge</i> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990), 56. The
distinction, or, more precisely, the ambiguity that I am emphasizing is
between criteria as universal standards "outside" of the situation being
decided, and criteria that themselves are effective causes of a situation
of choice in the first place and thus cannot be adduced as independent
(third party) standards.

Loren R. Graham makes a similar point about the study of Soviet
science. He points out that precisely because Soviet society was "based
on principles&#8212;economic, social, philosophical&#8212;strikingly
different from those of other industrial nations," those aspects of
it that were similar to Western nations, in particular its science,
reveal a lot about the way science and society relate. He concludes
his overview of the Soviet experience that "we can understand how much
<i>our</i> science and <i>our</i> culture are conditioned by <i>our</i>
society only if we have another society and another culture with which we
can appropriately draw comparisons. The Soviet Union may well have been
one of the last modern alternatives to dominant Western patterns with
which such comparisons of science can be made. In that sense, the study
of Soviet science is also a study of <i>our</i> science." <i>What Have
We Learned About Science and Technology from the Russian Experience?</i>

The debate over the incommensurability of "paradigms" in Kuhn's
work is a more recent, but now classic, locus for the discussion of
incommensurability. "The point-by-point comparison of two successive
theories demands a language into which at least the empirical
consequences of both can be translated without loss or change . . . no
such vocabulary is available. . . . Successive theories are thus, we say,
incommensurable." Thomas Kuhn, "Reflections on My Critics," <i>Criticism

For a discussion of the distinction in Aristotelian rhetoric between an
attested fact, subject to syllogistic reason, but not to generalization,
and a paradigm for guiding future action generally, see Carlo Ginsberg,

England, 1999).

Here, we can also see how a satire of cybernetic reasoning such as
Christa Wolf's 1970 story "Neue Lebensansichten eines Katers" ["The
New Life and Opinions of a Tomcat"] played a reactionary role against
the N&Ouml;S. Bitterly repressed at the 11th Party Plenum ("Kahlschlag
Plenum"), humanists like Wolf did not recognize that their enemies were
not directly the technocrats then in favor with the Ulbricht regime. They
equated the state with technocratic reasoning, which presumably spurned
humanist values such as quality, and thus when the state struck back with
the qualitative force of Party sovereignty, they had lost their chance for
an alliance with quantity. F&uuml;hmann's story, in contrast to Wolf's,
sees the merits of quantity and the dangers of quality. Christa Wolf,

"Der Umschlagspunkt ist nicht anders als mit 'pl&ouml;tzlich'

Ver&auml;nderung, n&auml;mlich bei Zu- oder Abnahme um eine so klein
wie nur m&ouml;glich gedachte Einheit, den Differentialquotienten,
von plus Unendlich nach minus Unendlich springt." F&uuml;hmann to Batt,

&#167;94: "This infinity [of endless negation] is the wrong or negative
infinity: it is only a negative of a finite: but the finite rises again
the same as ever, and is never got rid of or absorbed." In the Zusatz
to &#167;94 Hegel elaborates the good infinity by contrast. "Such
a progression to infinity is not the real infinite. That consists in
being at home with itself in its other, or, if enunciated as a process,
in coming to itself in its other." Hegel, <i>HL</i>, 137.

"I have always regarded the intellectual openings to Western traditions
after 1945 as liberating. . . . This orientation toward the West did
not involve a distortion of the German soul, but it did involve our
getting used to an upright posture." Habermas, <i>A Berlin Republic</i>
(Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1997), 101, 102. "If . . . one
conceives 'socialism' as the set of necessary conditions for emancipated
forms of life about which the participants themselves must first
reach an understanding, then one will recognize that the democratic
self-organization of a legal community constitutes the normative core
of this project as well." Habermas, <i>Between Facts and Norms</i>
(Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1996) xli.
<p>
<a name="FOOT76" href="#REF76">76</a>.
In contrast to Habermas, many Germans still object that the American
constitutional system is precisely such an imposed, hypostatized
form of control. Thus Bernd Fischer observes, "da der republikanische
Nationsbegriff Deutschland 1949 (bzw. 1990) von au&szlig;en aufoktroyiert
wurde, scheint er den Deutschen nicht nur bis heute teilweise unverstanden
und fremd, sondern wird h&auml;uals zu armselig und 'seelenlos'
angesehen, um das zu beschreiben, was man unter Deutschen verstehen
will." <i>Das Eigene und das Eigentliche</i>, 15.
