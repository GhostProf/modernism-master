<P>
The thesis of Walter Benn Michaels's <I>Our America</I> could hardly be
clearer or more forcefully argued. It goes like
this. Whereas "the major writers of the Progressive period--London,
Dreiser, Wharton--were comparatively indifferent to
questions of both racial and national identity" (<I>OA,</I> 8), the
literature of the postwar, of the 1920s, is
characterized by its particular brand of <I>nativism,</I> that is, its
commitment to the notion that one's identity is
defined by racial difference. Whereas the Progressivists believed in the
fabled melting pot, in the possibility of
wholesale assimilation into U. S. citizenry, the pluralist 1920s,
substituting a faith in difference for one in the
superiority of any one group, wanted to preserve racial purity at all
costs. Accordingly, identity comes to be defined
by one's difference from "them"--from those whose blood might contaminate
one's own. The fear of miscegenation and of
the reproductive family now become powerful; "the homosexual family and
the incestuous family thus emerge as parallel
technologies in the effort to prevent half-breeds" (<I>OA,</I> 49).

<P>
Michaels exemplifies this thesis with literally dozens of examples,
primarily from the fiction of the period. In
William
Faulkner's <I>The Sound and the Fury,</I> Quentin Compson's desire to
convince others that he has committed incest with
his sister Caddy is an "attempt through language to substitute the blood
ties of family for the affective and/or legal
ties of love and marriage." (<I>OA,</I> 5) In this respect, Quentin and
Jason are really not all that different; both
believe, in their own way, that "blood is blood" (<I>OA,</I> 3). Or again,
in F. Scott Fitzgerald's <I>The Great
Gatsby,</I> Tom Buchanan's aversion to Gatsby has less to do with



<B></B>


class than with race. For who is Gatsby? Is he
perhaps a Jew, hanging out as he does with the likes of Meyer Wolfsheim?
In any case, he is not "one of us," any more
than is Robert Cohn in <I>The Sun Also Rises.</I> But then that novel's
hero, Jake Barnes, functions as Cohn's alter
ego: Jake's war wound, which has left him impotent, Michaels argues, is
again an emblem of the nativist fear of the
reproductive family. In staying single, Jake preserves his racial
identity.

<P>
And so on. From Willa Cather's <I>The Professor's House</I> to Nella
Larsen's <I>Passing</I> and <I>Quicksand,</I> from
Jean Toomer's <I>Cane</I> to Carl Van Vechten's <I>Nigger Heaven,</I>
nativism is the engine that drives human
behavior,
and in the 1920s, nativism depends first and last on understanding one's
Americanness as racial difference. In Oliver
La
Farge's <I>Laughing Boy,</I> for example, Slim Girl's "genealogical
ambition is to have children who are 'all Navajo'"
(<I>OA,</I> 71), even as Nella Larsen's Clare learns that "passing"
destroys the purity of her own identity. One must
be
true to one's racial self.

<P>
Pluralism thus turns out to be the bogey. Whereas Progressivist "claims to
racial superiority inevitably involved the
appeal to standards that were understood as common to all races. . . . the
pluralist can prefer his own race only on
the
grounds that it is his" (<I>OA,</I> 137). The commitment to pluralism is
the commitment to the "primacy of identity"
(<I>OA,</I> 140), and thus to what Michaels calls "identity essentialism"
(<I>OA,</I> 140). Indeed, "there can be no
coherent anti-essentialist account of race" (<I>OA,</I> 134). For "the
particular contribution of pluralism to racism
is
to make racial identity into its own justification" (<I>OA,</I> 137). And
when that happens--as is, according to
Michaels, the cultural condition today--racism prevails.

<P>
But why did this form of nativism occur in the 1920s and recur in the
1990s? What about the six decades in between? And
why should miscegenation be such a taboo if the racial Other is considered
not inferior but merely different, as
Michaels claims? These issues are avoided by a curious sleight-of-hand.
The inevitable reductionism of Michaels's
project (the discussion of <I>Gatsby,</I> for example, must play down the
role of Nick Carraway so as to foreground Tom
Buchanan's fears) is acknowledged and declared necessary, given the
revisionist aim of <I>Our America,</I> which is to
provide, not close readings of specific texts, but a large-scale
reinterpretation of modernism. For American nativism
is
evidently synonymous with American modernism, which is, in its turn,
synonymous with the American fiction (few works of
other genres are included) of the 1920s.

<P>
For most literary historians, as for theorists of modernism, the great
modernist innovations were in place well before
World War I. In his recent <I>Modernisms,</I> for example, Peter Nicholls
characteristically begins with Charles
Baudelaire even as T. J. Clark's earlier <I>The Painting of Modern
Life</I> began with Edouard Manet. But then
Michaels's "modernism" is best described as a modernism without the
modernists, for the most canonical American
modernist writers--Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, H. D., Gertrude Stein, Djuna
Barnes--are eliminated from Michaels's
American
modernist canon, presumably because they lived abroad and took an interest
in non-American persons and places. For
example:


<B></B>

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
the endpoint of the "heritage" whose origin Pound locates in Jefferson is
. . . Benito Mussolini: "The heritage of
Jefferson . . . is HERE, NOW <I>in the Italian peninsula </I>at the
beginning of the fascist second decennio, not in
Massachusetts or Delaware." This "heritage" is thus in no way
distinctively American, any more than it is distinctly
Italian. Rather, it is disassociated from any particular nationality and,
indeed, from nationality as such, a concept
which Pound tended to link disparagingly with "provincialism." And, by the
same token, the "ancestors" to whom Eliot
appeals in "Tradition and the Individual Talent"  not only extend
beyond . . . his American predecessors to "the
whole of the literature of Europe" but beyond Europe as well to "all the
poetry that has ever been written." Neither
Eliot's "tradition" nor Pound's "heritage" is in any sense <I>national.
</I>. . . [<I>OA,</I> 102]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
What this line of reasoning ignores is that the very idea of linking
Jefferson to Mussolini is itself a profoundly
nativist theme. It assumes that the desire to transcend one's native
grounds, to assert one's difference from "ordinary
Americans," again, by the way, on the grounds of racial purity of some
sort (e. g., true Americans know that their
heritage can never just be American!), is a desire that can somehow be
satisfied, even as Quentin thinks that
<I>saying</I> he has had incest with Caddy means that it really happened.
Similarly, Eliot's desire in "Tradition and
the Individual Talent" to place his own poetry in relation to "all the
poetry that has ever been written" (<I>OA,</I>
102) could only have been made by a poet self-consciously American, and
hence self-consciously inserting himself into
the European arena where poetry does flourish. Just try to imagine Marcel
Proust or
St&eacute;phane Mallarm&eacute; or Paul Val&eacute;ry claiming that theirs
was a heritage that transcended their
national identity!

<P>
Ironically, a consideration of Pound's or Eliot's nativism would have
"thickened the plot" of Michaels's narrative.
Think of Eliot's "East Coker," with its claim for a racial identity (pure
English stock) that distinguishes the poet
from those others who have names like Sweeney or Bleistein. But even if we
grant Michaels his donn&eacute;e, even if we
assume that such internationalists as Eliot and Pound, Stein and Barnes
are outside the "nativist" orbit, how can we
equate nativism with modernism, when Michaels also eliminates such notable
stay-at-homes as Wallace Stevens, whose name
does not so much as appear in Michaels's index, even though Stevens's
first great book, <I>Harmonium,</I> appeared in
1923? The answer is not hard to find. Clearly, if one substitutes for
Eliot and Stevens such texts as Anzia Yezierska's
<I>Bread Givers</I> or La Farge's <I>Laughing Boy,</I> novels currently
being read precisely on account of their
multicultural rather than their literary interest, then of course one can
come up with a reinterpretation of
"modernism"
as racially motivated. The reasoning is patently circular:  modernism
has traditionally been defined as <I>X.</I>

Minority studies of the modernist period have unearthed a number of novels
that are more properly characterized as
<I>Y.</I> Therefore  modernism should be redefined as <I>Y.</I>

<P>
Thus nativism = modernism: such equations occur in <I>Our America</I>
because its analytic mode is structuralist rather
than in any sense historical. The identitarian paradigm once introduced
recurs with minor variations in novel after
novel: Michaels's synopses and exegeses become as repetitive and
interchangeable as do the characters in <I>The
Professor's House</I> and <I>The Sun Also Rises.</I> There is a "Gotcha!"
quality to all


<B></B>


this, as if to say, "Oh,
so <I>you</I> thought <I>Gatsby</I> dealt with the power of human illusion
or with the failure of the American dream
and
so on, but what the novel is <I>really</I> about is race." The static
nature of the analyses is ensured by the curious
absence of <I>history.</I> Why was the postwar so different from the
Progressivist era? What is it that happened that
made pluralism and its attendant racism so prominent? To explore the
changing demographics or immigration patterns of
the 1920s, to understand the effect of a world war on the modernist ethos,
would have gone a long way in explaining why
Robert Cohn res so prominently in <I>The Sun Also Rises</I> or why Tom
Buchanan is reading a book called <I>The
Rise
of the Colored Empires.</I> An historical study, especially of the war
period, would also demonstrate in what ways
"identity essentialism" became important in nations other than the U. S.
In Thomas Mann's <I>Buddenbrooks</I> ,
for example, national identity is still an attribute one has as a German
citizen plain and simple, and the emphasis is
on social and economic class. But for the Mann of <I>The Magic
Mountain</I> , racialized identity has become a
central concern. The shifting of national boundaries after the war, the
influx of Eastern European Jews into Germany
and
the West, the questions of the Sudetenland and Alsace-Lorraine: all these
produced a strong emphasis on the need for
racial purity.

<P>
Just as literary texts seem to have no historical determinants, so they
have, in Michaels's spatialized, structuralist
paradigm, no authors. He makes, for example, no distinction between Ernest
Hemingway, an author who never offers the
slightest critique of the anti-Semitism of his central characters--an
anti-Semitism that he obviously shares--and
Faulkner, whose understanding of the complexities of black as of white
people is of a very different order. Or again,
Hart Crane's touching explanation, made in a letter to his patron Otto
Kahn, that he is having difficulties completing
his long poem <I>The Bridge,</I> whose aim, so the poet claims, is nothing
short of writing "the myth of America," is
simply taken at face value: Crane's "efforts to capture" the myth, we
read, "revolve around the re of a Pocahontas"
(<I>OA,</I> 48). But this is to underplay the intense lyric charge of
<I>The Bridge,</I> its inability to produce "the
myth of America," even as the poet himself is cruelly anatomized.

<P>
History doesn't count, authors don't count, and, perhaps most
problematically, the reader doesn't count. No matter that
99 percent of Faulkner's readers are entranced precisely by the
differences between Jason and Quentin (and Quentin and
Benjy, and Quentin and Caddy) rather than the obvious similarities of the
Compson siblings. No matter that no one
outside the American Studies classroom would so much as read the many
minor ethnic novels that provide Michaels with
his
exempla. In fact, the weight of evidence, the endless plot summarizing and
teasing out of nativist themes becomes quite
tedious, even in this short book. Tedious, that is, until the last ten or
so pages, when the book's polemic thrust is
spelled out, when Michaels unleashes his critique of our own identitarian
moment, a moment in which, all too often, the
"American" past is understood as "the Native American past, the African
American past, the Jewish American past, and so
on." (<I>OA,</I> 128)

<P>
"Why," asks Michaels plaintively, "does it matter who we are?" For


<B></B>

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The real question . . . is not <I>which </I>past should count as ours but
why <I>any </I>past should count as ours. . .
. the history we study is never our own; it is always the history of
people who were in some respects like us and in
other respects different. When, however, we claim it as ours, we commit
ourselves to the ontology of "the Negro," to
the
identity of "we" and "they" and the primacy of race. [<I>OA, </I>128]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Thus, <I>"instead of who we are being constituted by what we do, what we
do is justified by who we are"</I> (<I>OA,</I>
140; my emphasis). Such pluralism or identity essentialism, Michaels
believes, is itself the thinly veiled racism we
now
practice.

<P>
But to what extent is "who we are" determined by "what we do"? As the
Austrian and German Jews found out by 1932 or
1933, what they "did"--which was pretty much what all other Germans
did--cut no ice with the Nazis, no matter how well
educated, assimilated, baptized, church-going, or blond and blue-eyed they
might have been. And what about Bosnia,
where
the Serbs have brutally murdered and raped women identified simply by the
signifier of gender as <I>women,</I> never
mind what these women had <I>said</I> or <I>done?</I> In an imperfect
world, as the history of our brutal century has
taught us, identity is largely a question of how others perceive us. And
that perception depends, in turn, on a host of
psychological, political, and cultural factors, with each case being
slightly different.

<P>
It is this sense of difference that brings us back--or it should bring us
back--to the question of the <I>literary.</I>
What is literature anyway, and why should we study it? On the last page of
<I>Our America,</I> we read:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
nativist modernism invented a new form of racism and produced a new model
not only of American identity but of the
other
identities that would now be available in America. . . . Because that
conception of culture found its fullest
expression
as a literary phenomenon and (not, in my view, coincidentally) because the
decade of the 20s produced a great number of
exceptionally interesting literary works, I have focused most of my
attention on American literary modernism. Whether
or
not the privileged position of literature as the carrier of cultural
heritage is enviable, it is real and, even though
it would certainly be useful to deal with a range of phenomena wider than
I have attempted, I believe that any account
of nativist modernism would end up making American literary history
central. [<I>OA,</I> 141-42]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The assumptions behind this eloquent conclusion deserve to be unpacked.
Why, to begin with, should "literature" be the
"privileged" "carrier of cultural heritage"? Why not music or the visual
arts or historiography? More important: the
notion of "literature" as a "carrier" (it sounds like a vaccine!) implies
that it dispenses something outside and above
literature that is "real" and can be accessed by means of a verbal
conduit. But what and where is this really real that
the literary vaccine injects?

<P>
"The decade of the 20s," Michaels insists, "produced a great number of
exceptionally interesting literary works." A
strange statement, this, coming from an anti-aestheticist like Michaels.
For what is it that makes "literary works"
"interesting"? And what is it that makes interesting works "literary"?
Since Michaels refuses all qualitative criteria,
confuting, as the dust jacket of <I>Our America</I> puts it, "the
canonical,


<B></B>


the popular, and the less familiar,"
we can only conclude that what makes certain literary works of the 1920s
"exceptionally interesting" is that they
exemplify the nativism that is Michaels's subject. Those works of the
1920s that don't so exemplify--say Stevens's "The
Snow Man" or Crane's "Voyages," or Stein's portrait of Paul
C&eacute;zanne--are evidently not
"exceptionally interesting." And evidently they are not "literary" either
since they are not privileged "carriers" of
the nativist message.

<P>
"I believe," writes Michaels, "that any account of nativist modernism
would end up making American literary history
central." Here is the salvage operation by which Michaels's brand of
cultural studies would like to save literature, to
preserve it as a field of study. But it will not do. For why do we need to
study literature in order to learn about the
identity politics of the 1920s? Surely there are more informative and
efficient ways than to read dozens of what are
largely undistinguished novels. What, in other words, can "literature"
teach us that the study of American history,
culture, and politics can't? Indeed, I would posit that if literature has
no other function than to be the privileged
"carrier of cultural heritage," its study will soon be an anachronism. If
we can offer our students nothing better than
the moral imperative to read the novels of Nella Larsen and Jean Toomer
and Willa Cather because they will teach us
about the "cultural heritage" that they "carry," the response is likely to
be a collective and extended yawn. What
nineteen-year-old will be impelled to read lesser novels written seventy
years ago on that argument?

<P>
The study of literature, modernist or otherwise, needs better
justification than Michaels gives it. The fascination
exerted by, say, <I>The Sound and the Fury</I> is that it is at once
utterly specific and documentary (one can go to
Oxford, Mississippi and photograph the buildings that people Faulkner's
universe) and yet entirely imaginary,
mythological, and fantastic. Insofar as the novel embodies nativist
notions of miscegenation and reproductive marriage,
it resembles the work of any number of lesser novelists, as Michaels
points out. But if we regard the glass as half
full
rather than half empty, we would have to go further and say, Yes, but look
at the astonishing subtlety of Faulkner's
treatment of the nativist theme. Again, if the nativist project were all,
why the astonishing linguistic invention that
characterizes <I>The Sound and the Fury?</I> Why not just substitute a
Cliff Notes pr&eacute;cis for the novel? Surely
the "ideas" remain intact. And at the ideological level, it may well be
the case that Faulkner's novel is no more
"interesting" than La Farge's <I>Laughing Boy,</I> which dates from the
same year .

<P>
Ironically, then, Michaels's contention that the notion of a racialized
identity will emerge as "the crucial feature of
modernism" (<I>OA,</I> 141), is itself nothing if not an essentialist,
indeed an inadvertently racist, claim. For
modernism does not, cannot, belong to the United States alone, much less
to any segment of U. S. culture or decade of
U.
S. writing. Modernism, as I noted above, goes back at least as far as
Baudelaire and Manet in France and includes the
poetry of Vladimir Mayakovsky and fiction of Andrey Bely at least as much
as it includes the fiction of Hemingway and
Fitzgerald. To cordon off American modernism, not to mention the fiction
of the American 1920s, from the larger world
in
which it functioned is to assume the existence


<B></B>


of a national (and
hence also racial) purity, an ethos that
separates "us" from "them."

<P>
But even if we could define American modernism according to its time
frame, nationality, and set of family
resemblances,
it is impossible to assert that it has one "crucial feature." Michaels
knows this well enough, knows that his
discussion
of nativist modernism has less to do with the 1920s than with what he
perceives to be the regressive identity politics
of our own day. But in insisting that nativism, with its attendant racism
is "the crucial feature" of American
modernism, Michaels is doing no more than perpetuating a narrow stereotype
of Americanness. Broaden the base,
substitute
Gertrude Stein's <I>Geography and Plays</I> for Carl Van Vechten's
<I>Nigger Heaven,</I> or Djuna Barnes's Greenwich
Village sketches and short stories for Sherwood Anderson's <I>Dark
Laughter,</I> and watch the map of American
modernism
change its shape.

<P>
Paradoxically, <I>Our America</I> will thus be of interest chiefly to
those already committed to the racialized
identity
politics Michaels claims to be critiquing. Its prerequisite is a
familiarity with the ethnic literature of the 1920s--a
literature that stakes its claim precisely on racial and cultural grounds.
But for those of us who are not racial
purists and who do not subscribe to the "cultural heritage" theory of
literary texts, <I>Our America</I> is not so much
wrongheaded as it is tautological. Race is always and only race. But then
what? "The difference," as Gertrude Stein
(and, by the way, just what was her racial identity?) put it in <I>Tender
Buttons,</I> "is spreading."
