Archaeology quite obviously deals with the past, as its name indicates,
but it is also the case that it does so in the present. It is very much
in the present, as and when it is practiced, that archaeology produces
knowledge about the past; it is in the present that this past is itself
appreciated and appropriated; and it is in the present that the many
values and uses it presents&#x02014;for the present&#x02014;are recognized
and pursued by its practitioners and promoters. That much we know: the
challenge is to translate this broad statement of principle into some
dedicated line of inquiry, one which would help us understand in much
more tangible and sensitive ways just what archaeology is all about,
and why is it of such interest in so many ways.
<p>
One way to do so, adding some complexity but also much-needed
enlightenment, is to turn to the history of archaeology. But not, of
course, just any history. Ever since the emergence of archaeology as a
field of scientific research, its practitioners have been interested
in their disciplinary past. All too often however this interest was
motivated by a concern for the creation of lineages and the legitimation
of authority. Encompassing the heroic accounts and accredited milestones
of discoveries, such internalist appreciations of the discipline have
often reduced themselves to a chronicle of the inexorable progress
of scientific knowledge. On the contrary, to delve fruitfully into
the disciplinary past, to appreciate the double lesson of familiarity
and alterity that it brings, to understand that at each of its moments
archaeology is practiced in the present, we need at the onset to adopt
a perspective that is both highly attentive and immune to veneration,
neither overly dazzled by the achievements of our


<b></b>


"genial founding fathers," nor, at the other extreme, dismissive towards
the supposedly "unscientific" errors of our predecessors. Alongside the
great discoveries, together with the persevering men (and sometimes
women) of genius, the history to be sought is that of the science in
action, of the half-forgotten controversies and errors of yesteryear,
of the routine operations so fundamental as to be self-evident, and
indeed of all these episodes and practices deemed unfit for inclusion
in the official or authorized histories of the discipline.
<p>
This last point, regarding the sources for the history of archaeology,
is indeed an important one. In terms of their contents, accessibility
and sheer quantity, archaeological publications obviously constitute
an important historical resource. But it must not be forgotten that
articles and monographs, regional syntheses, and interpretative essays
all constitute a literary genre in their own right, made to abide
by patterns of reference and authority, their scientific contents
recast according to ideal standards of objectivity and demonstration,
their rhetoric channeled into a retrospective succession of facts
and theory, methodology and results, solid knowledge and volatile
speculations. To reach the science in the making as much as the
applauded result, to grasp the quotidian as much as the extraordinary,
historians of archaeology need to turn to another essential resource,
namely the archives of the discipline. These are the various papers,
correspondence, manuscripts, drafts, internal documents, field-notes,
inventories, sketches, illustrations, prints, etc. produced as part of the
archaeological enterprise and accumulated since at least the seventeenth
century in museums, libraries, archaeological services, and archival
repositories. Archives constitute this crucial resource for re-collecting
and researching the history of archaeology&#x02014;a resource all the more
valuable if, for all its inherent fragility, occlusion and neglect, it
could be made known and accessible to a greater number of archaeologists
and historians who would then exploit and valorize these archives.
<p>
In effect, access to such archives makes it easier and more compelling
to appreciate the proposition that archaeology is, and has always been,
practiced in the present. And that, at each of the past events or episodes
of its practice that one may select: the 1930s quest for the cradle of
humankind in Africa, the sixteenth-century questions over <i>naturalia</i>
and <i>artificiosa,</i> the circumstances surrounding the opening of the
<i>Mus&#x000E9;e des antiquit&#x000E9;s nationales</i> in 1862, the running
of the schools of archaeology in Rome and Athens before the Second World
War, the schemes of artifact-based interpretative frameworks proposed by
C. J. Thomsen, Gabriel de Mortillet, Oscar Montelius, or William Flinders
Petrie, the background to the Folsom controversies in North America, the
debate over quaternary stratigraphy and its uses in nineteenth-century
Europe, the structuring of archaeological research in India and the Far
East after independence, the contemporary reception of Johann Winckelmann
and of the Comte de Caylus, etc.&#x02014;the chronological jumping back
and forth of these examples is of course deliberate, to remind us that
history really need not be a linear or teleological chronicle.

All this constitutes the rationale and modus operandi of the AREA
(ARchives of European Archaeology) network, a European Commission-funded
research project dedicated to researching and documenting the
history and the archives of archaeology. Leading institutions from
across Europe&#x02014;universities, museums, archaeological services,
research centers&#x02014;unite to encourage research on the history of
archaeology, to study and catalogue in a dedicated online database the
main archival fonds bearing on the history of the discipline, and to
explore the relations between the development of archaeology and the
challenges of cultural and political identity. More information about
the AREA network, its partners, activities, and productions can be
found at <i>www.area-archives.org</i>. Besides several publications,
the activities of the AREA network will focus for the coming months
on the organization of a major international conference, "Histories of
archaeology&#x02014;archives, ancestors, practices," which will be held in
G&#x000F6;teborg, Sweden, 17-19 June 2004. Further preliminary information
on the aims and scope of the conference, and contact coordinates, can
be found on the website <i><a href="http://www.historiesofarchaeology.org">www.historiesofarchaeology.org</a></i>.
