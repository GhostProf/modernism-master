<p id="lead">Those who acknowledge any relationship between Hollywood film and F. Scott Fitzgerald's fiction generally confine themselves to claiming either that Hollywood's demands and seductions interfered with Fitzgerald's already strained efforts to write "serious" fiction or that Hollywood studios have mostly botched their adaptations of his work.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  However, <i>The Beautiful and Damned </i> shows that the relationship between film and Fitzgerald's fiction is more complicated and more important than generally acknowledged both for his work and, more broadly, for fiction written during the cultural ascendancy of Hollywood film. Although in recent decades scholars have generally seen <i>The Beautiful and Damned </i>as a tonally incoherent, failed novel and therefore have given it relatively little attention, I would argue that its very tonal incoherence actually makes it worth studying.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Once one understands film's previously unacknowledged but crucial role in provoking and conditioning that incoherence, one can recognize the unappreciated extent to which Hollywood film shaped Fitzgerald's "serious" fiction beginning quite early in his career. Indeed, as a hyper-precise representational medium, as a purveyor of American fantasies, as a codified array of formal devices, and as a growing cultural power, Hollywood film not only structures the thematic and diegetic registers of <i>The Beautiful and Damned </i>but also significantly shapes its literary techniques. </p>

<p>Though this article focuses on <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>, film's influence both on Fitzgerald's technique and on the habits of vision shaping his technique have much broader implications for the study of American fiction. If indeed film did open up new 

<b></b>

 techniques for Fitzgerald well before he ever worked in Hollywood—and if (as in <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>) film did so without his even noticing or at least without his being able to treat the influence as an opportunity rather than a problem—then it becomes both sensible and productive to pursue the possibility that film contributed substantially to the formal and phenomenological shifts discernible in American "literary" fiction written in the first decades of the twentieth century, especially after the emergence and rapid consolidation of the feature film (say, 1917 onward). We may well discover that we should understand film not merely as a cultural threat to literary fiction or even as a set of techniques that forward-looking authors might have adapted to their own purposes but also, more fundamentally, as an especially influential crystallization of new habits of vision and cognition made not only available but in fact inevitable by the changing cultural and technological landscape of early twentieth-century America.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup> </p>

<p>In particular, such a reappraisal of film's influence suggests the value of understanding American fictional modernism in terms of the phenomenological shifts both promoted and evidenced by the developing American (particularly Hollywood) cinema. Admittedly, whether Fitzgerald is a modernist is a vexed question. His avowed literary priorities, his public persona, and the mass appeal of so much of his work would certainly seem to place him outside the literary high American modernism of, say, Gertrude Stein, John Dos Passos, or William Faulkner. It is therefore tempting to finesse the question by bestowing upon him a more particular label, perhaps "Jazz-Age writer." However, Fitzgerald's work, especially his early novels <i>This Side of Paradise</i>  and <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>, clearly demonstrates his interest in the formal strategies characteristic of literary modernism, and it seems important to stress that at least some of those strategies emerged from American mass culture (here, Hollywood film) at least as much as they emerged in opposition to it. </p>

<p>Many scholars and general readers alike see Hollywood as having influenced Fitzgerald's fiction primarily by distracting him from writing more of it and by cheapening what he did manage to produce, and that mistaken impression seems to come from understanding Fitzgerald as the uneasy marriage of what John Dos Passos called in 1945 "two divergent halves."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  In this view, Fitzgerald's better half struggled to produce "serious" fiction (mostly his novels), while his lesser half profited handsomely by pumping out ephemeral short stories and bad film scripts.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Scholars who accept this view of the divided Fitzgerald concede that Fitzgerald needed to sell commercial work in order to make a living while he wrote his serious fiction, but they also argue that his high wages came at a high artistic price. For example, one critic claims that Fitzgerald's attempts from 1919 to 1925 to write short stories that could easily be made into movies had the consequence of producing fiction larded with improbable plot twists, "ineffectual humorous comments referring to Hollywood filmmaking," and "unnecessarily drawn-out pictorial scenes."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Others claim that Fitzgerald's stints in Hollywood from 1927 until his death in 1941 prove that working there "was degrading of the human spirit."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> </p>

<p>This contempt for Hollywood film, veiled or otherwise, has further distracted attention from film's more fundamental influence on Fitzgerald's formal techniques by encouraging a widespread tendency to regard all filmic adaptations of Fitzgerald's novels 

<b></b>

 with suspicion and to treat as potentially praiseworthy only those adaptations that bring his novels to the screen "with a true sense of fidelity to the original source material."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Although critics judging by the yardstick of fidelity (or "authenticity") occasionally find that a given adaptation manages to live up to the Fitzgerald originals, more likely they will write about Hollywood's "carelessness and outright tawdriness" leading to "a Technicolor tragedy" that proves "Hollywood's inability to filmically replicate the written word."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  But fidelity or lack thereof is a side issue. In order to understand how Hollywood shaped <i>The Beautiful and Damned </i>(and Fitzgerald's other fiction), one has to look beyond both Fitzgerald's time in Hollywood and the adaptation of his novels. After all, even those scholars most dismissive either of film per se or of specific filmed adaptations nonetheless acknowledge that Fitzgerald "was fascinated by Hollywood even as he was repelled by it" and that his fiction "exhibits many filmic qualities."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  In fact, in reading <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>, if we take Fitzgerald's fascination with film seriously, we quickly discover that it extends beyond an interest in "sumptuous sets [and] detailed costumes" and stray references to movie stars.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">
Arc-Light Fiction: Realism, Romance, and the Anxiety of Social Change 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>I accept the scholarly consensus that the novel's tonal incoherence arises from Fitzgerald's inability to decide whether to satirize or to lament the decline of his protagonist's privileged class, but I argue not only that film contributes far more directly to that incoherence than generally acknowledged but also that film inflects Fitzgerald's own technique even—or especially—in those parts of the novel in which film menaces the literary values that Fitzgerald as implied author champions. I therefore spend much of the article establishing film's surprisingly complex and pervasive contributions to the novel's plot and theme. In particular, I show both that film is a crucial and overdetermined nexus in the novel's growing anxiety about social change and that its anxiety both partially derives from and significantly engenders its overt and increasing wariness of film's growing cultural power. That wariness marks the best spots to look for clear instances of the profound but subtle ways in which film shapes the novel's formal features. Indeed, only in the context of that wariness can the extent and significance of the novel's film-inflected technique become clearly perceptible and demonstrable as such. </p>

<p>In her excellent work on the connections between D. W. Griffith's heroines and the female characters in <i>Tender is the Night</i> , Ruth Prigozy has noted in that later novel two of the same features that I want to stress in <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>: an awareness of "the moving pictures as a major occupation" and an interest in "the dissolution and degeneration of a privileged class."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Indeed, in her attentiveness to popular culture's "particularly strong impact on Fitzgerald throughout his life," Prigozy makes in passing a crucial point about the simultaneous modern skepticism and old-fashioned melodrama of <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>. Noting Fitzgerald's deep admiration for—and saturation in—D. W. Griffith's work, Prigozy writes, 

<b></b>

 </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Fitzgerald's old-fashioned melodramatic scenes in <i>This Side of Paradise</i>  and <i>The Beautiful and Damned </i>, as well as countless stories presented in a thoroughly modern style, could lead one to comment as Aaron Latham does of the earlier novel: "He took his lifelike modern novel and turned it into a gaslight drama which would have been more at home back in the nineties."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">While Prigozy helpfully suggests the complicated nexus of melodrama and modernity in Fitzgerald's fiction, more recent film scholarship by Rick Altman, Linda Williams, Ben Singer, and Miriam Hansen has suggested that we can understand Griffith's melodramas and film melodramas in general not as cultural products opposed to early-twentieth-century technological and cultural modernity but rather as part of cinema's vital role in developing audiences' sensory and affective adaptation to modernity.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> </p>

<p>It is in that light that I wish to consider what Prigozy calls the "melodramatic" (Fitzgerald would have called it the "romantic") character of much of <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>. Even if one were to grant that "Griffith offered his audiences a vision that served as a balm to an age of profound stress and anxiety," one would have to say that <i>The Beautiful and Damned </i>does no such thing.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Above all else, Fitzgerald's vexed relationship to his protagonists and their fate is overwhelmingly likely to exacerbate any such readerly stress and anxiety. Likewise, even if one were to accept Latham's description of <i>This Side of Paradise</i> as a "gaslight drama," one would nonetheless have to treat <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> as a very different kind of novel. It doesn't nostalgically transform modern stories into older ones but rather enacts a complicated and corrosively unresolved clash between modernity and a way of life imagined in nostalgic reaction against the very experience of that modernity. </p>

<p>Indeed, rather than as a "gaslight drama," one might see <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> as "arc-light fiction," as a novel in which modernity encroaches upon and undermines the priorities and traditions of what Latham and Prigozy designate "gaslight drama." We can see this very clearly in an allegorical interlude at the beginning of the novel. Directly before this interlude, the novel's blueblood protagonist Anthony Patch is sitting in his luxurious apartment, enjoying the city from the apparent safety of his wealth. Although he lives in a thoroughly modern city, his values are those of an older world because his inherited wealth creates a social and sensory buffer between him and the city. He cannot yet imagine the looming world war or the incipient dissolution and degeneration of his privileged class. For example, the elevated trains' rumbling provides a faint note of change and danger, but Anthony cannot take that danger seriously; the noise merely reminds him of "a fantastic romance he had lately read in which cities had been bombed from aerial trains." For him, the el and the "continued low blur of auto horns from Fifth Avenue" seem unimportant, even pleasant, because "his own street was silent and he was safe here from all threat of life  . . .  safe, safe!" In fact, Anthony experiences the modern city as a sort of domesticated sublime, an improvement on mere nature: "The arc-light shining into his window seemed for this hour like the moon, only brighter and more beautiful than the moon."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  The novel, of course, proceeds to eliminate that sense of safety. And film is central to that elimination. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>We get the first real suggestions of film's importance to the destruction of Anthony's privileged safety in the allegorical birth of Beauty interlude that immediately follows this mention of the arc light. Fitzgerald's use of the term "arc-light" prepares us for those suggestions. Arc lights would have been familiar to Fitzgerald's readers not only as streetlamps but also as lights commonly used on film sets.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  And if the arc light by itself doesn't get the reader thinking about film, Fitzgerald's header for the birth of Beauty interlude should. He calls it "A FLASH-BACK IN PARADISE."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  This interlude, in which eternal Beauty and an incorporeal Voice discuss what form Beauty will take in her next mortal incarnation, sets up the connections between film and the novel's central conflict between satire and idealization. The Voice tells as-yet incorporeal Beauty, "At first it was thought that you would go this time as an actress in the motion pictures but, after all, it's not advisable" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 29). At this point in the novel, we don't know why it would be inadvisable because we don't yet know that Beauty will take the form of socialite Gloria Gilbert, Anthony's eventual love interest and wife. At this point, we haven't yet seen Gloria and Anthony drain the beauty and money out of each other's lives until they find themselves completely disenchanted with one another and nearly bankrupted by their protracted legal appeal, pursued jointly against his grandfather's estate regarding his lost inheritance. In short, we don't yet know that the novel chronicles the destruction of both this incarnation of Beauty and the privileged class in which and for which it appears, and we don't know that film and the cultural and technological forces that it symbolizes will wreak that destruction. </p>

<p>The novel's tonal incoherence and self-contradictions emerge because Fitzgerald never decides whether the destruction of safety and Beauty by film and all that it stands for is cause for celebration or mourning. We can see this ambivalence in the novel's persistent inability to settle into either realist or romantic mode. (The terms "realism" and "romance" have a long and contentious history in literary criticism; I use them here in accordance with Fitzgerald's own formulations in the early and mid-1920s.) In a letter written while he was still working on <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>, Fitzgerald draws a sharp distinction between realism and romance. He writes, </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Up to this year the literary people of any pretensions—Mencken, Cabell, Wharton, Drieser (<i>sic</i>), Hergeshiemer (<i>sic</i>), Cather and Charles Norris have been more or less bonded together in the t against intolerance and stupidity but I think that a split is due. On the romantic side Cabell, I suppose, would maintain that life has a certain glamor that detailed reporting—especially this reporting of the small mid-western town—can not (<i>sic</i>) convey to paper. On the realistic side Drieser (<i>sic</i>) would probably maintain that romanticism tends immediatly (<i>sic</i>) to deteriorate to the Zane Grey—Rupert Hughes level. . . .<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">In Fitzgerald's letters and fiction, romance often requires the creation of an illusion.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  His version of realism, on the other hand, refuses the seductions of illusion in order to scrutinize the object hidden in and distorted by glamor's glow; as such, Fitzgerald's realism almost inevitably involves social critique and the debunking of myth.  </p>

<p>Although the birth of Beauty interlude in many ways seems inherently "realist" (debunking) because it asks readers to imagine "<i>the unity </i>[of soul, spirit, and body]<i> sought </i>

<b></b>

 <i>for by philosophers through many centuries</i>" in the form of "a ragtime kid, a flapper, a jazz-baby, and a baby vamp" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 31), beneath the whimsical irony we find the conflicted desires that both animate the novel and contribute to its deep ambivalence about its protagonists. No matter how ugly Anthony and Gloria's behavior and beliefs become, Fitzgerald refuses to deny the beauty of their illusions. Though he satirizes the ignorance and denial underlying Anthony's romantic tendencies, he also strives to show how those tendencies make Anthony attractive and, through him, make Gloria glorious. Particularly in the early parts of the novel, Anthony's illusions give them both a glow; Anthony for having them, Gloria for abetting them. Fifty pages or so after the birth of Beauty, we find a passage that in a purely realist novel would be tonally ironic that nonetheless registers as perfectly sincere: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Out of the deep sophistication of Anthony an understanding formed, nothing atavistic or obscure, indeed scarcely physical at all, an understanding remembered from the romancings of many generations of minds that as she talked and caught his eyes and turned her lovely head, she moved him as he had never been moved before. The sheath that held her soul had assumed significance—that was all. She was a sun, radiant, frowning, gathering light and storing it—then after an eternity pouring forth in a glance, the fragment of a sentence, to that part of him that cherished all beauty and all illusion.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
	(<i>B&amp;D</i>, 73)
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Here, Fitzgerald clearly identifies Gloria as Beauty's avatar, and he makes Anthony's romance with her the power source of all the novel's romance. Such beauty, he implies, like all beauty, may ultimately be illusion, but in this passage at least, illusion has no negative valence. Indeed, while the novel may in realist mode tear apart those illusions, it does so with palpable regret. When Anthony and Gloria's illusions disappear, their gaiety and glamor disappear also and their home begins to reek of "the wretched aura of stale wine [and] the inevitable suggestion of beauty gone foul and revelry remembered in disgust" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 296).  </p>

<p><i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> repeatedly suggests that debunking illusions produces more disgust than insight, which largely explains why the birth of Beauty episode exists at all, that is, why Fitzgerald found it necessary to frame his otherwise earthly plot in terms of unearthly allegorical res. Allegory is ideally suited to effect a romantic "unity" of body, soul, and spirit in a work of realist fiction skeptical of the possibility of such unity because allegory is the form of <i>this-but-also-that</i>, in which the possible <i>this</i> stands in for the impossible, and often incommensurate, <i>that</i>. Frederic Jameson has described allegory as "precisely the dominant mode of expression of a world in which things have been for whatever reason utterly sundered from meaning, from spirit, from genuine human existence."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  If we press Jameson's formulation to include history, that is, to register not just an actual separation of things from meaning but also a longing for there to be—that is, for there to once <i>have been</i>—meaning, we see how a belief in the sundering of things from meanings actually reflects a need to create absent meanings in order to explain present things. Inventing the "romancings of generations" creates an "understanding" that Anthony can experience not as created but rather as remembered. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>The novel not only employs allegories that testify to the fundamental separation of the concepts that they bind together but also itself becomes an allegory for its own impossibly self-contradictory aspiration to bind together romance and realism as Fitzgerald understood them at the time he wrote the novel. Just before the long passage depicting Gloria as a solar eternity, Anthony experiences a powerful desire "to paint her, to set her down <i>now, </i>as she was, as, with each relentless second, she could never be again" but then says to her, "I'm not a realist . . . . No, only the romanticist preserves the things worth preserving" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 73). Whereas the realist chronicles the passing of presence into absence (or simply denies the reality of presence in the first place), the romantic forestalls that passing by embedding presence in memory. But attempting to embed such romantic moments in a realist mode of chronicling induces an authorial multiple personality disorder, a split between Fitzgerald the realist and Fitzgerald the romanticist. By tracking the destruction of Anthony and Gloria's illusions, Fitzgerald sides with time. But by attempting to preserve the ground of their illusions, he attempts to transcend time and avoid change. In so doing, he undermines the clarity of his analysis of Anthony and Gloria's degeneration and thereby betrays a conservative terror of social change. </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">
Shoddy Realism: The Rise of Film and the Threat to "Serious" Literature 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>Although few of the few scholars who write about <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> discuss it as a sociopolitical novel, the centrality of terror of social change to the novel's tonal incoherence demonstrates that one cannot make sense of the novel—or at least make sense of why it doesn't make sense—without careful attention to that change. In particular, I want to stress the importance to the novel of the acknowledged, fundamental historical features of that change—immigration, urbanization, and the concomitant erosion of established socioeconomic hierarchies. Indeed, one cannot make sense of either the novel or its incoherence without attending both to the novel's increasing tendency to link those features of change to movies and, ultimately, to the threat to literature that those features (and, by virtue of that linkage, that movies) come to represent in the novel.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> </p>

<p>Film's literal and symbolic connections to immigration, urbanization, and shifting hierarchies are frequent and fundamental. Film executive Joseph Bloeckman embodies them with particular clarity.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Bloeckman serves as Anthony's foil from start to finish; as Anthony falls, Bloeckman rises. And to take Anthony's place, Bloeckman has a lot of rising to do. Bloeckman's biography is a sort of composite history of a number of European immigrants, many of them Jews like Bloeckman, who got into movies while movies still bore the stigma of low-class amusement and who then became prosperous as the movies attracted larger and more affluent audiences.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  So, although Bloeckman is a "proud and dignified man" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 97) who has already succeeded in business, in the early parts of the novel he still has much to learn about elite, WASP New York society. He is an outsider to its history and traditions, a fact that he makes painfully clear when he attempts to sound rooted and cultured by declaring sententiously to the dinner 

<b></b>

 party, "When a man speaks he's merely tradition. He has at best a few thousand years back of him. But woman, why, she is the miraculous mouthpiece of posterity" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 99). Contemptuously amused, Anthony surmises that Bloeckman has memorized and delivered an intertitle from one of his movies. His contempt for the movies reinforces his contempt for Bloeckman. As Bloeckman continues to prosper, however, he gradually acquires the habits of the ruling class and adapts himself to its traditions. Indeed, by the end of the novel, we learn that Bloeckman's "process of general refinement [is] still in progress  . . .  in his manner there [is] perceptibly more assurance that the fine things of the world [are] his by a natural and inalienable right" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 305).  </p>

<p>Bloeckman's rise parallels and, indeed, represents the rise of the movie business. At the same time that Bloeckman's wealth is helping him move from gaucherie to sophistication, the source of his wealth is undergoing a similar gentrification as the heavily immigrant nickelodeons of early film give way to genteel movie palaces that attract middle- and upper-class patrons as well. So it is a measure of how dramatically Anthony's and Bloeckman's roles change in the course of the novel that after Gloria has failed a screen test (arranged by Bloeckman, a long-time admirer) she dresses up in the hopes that Anthony will take her "to a restaurant or even to one of the great, gorgeous moving picture palaces where there would be a few people to look at her, at whom she could bear to look in turn" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 411). But she has no money and Anthony is drunk again, and so she gets no glamorous evening out. Instead, a few pages later, a sloppily drunk and penniless Anthony finds Bloeckman at Bloeckman's private club, tries to borrow money, and then insults him, whereupon Bloeckman administers a clinical beating before having Anthony dumped in the street as a "bum" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 437). Bloeckman has by this point Anglicized himself even further by changing his name to Black, and the contemptuous beating that he gives Anthony demonstrates how powerful and genteel film money has made the "goddamn Jew" and how powerless and crude the loss of inherited money has made the once-aristocratic Anthony. </p>

<p>Bloeckman/Black's gentrification has very high stakes not only for Anthony but also for Fitzgerald. If Bloeckman's rise is the rise of film, then Anthony's fall bodes ill for what Fitzgerald considers serious fiction. While Anthony is only sporadically a writer of any kind and only notionally a writer of fiction, he belongs to the educated leisure class that establishes the values of what Fitzgerald treats in the novel as serious fiction. Indeed, in a scene toward the end, we see that film lies at the center of the novel's terror of social change precisely because its ascendancy seems to endanger the literary culture that Fitzgerald values. By the time the scene takes place, Anthony's longtime friend Dick Caramel has become a successful hack novelist and Anthony has stopped pretending to pursue any career but alcoholism. Their separate sadnesses underlie their debate about the changing function of art. Declaring all art elderly and moribund, Anthony predicts that poetry, already vitiated by the last-ditch efforts of the modernists, will die first. Anthony declares, "The beautiful word, the colored and glittering word, and the beautiful simile belong in prose now. To get attention, poetry has got to strain for the unusual word, the harsh, earthy word" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 421). The novel, Anthony contends, is the only literary form left with any hope to take beauty further. At this mention of 

<b></b>

 the novel, Dick takes the opportunity to vent some spleen. "I'm sick of all this shoddy realism," he declares, "I think there's a place for the romanticist in literature" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 421). Neither Anthony nor Fitzgerald, however, seem willing to grant Dick's romanticism the status of literature. Anthony is amused and vaguely horrified to learn than in Dick's new personal library—dedicated to what Dick calls "good American stuff, old and new"—one finds Dick's "execrably awful" novels sandwiched between Twain and Dreiser (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 422); it becomes clear that Dick's romanticism has deteriorated to the "Zane Grey-Rupert Hughes level."  </p>

<p>And, through Anthony, Fitzgerald blames film for that deterioration. As Anthony reflects on the pitiful fiction that Dick has produced since <i>The Demon Lover</i>, we learn that film has made writing such dubious fiction quite attractive. Even while Dick is writing <i>The Demon Lover</i>, he has become aware that "all the new novels are sold to the moving pictures as soon as they come out" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 96). And then in first the two years after the publication of <i>The Demon Lover, </i>Dick makes a great deal of money, Fitzgerald writes, because "the reward of the author of fiction had begun to swell unprecedentedly as a result of the voracious hunger of the motion pictures for plots" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 222). Dick receives a hefty $700 per story in the popular magazines and can count on another $1,000 from movie producers for "every one that contained enough 'action' (kissing, shooting, and sacrificing)" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 222).  </p>

<p>It's little wonder, then, to find much later in the book Anthony musing that Dick stands "accused of making a great fortune by writing trash for the movies." As the fashion in books shift[s]," Anthony thinks, Dick is "becoming almost a byword of contempt" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 422). Some of this contempt, clearly, applies not only to film but also to popular fiction (including Fitzgerald's own).<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  But even though mercenary fiction writers produce just as much "trash" as movie directors, it's important that in <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> the directors have begun to dictate the norms of such trash: it must contain both a happy ending and the appropriate dosages of "action." Indeed, Dick's own diction betrays the extent to which the demands of writing "screenable plots" have infiltrated his thinking (see fn. 6). Echoing the inverted maxim that Fitzgerald makes the novel's epigraph, Anthony warns his successful friend not to let "the victor belong to the spoils." Revealingly, Dick responds, "You mean write trash? . . . . If you mean deliberately injecting a slushy fade-out into each one, I'm not. But  . . .  I'm certainly writing faster and I don't seem to be thinking as much as I used to" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 188). To the detriment of Dick's fiction, not just film vocabulary but also film conventions have begun to shape his thinking. </p>

<p>While Fitzgerald makes clear that he thinks that movies pose a real threat to literature, his reference to the changing "fashion in books" suggests that emerging novelists might be able to continue advancing the cause of Beauty, however much older writers like Dick may have faltered. Indeed, by specifying <i>This Side of Paradise</i> (and only <i>This Side of Paradise</i>) as an example of that new fashion (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 421), Fitzgerald implies that one ought to look to <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> as a test case of that new novel, to see if and how it advances the cause of Beauty despite the death of old arts and the emergence of new ones. In the most obvious senses, <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> 

<b></b>

 succeeds where Dick's novels fail. After all, it stands as a contrast to the ethical and formal norms of contemporary Hollywood cinema, particularly to those that Fitzgerald identifies. It is "full of talk and psychology" and therefore "impossible to make  . . .  interesting on the screen" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 96). And it has no Hollywood ending; good reaps no rewards and evil suffers no comeuppance—worse, we have a hard time identifying any good at all. Further, one of the most important scenes in the novel—its "Symposium" scene—consists of a verbose discussion of philosophy meant to take on an eerie feeling by occurring in the dark, all of which would have presented quite a challenge to a silent filmmaker. Indeed, though no print of William Seiter's 1922 adaptation has survived, extant plot summaries seem to indicate that Seiter ignored those challenges in favor of making a conventional movie about ambition, repentance, and its protagonists' ultimate happiness. So, by neither going heavy on the action nor injecting a slushy fade-out, Fitzgerald avoids the obvious snares that capture Dick, his nightmarish alter ego.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>   </p>

<p>But obvious snares aren't the only snares, and film continues to make its presence felt in the novel. What <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> lacks in shooting and sacrificing, it makes up for in kissing, and that kissing implicitly allies it with precisely the sort of films that have diminished Dick's fiction. During a dinner party at the Biltmore hosted by Gloria, Anthony and Gloria sneak away for a carriage ride, during which they kiss for the first time. As Anthony leans in to kiss Gloria, "she turn[s] her face up to him, pale under the wisps and patches of light that trailed in like moonshine through a foliage" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 102). And then, as they share a kiss "never to be described, scarcely to be remembered," her beauty gives off "emanations of itself which settled transiently and already dissolving upon his heart.  . . .  The buildings [fall] away in melted shadows; this [is] the Park now  . . . " (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 102). When they return to the restaurant, Bloeckman and Dick are discussing "the influence of literature on moving pictures" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 103). So, well before Dick starts injecting slushy fade-outs, Anthony and Gloria's kiss shows that influence between film and fiction has already begun to move in both directions. In particular, the old conventions of romantic melodrama (gaslight drama) that film adopted from literature and stage have first undergone modernization and have then pushed their way back into literature; the arc light has replaced moonlight as the source of romantic glow, and behind this techno-romantic moment one can hear the faint whir of the projector. </p>

<p>Indeed, in a complicated associative knot that shows film's centrality to both the novel's realist <i>and</i> romantic strains, almost all Anthony's kissing has progressively more to do with film. Consider, for example, Anthony's predilection for working-class girls. Before Anthony meets Gloria, he has a minor fling with Geraldine Burke, an usher at a Keith vaudeville theater. A self-proclaimed "good girl," Geraldine is mentally limited and morally conventional. She will kiss but go no further. But just as vaudeville gave way to movies in theaters across America, film later helps an adulterous affair replace this quaint kissing liaison.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  After the draft has made Anthony a private in the army, he leaves the base whenever possible to wander the streets of the small Georgia town nearby. There he meets Dot, the lonely young woman with whom he begins an affair. Anthony begins his seduction by coaxing her to see a film with him at the Bijou Moving 

<b></b>

 Picture Theatre, and most of their subsequent dates also begin at that theater. The Hollywoodish action of kissing thus generates not only the novel's main romantic plot line (Anthony's love for Gloria) but also its realist critique of that plot line (of which Anthony's affair with Dot constitutes a significant part). </p>

<p>As Anthony and Gloria's place in the social hierarchy grows increasingly fraught, we see with increasing frequency and clarity the novel's tonal incoherence about their plight as well as film's increasingly central and complex contribution to that incoherence. One can perhaps best see this in Gloria's pivotal screen test for Bloeckman. From the beginning, Bloeckman has urged Gloria to come to his studio for a test. But Anthony opposes her doing so, so she doesn't accept the offer until Anthony returns from the army (and from his affair) and quickly becomes unendurable. Bloeckman arranges for her to audition for a Cecil B. DeMille parody named Percy B. Debris. During the audition, Gloria plays the wife of a businessman who learns by telephone that her husband has died in an automobile accident, whereupon she collapses with sorrow. Gloria passably acquits herself, but Debris decides that she, now in her late twenties, is too old to play the ingénue and offers her a smaller, less glamorous role of a widow. Panicked, Gloria turns down the role and looks in the mirror. Visible signs of age stun her: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>"Oh, my pretty face," she whispered, passionately grieving. "Oh, my pretty face! Oh, I don't want to live without my pretty face! Oh, what's <i>happened</i>?"</p>
<p>Then she slid toward the mirror and, as in the test, sprawled face downward upon the floor—and lay there sobbing. It was the first awkward movement she had ever made.</p>

	<div class="attrib">
	(B&amp;D, 404)
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">In the birth of Beauty interlude, the Voice has already told Beauty, "Your life on earth will be, as always, the interval between two significant glances in a mundane mirror" (B&amp;D, 29). Here, then, we have that second glance and thus the death of Beauty.  </p>

<p>Film plays a far more ambivalent and complicated role in the death of Beauty than one would expect from a novel that has set itself up as a challenge to the simpleminded stylings of Percy B. Debris, and that complexity shows that film's influence has begun to spread beyond just the novel's plot. The death of Gloria's movie husband could parallel the death of her love for Anthony, and the mirror at the end might well reflect her emotional grief as much as her physical aging. Even if one doesn't accept that interpretation, it becomes clear that film has begun to change the characters' actions and psychologies. Moreover, it becomes clear that film has moved from being a thematic opposite of literature to being part of the novel's representational strategies. Gloria's fall marks not only the end of one illusion but also the re-establishment of a new kind of illusion. She falls, after all, "as in the test." Thus, what Fitzgerald dismisses before (and, to a lesser extent, after) her fall as sentimental twaddle has nonetheless become both the instrument and the mode of meaningful revelation.  </p>

<p>Film has come to play a paradoxical role: it is the illusion that takes over when illusion fails. We see this again, even more powerfully, a few pages later when Anthony yet again visits a grungy speakeasy. Denied "the fruit of youth," Anthony now relies on 

<b></b>

 the fruit "of the grape" in order to preserve "the old illusion that truth and beauty were in some way intertwined" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 417). And he takes particular solace in the ignorance of his drinking companions at the speakeasy:  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>He liked them because they knew nothing about him, because they lived in the obvious and had not the faintest conception of the inevitable continuity of life. They sat not before a motion picture show with consecutive reels, but at a musty old-fashioned travelogue with all the values stark and hence all implications confused.</p>

<p class="continued">Here, only a few pages after Gloria's awkward moment, movies become even more explicitly real life <i>and</i> illusion. Real life is like a feature film, moving irrevocably from one reel to the next in crisp images, but drunken, substitute life is like a murky one-reeler with neither clarity nor development.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  So the passage complicates Fitzgerald's earlier thematizing of film as a medium devoid of thought; film, per se, is no longer an undifferentiated blot on the culture; instead, it has its own traits and history, some progressive, some retrogressive.  </p>

<p>Moreover, by granting film a history Fitzgerald reverses the nostalgic logic of his romantic allegories. Here, film becomes not less interesting as time passes but rather more so because (in Fitzgerald's version) as classical Hollywood cinema replaces the cinema of attractions, values become clearer. In this passage, modern films actually stand for clear and even non-obvious thought. Moreover, as we have seen, modern films also represent the inevitable passage of time and thus the passage into the ever more modern, a dangerous movement in a novel passionately terrified of the passage of each "relentless second." More than the particular valence of film in a particular passage, however, we should note that by this point film has come to influence the novel so thoroughly that it can occupy numerous and sometimes contradictory roles in its signification and symbolism. Indeed, movies have become both a deeply complicated embodiment of and an answer to the novel's terror about time and social change.  </p>

"Never to Be Described": Film as Formal Influence 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>Having tracked film's central role in the novel's incoherence, we are in a position to see precisely how film shaped the novel's technique. Let us begin by returning to Anthony and Gloria's first kiss. The kiss is supposedly "never to be described, scarcely to be remembered" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 102), but not only does Fitzgerald describe how "she turn[s] her face up to [Anthony], pale under the wisps and patches of light that trailed in like moonshine through a foliage" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 102), he also returns to that kiss during one of Anthony's adulterous interludes with Dot: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Anthony had a start of memory, so vivid that before his closed eyes there formed a picture, distinct as a flashback on a screen—a spring night of thaw set out of time in a half-forgotten winter five years before—another face, radiant, flower-like, upturned to lights as transforming as the stars. </p>
	<div class="attrib">
	(<i>B&amp;D</i>, 329) 

<b></b>
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->


</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Both Anthony's memory and Fitzgerald's handling of it have become not only profoundly visual but also profoundly filmic (and the flashback, of course, reinforces the connection between Gloria and Beauty developed since the "Flash-Back in Paradise"). Memory, even memory that preserves the romantic glory of Beauty, becomes timeless by working <i>like film</i>, by functioning like a screen kiss whose participants, like mechanical flowers, turn their faces to ersatz stars.  </p>

<p>That kiss gives us further evidence of how film takes over crucial parts of the novel. Let us remember how Fitzgerald describes Gloria's beauty: giving off "emanations of itself which settled transiently and already dissolving upon his heart.  . . .  The buildings fell away in melted shadows; this was the Park now" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 102). The ellipses are Fitzgerald's, and both the descriptive logic and diction of the passage ("dissolving," "melted") make them function like a dissolve. So, though Fitzgerald describes the kiss as beyond the reach of description and almost beyond memory, he describes it filmically and then does the same with Anthony's memory of those moments. Thus, the kiss that sets the novel into motion not only is the sort of filmic "action" that Fitzgerald claims to resist but also is handled in a film-like dissolve and then revisited via flashback. </p>

<p>Not only does the novel's main plot begin with a filmic moment handled in filmic terms, the scene that ends the plot functions much the same way. On the day that Anthony and Gloria will learn whether they have won their final appeal regarding Anthony's contested inheritance, Anthony decides not to go to court. While he lounges uselessly around his apartment, Dot suddenly reappears. Despite Anthony's having abandoned her, she has come to New York to declare her love and to insist upon their making a life together. Her presence throws Anthony into an insane rage, and he demands that she leave. She initially refuses, and by the time she starts toward the door his fury has taken over: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Uttering a harsh, broken shout, he seized [the stiff oaken chair], swung it above his head and let it go with all his raging strength straight at the white, frightened face across the room  . . .  then a thick, impenetrable darkness came down upon him and blotted out thought, rage, and madness together—with almost a tangible snapping sound the face of the world changed before his eyes . . . .</p>

	<div class="attrib">
	(<i>B&amp;D</i>, 446, ellipses in original)
	</div> <!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Fitzgerald follows this with a section break. Here we have not a dissolve but rather a close-up (or an iris-in) on Dot's face followed by a fade to black. After the section break, Gloria and Dick return to the apartment to tell Anthony that the judge has broken the will and that they will at last inherit all of his grandfather's money. They find that he has temporarily reverted to a childhood obsession with stamps and that he seems uninterested in his windfall. This bizarre behavior suggests that something awful has happened, that he has quite possibly killed Dot. But Gloria and Dick find no evidence of her death when they return, and in the few remaining pages, Fitzgerald says nothing one way or the other. The fade-out has swallowed all certainty.  </p>

<p>Fitzgerald's handling of Anthony's attack on Dot has a complicated relationship to Hollywood film. On one hand, it stands as a triumphant counterexample to Dick's slushy fade-outs; there is no happy ending for Dot, no kiss, no sacrifice. On the other hand, 

<b></b>

 though not quite an actual shooting, attempting to obliterate someone with a chair qualifies as "action," and in a way this fade-out does allow Anthony to inherit his money without scandal or complication and to sail in state to Europe—which might count as a happy ending for any reader not thoroughly nauseated by Anthony and Gloria's self-indulgence and self-pity. And, although in 1922 a conventional Hollywood movie probably wouldn't have left the status of such an important action unclear, it's equally true that, even before the industry adopted the Hays Code, few if any directors would have pointed their cameras straight at the brutal death of a woman, so in a way the fade-out is the clearest evidence that Dot <i>does</i> die. If she were to survive, Fitzgerald wouldn't need to pull down the darkness. </p>

<p>The darkness pulled down on Dot not only eliminates any lingering hope that the radiant, growing light of "all beauty and illusion" will triumph but also, through involuntary formal mimicry, indicates the extent to which film has changed not just the face of Anthony's world but also the novel's style, visual imagination, and narrative technique. Although film's contributions to the Fitzgerald technique is in many ways the most interesting and innovative feature of the novel—and although Fitzgerald in later novels would join other writers in exploring film's formal resources—in <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>, Fitzgerald's phobic reaction to film in this crucial example of arc-light fiction ends in confusion, "all values stark," and then, simply, dark. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT5" href="#REF5">5</a>. The notion of a divided Fitzgerald producing different kinds of work has become such a commonplace that scholars seeking to question that distinction often end up questioning only its particulars 

<b></b>

 rather than its existence. For example, Christopher Ames and Tim Prchal have both separately written reassessments of Fitzgerald's Pat Hobby stories in which they try to rescue those particular stories from relegation to the hack bin. In doing so, however, neither critic can divest himself of the need to draw categorical lines between good fiction and commercial fiction and, especially, between good fiction and Hollywood storytelling. Ames describes Hobby as a victim of the hackneyed, Hollywood plots that he tries both to sell and to put in motion in his own life. As such, Ames sees the stories as satires of "Hollywood storytelling at its worst." Christopher Ames, "Pat Hobby and the Fictions of the Hollywood Writer," in <i>F. Scott Fitzgerald in the Twenty-First Century</i>, eds. Jackson R. Bryer, Ruth Prigozy, and Milton R. Stern (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2003), 289. Prchal also sees the stories as satires of the "Hollywood fantasy factory" that "permeates and romanticizes [Hobby's] self-image"; he argues that Fitzgerald is delicately playing the conventions of the "popular series" against themselves in order to give his work "literary depth." Tim Prchal, "Tune in Next Month: Fitzgerald's Pat Hobby and the Popular Series," in <i>Fitzgerald in the Twenty-First Century</i>, 293 and 292. Even Robert Martin, who seeks to invert the notion of Fitzgerald as a serious writer forced to support himself as a commercial writer, has no problem with the idea that one can and should separate the two kinds of writing both generally and specifically in Fitzgerald's case. So while Martin argues that Fitzgerald was "a commercial writer" who "chose to think of himself as primarily a novelist," he doesn't devote attention to the possibility of connections between Fitzgerald's divergent halves.

If Fitzgerald was attending to plot at the expense of characterization and style, he would have been heeding photoplay writing manuals' injunctions to photoplay writers and fiction writers hoping to have their works adapted into movies that they should do just that if they wanted to write "screenable plots." I take the phrase "screenable plots" from opportunists David Raffelock and Willard E. Hawkins, who in 1925 published a pamphlet entitled <i>How to Write a Screenable Plot into Your Fiction Story</i>.

Craig Monk, one of the few scholars interested in <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i> as a political novel, argues that the novel has a pervading tone of bitter disillusionment attributable to contemporary liberals' disenchantment with Woodrow Wilson and his promises to create a "new world order." See Craig Monk, "The Political F. Scott Fitzgerald: Liberal Illusion and Disillusion <i>in This Side of Paradise and The Beautiful and Damned</i>," in <i>American Studies International</i> 33:2 (Oct. 1995), 60–71. </p>

Martin argues that Bloeckman corresponds to the "businessman-in-the-movies stereotype that Fitzgerald and literary people resented because they were gradually assuming control of a highly profitable industry in which the traditional arts and the traditional credentials of education, taste, and literacy were subordinate to power, money, and 'cheap, trashy entertainment'." I agree with that assessment, but as I make clear below, Martin errs in arguing that Bloeckman never develops any "taste and artistic discrimination." It is precisely the development of those qualities that makes Bloeckman (later Black) such a destabilizing presence. Martin, "Hollywood in Fitzgerald," 131–32 and 136.

What Fitzgerald calls "action," Bok calls "situations" and notes that, "'Situations,' and of the most dramatic and startling character, must be frequent, and two or three murders and a rescue in one chapter are not a bit too many." Edward W. Bok, "Literary Factories," in <i>The Publishers' Weekly</i> 42 (13 August, 1892), 231. </p>

<p>Fitzgerald, who often claimed that he wrote a lot of stupid stories to pay for his and Zelda's high living, here uses the platform of his novel to heap insult upon such stories. When Anthony considers writing fiction to make money, Dick advises him that since novels take too long and pay too little he should instead write popular short stories. He warns Anthony that "unless they're exceptionally brilliant they have to be cheerful and on the side of the heaviest artillery to make you any money" (<i>B&amp;D</i>, 301). </p>

<p><a name="FOOT27" href="#REF27">27</a>. For most of the novel, Anthony remains opposed to movies in general and to Gloria's working in them as an actress in particular. Anthony's objections and Gloria's rejoinder to them mark a distinction between theater and film. "'It's such a hell of a career!' he burst out, the moral, the infinitely circumspect Anthony  . . .  "'I hate theatrical things'." Fitzgerald has Gloria reply, "It isn't theatrical! It's utterly different" ((<i>B&amp;D</i>, 306). Fitzgerald's irony regarding adulterous Anthony's moral indignation highlights film's ambiguous role in the novel. Film is theatrical but also not; film seems morally and socially suspect but also not. As I argue below, its dubious status is directly related to the similarly contested status of the rapidly gentrifying Bloeckman (his "general refinement" is mentioned a page earlier), who has been offering Gloria her screen tests. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT28" href="#REF28">28</a>. Although it is possible that Fitzgerald is using "travelogue" to refer not to motion picture travelogues but rather to slides involving other sorts of projected images (and although that wouldn't undermine my primary point about the historical and diegetic ascendancy of film in <i>The Beautiful and Damned</i>), it seems unlikely. The word seems not to have entered into usage, at least common usage, in America until 1903 or 1904, when famous travel lecturer Burton Holmes began using it to describe his lectures, which since 1897 had included films as part of the program (by 1899 the films were directly related to the lectures)—see Burton Holmes, <i>Burton Holmes Travelogue</i> Volume 1 (New York: McClure, 1910), in unpaginated "Biographical Note." Given the textual context and the fact that, since before Fitzgerald would remember, travelogues could and often did include film segments, it seems likely that Fitzgerald is referring to filmed travelogues in the passage quoted.</p>
