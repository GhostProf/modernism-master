Blitzkrieg, one of those international notions of German origin, like 
"kitsch" or 
"kindergarten," sprang from two types of critical discourse or reflection, 
one 
military or strategic and one more sociopolitical or sociopsychological. 
Let me 
briefly characterize them. 
<p>
In October 1941, shortly after the beginning of the Nazi onslaught against 
the 
Soviet Union in accordance with the "Aufmarschanweisung Barbarossa" 
(Barbarossa 
marching orders) 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">
3</A>
</SUP>
one could read the following in a book 
published 
that year: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
It is too early to see more than the widest outline of what is happening 
in the 
largest blitzkrieg of the lot, that on the Russian front. All we can tell 
is that 
there are some signs that the German forces have been slowed down, and a 
number 
of signs show that they are meeting with an opposition not only powerful in 
numbers and materials, but more effective in its tactics than has been met 
by the 
Nazi Army in almost all its previous campaigns. We cannot tell whether this 
opposition will succeed; but we can say already that the Russians seem to 
have 
attempted on a very large scale the creation of a web of defence that 
separates 
the armoured spear-head of the blitzkrieg from the infantry divisions 
following 
it. . . . The blitzkrieg has decided the 
<B></B>
 fate of too many nations. 
The 
principles that I have emphasized here are to my mind the essence of the 
blitzkrieg: concentration for a "rolling thrust," the linking of various 
arms in 
combat teams, large scale counter-attack as one main element in the only 
sort of 
defence possible, and a web of tank-proof islands of resistance as the 
other main 
element.

<p>
This was written by Tom Wintringham in his introduction to the first and 
best 
description of blitzkrieg doctrine we have, Ferdinand Otto Miksche's 
<I>Blitzkrieg</I>. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">
5</A>
</SUP>
Both Miksche and Wintringham participated 
in the 
Spanish Civil War, the first "Nazi laboratory" for the blitzkrieg. Miksche 
was a 
Czechoslovak major on the General Staff of the Spanish Republican Army, 
while 
Wintringham was a commander of the British battalion. Miksche's book is 
the only 
serious study of the epoch, written by an expert and an eyewitness for 
whom the 
principles of blitzkrieg "were well known by 1939, at the end of the 
Spanish War. 
The road that the evolution of war was taking could not fail to be seen by 
an 
attentive observer who studied it in Spain." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">
6</A>
</SUP>
<p>
What is well known by military historians today as the basic concept of 
blitzkrieg was analyzed by Miksche as a combination of two factors, 
dromological 
(having to do with increasing speed) and territorial (space-making): 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
The first [features of blitzkrieg] are surprise, speed, and material 
superiority; 
the second ones are motorization as method of transport, mechanization as 
method 
of breakthrough [
<I>Durchbruch</I>
], air action as method of support, 
protection, 
and communication--that gives the warfare of to-day a character entirely 
different from that of the last World War. 
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Speed and communication, their articulation or linking by means of new 
hard- and 
software technologies, can be seen as the 
<I>differentia specifica </I>
that 
distinguish blitzkrieg from the war machine of World War I. The new era 
that 
blitzkrieg opened in the history of war is characterized by the use of 
communication weapons and transmission media, by what Heinz Guderian, 
commander 
of the tank troops and one of the first theorists of blitzkrieg, called the 
"concert of weapons," a symphony made possible by new communication 
technologies, 
such as FM radio, facilitating the control of command. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">

</SUP>
<p>
The other discourse mentioned has another horizon and another dimension. 
After 
the beginning of World War II, several entries in the 
<I>Arbeitsjournal </I>
(working journal) of Bertolt Brecht refer to the speed of German 
blitzkrieg 
as an astonishing new aspect of the war machine. Brecht characterizes this 
new 
quality as a substitution of the traditional battlefield by what he calls a 
<I>"Schlachtw&uuml;rfel," </I>
a "battle cube" or "battle 
dice." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">
8</A>
</SUP>
Brecht demonstrated a certain amount of knowledge of blitzkrieg strategy 
and 
tactics, which he may have owed to his friend Fritz Sternberg and his 
<I>Die deutsche Kriegsst&auml;rke </I>
(Germany and a lightning war) 
. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">
9</A>
</SUP>
<p>
But what is even more striking than the brief notes that Brecht makes 
(which can 
be considered in relation to the later 
<I>Kriegsfibel, </I>
the "war primer" 
composed together 
<B></B>
 with Ruth Berlau) is his question about the 
specific kind 
of energy that the Nazis brought into being and literally put on wheels 
("Krupp 
steel on wheels") with their blitzkrieg tactics. This issue, which Brecht 
himself 
rated as especially important to a better understanding of the Nazi war 
machine's 
destructive mobilizing drive, is seen as a consequence of deeper structures 
underlying the relation between civil society and violence. He thought 
that many 
"brave antifascists" had failed to understand those relations and therefore 
remained bound to what later on has been called a "helpless and hopeless 
antifascism" ("
<I>Hilfloser Antifaschismus</I>
"). 
<p>
Let me quote just some of his reflections about the new quality of German 
blitzkrieg from his 
<I>Arbeitsjournal </I>
in order to illustrate this idea. 
<p>
30 June 1940: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
The slow war brings about the fast one (as the inactive precipitates the 
active). 
but how this speed changes everything! whereas with the Germans it is not 
only a 
question of "blitzkrieg," but also of "blitz-armament." and oh what power 
this 
regime wrests from the breaking of all conventions! the most modern 
weapons of 
the sky mingle with tourist cruisers, Karl May complements Clausewitz. 
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
9 April 1941, again considering the driving force of the blitzkrieg war 
machine: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
It is as though only this army could move. it alone creates and controls 
the "3-D 
battle-zone" that has replaced the battlefield. conventional armies will 
compete 
this way like the bobbin with the "Spinning Jenny." courage is lost to the 
maneuverability of a vehicle, alertness is lost to punctuality, endurance 
to 
industriousness. the strategy has become surgery. an offensive country is 
"opened" after it has been anesthetized, then blotted, disinfected, 
sutured, and 
so on, all in excellent time. 
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
29 June 1942: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
The "high morale" of the German troops created a major headache for many 
well-meaning antifascists. they had never before encountered the elements 
of 
violence in parliamentary forms of government: the parliaments supposedly 
represented the consensus of the people. now the parliamentary apparatus 
has been 
torn to shreds and the naked violence (stripped of all its veils) has 
become 
visible. this nudity is no longer recognizable . . . for the lower social 
strata, 
enslavement by the Nazis appeared only a relative one, that is to say the 
intensification (of violence) did not exercise any real influence upon the 
behavior of these strata, at least so long as this intensification did not 
itself 
threaten the whole system of slavery. 
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The point I want to stress, taking Brecht's reflections as in a sense 
symptomatic 
in considering blitzkrieg as the violent eruption of a specific group 
mentality 
particular to a people who had fallen into deep crisis and despair after 
World 
War I, is what has also been stressed by Karl Korsch in his wartime 
correspondence with Brecht as "
<I>Blitzkrieg als geballte linke Energie</I>
" 
("blitzkrieg as concentrated Left energy"). 
<p>
I would like to explore this idea of an alternate construction of 
blitzkrieg, one 
that differs from a typical marxist account. This "rative thesis" (in 
the 
sense of what 
<B></B>
 Walter Benjamin described as a "
<I>dialektisches Bild</I>
") 
circulated among several German intellectuals in exile (Korsch, Benjamin, 
Heinz 
Langerhans, Fritz Sternberg, Wilhelm Reich), who tried to explain Nazism 
and 
fascist war in a way that differed from any Party version. Briefly, some 
main 
points in the argument were formal affinities between fascist mass 
movements and 
working-class movements under the leadership of the German Communist 
Party; the 
fascist recuperation of certain aspects of the workers' organization such 
as 
discipline, a fascination with technology, street demonstrations, etc.; 
and a 
manipulation of social conflicts and property relations in order to draw 
in the 
masses. 
<p>
Heiner M&uuml;ller recalled the idea of "blitzkrieg as concentrated Left 
energy" 
as a ra of the dramatic and dilemma-ridden history of German (and 
other) 
socialist movements. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">

</SUP>
He wrote in his preface to Curzio 
Malaparte's 
war reports, "In the GDR it would have been a text of enlightenment 
[
<I>Aufkl&auml;rung</I>
] about an aspect ignored by the ideological 
consensus of 
the workers' and peasants' state, an aspect that Karl Korsch was the first 
to 
articulate in a letter to Brecht with his thesis on blitzkrieg as 
concentrated 
left energy." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">
11</A>
</SUP>
It was in the same spirit that Karl Korsch 
recommended in a letter to Brecht Sidney Rogerson's book,
<I> Propaganda in the Next War</I>, and discussed critically at some length Heinz Langerhans's 
<I>Implications of the Allied Counterblitz</I>, in which Langerhans took 
for 
granted a "world-wide equality of globally accepted blitzkrieg tactics" 
that 
would promote "an invasion of Europe from the west by forces superior in 
number." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">
12</A>
</SUP>
<p>
There are certain remarkable affinities between Korsch's judgment and that 
of 
Curzio Malaparte in his war reports from the Russian front, written 
between June 
1941 and November 1942 for the Milan newspaper 
<I>Corriere della Sera</I>. 
Nazi 
propaganda officials considered these reports a provocation because of 
Malaparte's earlier opinion that World War II on the eastern front should 
be seen 
as a war of two worker armies, and that the morality of the Red Army was 
by no 
means inferior to that of the Wehrmacht soldiers. 
<p>
In 1932 Malaparte wrote 
<I>Der Staatsstreich </I>
(The coup d'&eacute;tat), 
a 
comparative study of armed putsches in Europe after World War I. From the 
perspective of blitzkrieg, and of Malaparte's own war reports, these 
studies may 
illuminate an important difference as well as a connection between a "total 
state" (or totalitarianism) and the "total war" as described in the widely 
read 
book by General Erich Ludendorf, 
<I>Der totale Krieg </I>
, 
blitzkrieg being 
the ultimate form of total war. Brecht and Korsch discussed the impact of 
blitzkrieg strategy while they were under the impression that the German 
Wehrmacht was successful in its offensive against Poland, France, and the 
Soviet 
Union. They saw it as the coming into being of a new form of strategic raid 
(
<I>strategischer &Uuml;berfall</I>
), qualified as such in one of the first 
appearances of the notion in an article published in 1938 by the retired 
Lieutenant Colonel Braun in 
<I>Milit&auml;r-Wochenblatt </I>
(Military 
weekly): 
"The importance of the strategic raid--also called blitzkrieg--is nothing 
less 
than a gigantic assault operation [
<I>Sto&szlig;truppunternehmen</I>
]. 
Everything 
depends on velocity and surprise." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">

</SUP>
<B></B>
<p>
After Stalingrad however, the draconian measures taken by the Nazis in 
order to 
totalize the war--"
<I>Totalisierung des Krieges,</I>
" as Goebbels called 
it in 
his notorious speech in the Berlin Sportpalast on 18 February 1943--were 
propagated as the best way to shorten the war. "
<I>Totaler Krieg--k&uuml;rzester Krieg!</I>
" ("The more total war--the shorter war!") the audience could 
read on 
the huge banner around the wall of the Sportpalast. In reality this change 
in the 
war strategy was a sort of mad drive precipitated by the prospect of 
military 
defeat; this was the turning point in World War II. Thus Goebbels's 
statement, 
"Today we know very well that the blitzkrieg employed in the Poland and 
West 
front campaigns will be of only limited utility for the East," was 
followed by 
the order: "The total war is therefore the command of the 
hour!" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">

<p>
The Nazi war machine took over all activities of state and civil 
institutions in 
a way described by Gilles Deleuze and F&eacute;lix Guattari: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
Totalitarianism is a State affair: it essentially concerns the relation 
between 
the State as a localized assemblage and the abstract machine of overcoding 
it 
effectuates. . . . Totalitarianism is quintessentially conservative. 
Fascism, on 
the other hand, involves a war machine. When fascism builds itself a 
totalitarian 
State, it is not in the sense of a State army taking power, but of a war 
machine 
taking over the State.

<p>
This echoes the theory of Ludendorf's book; he responds to the experience 
of 
World War I by criticizing Clausewitz and calling for a militarization of 
society 
at all levels. Or, as Malaparte wrote in 
<I>Der Staatsstreich</I>, 
pointing out 
the same distinction, "The police defend the state as if it were a city; 
but the 
army attacks the state as if it were a fortress." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">

</SUP>
<p>
I want now to comment briefly on two examples that illustrate the idea 
from the 
Korsch-Brecht correspondence of "blitzkrieg as concentrated Left energy." 
These 
examples illustrate a collective mentality formed under the pressure of a 
conration that afflicted Europe between World War I and World War II, 
and may 
help us to consider from a new perspective what has recently been called "a 
bizarre compatibility of elitism and populism in fascism," in which "the 
appeal 
of fascism had to do with its presentation as a total state--one that could 
reconcile the nationalism of the right and the syndicalist revolt of the 
left." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">
17</A>
</SUP>
This perspective may prevent us from falling back in 
the 
trap of "helpless antifascism" and help us to face in a critical way the 
different right-wing movements of our own time. 
<p>
The first example refers to the "Fiume adventure": Gabriele D'Annunzio's 
occupation of the Adriatic city of Fiume for fourteen months after the 
famous 
march from Ronchi on 11 September 1919. The "Poet as Commander" himself, 
making 
use of the prophetic semantics of his name, saw in the Fiume action a 
presage of 
Mussolini's later march on Rome in 1922. In this way Fiume could be 
considered as 
a double re (in the sense of Erich Auerbach's concept), connecting two 
events: Garibaldi's march in 1862 and Mussolini's 1922 campaign. 
<B></B>
<p>
As Emilio Gentile recently pointed out in "Fascism as Political Religion," 
the 
Fiume adventure revealed a clear connection with the national movement of 
the 
Risorgimento, a connection that has been obscured by Mussolini's movement 
and was 
later forgotten by postwar historians. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">
18</A>
</SUP>
But Fiume, according 
both to 
Gentile's convincing study and a recent analysis by Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht 
of the 
nationalist prophecy of this event, cannot be seen merely as a "symbol of 
fascism" any more than D'Annunzio can be seen simply as someone who 
invented the 
rhetoric and gesture of Italian fascism. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">
19</A>
</SUP>
One must not 
overlook the 
driving force of either the Garibaldian tradition, which provided the 
basis of 
popular support for D'Annunzio's adventure, or the force of the other 
tradition, 
which springs from the syndicalism of Georges Sorel, and is present in the 
Carta 
del Carnaro, the constitution of Fiume. 
<p>
In D'Annunzio's speeches on the eve of Fiume, we can see the difference 
between 
him and Mussolini. D'Annunzio is a more authentic representation of the 
national 
and social desires for emancipation, while Mussolini emerges as a violent 
and 
repressive "disciplinarian of exuberant energies." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">
20</A>
</SUP>
This 
difference 
becomes clear when we consider the notion of the sublime, which works as a 
sort 
of leitmotif in the speeches of D'Annunzio. The creation "
<I>di un sublime eroe novissimo</I>
" (of a new sublime hero) to overcome the decadent values of 
western 
culture is seen in the tradition of Georges Sorel. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">
21</A>
</SUP>
It was 
Sorel who 
thought that the liberal bourgeoisie had lost every sense and possibility 
of 
"sublime ethics" the moment it adopted "The Marseillaise" as a simple 
party hymn. 
A new sublime (and a sublime politics) was possible only in relation to the 
emancipatory struggle of the proletariat, for Sorel specifically in the 
form of a 
general strike and 
<I>action directe </I>
(direct action): "Why is it that 
in 
certain countries acts of violence grouping themselves round the idea of a 
general strike, produce a Socialist ideology capable of inspiring 
sublimity, and 
why in others do they seem not to have that power?" 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">
22</A>
</SUP>
<p>
The second example refers to the subtitle of my paper and is connected 
directly 
with D'Annunzio's Fiume action. It also marks a clear distinction between 
prefascist discourse and rhetoric in Italy and Germany. 
<p>
In 1922 the thirty-two-year-old Eugen Ortner published a sharply polemical 
essay 
with the title 
<I>Gott Stinnes: Ein Pamphlet gegen den vollkommenen Menschen</I>
(God Stinnes: A pamphlet against perfect man). While nearly forgotten 
today, 
Ortner was, in southern Germany in the 1920s, an author of some renown, 
having 
written plays and novels &agrave; la Gerhard Hauptmann and Frank Wedekind. 
The 
interest and the significance of his 
<I>Gott Stinnes </I>
pamphlet lies in 
the 
fact that amid a large mass of disillusioned postwar writings pertaining 
to the 
perceived negative consequences of the Versailles treaty, against the 
<I>Dolchsto&szlig; </I>
(backstab) legend, amid, therefore, all sorts of 
utopic 
visions offered to a people in despair, Ortner integrated those aimless 
energies 
in accordance with the principles of a totally collectivistic society, 
whose 
dignified and sublime symbol is the character Hugo Stinnes. Stinnes 
represents 
the idealized re of the modern energies of industry and the masses, 
thus 
incorporating the businessman and the leader of the masses at the same 
time: 
<B></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
Because in Stinnes and in Lenin, everything is founded upon masses, 
everything is 
collective, and there is no longer any such thing as personal culture. And 
it is 
also certainly true in Stinnes as well as in Lenin that in the end the 
entire 
system is based upon obedience, without which there can and never will be 
organized masses. . . . It can certainly no longer be denied, even by the 
most 
extreme individualist, that we are approaching an era of the mass human 
being. 
<SUP>

</SUP>
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Whereas in Spain someone like Ortega y Gasset, in his 1923 essay on 
"Invertebrated Spain," was diagnosing the mass-era critically, Ortner's 
prophecy 
is purely apologetic. Ortner is nonetheless realistic in pointing to the 
authoritarian tendencies in the postwar society of Germany (and in Europe 
generally). Ten years later, the analysis of German workers and low-level 
employees that was conducted by the Frankfurt Institute for Social Research 
revealed, as we may remember, the danger of a widespread authoritarian 
mentality. 
<p>
In the aftermath of the Stinnes-Legien Treaty, signed by Hugo Stinnes on 
behalf 
of the Unternehmerverb&auml;nde (the associations of the entrepreneurs) 
and by 
Carl Legien, the chief of the General Commission of the German Trade 
Unions, on 
15 November 1918, Ortner's text can be read as an apologia. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">
24</A>
</SUP>
More 
significant, however, is the rhetorical device that concentrates social 
energies 
on a single point: the integrated power of the machines and the masses. It 
is 
this same point that, transformed into pure destructive power, goes on to 
constitute the blitzkrieg war machine. The sublime becoming pure sublime 
in its 
fascist form: that is to say, eliminating all elements such as fear, 
horror, and 
critical self-consciousness--all of which have constituted since Kant the 
notion 
of the modern sublime--and substituting for them pure monumentalism, 
heroism, 
populism, and the F&uuml;hrer cult. 
<p>
Ortner describes this dynamic as the substitution of the "totality man" by 
the 
"combinatory man," the symbolic re of the former being D'Annunzio. 
Thus he 
bids "Goodbye to D'Annunzio" ("
<I>Abschied von D'Annunzio</I>
"): 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
There is no path joining Hugo Stinnes's world of experience to that of 
Gabriele 
D'Annunzio. No clearer illustration can be found of two worlds, one in 
decline 
and the other on the rise, than in these two types. In fifty years, a 
person who 
even slightly resembles D'Annunzio will no longer be possible in Europe. 
Not that 
I am comparing him in any way with all of those vain individuals who I have 
listed here. We take leave of him with the kind of cheerful melancholy to 
which 
the last totalitarian member of a great, dying culture is entitled. Stinnes 
destroys D'Annunzio, Stinnes destroys the artists. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">
25</A>
</SUP>
<!--_/extract--></BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
The annihilation of the artist by the re of "God Stinnes" can be read 
as an 
image of the dissolution of the sublime. D'Annunzio's still-political 
sublime is 
deconstructed, with "God Stinnes" as the new energetic artist--be it as the 
politician incarnated as a fascist F&uuml;hrer, or as a commander of the 
blitzkrieg war machine (Heinz Guderian, for example, a commander of tank 
troops, 
considered himself an artist). 
<B></B>
<p>
As we know, a modern concept of the sublime can be seen historically as 
emerging 
from the experience of war and of revolution. Edmund Burke wrote on behalf 
of the 
sublime and against the French Revolution. Francisco Goya represented 
another 
re of the sublime in his 
<I>Collosus</I>, in the 
<I>Caprichos</I>, and 
in the 
<I>Desastres de la guerra</I>. He shaped a critical sublime that, in 
Picasso's 
<I>Guernica</I>, with its depiction of the first experience of blitzkrieg 
attacks 
by the Nazi "Legion Condor" in 1937, opened a new era of the political 
sublime as 
art form. 
<p>
The conration of a specific fascist sublime, which according to Walter 
Benjamin can be considered the epicenter of the aesthetization of politics, 
contributed to a generalized suspicion of the sublime as a conduit of 
ideological 
mystifications and the engineer of reification. It seems, however, that the 
sublime is with us more than ever.

The very condition of late capitalism is to render thought (but not the 
writing 
of critical essays) impossible. Commodities circulate in a dizzying vortex 
of 
speed; simulacra hollow out a vast abyss in the place of the real; Elvis is 
everywhere. Fredric Jameson calls this a hysterical sublime; Baudrillard 
stays 
cool. . . . [Kant] describes the sublime . . . as follows: the sublime 
presents 
an object that exceeds cognition, and the subject experiences a mixture of 
pleasure and pain, pain at the incapacity of the faculties to come to 
terms with 
this object and pleasure at the capacity of the faculties to recognize 
their own 
incapacity.

The apparently seamless forms of commodification that now characterize 
global 
capital and the boundless conration of a New World Order present us 
with a 
dynamic sublime at once excessive and ubiquitous. Money in capitalism thus 
becomes, in Terry Eagleton's words, "an infinitely spawning signifier 
which has 
severed all relation to the real, a fantastical idealism which blots out 
specific 
value as surely as those more conventional res of sublimity--the raging 
ocean, the mountain crags--engulf all particular identities in their 
unbounded 
expanse." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">

The commodity moves in "an unstoppable metonymic 
chain in 
which one object refers itself to another and that to another, to 
infinity." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">

</SUP>
At the same time, the electronic technology that 
permits 
the accelerated solubility of one commodity into another, that speeds up 
circulation by eliminating the material weight of the commodity, rendering 
it 
increasingly virtual, introduces the mathematical sublime, those 
inconceivably 
small mechanical and logical components of artificial intelligence. 
<p>
These are, basically, arguments whose roots lie in the critical theory of 
the 
Frankfurt School. Along with the Toronto School of Communication, albeit 
in a 
different way, the Frankfurt School writers were among the first to 
recognize the 
critical problems posed once information itself becomes a matter for work 
and 
commodification, once a culture industry causes or allows representation to 
inhabit the base as well as the superstructure, confounding the distinction 
between production and reproduction. 
<p>
We may recall Adorno's assertion that "the Absolute became absolute 
horror"; 
German culture, the insistence on the autonomy of the spirit and the 
absolute 
<B></B>
 nature of idealism, participated in a motion that culminated in 
Auschwitz. 
This is, according to Joshua Halberstam, the inhuman and cruel consequence 
of 
every idealism taken to its extreme. 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
Kant does not entail Auschwitz. That charge would be an outrageous 
calumny. But 
Kant leads to Auschwitz. He leads to other places as well--some heroic and 
ennobling. But any moral theory which begins by disregarding human 
sentiment, 
caring and sympathy, might well end in crematoria. In the legend, God 
takes hold 
of compassion and creates a world. In the twentieth century the Nazis 
renounce 
compassion and almost destroy that world.

So what about the sublime, and a politics of the sublime, given this 
perspective? 
<p>
I think we have to distinguish a fascist sublime--in the sense of the 
Nazis who 
considered themselves to be the movement of 
<I>national Erhebung </I>
(insurrection), etymologically drawn from the original German term for 
the 
sublime, the 
<I>Erhabene</I>
--from another notion of the sublime. Since 
"all 
efforts to render politics aesthetic culminate in one thing: 
war," 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">
30</A>
</SUP>
and since Kant himself noted war as an example of the dynamic sublime in 
<I>The Critique of Judgment</I>, it is tempting to assume that the invocation of 
the 
sublime belongs entirely on the side of fascism in this dichotomy. The 
sublime 
introduces terror and death into aesthetics; having accepted terror and 
death as 
primarily aesthetic rather than political, fascism seeks to return them to 
society. Fascism's aestheticization of politics is the extraction of all 
political meaning in favor of aesthetic criteria. 
<p>
Thus the depoliticization of the sublime, for which blitzkrieg and its 
discourse 
offers a symptom, symbol, or re, consists in the application to 
politics of 
indeterminate judgments, judgments of taste, as if they were determinate: 
we have 
an idea of the beautiful, and we will make society conform. The idea of 
beauty, 
for example, will find its fulfillment in the social order: in the ordered 
hierarchy organized alongside a return to feudal elements, to 
<I>Blut und Boden</I>
 (blood and soil). This paradoxical understanding goes 
hand-in-hand with 
an appeal to the dynamic sublime on the grounds of technical 
modernization, an 
attempt to make society embody the idea of pure energy rather than mere 
order. We 
can see this in the re of blitzkrieg, for instance, that appears in a 
speech 
made by Hitler to delegates of the League of German Girls (BDM) at the 1935 
Nuremburg Party Rally. This is one of the first recorded allusions to the 
term: 
"I shouldn't negotiate for months beforehand and make lengthy preparations, 
but--as I have always done throughout my life--I should suddenly, like a 
flash of 
lightning in the night, hurl myself upon the enemy." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">
31</A>
</SUP>
<p>
In this sense, a fascist politics of the sublime attempts to present the 
unpresentable, to materialize the idea of energy. The effect of such 
realization 
is to make politics entirely a matter of representation and hence of 
cognition, a 
process of domination that is essentially totalitarian. Fascist 
totalitarianism 
proceeds from the claim that the idea can be an object of cognition, that 
the law 
can be fully represented, in order that determinate judgments can be made 
in 
reference to it. The effect of this, 
<B></B>
 the essence of such a 
<I>gleichgeschaltete </I>
(homogenizing) society--emerging in the 
post-World War I 
era as a movement toward total war, total state, total 
enemy 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">
32</A>
</SUP>
--is to 
preclude any possibility of dispute: the terror of fascism consists in 
saying 
that we are just because we know what justice is. (Remember G&ouml;ring 
proclaiming, "
<I>Wer Jude ist, bestimme ich!</I>
" ["I determine who is a 
Jew!"] 
to those who criticized him for retaining a Jewish general in the 
airforce.) 
<p>
Fascism's politics of the sublime consists in a replacement of cognition 
by will. 
Blitzkrieg is the ruthless transformation of will into violence. 
<p>
I will conclude by saying that blitzkrieg, after its success at the 
beginning of 
World War II and its failure after Stalingrad, and beyond its further 
application 
in other wars, has become an icon representing dangerous tendencies and 
despairing sentiments in the collective mind. We need not look far in 
order to 
observe the transformation of blitzkrieg into a collective symbol. 
<p>
During a German television program about new radical movements in Germany, 
the 
reporter interviewed young members of various so-called right-wing 
movements. 
Among them an approximately twenty-year-old girl, Uschi, said her interests 
included competitive sports, skinheads, Germany, music--and gave as her 
nickname 
"Blitzkrieg." The reporter, visibly astonished, was at a loss and had to 
move 
on.

At a large demonstration in the summer of 1994 on Berlin Alexanderplatz, 
the 
Brechtian actress K&auml;the Reichel referred to the disastrous effects of 
German 
unification on culture in terms of blitzkrieg: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
All conquerors, regardless of whether they came with weapons, dazzling 
glass 
beads, money, or goods, always began by destroying the culture of the 
conquered 
land. And if any proof is now necessary in Germany that since November a 
war has 
been taking place, a German blitzkrieg, then let it be the interaction of 
the 
victors and their paid enforcers with the culture of this 
land.

In October 1990 a London newspaper published an article by G&uuml;nter 
Grass with 
the headline, "The Business Blitzkrieg." Grass explained to his English 
readers 
his well-known critical position on the German unification process and its 
universal significance. He mentioned that after the monetary union in July 
1990 
the media used the term "blitzkrieg" in a highly euphoric manner: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
The way in which the D-Mark has been held up as an article of faith is 
frightening, as if thoughtlessness could be compensated for by money. The 
way in 
which the discussions about the future capital (Berlin) were relayed at 
full 
blast through loudspeakers was worrying. The standardization of public 
opinion, 
as expressed across the spectrum from 
<I>Der Spiegel </I>
to 
<I>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung </I>
to 
<I>Die Ziet</I>, had an oppressive effect. In 
both 
parliaments the initial State Treaty was thoughtlessly rushed 
through. 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">

</SUP>
And it was frightening to read reports of success 
according to which the strategy of the blitzkrieg is now showing its 
strength in 
peacetime by means of a politico-financial pincer movement. Who should not 
feel 
ever more anxious, when German recidivism is 
<B></B>
 demonstrated on a daily 
basis, when carefully learned democratic virtues lose their market value 
overnight, when there is even to be unification of the State Security 
Services, 
when--once again--the largest opposition party ducks the issue because it 
has to 
worry about the slightest reproach of "lack of patriotism"?

In another context, but with striking similarities, Heiner M&uuml;ller 
explained 
his conviction that Japan and Germany are the actual winners of World War 
II, 
given the application of blitzkrieg strategies to market economy. For 
M&uuml;ller, blitzkrieg is a result of the modern industrialization of 
war, "the 
continuation of economy by other (military) means, leading through total 
realization [
<I>Verwertung</I>
] of labor power in the concentration camps, 
to 
annihilation of production in extermination. Auschwitz as an industrial 
product." 
<SUP>
<A NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">

Blitzkrieg is seen as a sort of double re 
(again 
recalling Auerbach) strategically positioned between pre- and postwar 
economic 
struggles. 
<p>
The idea that media not only played an important role in the blitzkrieg war 
machine, but created a particular space for perception, has been related by 
Marshall McLuhan who describes, one might say, the shift from the ivory 
tower to 
a control tower as a way of approaching our work as critical "headworkers": 
<BLOCKQUOTE><!--_extract-->
The first and most vital step of all . . . is simply to understand media 
and its 
revolutionary effects on all psychic and social values and institutions. 
Understanding is half the battle. The central purpose of all my work is to 
convey 
this message, that by understanding medias as they extend man, we gain a 
measure 
of control over them. And this is a vital task, because the immediate 
interface 
between audile-tactile and visual perception is taking place everywhere 
around 
us. No civilian can escape this environmental blitzkrieg, for there is, 
quite 
literally, no place to hide. But if we diagnose what is happening to us, 
we can 
reduce the ferocity of the winds of change and bring the best elements of 
the old 
visual culture, during this transitional period, into peaceful coexistence 
with 
the new retribalized society.

Whatever this utopian version of a new tribalism might entail, McLuhan's 
warning 
should be heeded, it seems to me, especially when we face violence. Given 
our 
experience with the new electronic media blitzkrieg of the Gulf War, we 
are at 
the beginning of a new era in the modern history of warfare and of civil 
society, 
an era increasingly threatened by tendencies toward a total state. And 
these 
recent invocations of the term and concept of blitzkrieg show that we 
remain--not 
just on the Left and the Right but in the Center too--na&iuml;vely 
enchanted by 
this terrible idea.

The original reads: "Alle Eroberer, ob sie nun mit Waffen, blendenden 
Glasperlen, Geld oder Waren in die L&auml;nder kamen, haben immer zuerst 
die 
Kultur des eroberten Landes erschlagen. Und wenn es jetzt eines beweises in 
Deutschland braucht, da&szlig; hier seit November ein Krieg stattgefunden 
hat, 
ein deutscher Blitzkrieg, dann ist das der Umgang der Sieger und ihrer 
bezahlten 
Vollstrecker mit der Kultur dieses Landes" (
