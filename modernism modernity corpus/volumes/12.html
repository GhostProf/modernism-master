<p class="noIndent">
The early 1860s are white years. The arrival of "sensation" as a byword for the breathlessly modern in these years (as in "sensation drama," "sensation novel," "sensation paragraph") seems curiously wedded to that color. To be more precise, the sensation era is ushered in by a series of female res identified with whiteness. In <i>The Woman in White</i>, Wilkie Collins's seminal sensation novel of 1859-1860, drawing-master Walter Hartright becomes embroiled in a complicated plot by villains Sir Percival Glyde and Count Fosco to steal a young woman's identity. The first of many narrative shocks comes in the form of his chance moonlit encounter with a mysterious young woman, Anne Catherick, dressed all in white, who is fleeing from a private asylum for the insane. The first of the special-effects-driven sensation plays to make an impact in London was Dion Boucicault's <i>The Colleen Bawn</i> , in which the son of the manor tries to extricate himself from a secret marriage to a poor young woman, Eily O'Connor, by having her murdered. The title derives from the Irish <i>cail&#x000ED;n b&#x000E1;n</i>, sometimes translated "darling girl," but literally meaning white or fair-haired girl. Like <i>The Woman in White</i>, <i>The Colleen Bawn</i> was a huge popular success, and inspired a whole range of spin-offs, including an opera whose title continues the white theme, <i>The Lily of Killarney</i>. Perhaps the floral title of the opera offers us one clue to what whiteness might mean in this context: vulnerability&#x02014;these heroines are pure and delicate blossoms; orphans of the storm that is modernity, or angels cast out of the house into a cold world. To this extent these women in white might be seen to represent 



sensation-era revivals of the res of virtue in distress that are at the heart of all nineteenth-century melodrama.
</p>

<p>
But whiteness was also finding its way into the fine-art galleries, notably the Berners Street Gallery, where a painting by James Abbott McNeill Whistler, <i>The Woman in White</i>, was exhibited in the summer of 1862. Better known now as <i>Symphony in White No. 1: The White Girl</i>, or simply <i>The White Girl</i> (and this is the title that I will use here), thiswas the first of his attempts at a new type of "painterly" painting. The girl was the young Joanna ("Jo") Hiffernan (sometimes Heffernan), Whistler's Irish model and mistress, who appears in many of his other works of the 1860s: <i>Wapping</i> ; (probably) <i>The Lange Leizen of the 6 Marks</i> ; <i>Symphony in White No. 2: The Little White Girl</i> ; <i>Symphony in White No. 3</i> (1865-1867); <i>The Artist's Studio</i> ; <i>Whistler in his Studio</i> , as well as the uncompleted <i>White Note</i> (1861-1862<i>)</i>, and the dry-point sketch, <i>Weary</i> .<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  In <i>The White Girl</i>Hiffernan, wearing a simple white muslin dress, stands on a wolf-skin before a white curtain, her long, loose red hair providing a brilliant contrast to her pale surroundings (<a href="#1"> 1</a>). Rejected by the Royal Academy earlier in the year, the painting caused a sensation when it appeared in June at Matthew Morgan's new gallery. In 1863 it appeared in the Salon des Refus&#x000E9;s at the Palais de l'Industrie in Paris, where together with Manet's <i>Le Bain</i>, later retitled <i>D&#x000E9;jeuner sur l'herbe</i>, it again created a sensation. 
</p>

<p>
With <i>The Woman in White</i> Whistler wished to break with the classical conception of paintings with "content": a picture should have nothing to do with fictional or historical sources outside itself; nor should it have any narrative content of its own. As the later title, <i>Symphony in White, No. 1</i>, suggests, the aim was to subordinate content to form; we are to approach the painting not as a representation of a particular young woman, be it the fictional Anne Catherick as the original title seemed to indicate, or of the real Jo Hiffernan, or even as a re for all young women, but as an artistic composition true to its own internal formal principles. Whistler adopted this new musical title from a review in the <i>Gazette Des Beaux Arts</i> of July 1863 by the French critic, Paul Mantz, who had described the painting as a "symphonie du blanc." He may also have been thinking of the principles of color-use proposed by Michel-Eug&#x000E8;ne Chevreul, the first English translation of whose work appeared in 1854 as <i>The Principles of Harmony and Contrast of Colours</i>, though theories that linked complementary colors with harmony in music had been around since Isaac Newton's <i>Opticks</i>.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  There may be another meaning to the later title, of course: <i>Symphony in White, No. 1</i> also suggests a symphony in "White No. 1," that is, a commercially available painter's pigment.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  This pun further emphasizes the painterly aspect of the piece, drawing our attention to its actual physical nature as paint on canvas. In any case, the later title makes clear that the subject of the painting is not the "girl," but color, whiteness itself, the choice of white over some other color perhaps signaling an ambition to work with the least contrastive of tints (cf. the term "white work" used in embroidery). Imbued with such a will to bravura minimalism, Whistler's work may appear to us less a symphony than a five-finger exercise; one thinks of Gustave Courbet's claim that he learned to paint by drawing a white vase on a white serviette.

<p>How, then, can we link Whistler's white girl with those other white women of the 1860s without foundering on the rocks of self-referentiality? Insofar as <i>The White Girl</i> has a context at all, surely it is not such stuff as sensation drama or sensation novels, but art itself: synchronically the mid-Victorian narrative painting that Whistler rejected&#x02014;William Powell Frith's enormously successful <i>Railway Station</i>, for instance, then on view in the Haymarket, admission one shilling&#x02014;or diachronically, by affiliation, the bold handling of res that Whistler admired in the portraits of Velasquez? I will attempt to show otherwise. In the first section of this essay I will argue that <i>The White Girl</i> is very much of the sensation era, and moreover that it depends for its success on the same shock effects that sustained the sensation novel and drama. In short, I will be suggesting that aestheticism and sensation are formed in the same modern cultural matrix. 
</p>

<p>
But what about the girl in Whistler's <i>White Girl</i>? Does she simply motivate the device through which the painting achieves its particular effects? Is she subsumed into the symphony? Or, to ask a somewhat different question, what is the status of the model in the work of non-mechanical reproduction during the years of aestheticism? To answer these questions I want to turn in the second part of this essay to George Du 

<b></b>

Maurier's enormously successful 1894 reanimation of the sensation novel, <i>Trilby</i>. Marrying a nostalgic evocation of Bohemian life in the Paris of the late 1850s to a sensational plot involving occult mesmeric powers, it captivated readers on both sides of the Atlantic when it appeared in <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, and generated a wave of Trilbymania, a passionate popular interest in anything even remotely connected to the novel. Du Maurier met Whistler in Paris in the 1850s, and they moved in the same circles in London in the early 1860s. As is well known, the painter forced his one-time room-mate to remove from the novel the character of Joe Sibley, "the idle apprentice," a talented but feckless Bohemian who was quite clearly based on him. I want to argue, though, that the novel returns us to their shared past more directly still, and that <i>Trilby</i> offers us not just an insight into Du Maurier's mixed feelings about his Bohemian youth and a few side-swipes at the aesthetic movement, but also a Gothicized narrative of the relationships among Whistler, his model-mistress, and the artwork. By evoking a very different painting of the 1860s, Gustave Courbet's infamous "secret" painting, <i>L'Origine du Monde, Trilby</i>offers a skeptical account of Whistler's avant-garde ambitions.

Whistler spent his apprentice years in Paris, where he sometimes worked at the studio of Charles Gleyre (Monet, Renoir, and Sisley would also study there). There he became friendly with a number of British artists, including the Anglo-French Du Maurier, the two of them becoming frequent visitors at the studio apartment of Thomas Armstrong, Thomas Lamont, and Edward Poynter in the Rue Notre Dame des Champs, later the model for the studio in <i>Trilby</i>. In 1859 Whistler came to live and work in London&#x02014;while maintaining strong ties to Paris&#x02014;renting a studio-cum-flat at 70 Newman Street in Chelsea, which he later sublet to Du Maurier, while continuing to use it himself at times. He seems to have been attracted by two types of modern English subjects in these years: bourgeois interiors, like <i>At the Piano</i> , and paintings and etchings of the "low life" of the Rotherhithe docks, such as <i>Wapping</i> . The impressionistic interior, <i>At the Piano</i>, was accepted at the Royal Academy exhibition in 1860, as was a portrait, <i>La M&#x000E8;re G&#x000E9;rard</i>, in 1861.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Whistler's "Tamise" work is very different in subject, though not in treatment. In a letter to his mother, Du Maurier describes Whistler at work on <i>Wapping</i> in October of 1860: "I see less of him now, for he is working hard and in secret down in Rotherhithe, among a beastly set of cads and every possible annoyance and misery, doing one of the greatest <i>chefs d'oeuvres</i>&#x02014;no difficulty discourages him."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> <i>Wapping</i> depicts a scene in a tavern overlooking the busy Thames in which a red-haired young woman (Hiffernan), perhaps meant to be a prostitute, sits at a table with two men, the human commerce in the foreground doubling the scenes of maritime commerce in the background. Patricia de Montfort suggests that its risqu&#x000E9; theme marks it as a "sensation painting," a piece meant to shock the sensibilities of its original viewers ("WM," 80). Yet despite some mixed reviews, the painting was hung, and was sold. In 1862 his etchings were considered good enough to 

<b></b>

be part of the British section at the International Exhibition then taking place in London, and were favorably reviewed. In terms of Whistler's general reception in London, then, <i>The White Girl</i> was a decided anomaly. 
</p>

<p>
Though first exhibited in London, <i>The White Girl</i> was actually painted in Paris in the winter of 1861, in a studio on the Boulevard des Batignolles. In a letter of February 1862 to Tom Armstrong, Du Maurier relates Whistler's account of the painting and the effect he was aiming at: "Besides this [Breton painting] he is painting the woman in white&#x02014;Red-haired party, life size, in a beautiful white cambric dress, standing against a window which filters the light through a transparent white muslin curtain&#x02014;but the re receives a strong light from the right and therefore the picture barring the red hair is one gorgeous mass of brilliant white. My notion is that it must be a marvellously brilliant thing&#x02014;you can fancy how he described it" (<i>L</i>, 104-8, 105).
</p>

<p>
The first to succumb to the painting's brilliant composition was Whistler himself, according to Du Maurier in a letter to Armstrong of March 1862: "The woman in white is nearly finished&#x02014;Jim working at it all the winter from 8 in the morning; got painter's colic very severely, but worked pluckily through it all" (<i>L</i>, 117-22, 118). Painter's colic, or lead poisoning, was the natural result of Whistler's exposure to the massive quantities of lead white, essentially lead carbonate hydroxide, 2PbCO3.Pb(OH)2, that he was using to achieve his spectacular effects (it would be some years before painters fully adopted the less dangerous zinc white).<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Soon, the painting's intoxicating effect was felt by others. "Sensation" is the term Hiffernan herself uses to capture the reaction to it in a letter of June 16, 1862 to Whistler's American friend, George Lucas: "the White Girl has made a fresh sensation&#x02014;for and against. Some stupid painters don't understand it, while [John Everett] Millais for instance thinks it splendid, more like Titian . . . but Jim says that for all that perhaps the old duffers [that is, the hanging committee of the Royal Academy] may refuse it altogether."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Why did Whistler so clearly anticipate a negative reaction, when the old duffers had not shown themselves to be altogether inimical to his earlier work? A painting like <i>At the Piano</i>, though, was probably already rather on the fringe of what the art establishment considered acceptable. Classical, religious, and historical painting still commanded the greatest prestige in the Academy, though landscape and portraiture also had their place. Genre painting, particularly the painting of modern life, was best received when it had a topical theme or narrative component, like Frith's <i>Derby Day</i>, or <i>Railway Station</i>. Whistler himself describes the inimical art culture of the 1860s within which he tried to create a niche for his own work:

<i>At the Piano</i> could just about be accommodated within this world; <i>The White Girl</i> could not, and the committee of the Royal Academy did refuse his subject-less painting (two smaller canvases were accepted: <i>The Thames in Ice</i> and <i>The Coast of Brittany</i>). Whistler avenged himself in a minor way by describing it in the catalogue as "Rejected at the Academy" when he exhibited it at Matthew Morgan's Berners Street Gallery, part of his effort to "[wage] open war with the academy."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  What repulsed the art establishment was not so much its theme&#x02014;the suggestive <i>Wapping</i>would be accepted by the Academy in 1864&#x02014;but its apparent lack of one, and scarcely better, its impressionistic treatment.

Although any viewers at the Berners Street gallery who had seen the <i>Times</i> advertisement ("Now on VIEW, at the Gallery, 14 Berners Street, Oxford Street, WHISTLER'S extraordinary PICTURE of the WOMAN IN WHITE. Admission 1s, including the gallery of 150 paintings"), or the similar sandwich-board ads, must have been expecting something unusual, they seem to have been no more willing than the Academy to accept readily a painting without a subject, and they were equally perplexed by the painting's lack of "finish."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Here is the reviewer of the <i>Athenaeum</i>: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The most prominent [painting] is a striking but incomplete picture by Mr James Whistler . . . Able as this bizarre production shows Mr Whistler to be, we are certain that in a few years he will recognize the reasons for its rejection [by the Academy]. It is one of the most incomplete paintings we have ever met with. A woman in a quaint morning dress of white, with her hair about her shoulders, stands alone in the background of nothing in particular. But for the rich vigour of the textures, we might conceive this to be some old portrait by Zucchero, or a pupil of his, practising in a provincial town.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
In 1862 Whistler's attempt to modernize painting was interpreted not as modern, but as "incomplete," or as the work of some kind of curious throwback. As for the subject, viewers supplied their own narrative context, assuming that Whistler's startling exercise in color was really an attempt to illustrate Wilkie Collins's <i>The Woman in White</i>: the <i>Athenaeum</i> reviewer continued, "the face is well done, but it is not that of Mr. Wilkie Collins's Woman in White." 
</p>

<p>
This assumption that Collins's novel was Whistler's real "subject" had, to be fair, some basis, since the painting had been hung with the title <i>The Woman in White</i>, and advertised as such. Written by the son of an R. A., and with a drawing-master as its hero, it is a novel that implicitly compares visual art and narrative, and the midnight appearance of the fey Anne Catherick, "dressed from head to foot in white garments" is the novel's iconic moment.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Moreover, Collins's novel was such a luminous success in the early 1860s that it is easy to imagine how visitors to the gallery might see the painting in its after-glow even without the prodding of publicity: in 1862 an unofficial stage version of the novel was packing them in at the Surrey Theatre, and there was also a Woman in White perfume, two dances (the Fosco Galop and the Woman in White Waltz), and various other spin-offs and parodies such as Watts Phillips's play, <i>The Woman in Mauve</i>. So wide were the ripples that spread out from the novel that Whistler's friend and sublessee, Du Maurier, illustrated one of these parodies, F. C. Burnand's <i>Mokeanna, Or the White Witness</i>, which appeared in <i>Punch</i> in 1863 (<a href="#2"> 2</a>).<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>

<p>If Whistler wished to free painting from narrative, and from the tyranny of the Subject, he had made a very curious choice: in 1862 it would have been hard to keep a painting of any white-clad female re out of the powerful orbit of Collins's novel. Though he was presumably quite happy with the free publicity generated by the associations made between his narrative-free painting and the novel, he affected otherwise, and began what would be a long career of writing letters to the press by informing the <i>Athenaeum</i> that the gallery had added the title without his "sanction": "I had no intention whatever of illustrating Mr Wilkie Collins's novel; it so happens, indeed, that I have never read it. My painting simply represents a girl dressed in white, standing in front of a white curtain."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  This seems somewhat disingenuous, since Du Maurier refers to the painting as the "woman in white" as early as February 1862, which suggests that Whistler had in fact at some point used that title, even if he had not read Collins's novel. And whether or not he had read the novel, he could hardly have failed to notice its many spin-offs, and indeed the more general pervasiveness of the "sensation" phenomenon. Years later, in his <i>Ten O'Clock</i> lecture of 1885, he would pour scorn on those art critics who treat pictures like novels, and always try to find out the plot; and yet in this picture he seems to be teasing us to find just such a novelistic connection. 
</p>

<p>
The painting created just as much of a stir when it reappeared in Paris the following year at the <i>Salon des Refus&#x000E9;s</i>, the alternative exhibition ordered by Napoleon III to accommodate the many works that had been rejected by the committee for that year's official Salon. (The extra Salon can be seen to be part of the bread and circuses laid on by the monarch to shore up popular docility in the face of his autocratic rule, part of that mid-century consumer's paradise in which Walter Benjamin read the shape of 

<b></b>

things to come.) According to some reports, Whistler's work was more a <i>succ&#x000E8;s pour rire</i>, than <i>succ&#x000E8;s de scandale</i>, generating ridicule as much as shock (the reaction of the Parisian crowd is described in Zola's <i>L'Oeuvre</i> [1886]). English critic Philip Hamerton describes how each group who passed the painting "stopped instantly, struck with amazement . . . then they always looked at each other and laughed."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Some were more deeply impressed, though. Paul Mantz commented on the painting's strange charm in the <i>Gazette des Beaux-Arts</i>, and coined the term "Symphonie du blanc." Fernand Desnoyers described Whistler as "le plus spirite des peintres" and the painting as a portrait of a spirit, a medium, in his pamphlet on the Salon (<i>LJMW</i>, 74). Whistler's friend, Henri Fantin-Latour, wrote to say that "Baudelaire finds it charming . . . . Legros, Manet, Bracquemond, de Balleroy and myself; we all think it's admirable." Gustave Courbet, reported Fantin, was also struck by the work's spiritual quality: "[he] calls your picture an apparition, with a spiritual content (this annoys him); he says it's good" (<i>WB</i>, 86).
</p>

<p>
What was so unusual about this genre painting of a young woman in a white dress that caused viewers in England and France to be baffled by it, to attack it, to take refuge in laughter, but also in some cases to see it as strangely powerful? As I have suggested, it was not the sort of painting that the Royal Academy favored, but the depth of the reaction to it suggests that there were other factors at work in its reception. In fact, although the viewers of 1862 may have been wrong in seeing Whistler's <i>White Girl</i> as an <i>illustration</i> of <i>The Woman in White</i>, I think they were on to something. <i>The White Girl</i> is not so much an illustration of Collins's sensation novel as its analogue: it is a sensation painting, though not quite in the sense that <i>Wapping</i> is.
</p>

<p>
In the case of the drama and the novel, the term "sensation" testified to a common awareness that there was something qualitatively different about these forms, that they were somehow intimately connected to the modern, to the industrialization of everyday life. One aspect of sensation drama was that it placed the audience within a permanent present: not just through setting, but also through the techniques of suspense, the audience was radically interpellated into the drama. As I have argued elsewhere, the sensation novel worked along similar lines, producing an essentially somatic effect on its readers, what H. L. Mansel memorably called "preaching to the nerves."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  The exemplary instances of this effect were the "sensation scenes" shared by novel and play alike, where the audience or reader's attention is focused on a spectacular set-piece, often a last-minute rescue, or the sudden appearance of a re who is supposed to be dead: the rescue of Eily O'Connor from drowning in <i>The Colleen Bawn</i>; the burning river-boat in Boucicault's <i>The Octoroon</i>; Laura Fairlie's appearance at her own graveside in <i>The Woman in White</i>; the railway rescue in Augustin Daly's <i>Under the Gaslight</i>, Boucicault's <i>After Dark</i>, and many others. For many contemporary critics of drama these scenes meant the upstaging of actors by stage-carpentry, and the usurpation of the play as a whole by its spectacular scenes; for critics of the novel the effect of the sensational scene was to replace all nuance with what Mrs Oliphant called a "simple physical effect."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
This same species of immediately immersive intensity, this "simple physical effect" was deployed by Whistler. His deliberate eschewal of the procedures of the Academy meant that the viewer was forced to come to terms with this particular painting at this particular moment&#x02014;there could be no easy recourse to narrative, symbology, or classical or historical sources. Like the sensation scene, it immersed its audience in a thrilling commodity experience&#x02014;in this respect Eily's immersion in <i>The Colleen Bawn</i> is self-reflexive of the genre as a whole, as is the title of a popular play of 1862, <i>A Moment of Terror</i>.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Whistler, of course, was not simply trying to give his audience a frisson. There was a serious artistic purpose to his shock techniques: he wished to jolt the viewer out of a comfortable and contemplative relation to the work, and to confront him or her with both its hereness and nowness, and its material medium specificity, its nature as paint on canvas. 
</p>

<p>
One effect of the sensation novel and the sensation drama was the pleasurable acclimatization of their consumers to the speeded-up, stimulus-saturated world of Victorian urban modernity; they provide a species of temporal training, a form of shock-lite that inoculates the subject against hyperstimulus.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  "Sensation" at this level takes its part in that modernization of the subject described by Benjamin as taking place on the streets of Paris, and more recently identified by Wolfgang Schivelbusch in the railway carriages of Europe, and by Jonathan Crary in the fine art of the last quarter of the nineteenth century.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Crary, in <i>Suspensions of Perception</i>, argues that after mid-century there arises a conception of the normative modern subject as not just isolated and cellularized, as Michel Foucault has told us, but also focused and alert even in a kaleidoscopic and mobile world. Attention and attentiveness are the keywords of a new discourse that dreams of a focused subject who can withstand the sensory overload of modernity, but this discourse is troubled by "the realization that attention had limits beyond and below which productivity and social cohesion were threatened," that forms of focused attention on one stimulus can tip over into states of distraction, daydream, and reverie.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  In sensation drama and fiction this same dyad of riveted attention and distraction is the animating principle of the entertainment. (Indeed, a scene like the railway rescue, in which the audience has a brief moment to see the hero/heroine snatched to safety before the lights of the train disappear again, resembles nothing so much as the tachistoscope described by Crary, the laboratory apparatus that was used to measure the subject's response to fleeting stimuli.) It is no coincidence that in the sensation novel normal consciousness is always in danger of tipping over into some altered state, where self-presence is extremely precarious. Laura Fairlie comes to resemble the feeble-minded Anne Catherick in <i>The Woman in White</i>; the hero of the <i>Moonstone</i> turns out to have committed the crime himself in a trance-like state; Lady Audley in <i>Lady Audley's Secret</i> ends her days in a private asylum&#x02014;her real secret is that she is mad. (The private asylum lies in the background of many of these narratives, and seems to have been the great middle-class nightmare of the 1860s, far more than Foucault's panoptical prison.) A similar preoccupation with liminal mental states, if not with actual madness, is evident in the fine art of the period, and Crary shows how a number of artists thematize and critique the new discourse of attention/distraction

in their work from the 1860s on. But in the case of <i>The White Girl</i> this thematization, in the form of Jo Hiffernan's distracted, vacant stare, goes hand in hand with an attempt to solicit attention, to retrain the viewer, not as a subject capable of dealing with urban, industrial capitalist society, but as an aesthete who can respond to balanced masses of color, to niceties in shades of white on white, without recourse to explanatory narratives or external interpretive schemes. Whistler, that is, is trying to shape an audience for modern painting. Obviously he cannot recreate the effects of the theater, where a collectivity is tutored in the temporality of modernity; nor can he feed his audience on a diet of suspense and shock over months, as the serial novelist could do. Instead, the artwork galvanizes the audience into a close encounter with the material artwork; not some Paterian idealist encounter, but a more material and abrasive one. 
</p>

<p>
If the conscious effect aimed at by Whistler was the retraining of his audience for a new orientation to the artwork, some commentators at least could register this even while resisting. Here is the reaction of an American critic who saw <i>The White Girl</i> at the French Universal Exhibition in 1867: "[it shows] a powerful female with red hair, and a vacant stare in her soulless eyes. She is standing on a wolfskin hearthrug, for what reason is unrecorded. The picture evidently means vastly more than it expresses&#x02014;albeit expressing too much. Notwithstanding an obvious want of purpose, there is some boldness in the handling, and singularity in the glare of the colours which cannot fail to divert the eye and weary it."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
What the critic glosses as "want of purpose" is not some Kantian non-purposiveness so much as a powerful color-effect aimed at the eye of the viewer without the usual rationale of subject-matter. The eye is captured, and has to adjust not just to the "glare," but also to the minimal contrast of white on white. The reference to the "weary[ing]" effect of this on the eye is not just a throwaway remark, since in terms of nineteenth-century color-theory the painting would indeed exhaust the eye. According to such theories the presence of any of the primary colors (red, blue, and yellow) required the use of the product of the other two to provide "rest" for the eye (<i>CM</i>, 22). But here the eye has to travel from the dazzling red hair across whole swathes of bright white to encounter the complementary product in the green flowers, though blue and yellow (of a sort) are present in the rug and in the wolfskin. The theories of Chevreul and others are being harnessed here to create nervous strain rather than harmony: for the viewers of the 1860s this was a very discordant color-symphony. (In this respect the painting provides a negative anticipation of the use of "soothing" interior design schemes in hospitals to provide an antidote to shell-shock and nervous cases, following the color theories of H. Kemp Prossor [<i>CM</i>, 208].) 
</p>

<p>
That this attempt to fix the viewer's gaze was a violent one is evident: perhaps inspired by his friendship with the Fenian leader John O'Leary, Whistler was prepared to use drastic methods to effect his artistic revolution.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  As it happens, in 1867 Whistler also began to acquire a reputation for violence of a more tangible kind. In Paris he appeared in court for taking part in two street brawls, the first time for assaulting a workman who had dripped plaster on him as he passed in the street below, the second for shoving his brother-in-law through a plate-glass window (he was let off on the first 

<b></b>

occasion; on the second the Judge said "Connu" and fined him). An earlier story of his assaulting a black fellow-passenger while en route back to London from Valparaiso also began to circulate. Even his Bohemian friends did not approve, D. G. Rossetti penning a rather barbed limerick:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">

<br />

<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Rossetti seems to have realized that Whistler's use of white lead was intended as a punch in the eye, as a visual assault on the viewer. And of course not everyone wanted such vigorous treatment: Whistler's career, like that of many proto-modernists, testifies to the difficulties of creating an audience for unfamiliar material. 
</p>

<p>
Of course the extent to which the painting really does break with Academy practice is worth questioning. There are eighteenth-century paintings by Jean-Antoine Watteau that <i>The White Girl</i> appears to cite, and even at the time Paul Mantz linked it to Jean-Baptiste Oudry's Salon painting of 1753, <i>The White Duck</i>.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Nor is the painting empty of all symbolic resonance. If the painting refuses us the sort of "subject" much favored by the mid-Victorian art establishment, it is scarcely a non-representational exercise in pure color, and at least some of its content seems to at once offer and withhold meaning. As with the res of the Colleen Bawn and the Woman in White, the painting draws on a long iconographic tradition of representing female innocence and chastity as white: this is the virginal white of wedding dresses. That Whistler is putting such connotations in play is made more obvious from the fact that Hiffernan is holding a broken lily, while other flowers lie scattered on the floor before her. We are being invited to think of bridal bouquets, as well of the association of young women and flowers, and of course of young women and deflowering. And yet the fact that this young woman is standing on a wolfskin suggests that she is not so vulnerable, that she can keep predators&#x02014;wolves and perhaps even wolf-Whistlers&#x02014;under her heel. This is to address only the more obvious symbolism of the painting. In 1862 we might imagine a range of other meanings at work. The loose white dress invokes its opposite: the fashionable aniline-dyed corseted dress. This, with her loose red hair, links the white girl to the female icons of the pre-Raphaelites, and their studied anti-modernity.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  The whiteness of Hiffernan's skin evokes other kinds of skin, and the racial stakes of the American Civil War, which had been raging since April 1861 (Whistler's brother was an officer in the Confederate army, and Whistler himself, a former cadet at Westpoint, seems to have been rather ashamed at missing his chance for action). Nor is black/white the only opposition in play here. Hiffernan's fair skin and red hair announces an English/Irish ethnic divide. In this light <i>The White Girl</i> must have reminded at least some viewers of the play <i>The White Boy</i> , which dealt with revolutionary Irish secret societies (cf. Whistler's friendship with O'Leary and other Fenians in Paris in the 1850s). But that is another essay for another time.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Whistler's modernism met with considerable resistance. Until the 1880s and 1890s, when major international collectors began to buy up his paintings, it was hard work turning women into arrangements and symphonies, and those into money and prestige.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Until then his work retained the shock-value of violence. The conflict between his vision and that of the art establishment would reach its apogee some fifteen years after the impact of <i>The White Girl</i>, when John Ruskin brought the pugnacious artist fresh notoriety in the July issue of <i>Fors Clavigera</i> by accusing him of "ask[ing] 200 guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face" with <i>Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket</i> . Whistler would learn to his cost, in his action for libel against Ruskin, that the educated public were still closer in their views to the latter's moralized aesthetics than to his own. (One casualty of the jury's hostility to Whistler's aesthetics would be another symphony in white, The White House, his eye-catching new house on Tite Street in Chelsea. Sold at auction after Whistler's bankruptcy, it was bought by Harry Quilter, the <i>Times</i>'s art critic, who had appeared as a witness for Ruskin in the trial.)
</p>

<p>
If Whistler continued to fetishize white, by then he had long broken with red: Hiffernan seems to have largely dropped out of his life in 1866-1867, after his return to London from a mysterious trip to Valparaiso. Weintraub speculates that Whistler's break with Hiffernan resulted from her visit to Paris in his absence, where she posed for the explicitly lesbian work, <i>Le Sommeil</i>. But we will return to Hiffernan's work with Courbet; for now let us turn to the white girl's appearance in another medium, a novel by Whistler's quondam room-mate, George Du Maurier, and one of the first modern best-sellers, <i>Trilby .</i>

In December of 1861, while Whistler was painting <i>The White Girl</i> in Paris, George Du Maurier had plans of his own to captivate the public, not with a painting, but with an illustrated story of left-bank life. While Whistler's progress seemed unstoppable, the sudden loss of vision in one eye had forced Du Maurier to rethink his future in fine art. Since a career as a painter seemed out of the question, he began to work as an illustrator for various London journals, eventually securing a position on the staff of <i>Punch</i>. His letters of the 1860s trace his rivalry with and admiration for Whistler, but also trace Du Maurier's progressive alienation from Whistler's bohemian world, and attraction to the bourgeois domesticity of the Wightwicks, the family of his fianc&#x000E9;e and later his wife, Emma. At first though, he very much lived in Whistler's shadow. In 1860, not only was he subletting Whistler's studio at 70 Newman Street, but he was also making use of the dress coat and waistcoat that the latter had left behind. He describes "Jimmy" as "the grandest genius I ever met, a giant" (<i>L</i>, to his mother, June 1860, 8-12, 11), though he also speaks of his "cutting out" Jimmy at a social gathering . In October he boasts that though Jimmy is the greater "lion" of the two of them there is no rivalry between them&#x02014;and in any case he is more liked than Jimmy is, particularly because of his singing voice, his "Horgin," as he puts it (<i>L</i>, to his mother, 

<b></b>

October 3, 1860, 14-7). (His musical prowess meant a great deal to Du Maurier, and he speculated that he could make a living from his singing if his eyesight failed.) By September 1861, now living at 91 Newman Street, rivalry seems to have turned to mild hostility: "Jimmy Whistler gone to Paris&#x02014;bon d&#x000E9;barras; j'en devenais las; nothing is more fatiguing than an egotistical wit" (<i>L</i>, to his mother, 65-7, 66). His references to Jo Hiffernan seem to mingle jealousy at Whistler's sexual success, and snobbery at Jo's social origins. By 1862 he writes disapprovingly that she was "de plus en plus insupportable et grande dame" (<i>L</i>, to Thomas Armstrong, May 1862, 136-40, 139), and an "awful tie" for the artist (<i>L</i>, to Thomas Armstrong, February 1864, 226-8, 227).
</p>

<p>
But if Du Maurier was increasingly less the Bohemian artist and more the professional illustrator, in 1861 he decided that he could still put his Paris years to good use by writing a semi-autobiographical tale of left-bank life in Paris. As he wrote Tom Armstrong in a letter of December 1861:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
I took it yesterday to the <i>Cornhill</i>&#x02014;24 pages of closely written foolscap, and yet I had eliminated lots . . . [Thomas] Lamont is there as the wise and facetious Jerry, you as the bullnecked and sagacious Tim; the street is our Lady of the Bohemians.

It did not get into the <i>Cornhill</i>, and we hear no more of the untitled story for thirty years, when Du Maurier returns to the Bohemian theme with <i>Trilby</i> , perhaps inspired by the success of that very different tale of studio life, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> . But if his earlier tale provided the germ, by 1894 the story had acquired a more sinister dimension in the form of the relationship between Trilby the beautiful model-cum-laundress turned diva, and Svengali, the novel's Austrian-born Jewish villain. Svengali, of course, entered the language as a byword for manipulation and magnetism, one of a series of such res in the nineteenth-century anti-Semitic imaginary, as Daniel Pick has shown.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Like Whistler, Du Maurier equates the visual and the musical: Svengali is not a painter like the other young men we meet in the novel's early chapters, but a musician and composer, who takes the tone-deaf young Trilby O'Ferrall, and turns her into a singer of consummate ability. While he conducts, she spellbinds audiences with her ability to sing simple ballads and songs without words across a huge vocal range, performing super-human exercises in virtuosity. At the novel's close, though, we learn that there are "two Trilbys," and that the singing Trilby is the creation of Svengali's hypnotic powers: far from being a great singer, she is simply an instrument for his musical genius, her master's voice. When Svengali dies, his hold seems to be broken, and the original Trilby is briefly restored to the novel's band of heroes. But even from the grave Svengali asserts his power over her, and she dies shortly after seeing his portrait.

</p>

<p>
While the novel is now best known for this sensational mesmeric subplot, which was emphasized in subsequent stage and screen versions, in the original novel far more space is devoted to the idyllic evocation of Parisian studio life, and the male camaraderie of the three young British artists: the "Tim" (Thomas Armstrong, later director of the Art and Science Department of the South Kensington Museum) of the 1861 story has become Taffy; "Jerry" (Thomas Lamont, a lifelong friend of Du Maurier's) has become The Laird; and Du Maurier himself, if he is there at all, appears to have become Little Billee (later known as William Bagot). A very English version of Bohemia, their homosocial world has more in common with <i>Three Men in a Boat</i> than it has with Henri Murger's novel of 1851, <i>Scenes de la Vie de Boh&#x000E8;me</i>. Du Maurier's narrative of their left-bank life is chatty, digressive, and playful: readers expecting to be gripped by a swiftly-moving sensational plot must have been baffled. In this sanitized Bohemia, sexual appetency is displaced into gourmandry, and we are treated to lovingly detailed accounts of what the three "chums" eat and drink, rather in the manner of a school-story. This all-male Eden is doomed, though, and the first half of the novel describes the gradual break-up of the male household through Little Billee's growing attraction to the beautiful and good-hearted, but fatally declass&#x000E9;e heroine, Trilby.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Trilby works as a nude model, and we are told coyly by our narrator in Latin, "multum amavit": she has loved many.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  The end comes when Little Billee's strait-laced mother comes from England to persuade Trilby that she will ruin his life by marrying him. Svengali appears in this first section of the novel as a friend of the trio, one of the various satellite characters who frequent the studio. Other minor characters include Lorrimer, "the virtuous apprentice," a thinly disguised version of Edward Poynter (by the 1890s an R. A., and in 1896 President of the Royal Academy), and in the magazine version, Joe Sibley, "the idle apprentice," clearly modeled on Whistler. Whatever his theories of the autonomy of painting, Whistler was well able to see the links between model and artwork when it suited him, and he objected to his representation as Sibley. Du Maurier was forced to make changes to the subsequent book version, substituting "the yellow-haired Antony, a Swiss" (<i>T</i>, 96), a witty man who never made an enemy, for Whistler's character, and removing some of the illustrations (though Whistler, complete with monocle, is still clearly visible in some of the illustrations, e.g., "All as it used to be" in Part Third). 
</p>

<p>
<i>Trilby</i> is based on Du Maurier's memories of his Bohemian years in Paris and London, refracted through the experience of the intervening thirty years, and for much of that period Du Maurier had conducted a series of skirmishes with the aesthetic movement, parodying its affectations and excesses in his series of cartoons for <i>Punch</i> featuring such characters as Maudle, Postlethwaite, and the Cimabue Browns. In <i>Trilby</i>, though, it is the artistic practice of aestheticism that he attacks rather than the pretensions of the aesthetic followers. This practice is embodied not in the relationship between the talented painter, Little Billee, and Trilby, but displaced to that between the musician, Svengali and the model. 
</p>

<p>
When the homosocial world of the studio in the Rue Notre Dame des Champs breaks up, Svengali takes up Trilby as his instrument. At the novel's end we learn from 

<b></b>

Gecko, Svengali's assistant, that the mesmerist turns her into "a singing machine&#x02014;an organ to play upon . . . a flexible flageolet of flesh and blood" (<i>T</i>, 299), through which he is able to express his own musical genius (the phrase "singing machine" suggests that Du Maurier may have seen Thomas Alva Edison's phonographic dolls when he visited the 1889 Paris Exposition). But the novel hints that Trilby becomes Svengali's sexual instrument as well, and the sexuality repressed in the representation of Bohemia as a chummy all-male place returns here in a Gothic register: " . . . with one wave of his hand over her&#x02014;with one look of his eye&#x02014;with a word&#x02014;Svengali could turn her into the other Trilby, his Trilby&#x02014;and make her do whatever he liked . . . you might have run a red-hot needle into her and she would not have felt it . . . " (<i>T</i>, 298).
</p>

<p>
The spiritual love that Little Billee has for Trilby reappears here transmogrified into the barely disguised image of her brutal physical penetration by the swarthy foreign villain. To say that she has been reduced to a mere mouth for Svengali to sing through, then, is not the whole story: his hypnotic powers give him ready access to her whole body. That this idea was titillating as much as daring for the readers of 1894 is clear from the novel's astonishing popularity, and the letters from readers asking for further details of the exact relationship between Svengali and his obedient "organ."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The parallel between Svengali's artistic and sexual interests in Trilby is made clear quite early on when he waxes lyrical about her unusually large mouth: "Himmel! The roof of your mouth is like the dome of the Panth&#x000E9;on; there is room in it for 'toutes les glories de la France,' and a little to spare! The entrance to your throat is like the middle porch of St Sulpice when the doors are open for all the faithful on All Saints' Day . . . " (<i>T</i>, 50). But in this respect he is in fact only continuing a morcellization of Trilby that begins much earlier. <i>Trilby</i> is a novel of fetishization, both sexual and commodity-based&#x02014;people are reduced to particular body-parts; sexuality is displaced into other registers; things behave like people, and people like things. Unsurprisingly, art in the novel is also fetishistic. As Leon&#x000E9;e Ormond pointed out some years ago, Svengali's objectification of Trilby is rather belated, since she "has already been appropriated as an object before Svengali ever sees her" by the artists for whom she sits.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  The first thing that Little Billee does when he meets Trilby is to draw her perfect foot on the studio wall. Much later, the trio revisit their old studio, where they find this same sketch now operating as a sort of shrine. Protected "under a square of plate glass," it is now entitled "Souvenir de la Grande Trilby" (<i>T</i>, 200), and the Laird unsuccessfully attempts to buy this piece of wall as a memento of her (<a href="#3"> 3</a>). By then the three former bohemians each "possessed casts of Trilby's hands and feet, and photographs of herself" (<i>T</i>, 202), but this sketch "was Trilbyness itself, as the Laird thought, and should not be allowed to perish" (<i>T</i>, 202). Du Maurier hints broadly at the species of downward displacement involved in the fascination with Trilby's foot, in a long aside about this "wondrous thing," too often "hidden away in disgrace, a thing to be thrust out of sight and forgotten," though "the sudden sight of it, uncovered, comes as a very rare and singularly pleasing surprise to the eye that has learned how to see" (<i>T</i>, 16). Trilby, it seems, even makes a fetish of this aspect of herself: her foot, this token of "the lordship of woman over all" is her "one coquetry, the only real vanity she had" (<i>T</i>, 16). 

<b></b>

When Trilby becomes famous, it is by an advertising photograph of her in sandals that her former friends recognize her ("Look Sandy, look&#x02014;<i>the foot!Now</i> have you got any doubts?" [<i>T</i>, 244]). The deathly and less jocular aspect of Trilby's aestheticization becomes clearer in the second half of the novel. Without Svengali's controlling power she loses all vitality, but her fading away seems to make her "more beautiful in their eyes, in spite of her increasing pallor and emaciation&#x02014;her skin was so pure and delicate, and the bones of her face so admirable" (<i>T</i>, 266). She becomes, indeed, a White Girl. Svengali exerts his power over her one more time from beyond the grave when his portrait arrives in the post from "the poisonous East" (<i>T</i>, 282), and Trilby dies. The lines between people and things blur further when she sings one more time on her death-bed: when she stops, the doctor who examines her reveals that "she has been dead several minutes&#x02014;perhaps a quarter of an hour" (<i>T</i>, 284).

<p>
In <i>Trilby</i> Du Maurier may be suggesting that all art has reifying tendencies, but there is a more specific target for his animus&#x02014;his former friend Whistler. Whistler's presence in the novel does not, in fact, disappear with the excision of the "the idle apprentice"; he lingers as Svengali. Critics have tended to see Svengali as Du Maurier's nightmare double for Oscar Wilde, but the sinister Austrian mesmerist and musician more closely resembles the eccentric American with the monocle, given to the composition of Harmonies, Nocturnes, and Arrangements.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  The earlier version of the novel explicitly acknowledges the kinship between the more benign Whistler character, 

<b></b>

Sibley, and his demonic other: Sibley is "always in debt, like Svengali; like Svengali, vain, witty, and a most exquisite and original artist . . . [but] The moment his friendship left off his enmity began at once. Sometimes his enmity would take the simple and straightforward form of trying to punch his ex-friend's head."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Whistler's choice of the butterfly as his artistic signature (connoting transformation, beauty, artistic flight, and so on) returns in Du Maurier's depiction of Svengali as a spider (. <a href="#4">4</a> and <a href="#5">5</a>), a creature which captures its prey in its web and then feeds on it. Du Maurier even seems to have based Svengali's vampiric aspect on Whistler: for some of his sitters, such as the French dandy, Count Robert de Montesquiou, whom he painted in 1892, the intensity of Whistler's gaze did indeed seem to drain them of their vitality. As he told Edmond de Goncourt, he felt that "Whistler with his fixed attention was emptying him for life, was 'pumping away' something of his individuality" (<i>WB</i>, 355).<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
But if the demonic Svengali novel preys on Trilby O'Ferrall and lives vampirically on her, who was the object of Whistler's sexual-aesthetic exploitation? Felix Moscheles, another of Du Maurier's friends from his studio days, identifies "Carry," a Belgian girl they had befriended in Malines, as the model for Trilby, but Joanna Hiffernan is a far more plausible original.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  There are a number of indications that Du Maurier was overlaying his memories of Paris in the 1850s with London in the 1860s. Some are links so tenuous that they almost seem beneath notice, such as the fact that in his letters he habitually refers to Jo Hiffernan as "Joe," the name he later gives to Sibley in the novel. But there are stronger clues. Like Hiffernan, Trilby is the daughter of a lapsed Irish gentleman: in Trilby's case this is the hard-drinking "Patrick Michael O'Ferrall, Fellow of Trinity, Cambridge," son of a Dublin physician, a classical tutor who marries a barmaid and is lost to the world of respectability (18, 37); in Hiffernan's, it is Patrick Hiffernan, "an impulsive and passionate Irishman." According to Du Maurier's letters, the latter gave writing lessons&#x02014;the Pennells descibe him as "a sort of Captain Costigan [that is, an Irish character in Thackeray's <i>History of Pendennis</i>], "a teacher of polite chiromancy."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Whistler felt that he might "do something to disgrace Joe's sisters" after their mother's death (<i>L</i>, to Thomas Armstrong, March 1862, 117-21). Trilby possesses Hiffernan's Irish complexion, "a mass of freckles," which contrast with the "delicate, privet-like whiteness" of her neck (<i>T</i>, 13). Her accent is described as "half-Scotch," but her greeting to the three artists, "Ye're all English, now, aren't ye?" (<i>T</i>, 13) is more stage Irish, as apparently is her gift for compliments ("That's Irish, I suppose" [<i>T</i>, 91]). Later, when rumors spread of the humble origins of the great Madame Svengali, it is said that "she had run away from the primeval forests and lonely marshes of le Dublin, to lead a free-and-easy life among the artists of the Quartier Latin, and that she was "blanche comme neige" (<i>T</i>, 238). Like Hiffernan, Trilby puts her good looks to account by modeling for young artists; and like Hiffernan Trilby is not married to the man (in Trilby's case men) she sleeps with. Even the novel's most far-fetched feature, Svengali's occult use of Trilby, recalls Hiffernan's relationship with Whistler, since Hiffernan had acted as a medium at s&#x000E9;ances at the house of Whistler's more famous Chelsea neighbors, the Rossettis, and according to the Pennells, Whistler and Jo had tried something similar at home. Whistler claimed that, "a cousin from the South talked to me, and told me the most wonderful things."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>

What, then, is Du Maurier suggesting finally about the relationships among aesthetic artist, model, and canvas by transforming them into the relationship between Svengali and Trilby? What is involved in shifting the artistic modality of the novel from painting, where it begins, to mesmerism and music? At some level this may be simply a gibe at the musical metaphors beloved of Whistler and his followers; the Symphonies, Arrangements, and Nocturnes. But the mesmerism suggests something else. Little Billee and the other artists may fetishize Trilby just as much as Svengali does, reducing her to a foot, or a face, but Svengali goes further by actually stealing her identity completely, or more accurately by replacing the living Trilby with a puppet, a conduit for his own personality. Such critics as Grossman, Pick and Thurschwell are surely right to argue that Svengali's mesmeric powers re more general late nineteenth-century anxieties regarding questions of influence, charisma, and the nature of the self. But it is just as likely that the instrumentalization of Trilby is Du Maurier's narrative theory of what Whistler was doing in such paintings as <i>The White Girl</i>: the historical Jo Hiffernan is effaced to be replaced by Whistler's formal arrangement; she is abstracted out of existence, turned into a sensational visual effect.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  If Whistler was wary of critics who sought to turn paintings into novels, Du Maurier gives him grounds for such wariness by turning his artistic theories and practice into the stuff of Gothic. Du Maurier is at least as damning in his estimate of the effects of Svengali/Whistler on his audience. Like Trilby, they too are hypnotized by Svengali and Trilby in concert ("And here Little Billee begins to weep again, and so does everybody else" [<i>T</i>, 216]), and captivated by Trilby's "celestial form and face" (<i>T</i>, 220). No less than the popular mass culture to which it seemed to be opposed, aestheticism was just as much about retraining the modern audience, but here that retraining appears as a species of black magic that can raise whole crowds to the pitch of hysteria and infatuation.

<p class="noIndent">
And yet, there is a curious disconnect between the narrativized critique of aestheticism and the sexual menace of the relationship between Svengali and Trilby. Whistler's powerful personality may be the basis for Svengali's mesmeric powers, and the way in which everyone gets their bit of Trilby may re the abstracting processes of Whistler's aestheticism, but there appears to be a certain narrative excess in the way in which Trilby's mouth and feet are fetishized, and in the (related) way in which we are encouraged to think of Trilby's rape over a period of years by Svengali. I think that the source material for this dimension of the novel also derives from the 1860s, but it is not the relationship between Hiffernan and Whistler that is evoked, but rather her relationship with a very different artist, Gustave Courbet, and her role not in the creation of one of the threshold works of aestheticism, <i>The White Girl</i>, but one of the most infamous works in the history of realism, <i>L'Origine du Monde .</i>
</p>

<p>
In 1866 Whistler embarked for Valparaiso in Chile (then engaged in a war with Spain), having told many of his friends that he was in fact going to California. Biographers have speculated that the trip was motivated by his sense of having missed his 

<b></b>

chance for heroism in the American Civil War, though he may also have been avoiding police attention in the wake of his friend John O'Leary's arrest for treason. Jo seems to have done her best to manage his affairs in his absence, selling his work when she could, but eventually she resumed her former career as a professional model. She left London for Paris, where she sat for Gustave Courbet, whom she had met in the summer of 1865 in Trouville with Whistler (and probably earlier in Paris when <i>The White Girl</i> was being painted in 1861/2). At Trouville he had produced a study of her, <i>Portrait de Jo</i> , and in 1865-1866 four versions of a full portrait, the three which Robert Fernier describes in his Catalogue Raisonn&#x000E9; as: <i>La Jo, Femme D'Irlande</i>, or <i>La Belle Irlandaise</i>(Stockholm, probably the original), <i>La Jo, Femme D'Irlande</i>, or <i>La Belle Irlandaise</i> (Metropolitan Museum of Art), <i>Jo, Femme D'Irlande</i>(Kansas City<i>),</i> and <i>Portrait of Jo, or The Beautiful Irishwoman</i> (Collection Rolf and Margit Weinberg, Zurich).<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup> Art historians have speculated that she and Courbet had an affair in these months. Whether they did or not, what Jean-Jacques Fernier describes as "un d&#x000E9;ferlement d'&#x000E9;rotisme" swept over Courbet's studio, and he produced some of his most sensual paintings during Jo's Paris stay.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  The Ottoman diplomat, Khalil Bey, who admired Courbet's erotic <i>V&#x000E9;nus et Psyche</i> , had asked him to produce another version of it for him to add to his already impressive collection of French art. The result was the explicit eroticism, possibly inspired by contemporary pornographic photographs, of <i>Paresse et Luxure</i>, better known as <i>Le Sommeil</i> , in which one of the models is Jo (Robert Fernier identifies her as the blonde, James Rubin as the red-head).<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  As with <i>La Belle Irlandaise</i>, the Hiffernan we see here is not the ethereal beauty of <i>The White Girl</i>, a willowy re who seems to play second fiddle to fabric, but a mature woman of flesh and blood. As with his other nudes Courbet ignores the idealizing conventions of academic painting to achieve effects of startling immediacy and physical presence. 
</p>

<p>
But in 1866 Courbet also painted another work for Khalil Bey that has come to be, arguably, the most notorious painting of the nineteenth century: the unsigned <i>L'Origine du Monde</i>, which shows the torso of a woman reclining with her legs apart; the edge of a sheet covers one breast, and partly covers the other, but the viewer's gaze is drawn to her exposed genitals, shown in close-up, as it were, at the center of the composition (<a href="#6"> 6</a>). This was not a painting for the Salon: Khalil Bey kept it in his bathroom, behind a green curtain. Male guests were invited to view it from time to time (Maxime Du Camp and L&#x000E9;on Gambetta recorded seeing it in the 1860s). <i>L'Origine</i> might be considered a brilliant deconstruction of the fetishistic aspect of art, or an egregious example of it. Certainly, it makes the connection between fine art and the skin-trade abundantly clear, too clear for it to work as drawing-room erotica. Contemporary opinion evinced hostility to the painting and indeed its foreign patron. Charles Beauquier, writing in the <i>Revue litt&#x000E9;raire de la Franche-Comt&#x000E9;</i> in August 1866 wrote: "The famous picture of Two Naked Women has been sold by M. Courbet to a Turkish diplomat. Our painter is making at the moment a pendant to this picture. I don't need to tell you that is as indecent as the first. Dame! For a Turk!"<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
<i>L'Origine</i> seems to have been a rather open secret. In June 1867 a satirical magazine, <i>Le Hanneton</i>, featured a caricature of Courbet by L&#x000E9;once Petit in which the artist appears surrounded by some of his pictures; one of them is a white canvas with a solitary leaf in the middle. The painting disappeared after the sale of the bankrupt Khalil Bey's collection in 1867, to reappear in 1889 in the gallery of De La Narde, an art dealer. Edmond de Goncourt describes seeing it there concealed in a locked cabinet, the exterior of which showed a landscape featuring a snow-bound chateau (possibly <i>Le Chateau de Blonay</i> according to Robert Fernier). Bought by a Hungarian sugar-magnate, the Baron Francois de Hatvany, in 1913, it went to Budapest and dropped out of sight. Jacques and Sylvia Lacan appear to have purchased it in 1957, and they also kept it hidden behind another painting, this time a nude by Sylvia's brother in law, Andr&#x000E9; Masson. As late as 1987 Linda Nochlin, the eminent art historian, could find no trace of the painting, but in June 1995 it was presented to the Mus&#x000E9;e d'Orsay, where it was exhibited behind a glass screen.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>

<p>
In the catalogue to the <i>Courbet L'Amour</i> exhibition held at the Courbet Museum at Ornans in 1996, a number of critics&#x02014;Jean-Jacques Fernier, Mich&#x000E8;le Haddad, and Chantal Humbert&#x02014;suggest that the model for this extraordinary painting is Joanna Hiffernan (an idea mooted at least as early as 1978 by Sophie Monneret), though Humbert suggests that Courbet's "realism" is a more complex affair, and that <i>L'Origine</i> may indeed be a composite of Hiffernan and a contemporary "star" of pornographic photography, Augustine Legaton:<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  "pour r&#x000E9;pondre &#x000E0; la commande de Khalil Bey, le peintre aurait demand&#x000E9; de poser &#x000E1; la maitresse de Whistler, Johanna Heffernan [sic]. Courbet aurait ensuite 'peaufin&#x000E9;' la representation en se servant d'une &#x000E9;preuve semblable de nu [to meet Khalil Bey's order, the painter would have asked Johanna 

<b></b>

Heffernan, Whistler's mistress, to pose. Courbet would then have 'buffed up' the representation with a similar nude photograph]."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Did Du Maurier know of this picture and Hiffernan's role in its creation? Raised in Paris and himself a French-trained artist turned professional comic illustrator, is it not likely that he could have seen or heard about the cartoon in <i>Le Hanneton</i>, or come across the rumors about the painting's existence? He would almost certainly have heard of Hiffernan's other work for Courbet. His possible knowledge of <i>L'Origine</i> would certainly illuminate the sexualized "morcellization" of Trilby in his novel, her alternating presentation as a foot or a cavernous mouth, and indeed the suggestion of her becoming the abused private possession of a lecherous foreigner. (Trilby's description as "blanche comme neige, avec un volcan dans le coeur" [<i>T</i>, 238] perhaps even suggests that he had heard of the snowy landscape cover-painting that Edmond de Goncourt describes.) Svengali, then, may not be so much the nightmare version of Whistler, but Du Maurier's condensation of Whistler, Courbet, and Khalil Bey (not so much an Oriental Jew like Svengali as an Oriental Muslim). 
</p>

<p>
But besides this roman &#x000E0; clef dimension, the novel appears to be making a serious argument about the nature of art. By linking Whistler's publicly-exhibited abstraction to Courbet's piece of private bathroom erotica, Du Maurier casts into doubt the good faith of the former. In December 1861 Du Maurier writes to Thomas Armstrong: "I really believe that <i>mere female beauty</i> would actually make a well painted picture go down the swinish public throat, in spite of its artistic merit; indeed Millais is a very good instance" (<i>L</i>, 92-4, 4). By the 1890s he has swung round to thinking that sexual interest could be used to less noble ends. Just as Svengali's musical genius parasitically depends on its living organ&#x02014;Trilby's beauty, Trilby's cavernous mouth, her fascinating foot&#x02014;the impact of <i>The Symphony in White</i> depends on a representation of a beautiful young woman. In both cases, sex is used to sell the grander aesthetic program. And as in the case of <i>L'Origine</i>, it is the sexuality of the model Joanna Hiffernan that appears to be in question. 
</p>

<p>
<i>L'Origine</i>resides still at the Mus&#x000E9;e D'Orsay, and like the glass-covered drawing of Trilby's foot on the studio wall in the Rue Notre Dame des Champs, it has become a veritable shrine for art pilgrims. In this respect, Du Maurier's novel seems to demonstrate a strange prescience about the fate of Hiffernan's fragmented image. And the White Girl herself? Translated into a series of phantom doubles&#x02014;first a white symphony, then an anatomical close up, concealed beneath a snowy landscape, and then at once a singing machine and a glazed drawing of a foot&#x02014;what became of the actual Joanna Hiffernan? De Montfort quotes a letter from Whistler of May 1880 to his son, Charles Hanson, in which he sends his regards to "Auntie Jo," and Alan Cole remembered visiting her with Whistler in the 1880s ("WM," 80). According to the Pennells she was seen at Whistler's funeral in 1903, and Stanley Weintraub rather skeptically recounts Charles Freer's claim that Hiffernan came to Cheyne Walk after Whistler's death, to see him one last time, her striking hair now turning gray. As Weintraub points out the scene is far too reminiscent of the Victorian narrative paintings that Whistler hated to be entirely plausible (<i>WB</i>, 463-4). It seems more likely that, having lent her 

<b></b>

image to some of the key works of modern painting, she simply disappeared into private life. I wonder if she ever read <i>Trilby</i>.

In other respects life seemed to be imitating art. Whistler had returned to Paris in the 1890s, and had even acquired a studio in the Rue Notre Dame des Champs, the same street on which Poynter, Lamont, and Armstrong once had their studio/apartment, and where he and Du Maurier had visited so often.

But all day the impression in my mind has been the serenity, the urbanity of Paris, those wide streets, that air of tranquillity and civilisation, must have a queerly austere and reproving look to an invading army, confused with triumph and exhaustion. It seems to me that the Louvre and the Place de la Concorde, and Notre Dame and the bridges, all so compact together, all, somehow, so much smaller than their renown, must have a look of saying&#x02014;Yes, here we are. Et puis? And the people who remain; I suppose their blank faces would have much the same impression.
<p class="blockquote">
To invade Paris . . . surely it would give the invaders, those who were not too tired, too brutalised, to have lost all perceptions except pavement, food, drink, a hallucination of being a quantity of tourists, tourists with rather unusual equipment and baggage.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>

Experience, asserts Walter Pater, "seems to bury us under a flood of external objects, pressing upon us with a sharp and importunate reality, calling us out of ourselves in a thousand forms of action."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Warner finds a serene vision of Paris similarly "importunate," pressing in on her own impression of the brute "reality" of that city's invasion. She cannot prevent herself from imagining a place of "tranquillity and civilisation" removed from the context of its invasion; yet with some deliberate effort, Warner refuses in this diary entry to allow that abstract "impression in my mind" to replace what is socially specific, actual, immediate. The emphatic imperative opening her second paragraph is juxtaposed ominously with the fading aposiopesis that follows it. Those trailing ellipses work instantly to fracture the insularity of 

<b></b>

her fleeting aside; they lead off instead from "my mind" to the "people who remain," into the interior minds of others denied by exhaustion any ability to reflect deeply upon the impressions they receive as feared invaders. 
</p>

<p>
Encapsulated in miniature here is a prose dynamic featured throughout Warner's fiction writing too. Tempering her own impressionistic register, rhetorical choices are made accountable to the imaginary individuals she depicts. And with this deliberate denial of imaginative license, she summons a form of authorial depersonalization for purposes that are not merely benevolent but ethical. It is as if narration within this diary format becomes an act of self-requisition, a disclosure of descriptive priorities as responsibilities obligated to the described. She thereby addresses that "impossible task of aesthetic discourse," which Lesley Higgins has described as an attempt to "surmount the actually unbridgeable gap between the realm of sensory and sensuous experience and the domain of philosophical concepts and propositions."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  For by allowing those same imaginary faces to govern the very style in which they are re-imagined, Warner is also allowing them to contravene the prosaic introspection of her diary&#x02014;compromising it as a medium of solitary reflection when the diarist conjures temporally specific impressions of others in a foreign world. 
</p>

<p>
For Warner, though, this kind of reflexive strategy of combining authorial self-erasure with self-implication appeared to be second nature. Her implicit striving for an impartial separation of author from artwork is a quintessential component of her aesthetic aspirations for narrative fiction too. Pivotal in T. S. Eliot's evaluation, the concern with depersonalization assumed a radically new guise for women writers of the 1930s and 1940s who were debating the shaping of fiction as social criticism. And Eliot's famous epigram&#x02014;that "the more perfect the artist, the more completely separate in him will be the man who suffers and the mind which creates"&#x02014;remains but one account of how abstractionist impersonality came to function as a laudable device.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
A marked reconsideration of the novelist's social role as a kind of disinterested commentator, a re whose sensibilities might indeed appear so "self-abstracted" from the work as to give greater priority to critique, had spurred the emergence of a heightened inception of novelistic realism in the 1930s. As Storm Jameson retrospectively described it in 1949, high modernist predecessors preoccupied with formal innovation seemed to have all but retreated from the specific demands of the social. With a disembodied, defensive reconstitution of the literary-aesthetic as a platform from which to ironize the social in objectified form, earlier modernists had, for Jameson, courted an introverted pursuit of what she called "the virtue of originality, to the point where it becomes, in a novelist, vice."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Hers is a warning against literary experiment for which abstraction and insularity go hand in hand in the narcissistic pursuit of aesthetic perfection. Indeed, Tamar Katz even suggests that this quest for the ever more authentically inventive style cultivated in male experimenters an implicitly masculinist fascination with the abstractionist artifice as providing a sort of inoculation: a means of immunizing the creative self against the disruptive vagaries of modern social life. Such writers were, in Katz's frame, liable to reserve "for themselves a professional expertise 

<b></b>

and cultural authority that could distance them from women. They defined mastery of narrative form as a specialized cubistic skill that could exploit women's nature while standing above it."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Sylvia Townsend Warner's passage through late modernism evinced an altogether different relationship with the stylistic pitfalls and potentialities of abstraction, together with the evolving effectiveness of the novel as a platform for political critique. The resurgence and visible reorientation of social realist interventions between the wars actively challenged the assumptions by which high modernism's "new and deeper literary sense <i>abstracts</i>," in David Trotter's phrase, "the unchanging 'element' hidden beneath the appearances so exhaustively registered by nineteenth-century domestic realism."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Warner subverts across her work precisely this reductive presupposition: that novelistic realism has always had a particularly unchanging objective, so passively mimetic of mere surface appearances as to leave it unequipped to analyze the psychological complexities of the human interior. In what follows, I will show how she also seemed well aware of the susceptibility of the novel form to introspection. That is, her work was evidently sensitive to the climate of aesthetic preoccupations out of which "[m]odernism had produced often dazzling works of art," as Andrzej Gasiorek observes, "but had driven fiction so deeply into subjectivism that it had been left with few resources for dealing with social issues."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  What I explore below in <i>Summer Will Show</i>  and <i>After the Death of Don Juan</i> , is how Warner's "late modernist" approach to the mimetic is more than a mere counter-reaction to some received opinion of high modernism's abstractly formalistic priorities. Rather, she set the novel fresh methodological challenges. And in so doing, she sought to implicate her own rhetorical decision-making in that task of conveying political specificities from an immediate world beyond the literary artifact.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Warner's fiction thus offers a point of departure for innovating with technique in these interwar years, and more specifically with the uses of <i>narrative perception</i>. In tracing this particular intervention of hers, my concerns are twofold. Not only do I want to arrive at some estimation of Warner's role in the novel's stylistic development away from the abstract fastidiousness of subjectivist concerns; but also, of how her idiosyncratically <i>impersonal</i> inflection of narratorial perspective reveals that in fact she re-appropriated a poetics of abstraction of sorts so as to develop the activity of representing perception as a critical device for realist fiction.

<p class="noIndent">
"Late modernism" marks a contentious terrain, of course. Only relatively recently has a notional <i>late</i> modernist epoch gained currency. In this account, a hybridity of aesthetic modalities flourished between the wars, coalescing in practices of literary production closely mediated by the political and economic structures in which they were embedded. Tyrus Miller has argued that late modernist style singularly "dramatized the comic fragility of modernist attempts to contain contingency and violence, through literary form." To Miller, this trajectory, "facilitating a more direct, polemical 

<b></b>

engagement with topical and popular discourses," provides us with "an index of a new dispensation, a growing skepticism about modernist sensibility and craft as means of managing the turbulent forces of the day."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Yet his effort to retrieve interwar texts from the wake of the labeled "Men of 1914" soon turns into a performative self-justification of the viability of pursuing "late modernism" as a period for revision in the first place. Miller bemoans the fact that, today, the "majority of the works I discuss in this study are just not read" (<i>LM</i>, 6); but at the same time his paradigm leaves the experiences of many neglected British women novelists who followed on from high modernism entirely unaccounted for.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the space occupied by literary realism itself within this retrospective mapping is far from self-evident. It is perhaps easy to underestimate the practicalities by which literary forms responded to changing polemical accents. This is the case particularly when, as Maroula Joannou has argued, "[t]o systematise a demarcation between traditional and experimental modes of writing is to perpetuate an artificial division more rigidly than many women of the 1920s and 1930s believed to be necessary."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Storm Jameson stressed that, for novelists who turned to a social sphere, "[p]erfection of form, of language, is not what engages them first and insistently when they surrender to the impulse to convey, roughly in the shape of a novel, what they know or have been attentive enough to overhear about the human situation" ("FN," 43). A more contextually nuanced account is needed, therefore, of how Warner re-envisioned the potential of realism and, in so doing, redirected a high modernist commitment to the discursive mastery of form toward fiction's ability to engage with specific social issues of her time. It is perhaps true to say that "the phosphorescence of decay," as Miller suggests, "had illuminated the passageway to a re-emergence of innovative writing after modernism" (<i>LM</i>, 7). But this purely sardonic path to artistic renewal seems far removed from how <i>progressively</i> Warner shaped a realist poetics from the remnants of subjectivist experiment. 
</p>

<p>
For one, Warner appeared to interpret her own literary inheritance in a highly pragmatic fashion, borrowing from the commonsensical view of why aesthetic progressions occur, so devastatingly invoked by Virginia Woolf. In surveying literature's relevance to the demands of a material world "[w]e can only trust our instincts," as Woolf shrewdly puts it: "if one reader desires reality in a novel, and another is satisfied by something, which he calls proportion, each is right and each can pile a card house of theory on top of his opinion as high as he can go."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  And given that descriptive modes move on rapidly in ways inherently as multifaceted and contingent as the empirical reality of the world they describe, then for Woolf "they mean one thing to one person, another thing to another person: they are unintelligible to one generation, plain as a pikestaff to the next. And it is because of this complexity that they survive."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Warner's chameleonic reinvention of her own approach to writing fiction exploits the fact that narrative aesthetics are always modulating, however successfully, in response to an ever evolving life-world. "[L]et us always remember," declares Woolf: "influences are infinitely numerous; writers are infinitely sensitive; each writer has a different sensibility. That is why literature is always changing" ("LT," 160).

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Woolf saw these formal transformations emerging in a dialectic between artistic modes and the demands of women's struggle for political empowerment between the wars: "The change which has turned the English woman from a nondescript influence, fluctuating and vague, to a voter, a wage-earner, a responsible citizen, has given her both in her life and in her art a turn toward the impersonal."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  As such, the woman novelist's "attention is being directed away from the personal centre which engaged it exclusively in the past to the impersonal, and her novels naturally become more critical of society, and less analytical of individual lives" ("WF," 50). Again, I shall be suggesting that Warner, like Woolf, adapted a version of <i>impersonality</i> precisely to surpass the image of formal experiment as a masculinist pursuit whose introversion had compromised the novel's capacity to articulate political critique. 
</p>

<p>
One way she did so was by utilizing narrative perception as a vehicle for examining metafictionally her own deployment of polemic. Certainly, the evolving usage of perspectival narration in the historical and historicizing novel throws up a rich constellation of issues for late modernist writing. But what will occupy me specifically here is the way Warner's austerely reticent prose reveals how this curious retraction from stylistic embellishment became a deliberate strategy. For her, the depersonalization of narratorial voice was set to reinvigorate the placing and execution of social commentary in fiction. 
</p>

<p class="noIndent">
That commitment to aesthetic self-examination signaled outward, too. The thematic diversity of Warner's fiction suggests that she held to a rich notion of modernity itself: as radically multifarious, as a lived actuality spanning diverse contexts, as resisting monolithic assimilation both historically and geographically to any single epoch. And her fiction responds by promoting an inventive dialogue between setting and style. Dramatizing a plurality of cultural situations, her oeuvre in its entirety conveys a sense in which "modernity," as Janet Lyon has pointed out, "is not a seamless temporal entity characterized by period, progress, and development, though its narratives often prefer that plotline. It is, instead, subject to the very discontinuities of time that its narratives seek to disguise: different 'times' co-exist within the same discrete historical moment, just as surely as homologous 'times' exist across centuries."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  A comparable insight into the existence of alternative, divergent modernities certainly informed Warner's own aspirations for how literary practice might respond instrumentally to the social. She used her position, and persona, as a reviewer for the <i>Left Review</i>, to question the interventionary potential of contemporary writing. She called for a reassessment of how, and for whom, "new" literature is operating, if it portends to "an underlying morality, a resolute understanding and intolerance of social conditions."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  And it is in her tensile short story writing, that we find the communication of intolerance being turned into an ethical imperative. Those miniaturist fables reveal a recurrent activity of authorial obligation articulated through depersonalization, while each enunciating their own idiosyncratically astringent manner of reporting atrocity.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Unrelievedly spare and externalist, Warner's stories call into question the kind of interiorized perspectivalism lent sovereignty by the high modernist novel. Yet she also takes this a step further, scrutinizing her own practice. Namely, she highlights how the choice of free-indirect discourse entails certain ethical considerations of its own for the writer posing as documentarian. <i>A Garland of Straw</i> offers a series of set pieces that bring such issues of impersonality and perception into concert. Particularly acute in her depiction of Fascism's covert infiltration of the European imaginary, Warner creates the illusion of impartial reportage on Fascism's psychic effects while retaining the sort of immediacy one might expect from free-indirect style. In practice, this makes for a curious combination, whereby an oblique, self-distancing voice is offset against the lyric intensity of presented perception. But this double-act is enabling. It allows Warner to broach more widespread fears about the proliferation of Nazism as a growing power network, while giving those fears singularity as psychological effects belonging to those who act as her individual character-focalizers. 
</p>

<p>
In "Apprentice," an occupied Poland on the brink of famine is described through the detached fascination of the child Lili, newly arrived under the custodial of a German contingent. The narration assumes her imperious prospect-view from the "small stone summer-house, no bigger than a sentry-box," which enables Major von Kraebeck to "have her out of the way."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Out of sight and mind of the military's adult world, Lili is not out of reach of Fascism's allure. Keeping "house in the gazebo," Lili takes pleasure in her elevation&#x02014;as both viewer and dominant outsider&#x02014;over the impoverished passers-by, for "though Poland was a detestable country, it was rather grand to be in Poland" . Without any kind of commentary, with no recourse to a reassuring <i>paralepsis</i> pre-empting future events, the narrative is bereft of incidental, anticipatory details; instead, it is framed within the morality of a self-indulgent child who reasons through and enjoys her power over the starving Polish children:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Yet to Lili it seemed very nice to feed the starving. It was exciting, it made one feel good. Before they came to Poland she had had a little dog, and she always enjoyed feeding it, throwing a biscuit and seeing him dash after it, holding the bone above his head while he begged and rolled his eyes. It occurred to her that she could feed the starving from her summer-house. She would feed the children; no one could much object to that, for they would be Polish children only, all the Jews had been put away.

<p class="noIndent">
Warner's syntax, terse and unadorned, infuses tonally Lili's frank self-certainty. The association with teasing her dog is macabre; a fondly mnemonic moment, it betrays the extent to which unconsciously Lili is fast becoming a prime apprentice for Fascism's self-rationalizing objectification of human life. At the level of depictive style, Warner allows focalizer and narrator to enmesh in formidable unison. Subordinate clauses are displaced by a more appetitive parataxis&#x02014;horrid in their issuing forth a reporting voice now so rhythmically attuned to the excitement with which this cruel scene is being perceived: "she nursed a violent impression of the contrast between them and herself [ . . . ] They all had swelled bellies. It was funny, it made them look greedy and not starving at all" . The remembered pleasure of tempting and treating her dog is 

<b></b>

frustrated when a Polish boy refuses to comply. Lili has learned to combine Fascistic fetishism with economic sense: "It occurred to her that instead of just throwing food it would be much better sport to lower it on a string. For then she could dangle it, lowering it and drawing it up again; and quite a little food would last out as long as a basketful. This was delightful" . In this exchange of gratification (her pleasure for his survival), the boy who forgoes the bait "just as though to tantalise her"  perishes in a final snatch for the dangled bun, and confirms what Lili had disinterestedly anticipated all along: "So it was true, really true. The boy was dead. He had died of cold and hunger before her eyes, just as they said. Dozens of them were dying so; but hearsay is one thing, seeing with one's own eyes another" .
</p>

<p>
Channeling the speculations and sensations of a budding trainee for the Third Reich through the re of a self-justifying child, Warner drives allegory to disturbing new heights. Hers is a disquieting prose persona based on recoil, and in which, as Gillian Beer notes, "the telling is ruthless. The reader flinches but is sustained by the unexpected sequencing of her narratives, which gives an affect of improvisation, of freedom for the reader, even while the characters are pinched."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  This readerly freedom assumes an ominous dimension in "Apprentice," as one is encouraged to become a relatively <i>abstracted</i>co-observer, lacking an authorial guiding hand. What is so "ruthless" about Warner's perspectival mode is that her readers are at once powerless to prevent the seed of Fascism from taking root in the girl, and helpless to prevent their own assumption of and implication in a Fascist perception of human life&#x02014;a perception whose horrific insensibility becomes more and more abstracted from its originary context when given analogical correspondence in the excitement of Lili's game. 
</p>

<p>
Such is the unsparing immediacy of Warner's "realist" focalization: it is brutal and unimpeded when picturing brutal acts as normalized and mundane. Moreover, her glacial tone is not merely used to foreground as a kind of objective report the ethical travesty enacted within the scene. Reader and narrator alike are brought to account by the impersonality through which the horror of events is conveyed and left largely unexamined. Warner's unnerving withdrawal from humane commentary reveals precisely how she renders impassive an exterior perceiver so as to intensify our attention to the inhumanity of events perceived.

<p class="noIndent">
Compelling in its insensibility, that story is exemplary. The numbness of her register is performative, epitomizing how Warner's work "domesticates estrangement," as Jane Marcus has noted, "and asks us to examine our own complicity in 'othering' even when we think we are working to expand the canon. Master text, master race, master language&#x02014;all define themselves by the other."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Warner's fiction is multivalent in this respect. Readers are implicated at the point at which they become immersed, while the very insinuation of narratorial self-abstraction leaves the perspectival depiction itself accountable, given its partiality, to world-events beyond the mind of its focal character. All this is highly indicative of Warner's campaign. Her prose bears in its 

<b></b>

expressive intensity the urgency of her quest for how late modernist fiction might negotiate between the rigors of stylistic experiment and those of self-interrogation. 
</p>

<p>
If that "turn" to documentarian forms of literary realism in the 1930s was a reorientation toward the specific exigencies of the social over those of the interior, then Warner's writing equally refuses simply to jettison her representation of subjective perception before exterior political issues. Rather, she invites a reciprocal relationship between sense impressions and purposive critique. Her narrative aesthetics face head on the task of conveying individual, sensory intimations of modernity as valuable if not illuminating, while still remaining attuned to the material struggles of communal existence. One way she achieved this reciprocity was by presenting urban scenarios in which interventions of both a personal and collective kind could take place. In these instances, her work invokes that tropology of perception exemplified in the early modernist imaginary by the re of the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i>. This appropriative strategy holds several implications for Warner's resuscitation of narrative mimesis. As John Rignall has argued, "[t]he complex dialectical mode of seeing red in the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> and enacted in the narrative practice of realism is inherently unstable, and the epistemological assumptions of that practice are open to question."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Yet Rignall is taking as his starting point a rather univocal notion of realism itself&#x02014;as concerned only with the evidential, as an unselfconscious re-representation of social typicalities. For it is precisely these assumptions that Warner's late modernist texts interrogate in their use of perceptual detachment as a tool of metatextual self-inspection. By re-appropriating as a narrative language the mode of peripatetic observation exploited by the Baudelairean <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i>, Warner subverts any sense that "a privileged role ascribed to the detached individual vision of the novelist as narrator rests on the premise that seeing is equivalent to knowing."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Hardly so inevitably in Warner's work do moments of visual reception provide total apprehension. 
</p>

<p>
To identify the self-interrogative ways in which the syntax of urban perception could function for late modernist writing, we must recognize the dual nature of <i>fl&#x000E2;nerie</i> as Warner inherited it from early modernism itself. There the ral characteristics of the metropolitan migrant often emerge as both stylistic and structural features literalized over the course of depicted events. Reassessing Woolf's famous vision of female nomadism in "Street Haunting" , Katz concludes (somewhat reticently) that "[u]rban mobility thus seems to offer the possibility that the subject may identify elsewhere, live a variable and speculative life [ . . . ] suggesting the Woolfian <i>fl&#x000E2;neuse '</i>s complementary self-enclosure through economic privilege: identification with others is a luxury much like shopping."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Yet in her vital and important study, Deborah L. Parsons is at pains to assert "that the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i>is not only a historical re but also a critical metaphor for the characteristic perspective of the modern artist. To infer from the socio-historical position of bourgeois women as confined to private realms that it is therefore a priori impossible to conceive of a female aesthetic perspective in terms of the concept of <i>fl&#x000E2;nerie</i> is false."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Harnessing the possibility of such a definably "female aesthetic perspective," Warner's own free-indirect style appears to align with, only to regale, the scopic positions 

<b></b>

of masculinist <i>fl&#x000E2;nerie</i>: positions implying spectatorial autonomy in surveying and totalizing the particularities of the modern cityscape. And this had a narratological influence upon her work. The fetishistic connotations of visual reception and discrimination that informed an earlier paradigm of literary <i>fl&#x000E2;nerie</i> provided in themselves the means for Warner to mount a symbolic challenge to patriarchal modes of seeing. <i>Summer Will Show</i> extends this trajectory. Within the novel's depersonalized medium of social realist inquiry, the leisured practice of amorous observation is subsumed, replaced by ecstatic encounters of a more assertive kind, and occurring between two women whose experience of marginality at the heart of a metropolis is the catalyst for more purposeful and reparative forms of engagement. 
</p>

<p>
Sophia Willoughby's insatiable will to depart from all she owns and surveys at Blandamer House motivates her flight into a pared-down vision of revolutionary Paris. Abstracted in elemental form, the metropolis affords a turbulent backdrop to Sophia's pursuit of her estranged and "absent" Frederick: a "shadowy creature [ . . . ] dismissed to wander in exile from the real life and centre of life at Blandamer." Intimately described here, Paris emerges imbued with Warner's experience of the communist insurgency in Spain, at first hand with Valentine Ackland.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Warner unveils in her heroine an intuitive sensibility primed for this voyaging inquisition. For even with her children on native soil, "waiting irked her, this waiting for the next cough. She disliked sitting down in the middle of a walk, she disliked any kind of dawdling. A slow and rigid thinker, to sit still and contemplate was an anguish to her. Presently she jumped to her feet, saying, 'Children, I shall walk on'" . 
</p>

<p>
Into the fervor of Paris 1848 she walks, and into the arresting immediacy of a city in seizure. Certainly, it is tempting to approach <i>Summer Will Show</i> as an epitome of novelistic historicization at its most forthright. But this is to reduce the text to a purely mechanical decoding, neglecting the immersing clarity of Warner's period detail as it is relayed directly from the streetscape. Herein, the <i>fl&#x000E2;neuse</i> serves as the narration's principle reflector. Conveying the point at which protean impressions afford critical understanding of newly emerging contexts for collective interaction, Warner allows Sophia's perspective to prevail throughout the novel, mostly precluding authorial intercession so as to sustain the narrative's highly visceral unfoldment. That Warner's commentary remains shrewdly aloof further demonstrates Gillian Beer's point that "empathy is encouraged and then deflected. The process of her novels induces attachment at once sophisticated and infantile. Joy is unforeseen, suddenly present" ("STW," 77). Sophia's initial dilemma of "where to go, being a woman, and alone"  is soon resolved in her pursuit of Minna. For Minna she will rove the city delivering polemical tracts; "to walk and to meditate, and to be peaceful and solitary," is to reinvigorate for Sophia a sense of personal agency by way of elective nomadism&#x02014;appealing to the emancipatory potential of the "no where [ . . . ] I am particularly attracted to" . Indeed, the itinerancy with which Sophia makes physical contact with the city as an ephemeral and dispersing environment not only focalizes the action, but relegates Frederick's whole characterological influence, consigning him to what Terry Castle has called the "subjugated position of the mediator" between the two women's desire

For Castle, it is exactly this "kind of subverted triangulation" of the "canonical" triad of the two male suitors with eyes on the same maiden, "or erotic 'counterplotting,' that is in fact characteristic of lesbian novels in general."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  However, this analysis seems to overly schematize the form of erotic intimacy whose gradual evolution Warner explores across the novel's central section, between two women for whom urban space comprises a series of vulnerable sites for sensual proximity and sudden dislocation. Within these new communal environs opening up within a revolutionary Paris, Warner finds in the account of Minna and Sophia's separation and anticipated reunion occasions for rare intrusions of her own. It is as though Sophia's spontaneous quest becomes at once the advertisement for, and demonstration of, Warner's concern with how sense impressions furnish instrumental decisions, and arises from a scenario that beckons a more incisive degree of commentary:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Acts of impulse are of two kinds. Those performed by people of a naturally impulsive character come with the suavity of habit, they are put forth like the tendrils of a vine, and there is time to mediate them a little, to dispose their curvings with grace. However spontaneous, the mind which generates them has done the same sort of thing before, and in the instant between thought and deed there is an unflurried leisure, in which habit and cunning can contrive their adjustments. But when people of slow or cautious disposition act upon impulse, the impulse surprises them even more than it surprises those upon whom it is directed.

In her own surprise, Sophia seems to mature between Warner's two alternatives for embodying impulse. Refusing the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur'</i>s pursuit of "unflurried leisure," Sophia is compelled to shift from the undiscriminating passivity of one "who had no project whatsoever" . Sensory intimations give way to cognitive inferences upon which she must act. She re-interprets precisely that "sensation almost like complacence" as provoking a more determined role, by assuming the vitality of the <i>fl&#x000E2;neuse</i> in a self-reflective "hiatus, a darkness through which her purpose must travel to its expression" . 
</p>

<p>
So after those gnomic insertions about the nature of impulse, Warner stands back once more, allowing the urgent reality of unfolding events to exemplify her point. Sophia develops an interactive, haptical relationship with public space; narrative language itself responds fervently, its momentum now suffused by her "scribbled zig-zag of purpose" . It is a formal showcase of Elaine Scarry's fascinating point that "a mimesis of perceptual acuity cannot take place unaccompanied by that antecedent structure; in other words, by the very thing that perception exists to investigate."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Sophia's own investigative pursuit turns from the introspection wherein it began, outward to restore the impersonal tone in which the quest's climax in physical space is told:

<b></b>

drooping lopsidedly from her shoulders. With this meeting so clear in her mind, her impetus towards it carried her past Minna encountered in the street. The recognition that halted her, stock-still on the pavement, was only at second-sight realised as a recognition of the woman she sought. For the instantaneous, the overwhelming impression was, that for the first time in her life she had seen despair.

That our narrator has maneuvered over the course of the scene from philosophical interjection to a racy external description, complements Sophia's own transition. It points to a distinctly late modernist trait. By the shift in axis from probing subjectivism to depersonalized report, we find that, as Phyllis Lassner notes, the "psychological analysis of female character through introspection or narrative intervention is replaced by women speaking to and through each other, either directly, or in response to the other's character and behaviour."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Subjective upheavals of the interior become exteriorly projected onto those of the city, and Sophia begins to anticipate the way she is implicated in the social experience of what she perceives&#x02014;only then, it seems, is she awarded a new insight into the "recognition of the woman she sought."

The <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> may well remain one of those flourishing "heroes of modernity" who, as Janet Wolff reminds us, "share the possibility and the prospect of lone travel, of voluntary up-rooting, of anonymous arrival at a new place. They are, of course, all men."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  However, it does appear that Warner consciously pitted her women characters against the city gent as "objects of his 'botanizing.'"<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  And at the same time, she meticulously undercut the psychosexual hierarchy that the masculinist version of <i>fl&#x000E2;nerie</i> sought to consolidate through the visual objectification of women among the crowd.
</p>

<p>
"A Red Carnation," from <i>A Garland of Straw</i>, associates a more touristic set of sensibilities with the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> as focalizer for purposes of describing the Fascist's sinister "liberation" of communist Spain. This Warner portrays as a blithe exercise in military tourism that denies any humanitarian responsibility for the confined Spanish regions through which it passes. She depicts the journey of a German contingent as a parading of their romantic preconceptions about Spain's rural landscape. She shadows Kurt Winkler's documentation of his passage through the back streets of an anonymous city:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
<i>In Spain</i>, he was now in Spain. It must be Spain, for they had passed through the Straits of Gibraltar. It was a pity that they had not been allowed to arrive by day. Still, the city was awake. In Spain gay life persists all night long, and presently he would be riding past caf&#x000E9;s and flood-lit fountains, and girls would throw flowers from balconies, and he would catch a red carnation and hold it between his teeth.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Repeated like a yearning mantra, the word "Spain" becomes emblematic of all Kurt wistfully imagines, losing its substance with each repetition. Kurt's anticipation of being "in Spain" offsets the thrill of his proximity to a cultural landscape within which he is alien: "Looking at the cypresses and the fantastic silhouettes of the balconied and turreted villas Kurt felt that at last he was in Spain" . His excitement is short-lived, however; making actual contact with the terrain deflates his imaginary Spain. 

<b></b>

Out on foot now, his dreamed impression of what the country promises is shattered by the reality that a fellow contingent has preceded them. His image is defiled in advance: "Analysing his discontent, he told himself that he was bored and frustrated, that nothing short of the noblest could satisfy him, and that having come to Spain to root out Marxism he could not be happy till he was doing it. Meanwhile there were other small rubs and annoyances. The relation between his detachment and the earlier arrivals was not good" .
</p>

<p>
What Warner does is to utilize his "detachment" as a cipher for her own distanced scrutiny. We enter a faceless enclave which, as Kurt's group nears the station, turns out to be "pretty much like any other town" . The closer its narrow vistas become for Kurt, the more opaque their relation to the way "[a]ll the stories, all the movies, stressed the romance of Spain" . It is in this uncompromising documentation of Spain becoming "a battlefield merely, a preliminary battlefield [ . . . ] wherever the red menace shows itself" , that Warner critiques Kurt's point of view through a perversion of the universalized, nineteenth-century trope of the nonchalant <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> loitering in relative immunity from the terrain. Casual observations throw up the unexpected, ironizing Kurt's attempt to assimilate all he perceives into the romanticized prediction of what he assumes any visitor should perceive in Spain. Unable thus to connect up perception with prior expectation, he leaves his officers' siesta and is enveloped by the town. And it is here that Warner constructs an account of Kurt's failing position as foreign "liberator" as a premise for her impersonal analysis. Patently grave, she reveals how the voluntarity with which he occupies public space is soon the cause of his entrapment: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

He looked about, and saw, opening out of the street, a passage, and beyond the passage a little square. He waited till someone else turned down the passage, and then followed.
<p class="blockquote">
The square had arcades all round. It was like a cloister, but it also looked Moorish, as of course, it should do. In the middle was a small fountain. The jet of water was feeble and intermittent, it seemed as though something might be blocking the feed. But still, it was a fountain.

<p class="noIndent">
Threateningly framed by arcades, the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur's</i> meditative solipsism suddenly meets its match in built form, literalized in this deserted square. Kurt wavers in assigning his own military purpose to such a liminal place, as the "fountain" sustains his gaze and adds to his nostalgic taxonomy of this provincial surround. His hesitation is fatal, occurring late here, too, chronologically in the narrative&#x02014;his decision to linger is punished almost schematically by Warner's ferociously abrupt close. The townspeople return his stare with "blank faces" as he tries to visualize triumphantly their "glorious efficient future" under Fascist rule. Warner leaves him stranded in an ominous epiphany "that in coming to Spain to t he might also have come to Spain to die" . 
</p>

<p>
The underlying impulse of this sparse, exiguous fable thus emerges when events are brought to fruition. Within the most enclosed of urban settings, Warner has deliberately <i>adopted</i> a perspective aspiring to what Susan Buck-Morss calls the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i>'s "combination of distracted observation and dream-like reverie," but in a faltering guise 

<b></b>

that radically <i>adapts</i> its rhetorical purpose in this secluded context.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  In such a way as to invite scrutiny from an impartial narrator, Kurt is halted at the heart of that village to dissect his imminent fate; and in so doing, Warner captures in this "corner of old Spain"  a microclimate for staging wider changes in the spatial and visual economy of modernity at large. For in her account, that Ur-man re of the displaced, intoxicated observer can no longer entertain the possibility that totalizing observations are comparable to categorical knowing&#x02014;he is a once imperious re for whom the indulgence of impressionistic speculation has here become redundant, affording scarce understanding of others staring back, only outwardly observed.

<p class="noIndent">
The austerity of Warner's repose here is evidence of a significantly subversive act of appropriation. As a point of departure for realist representation, she actively recuperated one of the darlings of high modernist aesthetics&#x02014;authorial impersonality. "What has been happening in the last decades," argued Storm Jameson as the 1940s came to a close, "is something more than a change in direction": "It is not wholly that so many of the more serious novelists have been swayed, by the strength of the undersea current running against humanism, against tradition, to give their greater effort to releasing in their work the little jet of their own personality [ . . . ] The change is also towards a detachment from the world, a withdrawal" ("FN," 58).
</p>

<p>
Jameson highlights a double component to fiction's subjectivist turn. That is, the propensity for the novelist to exploit a heightened conception of interior subjectivity for the aesthetic enrichment of literary representation, while simultaneously offering themselves a retreat from immediate social inquiry into the artifice, into the egocentric task of solitary perfectionism. For Jameson, this kind of aestheticized "withdrawal" has had dire consequences for the novel's continued political relevancy, simply because "[l]ife, at the level on which the great novelist must approach it, is so full of impurities. The pure novelist, intent on easing the bulges out of his form, is forced to exclude too much, and without being able to achieve the evocative precision and concentration of the poem. The writer becomes too important, the novel etiolated and narrow" ("FN," 61).
</p>

<p>
It sounds like an unsparing criticism of the more insular, self-appreciative aspects of high modernist innovation. Yet more subtly, Jameson exposes the irony that experimentalist impersonality in the novel can operate paradoxically and in spite of itself&#x02014;the higher the level of aesthetically pure abstraction, the more visible the writer's aesthetic sensibilities become. 
</p>

<p>
More progressively, though, Jameson was campaigning for an overhaul of artistic impersonalism. It marks a critical attention to authorial persona, which, as I have been suggesting, remains central to Warner's use of perspectival form. Her own approach refused the self-interiorizing vanities of stylistic abstraction, privileging instead a mode of <i>oratio oblique .</i> This expanded the tonal possibilities for narrative voice. Rather than resort to overt intervention, Warner reserved as implicit and embedded with a given 

<b></b>

fictional world her communication of social critique. As another world war loomed, Warner would retain her scrupulous engagement with the uses of depersonalizing, writerly detachment, just as Jameson argued the case for a novelistic equivalent of disinterested documentary film-making.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, Jameson's warning against the experimental novel whose creator "becomes too important" thoroughly complements Warner's view of a definably female tradition of impersonality, one stretching back to the Bront&#x000EB;s and George Eliot. She would assert in a lecture given to the Royal Society of Arts in 1959 that "[w]omen as writers seem to be remarkably adept at vanishing out of their writing so that the quality of immediacy replaces them."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Conceiving of "immediacy" as Percy Lubbock did of Jamesian aesthetics, Warner supports an implicit privileging of the <i>showing</i> over the <i>telling</i>, of character-consciousness over <i>heterodiegetic</i> statement&#x02014;a diffusion of provenance in which the implied author is pronouncing less in order to picture more.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Bellicose propaganda, of course, is what drowns out the elderly lady whose"voice was hardly audible" at Speaker's Corner in <i>The Years</i>.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  And as Woolf herself reiterated in <i>Three Guineas</i>, strategies of depersonalization are crucial for a pacifist collective: a resistance that chooses "not to incite their brothers to t, or to dissuade them, but to maintain an attitude of complete indifference."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Heeding Woolf's caution that this "[i]ndifference in the first place must be given a firm rooting upon fact," Warner displays a similar strain of discretion when she dissects war's capacity to hold the psyche in thrall.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  She is <i>un</i>interested in the more insidious motivations for battle, just as she registers with critical disinterest the way time and again the horrific ramifications of conflict cannot dissuade nations from renewed warfare: "So perish all warlike heroism: for it is undoubtedly heroic to go out on bombing raids, it is even more dangerous than going out on horse to kill foxes. If more deeds of heroism could just fall flat there would be more hope for humanity. It is interesting how almost all working class people seem to know this without having to bother to hold it as a theory."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Despite the opinions Woolf and Warner share about warfare's futile masculinism, there are, nevertheless, clear distinctions to be made between the idea (and idealism) of a politically disinterested standpoint and the politics of an aesthetic disinterestedness as they respectively practiced it. "What one has to bear in mind" too, argues Anne Fernihough, "is the way in which, during this period, democracy above all was red as a process of <i>abstraction</i>, abstraction of the uniqueness of the individual into a mere cipher or statistic."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Even though their priorities are not always comparable, Warner and Woolf both forged an important feminist idiom from techniques of depersonalization. This idiom proved a practical tool, implementing by and through their revivification of narrative mimesis an urgently needed historicizing critique of contemporary social oppression.
</p>

<p>
In her rereading of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's <i>Aurora Leigh</i> , Woolf seeks to recuperate a prolific tradition of stylistic impersonality. In doing so she draws not on Eliot, but on the nineteenth-century realists, women who dared to inhabit their genre detachedly in order to subvert the novelistic expectations of them <i>as</i> women writers. Among them, Browning desired to undertake a "sort of novel-poem [ . . . ] running 

<b></b>

into the midst of our conventions."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  For Jameson, meanwhile, the "weakness of the poetic novel" was that it failed to be impersonal <i>enough</i>. "[I]t can so easily be made to seem clumsy by the greater concision and concentration of the poet," inasmuch as a "single phrase says more, says it better, rousing more echoes, than a page, pages, of careful (delicate, sensitive) description by Virginia Woolf" ("FN," 53). But note Jameson's use of the word "better" here; framed in a qualifying clause, it posits tentatively&#x02014;so as to differentiate qualitatively between&#x02014;the general <i>aesthetic</i> attribute of narrational "concision" (of being able to say profoundly "more," by doing less), and the particular <i>stylistic</i> skill of being able to say it "better." Jameson underestimates how much in command of the "single phrase" the later Woolf was, and like Warner, how far she controlled its <i>immediacy</i>. 
</p>

<p>
For Woolf also understood what a multifaceted thing impersonalism was for the woman writer. Not merely a rhetorical strategy for the greater good of narrative aesthetics, the impersonal was already an aspect of lived experience itself, to be forcefully redeployed in aesthetic practice: "The greater impersonality of women's lives will encourage the poetic spirit, and it is in poetry that women's fiction is still weakest" ("WF," 51). Indeed, she concludes of <i>Aurora Leigh</i>that "whatever Mrs Browning's faults," her account of social relations shows how she uses impersonality to intensify the creative (and ultimately critical) efficacy of women's formal experiment. "[S]he was one of those rare writers who risk themselves adventurously and disinterestedly in an imaginative life which is independent of their private lives and demands to be considered apart from personalities."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Browning's risk was to exploit a disinterested aesthetic rather than a wholly aestheticizing disinterestedness. The former marked a creative proliferation of forms of authorial agency open to the woman writer, as opposed to the narcissistic creation of a transcendent authorial genius secured in a legacy to artistic perfectionism. 
</p>

<p>
It is this very activity of writing <i>apart from</i> personality, rather than with a possessive and impersonally detached sense of objectivity, that Jameson herself saw as the future function for authorial standpoint in literary reportage. As she outlined it in the journal <i>Fact</i>: "The first thing a socialist writer has to realize is that there is no value in the emotions, the spiritual writhings, started in him by the sight, smell, and touch of poverty. The emotions are no doubt unavoidable. There is no need to record them" ("D," 11).<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  To take the words of Eliot himself (albeit to the opposite end of the political spectrum), for Jameson the most radical documentary is ideally "only a medium and not a personality," which, handled with a sort of self-abstracting discipline, may even offer "an escape from personality."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  An authorial practice of distancing oneself from that which must be conveyed and critiqued is <i>the</i> ethical imperative for Jameson's "well-placed novelist": 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

As the photographer does, so must the writer keep himself out of the picture while working ceaselessly to present the <i>fact</i> from a striking (poignant, ironic, penetrating, significant) angle.

Her typology for the "detailed and accurate presentment, rather than representation, of this moment, and this society," emphasized precisely that "seizing of the significant" as a mode for finding opportunities to intervene in workaday life; and by advocating exilic models of detachment from the viewed oppressions of that life as "conduits for a feeling which is not personal, nor static" ("D," 13). This is crucial for understanding how Warner too developed a lexicon of impersonality to find meaning in the everyday. It was surely that possibility of retrieving significance from the fabric of mundane experience that Warner pondered when writing to Paul Nordoff in summer 1940: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
[H]ow extraordinary it is that one feels this profound difference between things like bombs, which one can only partially assimilate to one's experience, and things like a cloudy moonlit sky and the naked boughs of an apple tree, which are commonplaces, and are part of one's ordinary being. [ . . . ] In fact, I shouldn't be surprised if in the last analysis it turns out that the horror of war is tantamount to the horror of boredom; it is the repugnance one feels to being compelled to attend to things that don't interest one.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
The taciturnity of Warner's persona in her fictional prose eases here, attenuating into the form of an insistent self-inquisition whose tone is far more confessionary, elliptical, personal. The "horror of boredom" is not so much a result of shrewd disinterest; it is more a reaction to sentiments that seem alien or intrusive upon the importance of commonplace immediacies&#x02014;those everyday occurrences that, to Warner, are often valuable precisely for piquing one's sensate self into awareness of a wider spectrum of political and ethical entailments. It was "alongside that severe conviction," as Beer puts it, of perceiving "a longer compass in the struggle between Fascism and Socialism" that Warner forever "registered through into extreme old age the tumbling pleasures of the ordinary moment" ("STW," 85). These two levels of seeing the world were inseparable, necessary, instrumental, however frustratingly those valuable pleasures retained something of the elusiveness of Woolf's epiphanic moments-of-being. Visions of the wider possibilities for social transformation appeared for Warner always inextricable from the hidden imperatives and perseverance entailed in inhabiting the everyday.
</p>

<p>
Warner's letter reveals a rigorous awareness of the cognitive significance of ordinary sensations that is richly evident throughout her fiction. She again echoes Pater's belief that felt experience need not bury our capacity for action. For what she finds is that stimuli from a quotidian world draw attention to the social field against which they hold a seemingly "profound difference." <i>After the Death of Don Juan</i> elaborates the stylistic implications of her insights, dramatizing as events of critical illumination moments in which sensory experience stresses the self's imminent entailment in the social. 
</p>

<p>
As in <i>Summer Will Show</i>, she sustains in the novel an interanimation of distanced description and fleeting intervention, while at the same time drawing out the ethical implications of writerly detachment. <i>After the Death of Don Juan</i> demonstrates how indeed Warner negotiated between impressionism and realism, lyrical interiority and 

<b></b>

outward projection. On occasion this kind of formal self-scrutinizing is made explicit. It is with a quizzical documentary concision that Warner pictures Don Saturno under impending siege; her inquisition arrives unsparingly from the position of an overseer whose provenance is indeterminate, left abstractly placed: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The water. The eviction of the tenants when the irrigation was completed. Do as he would, they were to be betrayed. Do as he would, they would never believe that he was betrayed with them. As long as a child's child lived in Tenorio Viejo he would be called Saturno the Cheat.
<p class="blockquote">
He walked to the window and looked through the chinks of the shutters. There they were. He looked at the landscape he had known all his life, at the place he called his. There was the river-bed, the poplar-trees, the speckled olive-yards, the green bands of the maize, the road. He saw something compact that moved at a steady pace along the road. A cloud of dust moved with it, and out of the dust flashed sharp prickles of light.
<p class="blockquote">
"They march well. But it's too fast." The sentence rose in his mind, deliberate as a bubble rising. It exploded into meaning. He remained for some time at the window, swallowing, and driving the nails into the palms of his hands. The truth was, he was afraid to go downstairs and face the two men there.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Those first two paragraphs work in tandem. It is as though Warner's reportorial terseness throughout the first condemns the impressionistic tone following on from it, when that second paragraph slides into the panoramic view of an entire landscape inflected by Saturno's nostalgia. Indeed, Warner's cataphoric phrases ("Do as he would") resound like a solemn descant, chiming testaments to the futility of Saturno's imagined hope of removing himself from implication once his temporary stronghold is besieged. That notion here of removal works in a double-pronged way, of course. A gesture of self-abstraction seems as applicable to our narrator's poise as an austere inquisitor as it is to Saturno who, holing up in this castle, thinks even now he can find consolation by escaping from the present into maudlin reminiscence. Warner's own self-distantiation as an implied and impersonal commentator thus highlights the distance her character can no longer preserve between a weakening nobility and the incensed population of a region he has forgone. 
</p>

<p>
Thanks to this very act of self-erasure on Warner's part, her voice-over remains impartial to benefit the presentation of regional place. As Wendy Mulford takes care to highlight in her 1989 introduction: "Warner's peasants are not sanctified, or seen as embryo social-realist heroes, for all her admiration for the USSR at that time. All are held up to her level, humorous and scrutinising gaze. But this detachment is permeated by an immediacy, a vivid life in the writing that more than compensates for the lack of individuation" (x). If <i>After the Death</i> works to historicize the empowerment of Franco's government, it never allows this tactic to impinge stylistically upon the limpid realization of Tenorio Viejo across the narrative. 
</p>

<p>
In Tenorio Viejo itself, of course, Warner had again adopted another remote and provincial setting. Yet this backdrop is far from restrictive as an idiom for political allegory. I would agree with Jane Marcus when she notes that "[i]n rescuing archaic forms from their exile in genre limbo," Warner "transforms the fantastic into a kind of 

<b></b>

superrealism." And it is that system of attentive revaluation which "deconstructs a norm of socialist realism as a vehicle for the expression of both ethics and otherness."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Contrapuntal and episodic, <i>After the Death</i> is alive to the subtle registers by which a feminist historical novel could "trespass freely and fearlessly" ("LT," 178), as Woolf had aspired. In <i>After the Death</i>"realist representation," to adapt Miller's phrase here, implements a "progressive de-realization of the social world." Guileful, denatured, the novel's portrait "seizes on that world in all its uncanniness, while satiric fantasy portrays the simulated reality of spectacle more truly than a more conventional 'realism' could" (<i>LM</i>, 97). Characteristic of the novel's proposal of an alternative mode of "ironic realism," the depiction of Tenorio Viejo's slide into divisive uprising after the fabled death of its tyrannical heir Don Juan, as Janet Montefiore finds, "allegorically represents the discomfiture of the Spanish ruling class by the election of a Popular Front government in February 1936."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  Warner's radical appropriation of the historicizing tradition, however, is more complex than a polemicized striking of parallels between a divided and dilapidated eighteenth-century village and contemporary Spain under the gathering storm of Fascism. Montefiore worries that, through Warner's recourse to "free indirect narration, using little or no authorial commentary," the resulting insularity compromises the potential scope of her socialist critique to leave feminist contentions unvoiced&#x02014;factors which "make the novel's humanism look a little narrowly defined."<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  But this fails to acknowledge how narrative refraction can be deployed as a symbolic tool; it underestimates the extent to which Warner could balance registers between character and critique, place and polemic, so as to prevent a proscription of rights from intruding didactically upon the description of embodied experience.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Narrative perception and narratorial persona: dual concepts, then, furnishing in Warner's fiction an extensive ethical vocabulary. These two elements of narration, working in concert, convey that threshold point at which sight provokes insight, where protean sensations yield political illuminations. Affecting syntax and structure alike, Warner's striking impersonality, issued from a stance in cool detachment, insists we attend not only to the repose in which she voices her polemic, but also to the repose as judicial witness that her readers are themselves invited to assume. 
</p>

<p>
Miller has indeed claimed that a consistent trait of "late modernist" narration is the considered erasure of any stable or accountable provenance, thereby subverting in turn the "basis of the novel as an anthropomorphic genre." For "[o]utside the norms of realism, voices may come from no apparent body, a single body may be occupied by multiple voices, or one body may be given the voice of another" (<i>LM</i>, 101, 102). This destabilizing of the enunciatory origin and execution of so-called "persona-mediated" perspective <i>is</i> indeed a distinctive trait in Warner's work; her honed impersonality, though, carries another dimension. With regard to her narrators' self-usurpations, a certain ambiguity is never diffused. And it is precisely because she gives this ethical weighting to the task of reshaping the very purpose of perspectival realism that her novelistic approach succeeds. 
</p>

<p>
Storm Jameson conceded that documentary's "criticism of social values" will always be "confronted by the extreme difficulty of finding phrases which are at once compressed 

<b></b>

and highly suggestive" ("D," 17). Warner's fictional enterprise succeeded in doing just that: describing sensorially abstract moments of supreme detachment that reconcile "the frightful difficulty," as Jameson saw it, "of expressing, in such a way that they are at once seen to be intimately connected, the relations between things (men, acts) widely separated in space or in the social complex" ("D," 18). Though Warner's fiction formally "abutts the Modernist," as Beer maintains, equally with that curious mix of syntactic brevity and lyric intensity it remains "pellucid, determined and mischievous" ("STW," 77). For Warner marks a commitment to the varied implications of considering mimetic narrative less as a functional remedy, than as a reflexive method. She inhabited "late modernism" with a resolute poetics, generating versions of modernity, and women's mobility within it, that radically challenge current understandings of realism and what a realist aesthetic is capable of achieving in its historical moment.

Keith Williams finds in the documentary realism of the 1930s "a reaction against modernism's imploding preoccupation with self-analysis and experiment, but without merely regressing to nineteenth-century Naturalism's unproblematised mimesis." This reaction constituted a politically-charged "acknowledgement that modernism's linguistic self-consciousness, together with new media technology, had transformed categories of realistic representation irrevocably" ("Post/Modern Documentary: Orwell, Agee, and the New Reportage," in Keith Williams and Steven Matthews, eds. <i>Rewriting the Thirties: Modernism and After</i> [London and New York: Longman, 1997], 165).

Elizabeth Bowen, Storm Jameson, Naomi Mitchison, and Rebecca West might spring to mind. Miller acknowledges this "problem of selection" and suggests that ultimately it is up to his readers "to judge whether they find compelling the reasons I offer for preferring a 'bad new' modernist canon, stood up on still-tottering feet, over a 'good old' one, squatly resting on a plinth of tacit beliefs and received ideas" (<i>LM</i>, 21). When situating Sylvia Townsend Warner's explicit reformulation of fiction's critical efficacy, I would argue that a singular version of "late modernism" is too monolithic for the purposes of re-evaluating the return of realist aesthetics in British women's writing leading up to <i>and</i> spanning World War II.

With a comparably reticent diagnosis that connects Warner's susceptibility to thematic parochialism with her retreat into rural Dorset, Alan Munton worries that "Warner's considerable literary skills cannot overcome the intrinsic limitations of the countryside as a topic," inasmuch as "it is difficult for a political writer to tell stories of rural conflict which have more than a limited or local resonance" ("Rural Radical," review of <i>The Diaries of Sylvia Townsend Warner</i>, ed.

<p class="noIndent">
Djuna Barnes's notoriously difficult work has received numerous critical explications, all of which have dealt, in one way or another, with the problem of style. The most salient characteristic of Barnes's work is an ornate, circular, obscure, rambling, hyperbolic style, a style which is non-communicative and transgressive, and which is the major source of the anti-realism of Barnes's work. Barnes's writing flaunts its artificiality, the ral character of its discourse, opening up a space of unreality in a way that suggests that perhaps pure language is the real subject of her work. Any recognition of reference or content is embedded in a play of deception and truth that questions the very principle of representation. The case I wish to make here is that Barnes's transgressive and ornate style was shaped by the neobaroque, a mode recuperated from the "obsolete" styles, forms, and themes of the historical baroque by twentieth-century writers in Europe and in the Americas. 
</p>

<p>
As is well known, Barnes criticism has seen two broad phases or orientations: first, Barnes's early and high modernist critics, following her publisher and long-time friend T. S. Eliot's lead, developed the importance of style and, in keeping with New Critical readings of modernism as experimental formalism, stressed the technical design of Barnes's work. Because of its organization into static symbol patterns reminiscent of poetry, <i>Nightwood</i>, for example, was declared the paradigm of the modernist novel's "spatial form" by critic Joseph Frank.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  A new wave of feminist and new historicist critics, beginning in the 1970s, has emphasized the political and subversive aspects of her work&#x02014;her gendered modernism, critique of the patriarchal family, portrayal of lesbian culture, and parody of contemporary sexological 

<b></b>

theories (the notion of homosexuality as sexual "inversion").<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  While formalist readings of Barnes tended to focus exclusively on her so-called "masterpiece," <i>Nightwood</i>, recent criticism has brought all of Barnes's work into visibility, from her early New York journalism to her 1958 play <i>Antiphon</i> and late poetry. As a result, the Barnes canon has expanded to comprise four "major" works: the autobiographical novel, <i>Ryder</i> ; her allegorical portrait of Paris's lesbian expatriate counterculture,<i>Ladies' Almanack</i>, (also 1928); her novel <i>Nightwood</i> , and her verse play and family tragedy, <i>The Antiphon</i> .<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Reviewing the shift from "formal considerations" to "content" in Barnes criticism, Victoria Smith recently observed that "[w]hile some of these latter critics have negotiated the twin difficulties of Barnes's obscure yet beautiful language and her radical insights into the nature of history and sexuality, few have attempted to show the content of Barnes's form&#x02014;that is, what her radical narrative style might be in the service of."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Like Smith, who decodes Barnes's indirect and trope-laden style as the language of melancholia, I identify her deviant style with the neobaroque, fusing formal as well as historical and ideological considerations. To insist on the centrality of style in Barnes's work seems pertinent given that, as more than one commentator has noted, it is style, more than content, which lends unity to her work.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Furthermore, the neobaroque can establish a conversation between formalist, feminist, and new historicist readings of Barnes. It can address the question of Barnes's experimental style as well as, as Smith put it, the content of Barnes's form. 
</p>

<p>
Among the four works mentioned above, I will focus on Barnes's two "queer" texts, <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> and <i>Nightwood</i>, which are set in non-normative socio-sexual subcultures. They form the affiliative counterparts to Barnes's two fables of filiation, <i>Ryder</i> and <i>The Antiphon</i>, whose plot and characters are allegorical representations of Barnes's own biological family. Critics have noted the complementary pairing of the filiative and the affiliative, heterosexual and homosexual worlds, in all four texts.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  The result is a bifocal structure that is further developed by the simultaneous "darkening" of both the world of the patriarchal and birth family and that of the affiliative homosexual community. Between the earlier 1928 texts and the later works, the mood darkens from ironic playfulness and (especially in <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>) witty and bawdy exuberance, to utter tragedy. All four works end with the death or destruction of a major re (Dame Evangeline Musset in <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>, the grandmother re Sophia in <i>Ryder</i>, the lover Robin in <i>Nightwood</i>, and the daughter re Miranda in <i>The Antiphon</i>). The absence or loss at the center of each narrative forms the basis of a decentralizing structure of signification.
</p>

<p>
Barnes faces loss by writing, simultaneously filling in empty spaces and articulating&#x02014;reaffirming&#x02014;the void. Indeed, the motif of the empty center, the horror of the vacuum (<i>horror vacui</i>), represents one of the most common topoi of baroque representation. Here a surface display of stylistic extravagance is linked to its opposite, a hidden insufficiency. The revival of the baroque as neobaroque was enabled by Swiss art historian Heinrich Woelfflin's pathbreaking studies, and has informed the work of Catalan philosopher Eugenio d'Ors, French philosopher Gilles Deleuze, U.S. writer 

<b></b>

William Faulkner, Cuban writers and essayists Alejo Carpentier, Lezama Lima, and Severo Sarduy, and Mexican writers and critics Carlos Fuentes and Gustavo Celorio. 
</p>

<p>
The baroque was vilified in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as an aberration; its rediscovery in the twentieth was linked to the crisis of Enlightenment rationality and its master narratives. During the formative years when Barnes lived as an expatriate in Paris, the baroque's modernity, that is, its validity as a response to the epistemological and religious crises of the Scientific Revolution and the Reformation, was discovered. In the wake of the twentieth-century crisis of metanarratives, the baroque, which now-discredited positivism and the na&#x000EF;ve belief in technological and social progress stigmatized as deviant, newly appears as a viable alternative. Recovered as neobaroque, the baroque, as a non-exclusive, de-centering principle, joins, however self-consciously and awkwardly, contradictory impulses of the premodern and the modern, faith and reason, the scientific and the mythic, marking the crisis and outer limit of modernity. The neobaroque recovers the historical baroque's alternate, pre-Enlightenment modernity, a transitional, ex-centric modernity and alternate rationality not reducible to the quantifying rationality that gained ascendancy in the eighteenth century. Discussing the baroque as a symptom of modernity in his influential 1962 study on the poetics of the open work, Umberto Eco writes: "[F]or the first time, man opts out of the canon of authorized responses and finds that he is faced (both in art and in science) by a world in a fluid state that requires corresponding creativity on his part."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Reviewing Barnes criticism, one could make a long list of casual comments on seventeenth-century expressive forms and themes in Barnes's work that both formalist and feminist critics, in a curious convergence of sensibility, have made but never fully explored. The initial and most influential observation comes, of course, from T. S. Eliot's introduction to the first edition of <i>Nightwood</i>; he states that the novel has "a quality of horror and doom very nearly related to that of Elizabethan tragedy" (<i>N</i>, xvi). In her recent psychoanalytic reading of <i>Nightwood</i>, Victoria Smith describes the novel's supposed "Renaissance tragic idiom" as a symptom of melancholia. The "great age of melancholia [ . . . ] began in the Renaissance," and, we might add, culminated in the baroque seventeenth-century ("SBI," 201). Thus, Smith decodes Eliot's pertinent observation as a mode of self-representation defined by loss: "The melancholic ego<i>[ . . . ] is dependent on loss as a means through which it can represent itself</i>" ("SBI," 201).<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Similarly, in <i>Djuna: The Life and Work of Djuna Barnes</i>, Barnes biographer Philip Herring writes of <i>The Antiphon</i>&#x02014;written in blank verse!&#x02014;that "the play's idiom suggests Jacobean tragedy" and is written "in vaguely Jacobean verse form, strongly flavored with Shakespearean drama."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> <i>Antiphon</i> is a family revenge play, where the dead and absent father's sins are shown to fester, like an open wound, in present relations between mother and children, leading to the tragic murder of the daughter by the mother. <i>Antiphon</i>'s idiom resembles <i>Nightwood</i>'s in its violent images of pain and ostentatious lamentation. Because their theatrical lamentation contrasts with what Walter Benjamin calls the silences of Greek tragedy, both works, as I will show in more detail in my subsequent discussion of <i>Nightwood</i>, have much in common with the 

<b></b>

"unclassical" seventeenth-century German tragedies Walter Benjamin discusses in his 1928 study of the baroque, <i>Origin of German Tragic Drama</i>.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  The baroque appeal to the emotions and the shift from absolute clarity to dramatic movement and subjective impressionism is a trait shared by Barnes's later works. Finally, and to put an arbitrary end to this open list of passing references to the baroque characteristics of Barnes's work, let me cite Dianne Chisholm's recent description of "a darkness in <i>Nightwood</i>" via "Barnes's affection for Burton's <i>Anatomy of Melancholia</i> ," which, once again, summons the ghost of the baroque in Barnes, calling for a fuller exploration ("OM," 176).<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
One major reason why Barnes's neobaroque recuperation of seventeenth-century expressive themes and forms has been neglected is the unpopularity of the baroque as a period term in England, the U.S. and English-language literary criticism.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Skeptics are right to point to the dangers of overly systematic translations and applications of this art historical period term in literature.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  On the other hand, the antithetical definition of the baroque (as the counter-principle of classicism) offered in Woelfflin's influential stylistic typology is illuminating. Woelfflin highlights a crucial shift of sensibility between the classic and the baroque, revealed in a persistent trend away from self-contained objectivism (the classic) and towards de-centering subjectivism and emotionalism (the baroque), from static wholes in repose to dynamic wholes in endless flux.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  This approach is fruitful, as long as the contrasting relation between the two styles is conceived not as an absolute rupture (problematic because the historical transitions between the Renaissance and the Baroque, and the Baroque and the Enlightenment were gradual) but as a mixture of rupture and continuity. 
</p>

<p>
My own approach is related to Woelfflin's definition of the baroque as an anti-classical principle in recognizing that the historical baroque intervened as a parenthesis (to use Gonzalo Celorio's term) between one classical age and another, between the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  With Michel Foucault, we acknowledge in addition that the baroque is not only preceded, but also succeeded by a classical age, the Enlightenment. Contrasting the baroque to what follows it, Enlightenment modernity, in <i>The Order of Things</i>, Michel Foucault famously claimed that the episteme of modernity was first articulated in the seventeenth-century baroque: "At the beginning of the seventeenth century," Foucault writes, "during the period that has been termed, rightly or wrongly, the baroque, thought ceases to move in the element of resemblance."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  According to Foucault, the Baroque was a transitional period, which saw the first articulation of modernity, and contained the emergent elements of what would become Enlightenment rationalism as well as the residual, premodern knowledge that was losing authority. If placed under the optic of Foucault's theory of the baroque as the expression of an epochal and epistemic threshold, the characteristic disharmonies of baroque representation enumerated in formalist morphologies of the baroque such as Woelfflin's are historicized <i>and</i>validated at the same time. Well-known topoi of baroque theorizing, such as the yoking of opposites within fragmented, unbalanced, and open wholes (<i>coincidentia oppositorum</i>); movement; and the impulse to break up static forms and transgress boundaries, all resonate with the epistemic break posited by Foucault. The content of baroque form grapples with the crisis of modernity in an 

<b></b>

ambivalent way, which can be characterized by the inclusive logic of both/and, rather than the dualistic logic of either/or. 
</p>

<p>
Foucault's case for the baroque as an alternate modernity is stated even more urgently by Gilles Deleuze in his 1988 study of seventeenth-century philosopher Gottfried Leibniz.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  For Deleuze, the baroque offers a unique response to the modern problem of the loss of traditional principles and beliefs: "[W]hat happened in this long history of nihilism," Deleuze asks, "before the world lost its principles?" 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

At a point close to us human Reason had to collapse, like the Kantian refuge, the last refuge of principles. It falls victim to "neurosis." But still, before, a psychotic episode was necessary. A crisis and collapse of all theological Reason had to take place. That is where the Baroque assumes its position: Is there some way of saving the theological ideal at a moment when it is being contested on all sides, and when the world cannot stop accumulating its "proofs" against it, ravages and miseries, at a time when the earth will soon shake and tremble . . . ? The Baroque solution is the following: we shall multiply principles&#x02014;we can always slip a new one out from under our cuffs&#x02014;and in this way we will change their use. We will not have to ask what available object corresponds to a given luminous principle, but what hidden principle responds to whatever object is given, that is to say, to this or that "perplexing case." [ . . . ] A case being given, we shall invent its principle.

<p class="noIndent">
According to Deleuze, Leibniz's philosophy represents an alternate rationality because his thinking enacts the multiplication, rather than the reduction, of principles&#x02014;in contrast to systematic Enlightenment rationality. "The Baroque is just that," Deleuze adds, "at a time just before the world loses its principles. It is the splendid moment when Some Thing is kept rather than nothing, and where response to the world's misery is made through an excess of principles, a hubris of principles . . . ." (<i>F</i>, 68). Deleuze's phrase, the excess of principles, echoes throughout the following discussion of the baroque as the rhetoric of abundance that is at the same time, as Deleuze implies and others claim explicitly, a rhetoric of insufficiency. 
</p>

<p>
The twentieth-century recuperation of baroque representation, therefore, is not a nostalgic gesture towards lost premodern unities and beliefs, but the opposite, a critical genealogy of modernity whereby the very principles of modern knowledge and representation are subjected to a deconstructive transformation. Following Cuban theorist and novelist Severo Sarduy in his 1972 essay, "The Baroque and the Neobaroque," I understand the neobaroque as a critical revision of the historical baroque, the first articulation, as both Foucault and Sarduy agree, of signification as artifice and the definition of meaning and identity through difference.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
My goal here is also to explore the transnational dimension of Barnes's modernism&#x02014;not the international style variety, but Barnes's affinities with the baroque countermodernity as theorized by Foucault, Deleuze, Sarduy, and others. Between her arrival in 1921 as a newspaper correspondent and her final departure for New York in 1940, Barnes lived in Paris and other European cities.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  The post-World War I period saw the rediscovery of the historical baroque across Europe's literatures and cultures: the 1927 centenary of the death of Spanish poet Don Luis de G&#x000F3;ngora heralded 

<b></b>

the revival of "Gongorism," previously considered "decadent," by poets of the "Generation of 1927." The influence of Barnes's lifelong friend and editor, T. S. Eliot, stimulated the rediscovery of Donne and the Metaphysical poets in the 1920s.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  German Expressionists celebrated their affinity with the baroque, based on transhistorical parallels.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Intellectual historians of the totalizing <i>Geistesgeschichte</i> variety, such as German philosophers Wilhelm Worringer and Oswald Spengler, and Catalan philosopher Eugenio d'Ors, have popularized the idea of the baroque as an ahistorical "late style" and a constant of the human spirit that recurs across different geographies and historical periods.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  (This dissociation of the baroque from a distinct historical period term and its identification with a recurring trans-historical style, of course, prepared the ground for the recognition of affinities between, say, Expressionism and the baroque in the first place.) Finally, in the 1920s, literature departments in Europe, especially (but not exclusively) in Germany and Switzerland, experienced a vogue for scholarship on the baroque, which Walter Benjamin documents.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
But perhaps the most important factor in the twentieth-century revival of the baroque is modernist writers themselves. As Mexican critic and poet Octavio Paz remarks in his study of the seventeenth-century Mexican poet, Sor Juana In&#x000E9;s de la Cruz, the relevance of the baroque in the twentieth century is due to "striking similarities between the aesthetic doctrine of the baroque . . . and the ideas of the avantgarde."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Paz continues:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The coincidence between baroque and avant-garde poetics is not a question of influences but rather a question of an affinity operating as much in the sphere of the intellect as in sensibilities. The baroque poet hoped to astonish and astound; Apollinaire proposed exactly the same thing when he extolled surprise as one of the basic elements of poetry. The baroque poet attempts to discover the secret relationships among things, exactly as affirmed and practiced by Eliot and Wallace Stevens. . . . Vicente Huidobro, the initiator of modern poetry in our language [Spanish], preached an art of invention in which the image created a reality independent of and even contrary to natural reality. Not unrealism or surrealism, but antirealism, or better, metarealism. His was a poetics that sought to turn its back on nature and reality. G&#x000F3;ngora, D&#x000E1;maso Alonso has said, created metaphors that were equations raised to the third degree: his raw material was neither spoken nor literary language but, rather, the metaphor of the metaphors of those languages. This describes exactly the images of Huidobro and the Hispanic avant-garde.

It was no coincidence, Paz reminds us, that avant-garde movements and writers, like Eliot and the "Generation of 27," initiated the revival of the historical baroque. In the following, I hope to show that we may count Djuna Barnes among this circle of avant-garde aficionados of the baroque.

<i>Ladies' Almanack</i> : Parodic Queer Hagiography
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Barnes criticism has firmly situated <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>  in the lesbian expatriate counterculture of Left-Bank Paris: the little calendar book, with text and drawings by Barnes, is a biographical roman &#x000E0; clef. It is concerned with the members of Barnes's 

<b></b>

lesbian circle, of which Barnes's best friend Mina Loy ("Patience Scalpel") was the token heterosexual member.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Apparently beloved by the women it features (such as Natalie Barney, Uma Troubridge, and Janet Flanner ["ST," 167]), but only reluctantly acknowledged by Barnes herself (who published the treatise anonymously, attributing authorship to the pseudonym "Lady of Fashion," and who also does not appear in it as a character), this short text poses severe stylistic obstacles to the reader that are only partially explained by the in-group character of the biographical allegory. Even after the identities of the historical personages are revealed (Dame Musset is Natalie Barney, Lady Buck-and-Balk and Tilly-Tweed-In-Blood are Uma Troubridge and Radclyffe Hall, respectively, to mention only a few of its more than a dozen characters), the meaning of the text remains relatively inaccessible. This inaccessibility is the effect of Barnes's signature ornate, indirect, hyperbolic style. One obvious and often advanced reason for its use is censorship: Barnes's subject matter, lesbian identity, sexuality and culture, remained under threat of publishing bans throughout the 1920s.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
While self-censorship may explain pseudonymous publication, the virtual absence of the term "lesbian" (only used once, in the phrase "lesbian eye" [<i>LA</i>, 35]) and a good deal of circumlocution around the details of lesbian sexuality, it does not explain the persistent stylistic exaggeration, the use of outlandish conceits, of archaisms, of capitalization, of narrative chapter titles.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Susan Lanser vividly describes the book's bawdy illustrations as "baroque cherubs, medieval grotesques, parodic iconography, feminized zodiacs, sexual caricature, and other emblems archaic and arcane" ("ST," 157). <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> summons what Severo Sarduy calls neobaroque "artificialization" in order to escape the realist claims of turn-of-the-century scientific sexological discourse and its dominant "objectivist" constructions of deviant lesbian identity and sexuality. <i>Nightwood</i>, as Dana Seitler has pointed out (and this is true for <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> as well) "relies on, even as it perverts, medical and evolutionary tropes for sexual alterity informed by the conception of the mannish lesbian. . . . In fact, Barnes takes much pleasure in ironically redeploying early twentieth-century sexual politics, sometimes through a series of hilarious gender inversions" ("DAF," 544).<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Many characters, major and minor, in both of Barnes's "queer" texts (I use "queer" merely as a neutral and descriptive term for their setting in non-heterosexual subcultures) are parodic clones of the so-called "invert," the scientific re of the "third sex." Among them are Robin Vote, "the girl who resembles a boy" (<i>N</i>, 135), the crossdressing Doctor O'Connor, who cherishes "in his heart the wish for children and knitting" (<i>N</i>, 91), and the chief protagonist of <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>, Dame Evangeline Musset, whom the frontispiece describes as "carrying a pole and a muff" (<i>LA</i>, n. pag.). Barnes's discourse on any referential "subject" of the outside world, including and especially sexuality, is avowedly artificial and non-realistic. It summons baroque associations between resemblance, artifice, and deception to dismantle the truth claims of scientific sexology by opening up a subversive, self-consciously metafictional space of representation.
</p>

<p>
According to post-structuralist Cuban theorist Severo Sarduy, the baroque is 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
an overflowing cornucopia, renowned for its prodigality and dissipation . . . a mockery of all functionality, of all sobriety. . . . Hence, its mechanism of periphrasis, of digression and 

<b></b>

detour, of duplication and even of tautology. Verbiage, squandered forms, language which, because of its excessive abundance, can no longer designate things but only other designators of things [ . . . signifiers] which enfold other [ . . . signifiers] in a mechanism of signification which ends by designating only itself, revealing its own grammar. . . . Language which speaks of language, the baroque superabundance is generated by the synonymic supplement . . . ." ("BN," 124)<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Sarduy sees the baroque as revolutionary literature because of its grand refusal of all "service," all functionality outside itself, including that of communication, referentiality, realism, political or religious orthodoxy, etc. Because of its anti-functionalism, the baroque is allied to eroticism, for like eroticism, baroque language is "no more than a parody of the function of reproduction, a transgression of the useful, of the 'natural' dialogue of bodies" ("BN," 130). Yet how does the baroque conduct this verbal squandering in the exercise of playfulness and pleasure? Offering a structuralist model of signification, Sarduy distinguishes three mechanisms in the process of artificialization: substitution, proliferation, and condensation. The second, proliferation, is the most useful for our purposes. More radical than substitution, which replaces one signifier (literal) by another (ral), proliferation describes a (theoretically) infinite "chain of [ . . . signifiers] which progresses metonymically and which finally circumscribes the absent [ . . . signifier], tracing an orbit all around it" ("BN," 118). Sarduy calls this process a "radial reading" ("BN," 118), for the circularity of the baroque signifying process that orbits around an absent signified, not to mention referent in the outside world. It should be clear by now that the Foucault of the <i>History of Sexuality</i> would not agree with Sarduy's premise of a liberation from institutional discipline through (neo)baroque language, obscene/bawdy or otherwise, as Dianne Chisholm reminds us in her illuminating discussion of intersections between <i>Nightwood</i> and surrealism ("OM," 169).<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Indeed, the dark and nihilistic tone of <i>Nightwood</i> is much less conducive to Sarduy's celebration (if not his linguistic analysis) of the subversiveness of metaphoric and metalinguistic discourse. Yet, I would argue, <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> is; this little book easily lends itself to a Sarduyan revolutionary liberation from utilitarianism through the anarchy of neobaroque hyper-ral language.
</p>

<p>
Generically, <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> is a parodic hagiography, a parody of the account of medieval saints' lives so popular during the baroque in Catholic and Counter-Reformation Southern Europe. Saints' Days and festivals link the cult of saints to the ritual calendar of Church liturgy. Hence the almanac structure of Barnes's book, which follows the months of one year, marking seasonal festivals. A second temporality&#x02014;not cyclical, but historical time&#x02014;traces a linear narrative from Dame Musset's birth (told in a preface before the annual cycle begins) to her death in the month of December. Barnes uses the genre of hagiography and its Catholic iconography to construct a lesbian culture. Dame Evangeline Musset is a saint with a difference, a queer saint. The reasons for Barnes's recourse to Catholic (rather than Protestant) iconography are fairly obvious. To begin with, Protestant iconoclasm and rejection of the cult of saints as intercessors between God and the believers erased all feminine res from Christian religion (most importantly, the Virgin Mary). Although saints are predominantly 

<b></b>

male (historian Stephen Wilson reports that the proportion of women among the Roman Catholic canon of saints "never rose above 20 per cent until [ . . . the twentieth] century," a significant imbalance since "women seem always to have participated fully in saints' cults"), saints seem to largely escape the normative binary gender system.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Once canonized, female saints command as much reverence and power as male saints (the Virgin Mary being most powerful of all). Since saints are commonly known for their cures and their miraculous intercession on behalf of humans (thus, all fulfilling stereotypically "feminine" caretaking functions), gender characteristics do not affect the election of female as opposed to male saints&#x02014;in one sense, all saints are feminine. Being highly "specialized," furthermore, saints give aid and patronage to various groups and issues, such as 1) toothache, 2) specific countries and towns, 3) fireters, 4) lost and stolen objects, 5) pregnant women. Dictionaries of saints offer long lists of the principal patronages of saints and their iconographical emblems, which reveal an astonishingly exotic taxonomy that seems to be principally infinite and non-exclusionary.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Each and every place, group, or person on earth can potentially have their saint: what prevents Left Bank expatriate women writers from having theirs? Here would probably be one major reason why Barnes chose the genre of hagiography and the saint as a parodic model of lesbian selfhood: it is a way of escaping the all-encompassing dichotomies of gender and sex that enforce constructions of lesbian subjectivity as lack or deviance.
</p>

<p>
There is an anarchic element in saints' cults: they spring up locally, as part of popular religion; the organized Church and the clergy, on the other hand, can only partially control this spontaneous process through canonization procedures. There is a transgressive excess in the cult of saints that seems to escape the panoptic power of the Foucauldian disciplinary confessional: believers in need may go on a pilgrimage instead of seeing a priest, thereby escaping ecclesiastic power. Wilson discusses the histories of saints' cults as vehicles of political opposition within the Church.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  "As saints are persons possessed of a charisma that is potentially dangerous and anarchic," Wilson explains, "so pilgrimage cuts across geographical and social boundaries, takes people out of their established places, mixes social strata and the sexes, allows individuals to wander like vagabonds. . . . The pilgrimage route . . . became a regular vehicle for cultural exchange. . . ." (<i>STC</i>, 14). The apocryphal legend of Dame Evangeline Musset, narrated anonymously by "a Lady of Fashion," suggests&#x02014;or rather, simulates&#x02014;the popular creation of a heroine outside of official institutions and history. In <i>Nightwood</i>, Doctor O' Connor explains the difference between history and legend, the history of the dispossessed: "[T]hink of the stories that do not amount to much! That is, that are forgotten in spite all man remembers . . . merely because they befell him without distinction of office or title&#x02014;that's what we call legend and it's the best a poor man may do with his fate; the other . . . we call history, the best the high and mighty can do with theirs" (<i>N</i>, 15). The subaltern genre of legend resignified by Barnes in <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> holds another explanation for its pseudonymous publication. This explanation takes some pressure off "all the questions," which Karla Jay urges us to "ask about Barnes's absence" as a fictional character from the artificial world of Dame Musset 

<b></b>

("OAE," 193). Less than an "author" or a "known contemporary," Barnes merely assumes the anonymous persona of a popular follower of her heroine who records, rather than invents, a collective oral legend. 
</p>

<p>
Patron saints are venerated by their devotees; by analogy, Dame Musset's queer sainthood implies the existence of a community, a lesbian community. The preface addresses this community, introducing <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> as the book "which all Ladies should carry about with them, as the Priest his Breviary, as the Cook his Recipes, as the Doctor his Physic, as the Bride her Fears, and as the Lion his Roar!" (<i>LA ,</i> 9). The cult of saints thus constructs a collective, public subjectivity, a public, adult identity defined independently of the Freudian family and its known polymorphous perversions. The conceit of hagiography allows Barnes to draft a narrative of physical and spiritual love that steers clear of the script of modern scientific psychoanalytic and sexological discourse (whose constructs of the "mannish lesbian" and feminine "lack" are also distorted parodically, as we shall see). Premodern and early modern narrative is resuscitated to deflect the panoptic gaze of modern science. <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> mixes premodern and scientific knowledge, juxtaposing the "faith" of the cult of saints to modern science's reductive and mechanistic classifications. In this respect, it resembles the works of some seventeenth-century scholars, such as the Englishman Robert Burton (author of Barnes's favorite book, <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i> [1621]), the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz, or the Mexican <i>savant</i> Carlos Siguenza y G&#x000F3;ngora, who sought to reconcile scholasticism (the doctrine of revealed authority), and classical and modern science, or faith and reason.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Similarly, Dame Evangeline's devotees worship their "wonder worker" saint (depicted in the frontispiece) in a way that modern science would dismiss as superstition. Upon the death of Dame Musset, Barnes's narrator reports, 
</p>

The funeral cortege, on its way to Evangeline's final resting place, is greeted by wild animals who join the human chorus of mourning, testifying to the cosmic repercussions of the saint's death: "a bird came, and in passing, crowed lamentably," followed by a "Mountain Goat," which also "lamented bitterly," which in turn is followed by a "Night'owl" who said, "'Oh! God!'" (<i>LA</i>, 83). The list goes on, drifting, once again, into the hyperbolic. To be sure, the na&#x000EF;ve faiths of popular Catholicism and animism Barnes incorporates here are slanted parodically, but this is not the same as invalidating the Evangeline legend as "irrational." 
</p>

<p>
In the fictional world of <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>, the marvelous is as real as that which is not marvelous&#x02014;a simply given fact. Barnes's narrative incorporates the fantastic and the miraculous to critique the exclusively rational concept of reality, the reductive 

<b></b>

materialist realism of modern science. In <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>, the miraculous aspects of Dame Evangeline's life are treated as seriously, or as non-seriously, as the myths of modern sexology&#x02014;both are subjected to neobaroque procedures of artificialization and exposed as fictions. For example, the book offers two "origin myths" of lesbianism, one rational, the other, fantastic. The first explains that "Evangeline Musset . . . had been developed in the Womb of her most gentle Mother to be a Boy," therefore, when she "came forth an Inch or so less," she "paid no Heed to the Error," fulfilling her prenatal destiny (<i>LA</i>, 7). The second, narrated in the March chapter, tells of the miraculous birth of "the first Women . . . with a Difference" from an egg, hatched, in less than nine months, by a gathering of angels (<i>LA</i>, 24-6). The first, an allusion to the modern pseudo-scientific myth that, as Karla Jay puts it, "lesbianism was caused by parents who strongly desired a son" ("OAE," 186) invalidates the second as much as the second invalidates the first: both stories are exposed as fictions, myths.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup> <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>'s opulent fabulations critique the reductive and mechanistic rationality of modern science, echoing Deleuze's description of the baroque thought of Leibniz. They multiply, rather than reduce, principles of understanding. 
</p>

<p>
Here, I would suggest, lies one major explanation for Barnes's baroque circumlocutions with regard to the subject of lesbianism.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  The Sarduyan substitution of terms such as "Ladies" or "modern Girl" (<i>LA</i>, 22) for "lesbian" fashions an artificialization that distances the fictional world of <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> from denotation and realism. The proliferation of metaphors ("first Woman born with a Difference") describes a Sarduyan "radial reading" around the absent signified (lesbianism), which enables the knowledge created in the text to elude reduction to a vehicle of denotative communication. The baroquely spiraling language of <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> takes pleasure in its prodigality and transgression of conventional realism. Thus, in the April section, notice the following parody of the medical classification of the symptoms of the unnamed "distemper": 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Acute Melancholy is noticeable in those who have gone a long Way into the matter, whereas a light giggling, dancing Fancy seems to support those in the very first Stages; brief of Thought; cut of Concentration; a Tendency to hop, skip, and jump, and to misplace the Eye at every single or several Manifestation of Girl in like Distemper. Chill succeeds, and Restlessness at Night, of unaccountable Tabulation of unimportant Objects. . . . This gives place, in from six to eight Weeks, to a Sobriety that includes thoughts of Transmigration, Levitation, Myopia and Blight. The Eye trickles, the Breath is short, the Spleen distended, and the Epiglottis rises and falls like the continual swallowing of the Heart. Whereupon the Veins are seen to lift themselves, the Nerves twitch, the Palms become moist, the Feet lose their activity, the Bowels contract, and, as in the old Days when a Person in the last stages of Hydrophobia sometimes found small Whelps in the Urine, in the Waters of such is seen the fully Robed on-marching re of Venus no larger than a Caraway Seed, a Trident in one Hand and a Gos-Wasp on the Left Fist.

Dame Musset's given name, Evangeline, speaks to her tireless proselytizing in the service of her cause. The story of her life is the story of her conversions, by seduction, of new members for her cult. The February chapter lists Evangeline's "saints days" 

<b></b>

(<i>LA</i>, 14), one for each month, detailing the good works for which she was sainted: "When well thirty," we learn, "she, like all Men before her, made a Harlot a good Woman, by making her Mistress" (<i>LA</i>, 15-7). This particular "miracle cure" can be traced to a definite episode in the life of the young Natalie Barney, who had indeed seduced a "known courtesan"&#x02014;but only by expert readers who are familiar with the biographies of the writers portrayed, many of whom were unable to identify themselves.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  By all appearances, Barnes took pains to obscure even the allegorical references to her writer-friends' lives, signaling that not even in <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>'s dimension as a closet biography did the referential function play a prominent part.
</p>

<p>
Barnes pointedly avoids using one popular plot of saints' lives&#x02014;the story of martyrdom&#x02014;signaling her refusal to employ the tragic plot for lesbian identity that appears in Radclyffe Hall's <i>The Well of Loneliness</i>. But she does use another&#x02014;the plot of conversion, the story of sinner become saint. As always, Barnes resignifies codes: Dame's queer saint herself was, pointedly, never converted, but born into the condition. Most of her followers, on the other hand, are the products of Evangeline's conversion-seduction. Born with "an inch or so less" (<i>LA</i>, 7), Dame Musset parodies the post-Freudian psycho-biological discourse of feminine "lack." To her father's lament about observing "fatherly sentiments" in his daughter, Evangeline replies, "'Thou, good Governor, wast expecting a Son when you lay atop of your Choosing, why then be so mortal wounded when you perceive that you have your Wish? Am I not doing after your very Desire, and is it not the more commendable, seeing that I do it without the Tools for the Trade, and yet nothing complain?" (<i>LA</i>, 8).<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
As each saint has her or his unique iconography and attributes, so does Dame Evangeline. In a mixed genre of word and image, text and drawings, the frontispiece introduces the heroine as "a Wonder Worker [ . . . who] was perhaps at her very best when, carrying a pole and a muff, and sporting an endearing tippet, she stepped out upon that exceedingly thin ice to which it has pleased God, more and more, to call frail women, there so conducting herself that none were put to the chagrin of sinking for the third time" (<i>LA</i>, n. pag.). We should see Dame Musset's "pole" within the premodern and early modern hagiographic convention of constructing subjectivity, as well as within the Freudian post-romantic psychoanalytic tradition. In this light, the charged pole is not just what it seems to be for the post-Freudian reader, a phallic substitute: it is also, and simply, Musset's emblem, just as Mary Magdalen's emblem is an ointment jar (a reference to her former life of luxury) or Saint Francis of Assisi's emblem is birds. The post-Freudian sign is psychological and interiorized; the emblem is not, but typically refers to an episode in the saint's life and works&#x02014;in Musset's case, it is an allusion to her miraculous cures. The pole's ambiguous status is another example of the Sarduyan procedure of artificialization, as well as of Deleuze's process of the multiplication of principles: one signifier has been superimposed upon another, introducing a gap between sign and meaning whose effect is the subversion of literal, communicative language. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Ladies' Almanack</i>, then, subverts the modern scientific discourse of "phallic" insufficiency by parodically recuperating a medieval and early modern iconography which 

<b></b>

circumvents the traps of the modern sexual system and scientific sexological discourse. The book ends with another of Barnes's hilariously bawdy episodes, in which Dame Musset's famed "tongue," with which she has converted and seduced women during her life, becomes her relic after her death. As Dame Musset is cremated for her burial in the December chapter, her tongue will not burn, but "flamed, and would not suffer Ash, and it played about" (<i>LA</i>, 84), giving pleasure after her death. Here, Barnes heretically appropriates the pentecostal imagery of holy tongues given to the apostles to inspire their work of conversion. Similarly, Musset's tongue comes upon the mourners at her funeral who honor her life and work. Typically, as Stephen Wilson points out, the cult of saints is the cult of the dead; saints' cults are oriented around their tombs and relics. Their healing power is posthumous, and saints' cults contain a great deal of necrophilia (<i>STC</i>, 9-10). On the one hand, Barnes has resignified the conventions of popular Catholicism by shifting the accent from death to life, and canonizing her fictional saint during her lifetime. On the other, Dame Musset bodily remains yield a relic, which, like so many saints' bones, is coveted by devotees. And the final illustration in the book is a drawing of Evangeline's tomb, the shrine where her devotees continue to worship.

<i>Nightwood:</i> Melancholic Knowledge and Baroque Curiosity
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Like <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>, <i>Nightwood</i> is set in a world on the margins of official history: its protagonists, including its minor characters, are social outsiders&#x02014;homosexuals, Jews, artists and circus people. As if to emphasize the non-normative character of its social world, almost all of the episodes are set at night or in dark interiors. However, what one critic has called Barnes's "anatomy of the nightworld" reaches beyond its confines: more ambitious than <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>, <i>Nightwood</i> aims to deconstruct the social and discursive authority that, in the metaphoric language of the novel's symbol patterns, divides "night" from "day"&#x02014;or rationality, consciousness, domesticity and order from its Others: madness, desire, grief, dreams, perversity. In <i>Nightwood</i>, Djuna Barnes deconstructs the disciplinary authorities of language and society. My claim is that hyperbolic baroque signification, or the procedure Sarduy calls artificialization, brings about this deconstruction. 
</p>

<p>
As most of <i>Nightwood</i>'s commentators have noted, the novel offers only a minimal plot and sketchy character development: set in the U.S., and European capitals Paris, Berlin and Vienna during the 1920s, <i>Nightwood</i>'s spare plot is propelled forward by Robin Vote's promiscuity, centering on her tormented relationships with her lovers. Jewish convert to Catholicism and false Baron Felix Volkbein meets the unlicensed gynecologist and scholar Doctor O'Connor, who introduces him to Robin Vote, a young American. They marry and have a child, but Robin soon abandons Felix and goes to America, where she meets the artist Nora Flood. Nora and Robin settle in Paris, but Robin soon takes to wandering again, and meets Jenny Petherbridge, with whom she leaves for America. Nora, disconsolate, seeks out the Doctor in his quarters in Paris for advice and comfort. Before moving to Vienna with his mentally disabled son Guido, 

<b></b>

Felix does the same. Three of the final chapters are driven by the interminable talk of the Doctor, who falls silent in the end before the magnitude of pain. His monologue breaks off with the words, "now <i>nothing, but wrath and weeping</i>" (<i>N</i>, 166). Powerless to control or order the tragic reality it describes, language yields to silence and grief. In the last chapter, Robin, adrift once again, turns up in an abandoned chapel on Nora's property in the U.S. In an enigmatic and disturbing scene the novel describes as "obscene and touching" (<i>N</i>, 170), she falls to barking and running with Nora's dog. Here, the arc of collapse that the plot has been charting through its symbol pattern of "descent" and through the spiritual defeats of all the major characters culminates in Robin's regression to an animal state. 
</p>

<p>
This scene of "human becoming-animal" harks back to an earlier complementary scene of animal becoming-human, Robin's "awakening" by the Doctor. <i>Nightwood</i> traces a circular trajectory for Robin that shows her to first appear, and then finally disappear, at the boundary of the primitive, the mythic, the archaic. Robin is said to be "outside the human type," a "wild thing caught in a woman's skin" (<i>N</i>, 146). As Felix puts it, "The Baronin had an undefinable disorder, a sort of 'odour of memory,' like a person who has come from some place that we have forgotten and would give our life to recall" (<i>N</i>, 118). Robin is a supernatural character even more marginal than the others because she is the embodiment of everything that is alien and deviant in the human social order: an emblem of the female Other in Western culture, Robin represents the empty center of <i>Nightwood</i>'s tragic narrative. She is both the paradigmatic object of the characters' desire and the focal object of the novel's baroque ornate, proliferating discourse. Robin has a primal vitality that makes her irresistible to humans; but driven by anarchic desires for nomadic wandering and promiscuous sexuality, she cannot be domesticated by her lovers. Neither is the Doctor's considerable erudition and volubility able to bring order into the chaos Robin leaves in her wake. 
</p>

<p>
Robin's status as the enigmatic object of representation is partly the result of a subtle management of narrative technique and devices of distancing and closeness. Barnes refuses to reflect or focalize the story through Robin's mind, although she grants an inside view of Felix, the Doctor, and especially of Nora. Robin does not speak more than a few phrases and expresses herself through silent gestures, as when, after giving birth to her son, she screams, "I didn't want him!" (<i>N</i>, 49) or upon meeting Nora in the circus, she exclaims, "Let's get out of here!" and "I don't want to be here" (<i>N</i>, 54-5). Spoken for and seen through the consciousness of others, Robin is never represented through psychological realism, one of the achievements of modernist experimentation. In general, <i>Nightwood</i>'snarration is unabashedly authorial, deviating from the mainstream of modernism in its refusal to abandon omniscient narration for subjectivist representation and psychological realism. Typically, Barnes's narrator describes her characters from the outside, speaking from a position aloof from the narrated events. <i>Nightwood</i>'s distinctive lack of interiority is a baroque feature, for, as Octavio Paz explains in a discussion contrasting the baroque with Romanticism, "baroque transgression focuses on the object. Romanticism liberates the subject; the baroque is the art of the metamorphosis of the object. . . . Romantic transgression culminates in the apotheosis 

<b></b>

of the subject or in its fall; baroque transgressions lead to the appearance of an unheard-of-object. . . . [T]he subject disappears in the baroque object" (<i>SJ</i>, 154).
</p>

<p>
When we first encounter Robin in the chapter named for her hybrid being, "La Somnambule," she is lying unconscious on a bed, surrounded by proliferating plants, where she is "brought to life" by the Doctor's dubious and magical ministrations: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The woman who presents herself to the spectator as a "picture" forever arranged is, for the contemplative mind, the chiefest danger. Sometimes one meets a woman who is beast turning human. Such a person's every movement will reduce to an image of a forgotten experience; a mirage of an eternal wedding cast on the racial memory; as insupportable a joy as would be the vision of an eland coming down an aisle of trees, chapleted with orange blossoms and bridal veil, a hoof raised in the economy of fear, stepping in the trepidation of flesh that will become myth; as the unicorn is neither man nor beast deprived, but human hunger pressing its breast to its prey. Such a woman is the infected carrier of the past: before her the structure of our head and jaws ache&#x02014;we feel that we could eat her, she who is eaten death returning. . . .

<p class="noIndent">
Here, the baroque discourse layers conceit over conceit, without ever reaching a conclusion. The reader witnesses, as Paz puts it, the metamorphosis of the object; Robin's subjectivity has "imploded" into her object-hood as the archetypal Other and object of desire and representation. Consider the metonymic succession of signifiers referring to Robin: "the beast turning human" "image of a forgotten experience" "mirage of an eternal wedding" "vision of an eland" "unicorn" "an infected carrier of the past" "eaten death returning." To begin with, this process epitomizes the "radial reading" Sarduy describes in his essay on "The Baroque and the Neobaroque": the dynamic movement of language generates "a chain of signifiers which progresses metonymically and which finally circumscribes the absent [ . . . signified], tracing an orbit all around it" ("BN," 188). The baroque proliferation of signifiers works to obscure meaning rather than clarify it; for, as Sarduy explains, the substitution of metaphors by other metaphors amplifies the distance between sign and meaning, thus highlighting the gap between them. To call Robin, a young woman the Doctor knows and treats, a "vision of an eland coming down the aisle of trees," to link her to such dissimilar objects as elands or unicorns is to bury "natural" and literal signification under successive layers of artifice. The result, as Sarduy points out, is anti-realism, the creation of a reality independent of natural reality, the "mockery of nature" ("BN," 116).
</p>

<p>
Here, we reach an interesting impasse: notice the difference between Robin's supposed primitive nature, the essence of her desirability and "damnation," and the chain of signifiers that links Robin to ever more surreal instances of primitivism and perversity. <i>Is</i>Robin the incarnation of animalism and polymorphous perversity, <i>or</i> is it all baroque make-believe, a device for trapping the reader in an artifice, a labyrinth of signs, an all-encompassing fiction? One of the first glimpses of Robin compares her sleeping re to "a painting by the <i>douanier</i> Rousseau, she seemed to lie in a jungle trapped in a drawing room . . . thrown in among the carnivorous flowers as their ration" (<i>N</i>, 35). Her first meeting with Nora (who later remarks that "Robin is incest too; 

<b></b>

that is one of her powers" [<i>N</i>, 156]) at a circus performance again associates her with the primitive: "a powerful lioness come to the turn of the bars, exactly opposite the girl [Robin], she turned her furious head with its yellow fire and went down, her paws thrust through the bars and, as she regarded the girl . . . her eyes flowed in tears that never reached the surface" (<i>N</i>, 54). The caged lioness weeps tears of pity for Robin, recognizing a bond of common imprisonment. 
</p>

<p>
The process of Robin's becoming-animal and the recuperation of <i>Nightwood</i>'s sexual and social transgression became the focus of feminist readings of Barnes. These probed <i>Nightwood</i>'s formalist fa&#x000E7;ade, praised by T. S. Eliot for its "great achievement of style," while he warned that "[t]o regard this group of people as a horrid sideshow of freaks is . . . to miss the point" (<i>N</i>, xvi). Feminist readings, reacting against the formalist emphasis on style, saw <i>Nightwood</i> as a novel which, albeit in an indirect way mediated by modernist design, brought to visibility various countercultures, not just the lesbian. They celebrated <i>Nightwood</i>'s carnivalesque articulation of the deviant desires of, to echo Jane Marcus' reading, "the body of the Other&#x02014;the black, the lesbian, transvestite, or Jew."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  However, recent assessments of <i>Nightwood</i> are much more skeptical than optimistic, especially of the claim that the novel is a representation of lesbianism: the novel "frustrates identitarian notions of sexuality," writes Dana Seitler, echoing Dianne Chisholm's statement that Barnes's "narration does not voice the struggle of an emerging subculture . . . Instead of speaking out on lesbianism in cryptic modernism, <i>Nightwood</i> seriously challenges the epistemological and ontological claims of sexual discourse in general and the category of 'inversion' in particular" ("OM," 172). Both Chisholm and Seitler offer new historicist readings of Barnes's recodification of scientific sexological discourses of perversity and degeneration in <i>Nightwood</i>. "<i>Nightwood</i> is set in the Paris of Surrealism," writes Chisholm; "we might see [Barnes] as the artificer of an obscene resistance, laboring in tacit solidarity with her Surrealist contemporaries" ("OM," 188, 195). However, Chisholm is leery of letting too much modernist talk of the autonomy of art creep into her analysis: yes, <i>Nightwood</i> is transgressive, but in a pessimistic way that lacks Surrealism's revolutionary optimism. Less than an identitarian (lesbian) counterdiscourse, <i>Nightwood</i> offers only a negative "queer antidiscourse" constructed out of "a heterogeneous re of abjection" that is deployed against dominant sexological discourse ("OM," 186, 195). Seitler, for her part, charges that Chisholm's discussion of obscenity is still too beholden to the question of style and <i>Nightwood</i>'s "uniquely modernist expression," insisting somberly that "<i>Nightwood</i> relies on, even as it perverts, medical and evolutionary tropes for sexual alterity informed by a conception of the mannish lesbian" ("DAF," 544). Immediately, however, Seitler brings back the notion of stylization as a subversive weapon against the epistemological claims of realist discourse: "While Barnes incorporates sexological discourse into her narrative, she does so with a twist: she ironically and humorously reformulates those conceptions of sexuality into hyperbolic accounts of the self"("DAF," 545). Like hyperbole, irony is eventually brought back as a transgressive tool: "In fact, Barnes takes much pleasure in ironically redeploying early twentieth-century sexual politics, sometimes through a series of hilarious gender inversions" ("DAF," 544). 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
New historicist readings of <i>Nightwood</i>, written in the wake of Foucault's disciplinary construction of identity and discourse, struggle to salvage a measure of the avant-garde and social transgression that earlier feminist readings were more certain of. My point is that they, too, find the traces of resistance in what is variously called "recodification" or "reformulation," which are polite synonyms for aesthetics and stylization&#x02014;in short, they support the notion that literary form can undermine the authority of the functionalist language of sexology and science. This exactly is Sarduy's claim in his theory of the neobaroque as the apotheosis of artifice and anti-realism. Consider the passage of Robin's awakening cited above: the more links there are in the chain of signifiers surrounding Robin, the more unlikely it is that any of these metaphors will be taken literally, referentially, in the authoritative and didactic way that scientific sexological discourse would use them. Thus, both Chisholm and Seitler seem to be arguing, when the Doctor refers to Robin as an "invert" (<i>N</i>, 136), this term loses its powerful authority simply by being inserted into the galaxy of surreal metaphors already orbiting Robin. <i>Nightwood</i>'s dilating baroque discourse uncovers the fallacies of functionalist-scientific discourse by undermining the reader's belief in the power of naming through singular, exclusive analytical concepts.
</p>

<p>
<i>Nightwood</i>'sdynamic, restless discourse, which proliferates indefinitely the process of naming things, is predicated on lack, or the absence of stable meaning. In an essay on William Faulkner, Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes points to the paradox that verbal abundance is causally linked to epistemological uncertainty: "The baroque, language of abundance, is also the language of insufficiency: only those who have nothing include everything. Their horror of the void is not gratuitous; it is due to the certain fact that one finds oneself within the void, that one lacks security. Verbal abundance in . . . <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> signifies a desperate invocation of a language that fills the absences of reason and faith."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Fuentes advances this justification in defense of the "language of Faulkner contemptuously called 'Dixie Gongorism' by one North American critic."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  The horror of the void, which leads to the baroque habit of leaving no empty spaces, similarly motivates Barnes' language. There, too, it testifies to the crisis of Enlightenment rationality and modern scientific knowledge.
</p>

<p>
<i>Nightwood's</i> language of abundance is, paradoxically, a language of insufficiency, lacking a single authoritative truth. Take the medical theories of homosexual "inversion" and the popular myth of the "mannish woman": Barnes subverts their didactic authority by redeploying them (as Dana Seitler argues) as a series of "hilarious gender (and grotesque) inversions" and portraits of the "third sex" ("DAF," 544). These are the "sideshow of freaks" T. S. Eliot worried might distract readers from appreciating <i>Nightwood</i>'s "great achievement of style." Yet Eliot did not realize (neither did many of Barnes's subsequent critics) that the style and patterns he valued were an active force in creating it. Like the characters in <i>Nightwood</i>, form, too, is transgressive, abnormal: the acrobat Frau Mann ("Mrs. Man"), one of the circus characters, emblematizes the third sex; so do Robin Vote ("the girl who should have been a boy"), and the voluble Doctor with the baroque name, Matthew grain-of-salt-Dante O'Connor, who sometimes "feels like a bride," dresses in women's clothes, and claims that he is "the 

<b></b>

woman God forgot." Baroque style, the "apotheosis of artifice" (Sarduy), de-naturalizes the objects and concepts it re-presents; in the description of the body of Frau Mann&#x02014;allegory of the third sex&#x02014;the natural yields to the artificial: "She seemed to have a skin that was the pattern of her costume . . . and the bulge in the groin where she took the bar . . . was as solid, specialized and as polished as oak. The stuff of her tights was no longer a covering, it was herself; the span of the tightly stitched crotch was so much her own flesh that she was as unsexed as a doll" (<i>N</i>, 13).
</p>

<p>
At this point, we should return to Robin, the empty center of <i>Nightwood</i>'s tragic narrative, and silent object of desire and representation, whose dramatic disintegration in the closing scene completes the collapse of social and narrative authority enacted in the novel. As I have argued, the collapse is double, for as Robin's lovers must "bow down" before their failure to love Robin, so they realize that they cannot "speak" Robin. <i>Nightwood</i>'sdeconstruction of discursive authority becomes emblematic in the moment when the Doctor finally ceases to speak, breaking off his prolific monologues; his last words are, "now <i>nothing, but wrath and weeping</i>" (<i>N</i>, 166). In addition to bringing down the social order of romantic and domesticated love (the lover's desire is not reciprocated), Robin also causes the breakdown of the order of representation. As Carolyn Allen and other critics have pointed out, the Doctor embodies language.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  He presides over the story as a commentator, as <i>Nightwood</i>'s central discursive authority and source of knowledge and comfort. The Doctor's early confidence in his knowledge, displayed in his philosophical monologues on "woman" and "the night," full of learned allusions, gives way to bitter resignation as he realizes that language is nothing but a dress and a lie: "You have dressed the unknowable in the garments of the known" (<i>N</i>, 136). Like that of the others, his decline is steep; he moves from the confident "I will tell you how the day and the night are related by their division" (<i>N</i>, 80) to the resigned "To think is to be sick" (<i>N</i>,158).
</p>

<p>
The disintegration of the doctor's epistemological mastery shows baroque <i>desenga&#x000F1;o</i>, disillusionment&#x02014;the revelation that knowledge is but a dream and a fiction. Matthew finally recognizes that his life is absurd and meaningless: "I have not only lived my life for nothing, but I've told it for nothing" (<i>N</i>, 165). Other characters experience a parallel process of "awakening" from their illusions. Thus, Nora says: "I thought I loved her for her sake, and I found it was for my own" (<i>N</i>, 151). In the long conversations and the Doctor's mock-learned monologues of the last four chapters, all beliefs and relationships dissolve through paradox and inversion: truth is falseness, love is fiction, discursive control is an illusion. The Doctor's bitter recognition of having "dressed the unknowable in the garments of the known" reveals the deeper meaning of his final silence: language is but a "dress" and a "lie," that is to say, it is impotent facing the reality it attempts to represent. The verbal spectacle of <i>Nightwood</i>'s extravagant narration only affirms the failure of language and representation: <i>Nightwood</i> inverts the high modernist doctrine of mastery through technique and narrative design.
</p>

<p>
Contrary to Eliot's famous assertion in his essay, "<i>Ulysses</i>, Order and Myth," that modernist technique "is simply a way of controlling, of ordering, or giving a shape and a significance to the immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is contemporary 

<b></b>

history," experimental narration in <i>Nightwood</i> does not restore order through symbolic reference and mythic narration.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  On the contrary, <i>Nightwood</i>'s metaphoric hyperbole, its frenzied proliferation of images exposes itself, as Fuentes suggests and as Sarduy recognizes, as a language of insufficiency. Eliot clearly viewed <i>Nightwood</i>'s "achievement of style" as compensation for its "psychopathic" (<i>N</i>, xv) element, about which he expressed his discomfort. In fact, the opposite is true. <i>Nightwood</i>'s language is powerless to exert symbolic discipline over reality: ceaselessly dwelling on the disturbing reality it attempts to control (Robin's promiscuity and the "night," or the larger trauma Robin represents), it circles a grief that will not cease and a wound that will not close. The Doctor's final silence is superceded by weeping, and Robin's degeneration from human to animal in the last chapter takes place amidst this weeping after the failure of words. 
</p>

<p>
The Doctor's profuse and rambling disquisitions have the quality of a dream, but his is a rational delirium. Here, Jos&#x000E9; Lezama Lima's description of the American baroque as "curiosidad barroca" ("baroque curiosity"), a baroque that was friendly towards, rather than hostile to, the Enlightenment, sheds light on the fusion of the rational and the irrational in the Doctor's discourses.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  The "night," both the setting and the subject of the Doctor's lectures in "Watchman, What of the Night?," is a hallucinatory world. But, unlike the night of surrealism, the medium of escape from rationality, the night of <i>Nightwood</i> is a profoundly intellectual night. The doctor's speculative and analytical mind classifies and systematizes distinct philosophical, geographical, and phenomenological dimensions of the "night": "Well, I, Dr. Matthew-Mighty-grain-of-salt-Dante-O'Connor, will tell you how the day and the night are related by their division. The very constitution of twilight is a fabulous reconstruction of fear, fear bottom-out and wrong side up. Every day is thought upon and calculated, but the night is not premeditated. The Bible lies the one way, but the night-gown the other. The night, 'Beware of that dark door!'" (<i>N</i>, 80). The Doctor offers a detailed (if maddeningly obscure) ontology of the night: "Our bones ache only while the flesh is on them. Stretch it as thin as the temple flesh of an ailing woman and still it serves to ache the bone and to move the bone about; and in like manner the night is a skin pulled over the head of day that the day may be in a torment. We find no comfort until the night melts away; until the fury of the night rots out its fire" (<i>N</i>, 85).
</p>

<p>
The Doctor's errant thought never comes to definite conclusions. Still, even if knowledge fails in the end, the impulse behind both the Doctor's and Barnes's narration is consciousness, the intellectual mind, rather than the unconscious, and its pre-verbal and pre-rational drives. As the Doctor steps into the foreground in <i>Nightwood</i>'s final discursive chapters, his circumlocutions, digressions, and apologies gradually increase to a full-fledged baroque "horror of the void"&#x02014;a horror of the magnitude of pain&#x02014;which, as all parties involved realize, will reign after the inevitable ceasing of words. Here, <i>Nightwood</i>'s obscure language, obsessively circling its objects of representation&#x02014;Robin and "the night," the lost love object, the humiliation, the past, unfulfilled longings, absence itself&#x02014;finally reveals its impotence before reality. But even if his quest remains unfulfilled, the Doctor's discourse seeks knowledge. <i>Nightwood</i> conducts 

<b></b>

its critique of rationality and representation not in the surrealist manner, by abandoning consciousness and intellect, but, rather, by letting them soar to their highest potential, at which point understanding is overwhelmed and recoils in failure. 
</p>

<p>
In a recent article, Victoria L. Smith identified <i>Nightwood</i>'s language as melancholic, linking its indirection, opacity and sustained use of tropes to the Freudian account of melancholia as loss ("SBI"). Comparing melancholia with temporary sadness at the death of a loved one, Freud described melancholia as an interminable grief about a mysterious loss that is partly hidden from consciousness.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  Smith's argument is convincing regarding Robin's ambiguous role: <i>Nightwood</i> mourns the loss of Robin as the love object that cannot be domesticated; at the same time, grief in <i>Nightwood</i> is larger than what could have been caused by Robin. As Smith notes, "there is perhaps a concatenation of losses, Robin's loss activates, and is contiguous with, larger losses" ("SBI," 202). Smith's notion of a "concatenation of losses" as well as her subsequent comment that "the loss of [ . . . Robin] allows other losses to surface" ("SBI," 203) evoke Sarduy's model, discussed above, of the proliferation of signifiers around an empty center, occupied (but not fully occupied) by Robin. <i>Nightwood</i>'s "rhetorical indirection" calls attention to "something besides its overt narrative," Smith argues, "the novel keens a loss . . . and in doing so calls attention to the style of the lamentation, the one who laments, and the 'dead' or lost object" ("SBI," 194-5).
</p>

<p>
Smith's claims are compatible with the neobaroque dialectic of rhetorical abundance and epistemological insufficiency I have been discussing. I want to extend her argument with respect to the Freudian melancholic ego, which, as Smith points out, is constituted by loss: the melancholic ego is "<i>dependent on loss as a means through which it can represent itself</i>" ("SBI," 203, emphasis in original).<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Like the melancholic obsessive and obscure narrative, the melancholic self stands as a "memorial to loss" ("SBI," 196). According to Smith, Dr. O'Connor epitomizes Freud's melancholic in this re's distinctive self-abasement and self-exposure, its identification with a loss that is no longer confined to a lost object, but which has been transferred onto the self ("SBI," 201). "In mourning," Freud writes, "it is the world which has become poor and empty; in melancholia, it is the ego itself."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In keeping with my focus on Barnes's recuperation of early modern expressive forms and themes, I would like to focus on the long tradition of writing on melancholia preceding Freud, a tradition which Freud himself rewrote through his novel theory of loss. Reviving an Aristotelian doctrine, the Renaissance associated melancholy with learning and genius. The paradigmatic melancholic of early modern iconography, explains Jennifer Radden, was the melancholic scholar, famously depicted by Albrecht D&#x000FC;rer (in his <i>Melencholia I</i>) and by Cesare Ripa.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  This link between melancholy and learning was expanded by cultural intellectuals including Robert Burton, in <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>. While Smith is correct in pointing out the Doctor's affinities with the Freudian re of the self-disparaging melancholic, the Doctor epitomizes even more the early modern re of the melancholic scholar. As Barnes critics agree and as I have discussed above, the most distinctive characteristic of Doctor O'Connor is his learning and his intellect. A "middle-aged 'medical student'" with an interest in 

<b></b>

gynecology (<i>N</i>, 14), the Doctor speculates about Enlightenment philosophy ("We may all be nature's noblemen," <i>N</i>, 15), Biblical legend (Sodom and Gomorrah, <i>N</i>, 86), and many other topics in both high and low culture. Known as a "liar, but a valuable liar" (<i>N</i>, 30), Doctor O'Connor explains the connection between melancholic moods and the intellectual life: "Do you know what has made me the greatest liar this side of the moon, telling my stories to people like you, to take the mortal agony out of their guts . . . " (<i>N</i>, 135). But the link is not just between the suffering of others and the Doctor's torrential mock-learned narrative. The Doctor is a scholar as well as a melancholic: "The scalpel and the Scriptures have taught me that little I did not already know" (<i>N</i>, 153), he claims, yet his brilliance is marred by melancholic gloom. Exclaims the Doctor: "A broken heart have you! I have falling arches, flying dandruff, a floating kidney, shattered nerves <i>and</i> a broken heart! But do I scream that an eagle has me by the balls or has dropped his oyster on my heart? Am I going forward screaming that it hurts, that my mind goes back, or holding my guts as if they were a coil of knives? . . . Isn't everyone in the world peculiarly swung and me the craziest of the lot?" (<i>N</i>, 154). The Doctor's self-diagnosed "floating kidney" evokes and parodies the premodern and early modern humoral theory of melancholia as an imbalance in black bile, causing "smoky vapors to cloud and darken the brain and its functions."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  (As always, Barnes's neobaroque proliferating discourse displaces any such authoritative medical diagnosis by a metonymic chain of other conceits. The "falling arches" and "flying dandruff" are only the beginning of a long series of symptoms of the Doctor's medical condition that, as in the case of Robin's mysterious and primitive nature, keep deferring meaning.)
</p>

Doctor O'Connor's recognition that "[t]o think is to be sick" (<i>N</i>, 158), furthermore, explicitly names the early modern theory that learned pursuits cause melancholy: in one section of <i>The Anatomy of Melancholy</i>, Burton discusses "Love of Learning, or Overmuch Study With a Digression of the Misery of Schollers, and Why the Muses Are Melancholy."

I want to close this discussion with yet another trace that links <i>Nightwood</i> with the seventeenth-century baroque: in <i>Origin of German Tragic Drama</i>, Walter Benjamin 

<b></b>

discusses the plays of Lutheran Germany as "unclassical tragedies"&#x02014;unclassical because the tragic is expressed in a noisy and demonstrative clamor that is antithetical to the silences of Greek tragedy. "The relationship between mourning and ostentation," Benjamin writes, "is . . . brilliantly displayed in the language of the baroque" (<i>OGTD</i>, 140). Like the lamentations of baroque drama, the lamentation in <i>Nightwood</i> is directed at an audience; it is an extroverted rather than introverted grief, a public display that shifts the emphasis from the tragic suffering itself (objectivism) to its expression and articulation (subjectivism and emotional appeal). In <i>Nightwood</i>, as in the baroque plays analyzed by Benjamin, suffering is a spectacle. The hyperbolic performance of suffering in <i>Nightwood</i>, its noisy and torrential lamentations, is the expression of a language that both affirms its self-confidence and undermines it.

Frank writes: "[M]odern literature . . . is moving in the direction of spatial form; and this tendency receives an original development in Djuna Barnes's remarkable book <i>Nightwood</i>." Modernist writers "ideally intend the reader to apprehend their work spatially, in a moment of time, rather than as a sequence" (<i>The Widening Gyre: Crisis and Mastery in Modern Literature</i> [Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1963], 8-9). A section on <i>Nightwood</i> presents Barnes's novel as the paradigm of the "space-logic" of poetry modernist novelists introduce into the "time-logic" of narrative . <i>Nightwood</i> thus epitomizes a modernism as defined as the experimental formalism championed by the New Critics.

Briefly, there is the widespread notion that England did not have baroque writers like those Continental writers (Spanish poet Don Luis de G&#x000F3;ngora, Silesian poet and playwright Andreas Gryphius), who use the ornate and extravagant stylistic trend usually identified with the baroque. Secondly, as Ren&#x000E9; Wellek has pointed out, English literary history preferred to retain existing terms, such as "metaphysical poetry" or "Jacobean tragedy" to adopting "baroque" from art history as a period term. Yet comparisons of Shakespeare's late plays with, say, Cervantes show that the baroque existed as a definite historical and a trans-European phenomenon. The debate has not been resolved. See Ren&#x000E9; Wellek, "The Concept of the Baroque in Literary Scholarship," in <i>Concepts of Criticism</i> (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1963), 69-127, henceforth abbreviated "CBL." On the English Baroque, see Mario Praz, "Baroque in England," <i>Modern Philology</i>61 , 169-79 and "The Flaming Heart: Crashaw and the Baroque," in <i>The Flaming Heart: Essays on Studies in the Relations between Italian and English Literature from Chaucer to Eliot</i> (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1958), 204-63.

This is especially true when the discussion is broadened to juxtapositions of the baroque vs. mannerism, and even more comprehensive attempts to translate art historical period terms (Renaissance, Mannerism, Baroque, Rococo) literally into literary criticism, as in Wylie Sypher, <i>Four Stages of Renaissance Style</i>(Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1955). That is why Wellek, in his well-known critical appreciation, admits the baroque only as a heuristic term ("CBL," 113).

Rather than talking about "the absence of the Enlightenment and the consequent lack of criticism" in Latin America, Celorio suggests, we should speak of "the inseparable union, neither displacement nor rupture, of the Enlightenment and the baroque, of criticism and passion" . Celorio is one of the emerging theorists of the baroque as an alternative or counter-modernity, whose argument for an eccentric baroque modernity on the Latin American periphery of universalizing European modernity complements the arguments of Foucault and Deleuze on the baroque's critical function in Europe.

Wilfried Barner reviews "the intensive discussion of the baroque of the 1920s" whose enthusiasm, fueled by abstract and ahistorical <i>Geistesgeschichte</i>, gradually gave way to critical and historical readings ("Introduction," in <i>Der literarische Barockbegriff</i> ["The Literary Concept of the Baroque"] ed. Wilfried Barner [Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1975], 1-13, 2). Mid-twentieth century scholarship on the literary baroque ran into another, new problem, that of overly specific terminologization and classification, which distorted the situation in the opposite direction, by drawing sharp boundaries between writers, styles and periods where more heterogeneous differences existed. Also see "CBL" for a critical review of literary scholarship on the baroque. Benjamin takes up the notion of analogies between the baroque and Expressionism to gesture towards the topical interest of his subject, the baroque plays of seventeenth-century Germany.

Barnes had first-hand experience with obscenity laws and trials, through her own novel, <i>Ryder</i>, whose American edition was expurgated against her will. Furthermore, Barnes was familiar with the trials of the lesbian novel <i>The Well of Loneliness</i>, for the author, Radclyffe Hall, was a member of Natalie Barney's circle. Of course, legal obscenity suits were a threat homosexual texts shared with other modern literature with heterosexual content, viz. <i>Ulysses</i> and <i>Lady Chatterley's Lover</i>.

Susan Lanser and Karla Jay discuss another reason for self-censorship, Barnes's discomfort with being identified as a member of Barney's lesbian circle and her ambivalence about identifying herself as lesbian. While Jay argues that Barnes's reluctance to do the latter is expressed in a "reductionist vision of lesbianism" in <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> ("OAE," 193), Lanser proposes that the rhetorical stance that matters is the book's "inside stance" ("ST," 165), independent of the author's well-publicized disclaimer, "I'm not a lesbian; I just loved Thelma." From the neobaroque perspective adopted here, the realist grounding of the lesbian text in the lesbian life of the author is not the central issue, given, following queer Cuban theorist Sarduy, the baroque focus on artificialization and the "mockery of nature," which includes the naturalization of the text through reference to the author's life.

Although I hesitate to authenticate Sarduy's discourse on the neobaroque as queer by reference to his biography, given the anti-realist premises of his work and this article, readers unfamiliar with his work should know that his being gay had a significant impact on his life and work, the most important of which was his decision, in 1960, to remain in Paris, where he had come on a Cuban scholarship, and not to return home to what had become post-revolutionary Cuba. His Parisian exile, of course, enabled his future intellectual career as a full member of the Tel Quel circle around Roland Barthes, and the development of his post-structuralist orientation. For a study of Sarduy's work, see Roberto Gonz&#x000E1;lez Echevarr&#x000ED;a, <i>La ruta de Severo Sarduy</i> (Hanover, NH: Ediciones del Norte, 1987).

Barnes biographer Andrew Field notes that <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i> was one of Barnes's "favorite books" (<i>Djuna: The Life and Times of Djuna Barnes</i> [New York: Putnam, 1983]). Herring concurs, citing Barnes's correspondence with Emily Holmes Coleman (<i>DLW ,</i> 219). Leibniz was not just one of Europe's leading rationalists and the co-inventor (with Isaac Newton) of differential calculus; he was also the author of a theodicy, and, infamously, the model for Doctor Pangloss, Voltaire's biting satire of the foolish philosopher, who, despite the evil that he experiences, never abandons his faith "that this is the best of all possible worlds." The literature of the discussion of baroque reason as a hybrid phenomenon&#x02014;seeking a third option beyond the rejection of the Aristotelian-Scholastic tradition for the new mechanical philosophy of the Scientific Revolution&#x02014;includes Deleuze's book on Leibniz, <i>The Fold</i>.

Reading for the biographical allegory in <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>, Jay critiques this description of Natalie Barney as "insulting," considering that Barney "considered herself to be completely feminine," not at all a "pseudo-man" ("OAE," 187, 186). In contrast, I am arguing that biographical realism is not the main point of <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>, but that it is, rather, a critique of the rational concept of reality underlying explanations of the "mannish woman" type.

Lanser makes a similar point when she notes that "[m]any of <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>'s terms for the female body&#x02014;furrow, nook, path, keyhole, whorl, crevice, conch shell . . . &#x02014;are clearly designed to counteract emerging Freudian notions of phallic supremacy and clitoral insufficiency" ("ST," 162).

Jay goes on to discuss (and express her discomfort with) the obscurity of many of the biographical allegories. "Even Natalie Barney, who provided most of the characters' identities in the margins of her own copy of the <i>Almanack</i>, was unable to name all the res in the book, though they were all supposedly either her lovers or intimate members of her circle" .

On the afternoon of 14 November 1993, the so-called "People's Day of Mourning" [<i>Volkstrauertag</i>], the "Central Commemorative Site of the FederalRepublic of Germany" was unveiled in the modest, neoclassical building originally designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, called the Neue Wache, or "New Watch." President Richard von Weizs&#x000E4;cker, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Bundestag President Rita S&#x000FC;ssmuth, Bundesrat Vice-President Henning Voscherau, and Constitutional Court President Roman Herzog entered the building and laid five wreaths at the base of the statue, which bears the inscription "To the Victims of War and Tyranny." Outside, cordoned off by steel barricades and eight hundred riot police in body armor, with plastic shields and leather truncheons, facing a group of spectators and protestors half their number, a solitary soldier stepped forward from the honor guard, raised his trumpet and played an elegiac theme from Brahms under cold and drizzly skies. The entire event lasted less than ten minutes.

These largely symbolic proceedings had been preceded by months of acrimonious controversy that had already led to the decision to erect a separate "Memorial for the Murdered Jews of Europe" near the Brandenburg Gate, and later to further discussion about a second monument to the Roma and Sinti victims of Nazism.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  The controversy was very different from the reception which has greeted another recent memorial in Berlin, a project which is located in the Bavarian Quarter (a formerly Jewish neighborhood, decimated and depopulated by a raft of National Socialist actions) and was constructed according to very different principles. Those principles are suggestive for thinking 

<b></b>

about memorials to the National Socialist past in Germany and, more important, share critical affinities with Walter Benjamin's notion that "dialectical images" can be sites of historical materialism and remembrance insofar as they juxtapose material forms, affective attunements, and ideological functions from the past with those of the present.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Underlying the memorial project in the Bavarian Quarter is Benjamin's method of "[t]elescoping . . . the past through the present" (<i>N</i> 7a, 3), his belief that "[t]he materialist presentation of history leads the past to place the present in a critical question" (<i>N</i> 7a, 5) and achieves a "dissolution of 'mythology' into the space of history" (<i>N</i> 1, 9). To appreciate the differences between the two memorials and the principles behind them, however, we must first situate the discussion within ongoing and broader debates about modernity and "collective identity," then identify a methodological shift from a psychological model of collective identity to one that is grounded in cultural resources and their discursive transmission.

Memorials in our time possess a dialectical relationship to the end of what the French historian Pierre Nora calls "the tradition of memory." According to Nora, "we speak so much of memory because there is so little of it left":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
These <i>lieux de m&#x000E9;moire</i> are fundamentally remains, the ultimate embodiments of a memorial consciousness that has barely survived in a historical age that calls out for memory because it has abandoned it. They make their appearance by virtue of the deritualization of the world&#x02014;producing, manifesting, establishing, constructing, decreeing, and maintaining by artifice and by will a society deeply absorbed in its own transformation and renewal, one that inherently values the new over the ancient, the young over the old, the future over the past.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
What Nora calls the "acceleration of history" and "the lack of spontaneous memory" seems to imply a nostalgia for tradition-bound substantive <i>Gemeinschaft</i>, but we can deepen his insight by placing it alongside related diagnoses of modernity: the transition from a stratified to a functional society (Luhmann), the disenchantment of traditional societies in the rise of abstract and bureaucratic rationality (Weber), the alienation of life-world and labor (Marx, Luk&#x000E1;cs), the intertwining of technical progress with failed political emancipation (Horkheimer and Adorno), the loss of traditional continuity in storytelling (Benjamin), and the general rationalization of production and irrationalization of societal relations micrologically analyzed in the phenomena of mass culture (Kracauer). In fact, the analysis of the "memorial cult" at the turn of the century by the young Alois Riegl offers a more nuanced and dialectical historical framework than Nora's, by juxtaposing the nineteenth century as the era of "historical value" with the onset of a contemporary era of "age value": the latter reflected a superhistorical notion of objective knowledge, manifesting itself in a tireless pursuit of exacting restoration of past architecture, the former reflected the awareness of fashion, of the swift 

<b></b>

and inexorable transition from new to old, and manifested itself in an appreciation of the effects of time, the process of aging, in themselves.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Preliminarily then, we can situate the question of the significance and role of monuments and memorials against the background of the loss of traditional contexts of significance that has become a commonplace characteristic of modernity in all these analyses. However, public remembrance is not only conditioned by the fact that spontaneous memory in a homogeneous communal life-world has largely vanished but, more important, by the existence of a <i>multiplicity</i> and <i>heterogeneity</i> of narratives and traditions vying for the status of public memory. Recent German history provides one unparalleled example of this phenomenon, the one I shall discuss here; multicultural American society provides another.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Discussions of German postwar memory have concentrated around the notion of personal and, by analogy, collective identity. So for instance, Eric Santner's penetrating book <i>Mourning, Memory and Film in Postwar Germany</i> undertakes to answer the question "What are the strategies and procedures by which a cultural identity may be reconstituted in post-Holocaust Germany?"<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  I will return to this question in a moment, but for now let me cast an initial skeptical glance at Santner's question by noting that it was most likely one of the questions motivating Helmut Kohl's government as well when it reincarnated the Neue Wache. Santner himself, however, takes a first step toward undermining a singular notion of cultural identity by differentiating between generations. Whereas according to Alexander and Margarete Mitscherlich, whose analyses of the postwar German "psyche" form Santner's <i>terminus a quo</i>, first generation Germans sought to evoke notions of universal reconciliation and "drawing a line" or "mastering" their past and repressing any feelings of guilt, second-generation Germans receive their sense of the past from their parents' stories, as one survey summarizes: "Fleeing advancing armies, bombed out, homeless and unemployed, hidden from Allied police, arrested and jailed, these parents are remembered by their children as victims of the war, as victims of a lost war."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Some post-Cold War representations of the war in popular culture clearly reflect this self-understanding, for instance, Helke Sanders's documentary <i>BeFreier und Befreite</i>, about the rape of German women by advancing Russian soldiers, and Joseph Vilsmaier's 1993 film <i>Stalingrad</i>, which depicts decent Wehrmacht soldiers commanded if not commandeered by diabolical SS officers. In both cases the revisionist portrayals of Germans as victims have proved controversial: at one point Sanders's film suggests a tacit equality (if not equity) between German women and Jews; the idealized moral line drawn in Vilsmaier's film between Wehrmacht and SS is belied by the Wehrmacht's documented participation in genocidal actions in the East.
</p>

<p>
Although Santner acknowledges the marked differences in the attitudes of first and second generations, he still formulates the generational problem as one of conflicted collective identity based on a social-psychological model of individual identification:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The core dilemma is that the cultural reservoir has been poisoned . . . To carry out their labors of self-constitution the second and third generations face the double bind of needing 

<b></b>

symbolic resources which, because of the unmanageable degrees of ambivalence such resources arouse, makes these labors impossible. . . . The double bind of having to identify with res of power one also at another level needs to disavow . . . leads to . . . a resistance to identification with parents and elders, in the second generation.

<p class="noIndent">
Yet a further attenuation of generations argues for reconsidering the <i>context in which</i> and <i>extent to which</i> the social-psychological model of mourning has purchase: the third generation is so far removed from the events that their information is provided less by personal testimonial than by today's educational institutions and entertainment media. In being institutionalized as history, what was <i>psychologically lived</i> or reported first-hand experience becomes <i>discursively and/or symbolically constructed and transmitted</i> simulacra of experience, what Santner aptly terms "the cultural reservoir." 
</p>

<p>
Santner emphasizes that "postwar generations have inherited the psychic structures that impeded mourning in the generations of their parents and grandparents" and "face the complex task of constituting stable self-identities by way of identifications with parents and grandparents who, in the worst possible cases, may have been directly implicated in crimes of unspeakable dimensions, thereby radically impeding their totemic availability."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Generational differentiation is only one way in which a notion of <i>the</i> German collective identity undergoes empirical attenuation. In the wake of events which Santner's book, published in 1990, could not have addressed, the third generation finds itself in an entirely new context of an abruptly reunified Germany that&#x02014;at least officially&#x02014;is no longer characterized by ideological division. A German collective identity, even posed simply as a task, is already composed of two traditions and two spheres of experience from two social systems, a <i>political</i> conflict of collective narratives more than a psychological working through of mourning. Finally, besides the multigenerational and (for lack of a better term) multi-ideological attenuation of a German collective identity, there is a multicultural dimension, in which national, ethnic, religious, and cultural identities are <i>not</i> coextensive. Whereas first-generation "guest workers" (a more apt term would be "permanent immigrants") from Turkey, Greece, or Italy remain largely unassimilated in German society, their sons and daughters do not possess German passports. They are wholeheartedly Berliners, native German speakers, and so on without, however, being "German." Clearly their relationship to a collective "German identity" and social memory involves an entirely different framework, including the poetics of memorials.
</p>

<p>
What I have been calling the empirical "attenuation" of a supposed singular German collective identity, whose (re)generation Santner's book explores, suggests rather that we speak of different <i>contexts</i> of identity: ranging from personal (with its criteria of authenticity and self-realization), through religious, ethnic, cultural, economic, up to national and legal (citizenship) and moral (universal human rights, for example).<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  A given situation may address or activate any one (or several) of these levels of identity, so that it becomes pertinent for that situation.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  This suggests a "postconventional" notion of identity that is no longer theorized by an analogy to Freudian psychology's concept of egological identification but rather admits a variety of contexts of identity.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Besides the empirical attenuation of collective identity in the classical sense, there is also a methodological point to be raised in considering social memory. Already in the 1920s the historian Marc Bloch criticized Durkheim's pupil, Maurice Halbwachs, for his easy borrowing of terms from individual psychology and nonchalantly prefacing them with the adjective "collective."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  To the extent that Santner projects Freudian notions of successful mourning as a reconstruction of egological identity after loss onto the plane of collective (national or cultural; Santner speaks of them apparently interchangeably) identity, he too is vulnerable to that criticism. Bloch himself also explored social memory but stressed the process of transmission rather than group-psychological identity. Paul Connerton has drawn the lesson I shall follow here as well: "If we want to continue to speak, with Halbwachs, of collective memory, we must acknowledge that much of what is being subsumed under that term refers, quite simply, to facts of communication between individuals . . . to study the social formation of memory is to study those acts of transfer that make remembering in common possible."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Thus <i>either</i> the egological analogy is maintained but a multitude of overlapping, stratified, interpenetrating multiauthored collective identities within a pluralistic framework is accepted, <i>or</i> a change in focus is necessary from "collective identity" to competing, potentially conflicting public discourses of remembrance and transmission. I would therefore like to shift the emphasis from the social-psychological notion of collective identity to that of contradictory historiographical discourses, which are discernible and available to the historian and cultural critic in a way that collective psychology is not, and which constitute the "archive" out of which social memory undergoes an ongoing process of construction and reconstruction. These discourses form orientation points for individual memory, action and "improvised predispositions" (in Bourdieu's words) in the various contexts of identity suggested above. In this way social memory as "cultural reservoir" in fact is the counterpart to methodological individualism and not to collective identity. Furthermore, the discursive conflicts in the construction and transmission of social memory, perhaps not unlike the collisions of subterranean masses in plate tectonics, produce surface fractures and sudden eruptions of energy at long-established fault lines, such as the impact of the last fifty years of German history upon a small building on Unter den Linden.
</p>

<p>
Genealogically, the end of World War II produced two Germanies, and each commemorated its genesis as a way to justify its claim to authenticity of tradition and political legitimation against the background ideologies of the Cold War. So the GDR viewed itself as the continuation of the Weimar Republic's communist left who fought fascism and portrayed the Federal Republic as the continuation of the capitalist organization of society that "necessarily" led to fascism and imperialism. The GDR's double bind was, of course, that it paraded itself as the workers' state that arose from the ruins of totalitarianism while denying its own totalitarian lineaments. The workers' uprising on 17 June 1953 represents that double bind in all its tension.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the FRG faces a different kind of paradox. Its self-understanding holds that West Germany was liberated by the Allies from . . . itself, in Nazi guise. 

<b></b>

Or rather, the story stands on the distinction between a Nazi <i>tyranny</i> that usurped the incipient <i>democracy</i> of the Weimar Republic and drove Germany to ruin. The rupture of 1945 represents Germany being liberated from its own dictatorship: Germans were <i>both</i> agents of their regime&#x02014;no matter how unwilling or unknowing&#x02014;who sacrificed for their fatherland <i>and</i>, so the story goes, passive victims of that regime. This leads to a perennial problem in negotiating the closure of the Nazi regime and the origin or rebirth of (West) German democracy, since in a sense it is the same event under two different descriptions as, for instance, in the controversy about whether May 8th should be commemorated as the "day of capitulation" or the "day of liberation." Furthermore, the legitimacy of the FRG was also continually contrasted with the illegimitacy of the other German state: the communist totalitarianism was equated, more or less openly, with the prior national-socialist one. This allowed a reversed projection. The FRG could exploit the rule of force as exhibited in the GDR (most graphically in the killings at the wall and the suppression of the strikes and demonstrations on 17 June 1953) to dramatize the way the Nazi regime had made resistance impossible; this secured the necessary historiographical rupture between Nazi past and democratic present. The fact that the dissolution of the GDR is at least in large part due to the populist impulses for change in a broad spectrum of the population (as for instance in the Leipzig and Berlin demonstrations in the autumn of 1989), that is, precisely the kind of resistance that did <i>not</i> occur during the Nazi regime, is of course more problematical and less acknowledged. Moreover, the case of resistance the FRG chose to make paradigmatic, the failed attempt on Hitler's life by a group of Wehrmacht officers, draws on another tradition that stands in a more complex relationship to National Socialism. For the 20 July 1944 plot was organized and led by army officers of Prussian aristocratic background intent on saving Germany from absolute defeat and occupation by the Russians (thus recapitulating the classic "Weimar choice" between Bolshevism&#x02014;often personified as "Jewish"&#x02014;and fascism all over again), and there is no indication that their vision included a democratic form of government. Thus the official sanctioning of their attempted coup d'&#x000E9;tat in conjunction with the official disregard, if not omission, of leftist resistance organizations before and during the war (the latter orchestrated from Moscow) indicates an unbroken line of Prussian militarist patriotism within the FRG which, though latent, is an available historical-narrative resource. And so when Kohl's press-spokesman was asked if the Chancellor was disappointed not to have been invited to the commemorative ceremonies in Normandy marking the fiftieth anniversary of D-Day, he quipped, "Do you seriously believe the Bundeskanzler places any value in participating in a celebration of the defeat of German soldiers?"<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Thus on the one hand both East and West Germany constructed discourses of national legitimacy through denial of the prior national self-image, while on the other hand trying to claim the proper continuity with an even earlier tradition. The confluence of contradictory historiographies often results in symbolic conflict, and such conflict is perhaps nowhere more noticeable than in public memorials that seek to rescript these various histories into one story, one <i>mythos</i>. One such neuralgic point is the small memorial located on Unter den Linden known as the Neue Wache. If, according to 

<b></b>

Benjamin, "the historical object, by virtue of its monadological structure, discovers within itself its own [dialectical] pre-history and post-history" (<i>N</i> 10, 3), then the Neue Wache is a preeminent monad, for this modest memorial more than any other state building has been programmatically used in each of its concrete historical forms to provide the then current German state with a unifying image of national legitimation. If "[t]o write history means giving dates their physiognomy" (<i>N</i> 11, 2), then the incarnations of the Neue Wache amount to a dialectical image of the failed project to symbolically found a German national-cultural identity. Each attempt, each incarnation, has failed, I claim, for two reasons: <i>first</i> because of the conflation of military memorial and civil&#x02014;usually national&#x02014;monument inscribed in the very building's history. Indeed this is a recurrent conflict in the hybrid genre of national monument and military memorial throughout modern German history. The <i>second</i> reason for the Neue Wache's failure is that the equally conflicted post-war genealogies of national self-legitimation likewise conflate the civil and military dimensions of their narratives: on the one hand the GDR and reunified Germany wish to establish a complete break with the National-Socialist political past, while on the other hand they strive to maintain the national-cultural military tradition of honoring their war dead. This double-bind of trying to rewrite contradictory narratives into one story, one <i>mythos</i>, results in a symbolic conflict at whose center stands the Neue Wache.

The Neue Wache is a small, unprepossessing building. Its origins stretch back to 1786, when a soldiers' watch station, called the Kanonierwache, was located on the main thoroughfare across from the king's residence. It was one of thirty-four such buildings located throughout the city at gates, barracks, royal houses, etc. The soldiers at the Kanonierwache, later called the K&#x000F6;nigswache, were responsible for security in the area surrounding the Berlin city castle and the king's residence. The original wooden structure soon proved too small for them and, in the wake of Napoleon's defeat, too modest, and so in the spring of 1816 Friedrich Wilhelm III commissioned his chief privy architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel to design an impressive but, because of massive debts accrued during the Wars of Liberation, also an economical "Neue Wache." Schinkel's design called for a neoclassical pavilion with a duty room for about 100 soldiers of the Imperial Watch, Fourth Guards regiment, and a detention cell (<a href="#1"> 1</a>). Schinkel wrote: "The design of this solitary and free-standing building is in a rough imitation of a Roman <i>castrum</i>, hence the four quite solid corner towers and the inner courtyard."
</p>

<p>
In addition to its military use, the building also served to commemorate the victory over Napoleon, that is, served as a national monument. Thus the intended tympanum relief designed by Schinkel depicts a battle in which, as he wrote: "a Victory in the center decides in favor of the heroes ting on the right side; on the left are represented the final efforts, the exhortation to battle, flight, the plunder and pain of the family awaiting their fate; on the right one can see the overwhelming emotion and mourning for a fallen comrade."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>The tympanum was finally built in 1842 by Johann Gottfried Schadow, the leading neoclassical sculptor of his day. Schadow had already designed the Quadriga&#x02014;the female re of Victory, standing in a war chariot, her brow adorned with a chaplet of oak leaves&#x02014;for the Brandenburg Gate, which was unveiled in 1791 as the "gate of peace." Following the Wars of Liberation the Quadriga, which Napoleon had hauled off to Paris in 1806, was returned to the Brandenburg Gate, now renamed a "triumphal gate" at the head of Unter den Linden's "Via Triumphalis," henceforth the main avenue of Prussian parades, in which the Neue Wache played an integral role. The intended sculptures of victory trophies to crest the corner towers were never built. Originally it was planned to erect statues of five generals who had helped defeat Napoleon, but because of budgetary considerations only three were realized: Bl&#x000FC;cher across the street near the Opera house, and von B&#x000FC;low and Scharnhorst flanking the Neue Wache. The statues were unveiled in 1822 on the anniversary of the battle of Waterloo (<a href="#2"> 2</a>). Likewise the chestnut tree grove adjoining the Neue Wache boasted a permanent exhibit of captured French howitzers: war trophies from the Wars of Liberation. After the Berlin city castle received its own regiment of soldiers, the Neue Wache's function became purely ceremonial, and extravagant military parades passed by it to celebrate the defeats of Denmark , Austria  and France . On 1 August 1914 the general mobilization orders were announced from its steps, as were the demobilization orders four years later.

<p>After the abdication of the Kaiser in 1918 the building fell into disuse, serving as emergency housing for the homeless, among other functions. On 3 August 1924, on the tenth anniversary of the beginning of World War I, Reichspresident Friedrich Ebert expressed his desire for a "national monument of honor" [<i>Reichsehrenmal</i>] that would "serve to mourn the past and embody the vital energy and the will to freedom of the German people." Controversy and indecision lingered on until 1929, when Otto Braun, Ministerpresident of Prussia, decided to transform the Neue Wache into a "Memorial Site [<i>Ged&#x000E4;chtnisst&#x000E4;tte]</i> for the Fallen of the World War" and asked for proposals for the interior. Heinrich von Tessenow's design was accepted (<a href="#3"> 3</a>). Light gray limestone plates cover the walls, and dark basalt-lava stones form a floor mosaic. In the center a black memorial stone, marked "1914-1918" and bearing a large silver oak-wreath, represents the "Altar of the Fatherland." Two candelabra flank the altar to the rear in each corner, and a large opening four meters in circumference and encircled in bronze is cut in the ceiling above the altar. In his review of the memorial for the <i>Frankfurter Zeitung</i> Siegfried Kracauer wrote:

Of course, one can erect emotional memorials and reinforce the interpretation ascribed to them by means of some symbol or other&#x02014;but haven't we had enough of our Bismarck towers?

In Germany in any case, it is because we are much too divided on questions of the most important and vital kind, so that we cannot come together through some insight that would unite us.

Politicians did not demonstrate such self-restraint in their evaluation at the opening ceremony of the redesigned Neue Wache on 2 June 1931. The German Army Minister Groener embedded the Neue Wache squarely in the Prussian military tradition of war memorials: "We consecrate today the remodeled Neue Wache to the fallen of the World War. Built by the warriors of Leipzig and Belle-Alliance, for a century it was the emblem of the Prussian army. The heroic greatness of its form is equal to the greatness of heroism and the greatness of the sacrifices [<i>Opfer</i>] that ever new generations have made so that Germany may live."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Indeed in 1934 the Neue Wache became a "memorial of honor" [<i>Ehrenmal</i>] for fallen soldiers and an inspiration for new ones. A large oaken cross was affixed to the rear wall and candles and candelabras were placed around the altar to convey a greater sense of piety. The Christian iconography of the cross echoed the characteristic adornment on World War I veterans' graves as well as the Nazi memorial to Schlageter and Hindenburg's crypt within the Tannenberg memorial. The civil police posted before the building were replaced by an honor guard of Wehrmacht soldiers of the "Guards Regiment of Berlin" (<a href="#4"> 4</a>). The changing of the guard on Sunday, Tuesday, and Friday was a public spectacle, as was the wreath-laying ceremony by Hitler on "heroes' 

<b></b>

remembrance day" [<i>Heldengedenktag</i>], the precursor to <i>Volkstrauertag</i> (<a href="#5"> 5</a>). During World War II fallen generals were given their final honors before the Neue Wache.</p>

Bombs damaged the building badly toward the end of the war: the roof burnt away, two columns were shattered, the south-eastern corner collapsed, the memorial stone was partially melted in the heat of the bombing, and the wreath was eventually stolen (<a href="#6"> 6</a>). Tessenow said of the ruin: "If it were now up to me, I would not give the building any other form whatsoever. As damaged as it is now, it truly speaks history.

The Neue Wache along with the other neoclassical buildings of Unter den Linden fell within the Russian sector of occupied Berlin (<a href="#7"> 7</a>). In 1948 the local communist government considered tearing down the Neue Wache because of its militaristic history, and because people continued to lay flowers and wreaths there in remembrance of recent war dead, even after the building's iron doors had been chained shut. However, the Soviets interceded, reasoning that the building and its military symbolism represented Russian and German "friendship" in their having joined forces to defeat Napoleon: the military tradition was once again invoked and renewed. The Neue Wache was transformed into a museum of Soviet-German friendship, with slogans and large portraits of party members. The statues of B&#x000FC;low and Scharnhorst were removed and their pedestals given Russian and German inscriptions honoring Stalin.
</p>

<p>
On 10 February 1949 the Freie Deutsche Jugend (FDJ) demanded that the Neue Wache, as a symbol of Prussian militarism, be demolished, an argument that did in fact lead to the demolition of several neoclassical buildings designed by Schinkel: the Berlin city castle in 1950, the Potsdam city castle in 1959-1960, and the Potsdam

But the Neue Wache was saved by its central location on Unter den Linden and by the resolution passed by the Fifth Party Congress of the SED in 1950 that by 1965 the "center of the capital of the GDR" should be completely rebuilt: the new East German state, founded on 7 October 1949, demanded a fitting capital. In the initial phase of East German architecture (1949-1955) Lothar Bolz, the Minister for the Construction of the GDR, stipulated that the capital's architecture&#x02014;so long as it could be integrated into socialist inner-city planning&#x02014;was to be rebuilt in the national and regional traditions, in ideological contrast to the "Americanization" of the Federal Republic's architecture just across no man's land. Returning to a national architectural tradition meant above all that the historical center, the so-called <i>Forum Fridericianum</i>of Unter den Linden&#x02014;the Neue Wache, the Armory, the National Opera, the Prinzessinnenpalais&#x02014;was to return to Schinkel's classicism.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>

<p>Renovations began in 1951: indeed, the Neue Wache was among the very first buildings to be rebuilt in the service of the new East German nation. It was as if a proper relationship to the historical tradition had to precede the building of socialist architecture such as the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (1963-1966) or the Palace of the Republic (1973-1976). On 21 September 1956 the magistrate of East Berlin passed the final decree to make the Neue Wache a new admonitory memorial [<i>Mahnmal</i>] for "the victims of fascism and both world wars." The architect Heinz Mehlan restored the interior, removed the oaken cross, replaced the inscription of "1914-1918" with the final formulation, "to the Victims of Fascism and Militarism," and kept the now disred "Altar of the Fatherland" (<a href="#8"> 8</a>). The restoration was completed in 1960, and the Neue Wache reopened with a military ceremony. On 1 May 1962&#x02014;the year that mandatory military service was introduced in the GDR&#x02014;two NVA (National People's

In 1966 the Neue Wache was closed for interior remodeling by the architect Lothar Kwasnitza, because&#x02014;according to the GDR souvenir book on the Neue Wache&#x02014;"it became ever more clear that the interior design of the memorial [<i>Mahnmal</i>] did not correspond to the understanding of socialist society."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  The uneasy combination of admonitory memorial and national self-image was redesigned, probably in connection with the upcoming twentieth anniversary of the GDR (7 October 1969). The national crest of the GDR (hammer and compass) was chiseled into the rear wall, and the inscription was transferred to the side wall. Tessenow's altar was removed and replaced by a gas-fed eternal flame as was the custom in the Soviet Union. Probably in imitation of the memorial to the unknown soldier in the Kremlin wall unveiled in 1967&#x02014;itself an imitation of similar national war memorials in Britain and France erected after World War I&#x02014;the remains of a resistance ter shot by the SS and the remains of a German soldier killed in Eastern Prussia were exhumed and placed under the stone floor; the unknown soldier was buried with the soil from nine battlefields, the unknown resistance ter with the soil from nine concentration camps. A glass cupola sealed the ceiling opening, and the basalt-lava floor was covered by bright, polished marble plates. The honor guard's watch station was moved to the adjoining Museum of German History (formerly the Prussian Armory), and cameras were installed to monitor the eternal flame and the interior (<a href="#0"> 10</a>).

</p>

<p>
In West Germany the need for a memorial to the dead was dictated first and foremost by pragmatic needs, above all the "international protocol" of foreign dignitaries laying wreaths at each other's national war memorials. The first incarnation of such a memorial was a bronze plaque with the inscription "To the Victims of Wars and Tyranny," erected in the court garden [<i>Hofgarten</i>] in Bonn on 16 June 1964 and dedicated by President L&#x000FC;bke "in memory of the victims of the people's uprising on June 17th," the first in a long line of surreptitious ideological identifications by West German politicians of East Germany and Nazi Germany performed while doing nothing more suspect than laying a wreath. Because of the campus atmosphere of the Hofgarten, which adjoins several university institute buildings, the "wreath-laying site" [<i>Kranzniederlegungsstelle</i>], as the memorial was derogatorily nicknamed (it was also more cynically called the "wreath-dumping site," <i>Kranzabwurfsstelle</i>), was moved in 1969 to the Northern Cemetery in Bonn where, however, ninety-six Russian prisoners of war who had been worked to death and seventeen members of the Waffen-SS are buried. 
</p>

<p>
In 1981 Bundeskanzler Schmidt proposed the establishment of a memorial for all those "who through the errors [<i>Irrt&#x000FC;mer</i>] and the crimes of the Third Reich gave up their lives, be it in prisons and concentration camps, be it in the homeland in the bombing war or on the fronts of the Second World War." The German War Graves Commission responded with an aide-m&#x000E9;moire proposing as a "national place of honor" [<i>nationale Ehrenst&#x000E4;tte</i>] a "national commemorative site for the war-dead of the German people" that would have as a "unifying symbol" a "proportionately oversized crown of thorns, suspended in the air or just above the ground."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Protests by the representatives of the Jewish Community in Germany at the Christian symbolism quashed the proposal.
</p>

<p>
The embarrassment of lacking a "central wreath-laying site" was exacerbated by the public outcry when President Reagan and Chancellor Kohl fulfilled their obligations to "international protocol" at Bitburg cemetery on the fortieth anniversary of the end of the war.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
On 27 January 1993 the Federal cabinet under Chancellor Kohl announced that a "central commemorative site of the Federal Republic of Germany" would be erected in the Neue Wache and would be opened on 14 November, the <i>Volkstrauertag</i> of that year. Volkstrauertag, the last Sunday before the first Advent, dates back to the "remembrance day" [<i>Gedenktag</i>] introduced in 1923 to honor the dead of World War I, itself in imitation of the French national day of mourning (11 November) introduced in 1922. The "day of remembrance" was renamed "heroes' remembrance day" [<i>Heldengedenktag</i>] in 1934 and reintroduced and renamed Volkstrauertag under the Adenauer government in 1952. By way of justifying his decision Kohl said that the institution of a central memorial site in Berlin was a "signal that the move [of the government] to Berlin will not be delayed."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Like the East German government before it, the new reunified Federal Republic rebuilt and "rebaptized" the Neue Wache before any other official building in Berlin.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
In answer to protests over the lack of public and government discussion surrounding Kohl's decision, a two-hour debate ensued in parliament: five experts were consulted (two pro, three contra); no alternatives were proposed. The Berliner Amt f&#x000FC;r Denkmalpflege, the city's office of memorial preservation, which had been working on the Neue Wache's interior and had recommended maintaining the 1969 design, was "considered in an advisory capacity only." In his address to the parliament during the debate Kohl informally adduced four reasons for moving forward quickly with the memorial:
</p>

<ol class="decimal">
<li> The state required a site for wreath-laying ceremonies with foreign dignitaries;</li>
<li>Because fewer Germans could directly remember the war (as opposed to those who learn about it only through school, books, etc.) the issue had to be decided quickly.</li>

<li>More generally, because women, as mothers and widows "are victims of war and violence who have been affected by the horror of this century in a particular way," the proposed sculpture of a mother and dead soldier-son, to be installed within the memorial building, would best represent the "tragedy of the century."</li>

<li> Finally, there were letters of support for the project from the "League of the War-Blinded" and the VdK (War Graves Commission), which Kohl read aloud.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> </li>
</ol>

<p>
There was nothing in Kohl's parliamentary address to indicate that he saw the Neue Wache as anything more or other than a national war memorial to Germany's dead soldiers. There was no parliamentary decision procedure, no vote, no referendum, and no advisory committee formed. In the first words of an open letter to the <i>Frankfurter Allgemeine</i> newspaper, Christoph St&#x000F6;lzl, the director of the German Historical Museum and a Kohl-appointee, justified the reason: "The federal government has decided about the design of a commemorative site of great political symbolism. The government did not take the path of public discourse (hearings, competition, jury) but decided to return to tradition. This is not as unusual as it seems to many critics. The selection of other state symbols of the Federal Republic, like flags and hymns, was also made in this way."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  The nexus of the Neue Wache's military and national traditions was thus upheld.
</p>

<p>
So, the Neue Wache is once again redesigned: its interior is restored to the form it had in the Weimar Republic according to Tessenow's <i>original</i> plan. The glass cupola is removed, uncovering the opening in the ceiling, and the floor and wall plating now imitates Tessenow's design. The sculpture by K&#x000E4;the Kollwitz of a mother embracing her dead son, which Kohl had chosen, is enlarged fivefold into slightly larger-than-life size and placed in the center of the interior (<a href="#1"> 11</a>). The new inscription reads: "To the Victims of War and Tyranny" (<a href="#2"> 12</a>). 
</p>

<p>
Critics expressed reservations concerning the appropriateness of the Kollwitz sculpture, as a result of its complex genesis. Entries in Kollwitz's diary indicate that she encouraged, against her husband's protests, their son Peter in his wish to volunteer for the army in the first ecstatic days of World War I, when members of the romantic Youth Movement were swept up in rhapsodic patriotism. Because he was underage, Peter required the permission of his father, Karl, in order to enlist, and with the support of his mother he finally received it. Kollwitz wrote: "I stand up, Peter follows me,

This sacrifice [<i>Opfer</i>] to which he charmed [<i>hinri&#x000DF;</i>] me, to which we charmed Karl." Within a month, in his first action, Peter lay dead on a field in Flanders. The death of her son became the overriding theme in her drawings and sculptures: she addresses her dead son in her diary, reports to him about "your memorial." Yet, most striking is the fact that the image of mother and dead son&#x02014;with K&#x000E4;the Kollwitz and Peter as models&#x02014;already recurs often in her early work, well <i>before</i> the war, before Peter's death, thus complicating a simplistic story of art being used to come to terms with a painful loss. Instead, the ideology that shaped her artistic subject matter seems continuous, indeed complicitous with the ideology that "charmed" her into "charming" her husband into signing Peter's permission papers.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  That ideology, in her art as in her life, is replete with Christian motifs of sacrifice and redemption, for instance of Mary holding the dead Christ in the early "Piet&#x000E0;" of 1903 (<a href="#3"> 13</a>).

What the war withholds, art may provide. On 22 October 1937&#x02014;the anniversary of Peter's death&#x02014;Kollwitz reports in her diary that she is working on a small bronze sculpture that "has become something like a piet&#x000E0;. The mother is sitting and has her dead son lying between her knees in her lap. It is no longer pain, but rather thoughtful reflection."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  The sculpture is 38 cm. high, 38 cm. deep, and 26 cm. wide. The work was never modified after 1937, and there is no indication that the piet&#x000E0; was ever intended as a model for a larger work or public monument. But, again, more striking is an earlier woodcut and drawing entitled "Death with a Woman in her Lap" [<i>Tod mit Frau im Scho&#x000DF;</i>] dating from 1921 (<a href="#4"> 14</a>). Not a mother and dead son, but Death and a young woman, though one can still recognize Kollwitz and Peter in both images. Here too, as in the diary entry above, I would suggest that we see the iconographic piet&#x000E1; symbolizing the heroic, redemptive sacrifice for the fatherland but also the ambivalence,

The appropriateness of a Christian piet&#x000E0; to commemorate, among others, Jewish victims of National Socialism was questioned by critics of the Neue Wache's new makeover, and the lack of discrimination between perpetrator and victim in the language of the dedication had been challenged.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Kohl responded to criticism of the inscription in the parliament debate: "One could of course ask whether such a sweeping formulation doesn't include much that we don't want to see included. For this reason one might consider going into more detail with the formulation. But in doing that one slides into the whole labyrinth of modern German history. The more you formulate, the less justice you'll provide."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Justice <i>to whom</i>, of course, is the question, and Kohl's attempt at what could be termed as apotropaic invocation stands diametrically opposed to Bundespresident Richard von Weiz&#x000E4;cker's speech on 8 May 1985, in which he attempted to name specifically those who are being remembered and why.
</p>

<p>
In autumn 1993, shortly before the unveiling of the memorial, and in the face of a mounting scandal surrounding its design, a compromise was effected between Kohl's cabinet and various political representatives and critics at large. It was agreed that a separate memorial to Jewish victims will be erected, and two bronze tablets were mounted flanking the entrance portal to the Neue Wache: on the left a short history of the building, on the right an enumeration of who is to be honored:

Arthur Danto has proposed the following conceptual-analytical distinction between monument and memorial: "We erect monuments so that we shall always remember and build memorials so that we shall never forget . . . Monuments commemorate the memorable and embody myths of beginnings. Memorials ritualize remembrance and mark the reality of ends. . . . Monuments make heroes and triumphs, victories and conquests, perpetually present and part of life. The memorial is a special precinct, extruded from life, a segregated enclave where we honor the dead. With monuments, we honor ourselves."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The German language does not have separate words for "monument" and "memorial." <i>Denkmal</i> is the neutral term designating both;<i>Ehrenmal</i> with its root of "honor" [<i>Ehre</i>] was the common term used in the beginning of the century (before World War II) to honor the war dead, but it is seldom used today and has been largely replaced by <i>Mahnmal</i> with its root "<i>mahnen</i>" suggesting reminder, admonition or edification. Finally, <i>Gedenkst&#x000E4;tte</i> has appeared as a neutral term for a site whose purpose is to foster remembrance. Danto's distinction is a good starting point because it rests on the <i>use</i> to

which monuments and memorials are put in the context of public commemoration, which suggests considering them as modified forms of semiotic communication. According to Roman Jakobson's model, any communicative act involves the (explicit or implicit) presence of six functions: an <i>addresser</i>, who sends a <i>message</i> to an <i>addressee</i>, a <i>context</i> referred to in the message, a <i>code</i> that the addresser and addressee hold in common, and a <i>contact</i> (a physical channel between them).<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Schematizing Danto's insights, we can say: Monuments typically <i>address</i> their producer's community (nation), while memorials may address the dead themselves; the <i>context</i> referred to in monuments is a myth of founding or legitimation, in a memorial a painful reality of loss; the <i>code</i> shared in a monument is likely a traditional iconography of national symbols, whereas memorials "tend to emphasize texts or lists of the dead"; in a monument the <i>contact</i> is one of a privileged central site manifesting the state's importance in daily life, in a memorial a "special precinct, extruded from life" and ritualized.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  With this instrumentarium let us consider the Neue Wache and then the genre characteristics of German national war memorials.
</p>

<p>
The double bind afflicting the postwar Germanies is that the memorials commemorating the war dead are at once <i>also</i> monuments to the "birth" of modern democratic or socialist Germany: the "myth of beginning" and the "reality of ends" that Danto separates by analytical definition are here inextricably convoluted. The message of the Neue Wache as a communicative act is contradictory because the historical narrative&#x02014;the context&#x02014;that Kohl's newly reunified Germany wants to tell itself is just as conflated, trying to name the same event(s) under two descriptions: defeat and rebirth are "co-originary" [<i>gleichurspr&#x000FC;nglich</i>], as Heidegger would say. The oscillation between the two varies according to what instantiation one wishes to disclose in the statue of the mother mourning her dead son: is she the mother of a concentration camp victim, a Wehrmacht soldier or Waffen-SS officer or NVA border guard at the Berlin wall, of a child killed in the night bombings, one of the executed plotters against Hitler, and so on. The variability of the addressee in turn recodes the message so that virtually anyone can symbolically identify himself or herself as the victim. Victimhood has become a universal currency: to turn the supremely ironical phrase from Marx's "On the Jewish Question": the Jews have achieved commemoration in so far as the Christians have become Jews.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The abstraction of the dedication ("To the Victims of War and Tyranny") is matched by the sculpture's universality of address and intended affect: pity [<i>Mitleid</i>]. In West Germany, Kollwitz's art was understood above all as a gesture of humanist pity, as for instance, the opening lines of the most popular monograph on her intone: "to cry together, to empathize, to struggle together, to be needed together: nothing characterizes the person K&#x000E4;the Kollwitz and her work better than this emotional preposition '<i>mit</i>' [together] that aims for commonality."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  St&#x000F6;lzl once again ascribes a clear national purpose to the work: "If any commemorative site erected by the state can found a tradition, then it cannot be wrong in being a tradition of pity . . . Hardly any other problem in artistic design is so arduous for the Germans than that of an official commemorative site for the victims of war and tyranny. Can it be wrong to avail oneself of 

<b></b>

an artistic tradition to which we owe some of the great, binding images of humanity? Some say: that is sentimental. But what is wrong with that?"<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
It remains a question whether Kohl in his speech about the "tragedy of the century" and the "family tragedies" of German families, and St&#x000F6;lzl in his appeal to the unifying effect of pity, were aware of Lessing's attempt in the eighteenth century to unify the German people via a national theater and a modified Aristotelian theory of the universal cathartic effects of pity. Lessing's creative translation of the Greek [&#x003B5;&#x003BB;&#x003B5;&#x003BF;&#x003B6;] as "pity" [<i>Mitleid</i>] rather than, for instance, "misery" [<i>Jammer</i>], universalized the effect of tragedy by disconnecting it&#x02014;in contrast to Aristotle&#x02014;from the moral judgment by the audience that a tragic hero has suffered "<i>undeserved</i> misfortune."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
There is, however, a second level of interpretation regarding the statue, beyond its intended effect of universal reconciliation. The selective reception of K&#x000E4;the Kollwitz in West Germany as an artist of universal humanism and originality in aesthetic form stood in marked contrast to her wholesale adoption by East Germany as a "comrade of the struggling workers": public statues erected on the renamed "K&#x000E4;the-Kollwitz Square" in East Berlin, several major exhibitions alongside a permanent museum, state-funded scholarly studies and a complete edition of her graphic works all solidified the official interpretation of Kollwitz's socialist engagement, which included antiwar and antipoverty graphics and a woodcut for a memorial leaflet on the death of Karl Liebknecht, which characteristically alludes to the iconography of "the mourning of Christ."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Kollwitz and her art thus were subject to the same Cold War ideological pressures and faultlines as the Neue Wache itself, and placing one of her works within the memorial may be seen as the new state's symbolic affirmation of her western ideological image, just as East Berlin streets named after Weimar socialist and communist personalities have now been renamed and ideologically reappropriated.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
However, other criticisms remain. A purported <i>realistic</i> code of the sculpture is mitigated by the fact that in World War II most victims' bodies were not recovered, and that whole families and neighborhoods&#x02014;civilian casualties far outnumbering military ones&#x02014;were eradicated in the death camps and the bombings: as a result of modern warfare and industrial murder the gendered stylization of a surviving mother cradling the body of her soldier son no longer has the purchase on universality Kohl claims. Furthermore, that pool of addressees is curtailed through the <i>symbolic</i> code of the memorial, for indeed the statue belongs to the Christian iconographic tradition of piet&#x000E1;: it thereby excludes precisely many of the groups to which it is ostensibly dedicated: Jews, Gypsies, Orthodox, atheists, communist resistance ters, etc.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Lastly, the contact, the physical channel, also forecloses the work's reception and hence the goal of reconciliation, for the Neue Wache, as we've seen in the historical sketch above, is coded above all as a <i>military</i> memorial, whereas the overwhelming number of the dead did not belong to the military, but rather the <i>civil</i> sphere of society. It is the recoding of a breakdown of civil society (the rise of National Socialism) in the traditional trappings of a national war memorial that most condemns the Neue Wache.
</p>

<p>
The Neue Wache's contribution to the "cultural reservoir" of postwar social memory can be evaluated with recourse to Reinhart Koselleck's seminal study of the genre, in 

<b></b>

which he specified three ways in which a memorial to the war dead [<i>Kriegerdenkmal</i>] can establish identification:
</p>

<ol class="decimal">
<li>  "The dead, the killed, the fallen are identified in a certain respect&#x02014;as heroes, victims, martyrs, victors, followers, and also even as vanquished; furthermore as keepers or bearers of honor, faith, fame, loyalty, duty; finally as guardians and protectors of the fatherland, humanity, justice, freedom, the proletariat or the particular constitution."</li>

<li>  "The surviving spectators themselves are confronted with an identification to which they should or must relate themselves. 'Mortui viventes obligant,' says the simple maxim, which can be filled out according to the identity structure given above. Their cause is also ours. The war memorial does not only remember the dead, it also reclaims the lost life in order to give a meaning to the process of surviving."</li>
<li> "Finally there is the case that is included in all those named, but that in itself means at once either more or less: that the dead are remembered&#x02014;as dead."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup> </li>
</ol>

<p>
The present avatar of the Neue Wache has aroused such controversy because it at once partakes and does not partake of the poetics of <i>Kriegerdenkmale</i> Koselleck outlines. The first level of identification, the dedication's addressees, is left as indeterminate and hence inclusive as possible, augmented by the semantic slipperiness of the German "<i>Opfer</i>," which up to <i>Kriegerdenkmale</i> commemorating World War I translated <i>sacrificium</i>, a voluntary "sacrifice" for one's country, but since World War II has come to mean more the passive <i>victus</i>, "victim." The former belongs to the vocabulary of the Roman soldier's heroic virtue, the latter to the statistics of highway fatalities, aerial bombings and the death camps. 
</p>

<p>
So, too, the second level of identification, the common cause or obligation linking the dead and the living&#x02014;conceivably something like "let there be no war and tyranny"&#x02014;in its very anodyne abstraction can refer to both National Socialism and the GDR, and moreover seems a proleptic justification for sending <i>Bundeswehr</i> soldiers abroad on UN peacekeeping missions, part of Germany's incremental "normalization" as a post-Cold War national power and future permanent member of the UN Security Council. In keeping with the Lessing program of cathartic nation building, "war and tyranny" stand opposed to a passive humanity like divine or natural forces confronting a vulnerable polis&#x02014;as impersonal, inscrutable fate rather than human, all too human political catastrophes. All of humanity appears as a real or potential <i>Schicksalsgemeinschaft</i>, a "community united by fate," a concept with a highly compromised political history.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the concreteness of the re in contrast to the generality of the dedication suggests that&#x02014;to the extent that the memorial is a war memorial&#x02014;the attempt is being made to distinguish the honor of those who sacrificed from the dishonorable cause for which they sacrificed, similar to the poetics, controversy, and subsequent compromise formations (the addition of a flagpole and realistic ral statues of combatants) of the American Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  One can only hope then that the third level, remembering the dead themselves, in their particularity, is somehow possible <i>despite</i> the memorial.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
These motifs are not new, for indeed they have an insistent, recurrent presence in the hybrid genre of national monument and military memorial throughout modern German history. The nexus of civil, military, and Christian elements is specific to German war memorials as opposed to French: as one historian of World War I memorials succinctly notes, "In the German cult of the dead the citizen is celebrated as soldier, in France the soldier as citizen."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Whereas French memorials exhibit secular motifs of the citizen-soldier and his waiting family, Germany's memorials to its soldiers emphasized sacredness of duty to the nation, part of the larger strategy of nation building in Germany: "The religious is secularized in the national, and the secular is sacralized."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
A perhaps extreme example in this tradition is presented in Hubert Schrade's 1934 study <i>The German National Monument</i>, which lays out the National Socialist program to fulfill the avowed need for a national memorial that, by 1934, was already celebrating the tenth anniversary of its first manifestation: the memorial to Schlageter, the early Nazi martyr from the Ruhr occupation.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  Schrade praises the memorial, a sunken circular crypt with an overarching cross, for providing an <i>Urform</i> of the space that forms a community [<i>Urform des gemeinschaftsbildenden Raumes</i>]: "With its main space and its crypt sunk into the fateful earth of the Ruhr, bringing the ring of community to appearance, dominated by a symbol, this memorial contains in embryo everything that shapes our expectation."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  However, it is Munich's memorial to its 13,000 sons who fell in World War I that captures his unqualified approbation (<a href="#5"> 15</a>). A mausoleum, adorned with the names of the dead and the dedication "To Our Fallen" on one side of the chamber and the assurance "They Will Rise Again" on the other, leads down to a sunken cryptlike space enclosing the full-size sculpture of a soldier in battle-dress laid out upon the altar of the fatherland (<a href="#6"> 16</a>). Schrade provides first a first-person plural ("we") phenomenological description of the experience of the memorial:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
All the names have become a sign for men of one fate, as it were traces of the mythos of the fallen . . . The view upon all the names of <i>one</i> mission [<i>Berufenheit</i>] of itself awakens in us the need for a re in which the fate of the many, who have become one, is allegorically [<i>gleichnishaft</i>] embodied. We are prepared to descend into the crypt located below the altar-tomb-block. In it is the sought-for image of the one who represents all: a young warrior in his repose of death . . . The whole sounds through the one, through whom he existed and for whose sake he fell: his nation

<p>
My point is not, of course, that the Kohl government is consciously seeking to renew a National Socialist program in its design of the Neue Wache. Rather the homologies in situation, design, address, and allegorical ration indicate the powerful and unbroken function performed by memorials to the war dead in creating a "cultural reservoir" for national identity. From this perspective, the vagueness of the Neue Wache's dedication and allegorical re becomes more motivated, for only from such vagueness could the desired national unity possibly be fashioned out of the wounds and ruins of recent German history.
</p>

<p>
My final example from the history of German national monuments and memorials addresses the other aspect I named above: the uncomfortable conflation of <i>military</i>

and <i>civil</i> motifs in the Neue Wache, for this conflation dates back at least to the 1969 renovations carried out to bring the building into line with the GDR's founding myth of self-legitimation. At the conclusion of the souvenir book about the Neue Wache by the "Military Publishing House of the GDR" the author addresses precisely the spectator's apprehension and confusion caused by the interference between a military-ceremonial building and rituals (contact and code) on the one hand and the civil-monumental role (context) the remodelled Neue Wache was supposed to play on the other:

Now and again visitors do not really know how they should reconcile the military ceremony with this [i.e., antifascist] tradition. Military demonstrations of honor before memorials in the historically traditional national manner are common in many countries, as also in the GDR. Here, as in all socialist countries, the historically transmitted forms of military ceremony are the point of attachment. They extend from the weekly mounting of the guard to the Great Ceremonial Tattoo on special occasions. However, in a workers' and peasants' state like the GDR there is no possibility whatsoever that this ceremony would serve to glorify the demon of militarism, which was eradicated completely in this state. Carried out by members of a workers-and-peasants army in the "Friedrich Engels" Watch Regiment in honor of the pioneers of socialism and as expression of its reliable armed protection, from the beginning onwards it serves the cultivation of the antifascist tradition of the people of the GDR that is embodied in this memorial.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
That is, the GDR is a legitimate state because it too draws on its specific traditional national forms of military ceremony, while at the same time defining itself in opposition to the national militarism that immediately preceded it, fascism. Furthermore, the memorial is split along the fissure dividing the unknown soldier from the unknown resistance ter, the former performing the function of a military memorial&#x02014;marking the loss of German soldiers in the previous war&#x02014;the latter the function of a civil memorial and monument&#x02014;marking the founding of the GDR upon the tradition of political, antifascist resistance. The unfortunate juxtaposition metonymically links victims and perpetrators in what could be called "Bitburg <i>avant la lettre</i>": the soldier conceivably could have shot the resistance ter, or vice versa.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The current incarnation of the Neue Wache merely multiplies the conflicts between the military and civil registers. The external tablet must prophylactically <i>correct</i> the interior dedication, which conceivably commemorates everyone who suffered during the war, implying an equivalence between fallen soldiers and murdered citizens (which the tablet corrects only to the extent that it invokes "innocence" without, however, explaining how it should be understood in such cases), and again between the National Socialist totalitarianism and the East German regime (which the tablet explicitly reinforces). In this self-diremption the reunified Germany assumes, ironically, the conflicted legacy of the GDR.

A short critical excursus regarding some recent Holocaust memorials in Germany may provide a useful conceptual transition from the Neue Wache to the Bavarian Quarter memorial for two reasons:  discussing the memorials that commemorate Holocaust victims disentangles the Holocaust as a civil catastrophe from its unfortunate intertwinement with military and nation-building motifs in the Neue Wache; and  the regressive inadequacy, if not bad faith, of the Kollwitz sculpture as a rative representation of Holocaust victims has led critics, in particular James E. Young, to advocate its dialectical counterpart: "counter-monuments" (<i>Gegen-Denkmale</i>)&#x02014;nonrepresentational or self-thematizing memorials&#x02014;which all too often renounce their historico-commemorative specificity. "Counter-monuments" generally fall into three kinds of poetics: nonrepresentational or "negatively sublime" artworks; artworks that self-reflexively thematize the transience and difficulties inherent in public commemoration as such; and "limit-case" artworks that tend toward their own self-effacement in favor of historical documentation. Understanding what I take to be the dialectical relationship between nonrepresentational and representational forms of remembrance will prepare the possibility of moving beyond that opposition in the Bavarian Quarter memorial.
</p>

<p>
The first kind of poetics of "counter-monuments" arose from debates surrounding Holocaust memorials in particular that centered on the opposition between rative representation on the one hand, characteristic of memorials in the 1950s and 1960s and dating back to memorials commemorating fallen soldiers of World War I, and abstract or minimalist, nonrepresentational memorials on the other hand, whose justification often draws on the unrepresentability thesis by thinkers like Lyotard, or, in this context Claude Lanzman or Dan Diner, who hold that the Holocaust has no narrative structure, only statistics. Within this opposition the Kollwitz sculpture clearly is regressive, a totem offering the promise of reintegration, via what Freud calls secondary narcissism: the <i>fusion</i> of mother and child prescriptively mirrors not the viewer's strength and ability to accept loss and separation (in what could be called a politically mature historical consciousness), but the <i>fantasy</i> of a subsuming reunion. The specularization enacted by the reciprocal gaze of mother and child itself res the imaginary reintegration into a mythic unity, satisfying the "historical need" Nietzsche located in "the loss of myth, of the mythical homeland, the mythical maternal womb."<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
But the other pole of the opposition, the memorials of nonrepresentability of the late 1970s and 1980s, is also open to critique. The assumption here is that what is to be remembered, what is to be gestured toward or evoked because it is not directly re-cognizable, is absence, death, mass destruction, the endpoint of the <i>Endl&#x000F6;sung</i>. One example of this concept is Ulrich R&#x000FC;ckriem's "Denkmal f&#x000FC;r die deportierten Hamburger Juden" : a massive gray square of granite, cut into seven pieces and reassembled so that the cuts are visible, and located before the Hamburg Logengeb&#x000E4;ude, the collection point from where in 1941/1942 thousands of Jews were deported. Another example is Sol LeWitt's "Black Form&#x02014;Dedicated to the Missing Jews" (1987 

<b></b>

M&#x000FC;nster, 1989 Hamburg-Altona), a huge black block, reminiscent of Richard Serra's "Tilted Arc"  in downtown Manhattan, that the artist calls a "black hole" or "perceptual barrier" meant metaphorically to denote the absent Jewish population.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  The problem is that such a strategy can all too easily fall into theological transcendence (the Holocaust is unique, unrepresentable) or, even worse, an aesthetic myth. Such "black holes," while they do not provide the convenient closure of universal reconciliation, do provide another kind of closure, that of historical causality and agency. The memorials mark a limit event that in its absolute otherness implies that the Holocaust was itself extraterritorial to its historical genesis. If the first strategy collapses the crimes into an undifferentiated universal mourning, the second strategy hypostatizes them into a sublime negativity; in both cases what is missing is the historical differentiation that, especially in the land of the perpetrators, might actually make a difference toward Auschwitz not happening again.
</p>

<p>
James E. Young introduced the term "counter-monument" (following Jochen and Esther Gerz's coinage "<i>Gegen-Denkmal</i>") specifically to designate the second kind of poetics in my enumeration: several recent memorials, by playing with absence and presence and the processual, ephemeral nature of remembrance, cast doubt upon the function and permanence of traditional monuments. "Instead of seeking to capture the memory of events," younger artists, who never experienced the events directly, "remember only their own relationship to events, the great gulf of time between themselves and the Holocaust" (<i>TM</i>, 27). According to Young, these artists consider it their task "to jar viewers from complacency, to challenge and denaturalize the viewers' assumptions . . . artists renegotiate the tenets of their memory work, whereby monuments are born resisting the very possibility of their birth" (<i>TM</i>, 28). Examples of such "counter-monuments" include Harburg's "Monument against Fascism" by Jochen Gerz and Esther Shalev-Gerz, a twelve-meter-high, one-meter-square pillar made of hollow aluminum and plated with a layer of soft lead. An inscription near its base reads in German, French, English, Russian, Hebrew, Arabic, and Turkish: "We invite the citizens of Harburg, and visitors to the town, to add their names here to ours. In doing so, we commit ourselves to remain vigilant. As more and more names cover this 12-meter-tall column, it will gradually be lowered into the ground. One day it will have disappeared completely, and the site of the Harburg monument against fascism will be empty. In the end, it is only we ourselves who can rise up against injustice" (<i>TM</i>, 30). Unveiled on 10 October 1986, the pillar was sunk eight times over the next seven years until on 8 October 1993, it disappeared, only its top remaining visible.
</p>

<p>
Another example of a "counter-monument" is Horst Hoheisel's "Negative-Form" Monument in Kassel. The original Aschrott-Brunnen (Aschrott Fountain) in City Hall Square was built in 1908 and funded by the Jewish entrepreneur and citizen of Kassel, Sigmund Aschrott. It was demolished by Nazi activists during the night of 8-9 April 1939. In 1943, two years after the deportations from Kassel had begun, the city filled in the fountain's basin with soil and planted flowers, and local citizens came to call it "Aschrott's grave." Rather than rebuild the fountain, Hoheisel's design called for a mock-up of the fountain to be inverted and buried under the original basin, writing: "I 

<b></b>

have designed the new fountain as a mirror image of the old one, sunk beneath the old place in order to rescue the history of this place as a wound and as an open question, to penetrate the consciousness of the Kassel citizens so that such things never happen again" (<i>TM</i>, 43). As part of the project Hoheisel had school children research the lives of individual Jewish citizens, write their life stories on paper, attach them to stones, and place these "memory-stones" before the Kassel train station as an admonitory memorial [<i>Mahnmal</i>]. This dimension of historical documentation accompanying a memorial leads into the third and final poetics of counter-monuments.
</p>

<p>
This third kind of poetics is exemplified in recent work by the Gerzs, who have continued and radicalized their counter-monument strategy in the admonitory "invisible" monument "2146 Stones&#x02014;Monument Against Racism" [<i>2146 Steine&#x02014;Mahnmal gegen Rassismus</i>] in Saarbr&#x000FC;cken, where Jochen Gerz was a guest professor. There he happened upon the cell in the basement of the city castle where the Gestapo had held their prisoners. He and his students wrote to sixty-six Jewish communities and collated a list of all the locations of Jewish cemeteries in Germany before 1933. They then removed paving stones from the path leading to the Saarbr&#x000FC;cken castle, etched the name of one cemetery on the <i>underside</i> of each stone, and replaced the stones. As the artist says, "When you cannot see something, then you are almost forced to talk about it."<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Yet the monument would, in adherence to its own concept, need to remain completely invisible. The monument was in fact "unveiled" on 23 May 1993. The "castle square" [<i>Schlo&#x000DF;platz</i>] was renamed "square of the invisible monument" [<i>Platz des unsichtbaren Mahnmals</i>], and politicians convened to unveil the new street sign. Two critical observations arise here. First, conceptually one could argue that the monument itself is superfluous, that the activity leading to its emplacement&#x02014;the research, the inscribing&#x02014;constitutes the only real memory-work possible, and that in that case the artwork as public memorial has negated itself in favor of remembrance in the form of historical research and documentation. The second point is, to what extent do these strict counter-monuments, in denying representation and/or narration altogether&#x02014;whether through a questionable mimeticism of Jewish traditions and motives such as the <i>Bildverbot</i> or in favor of the enumeration of names and places alone&#x02014;contribute to the historical oblivion against which they are ostensibly struggling?
</p>

<p>
Thus by remaining bound dialectically to what they try to negate, counter-monuments either efface their role as public art in favor of historical documentation alone or, in denying representation, communication, or specificity, they become themselves "black holes" and <i>renounce</i> the very "memory work" they aspire to generate. Finally, by thematizing the resistance or ephemerality of remembrance in their opposition to conventional, ever-present, and hence easily overlooked ("invisible" is Robert Musil's apt expression) monuments, these counter-monuments at best reflexively thematize the problem of memorials in Germany today.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>

I turn now to another kind of memorial that, I think, escapes the dialectic between remembrance and forgetting, rative representation and unrepresentability as I've expounded these oppositions above and that also eludes the entwinement of military and civil spheres, of national monument and military memorial that I've traced in the various incarnations of the Neue Wache. The Neue Wache's inscription reads "Den Opfern von Krieg und Gewaltherrschaft," "To the Victims of War and Tyranny," though the German "<i>Gewaltherrschaft</i>" (as opposed to the loan word "<i>Tyrannei</i>") more literally means rule or domination through force; it thus stands implicitly opposed to the state under the rule of law [<i>Rechtsstaat</i>]. Those who are vulnerable to <i>Gewaltherrschaft</i> are those who stand outside the <i>Rechtsstaat</i>, are deprived of legal rule and recognition as citizens. The difference between a <i>Rechtsstaat</i> and a <i>Gewaltherrschaft</i> is subtly enacted rather than representationally or narratively re-red (positively or negatively) in the memorial entitled "Places of Remembering in the Bavarian Quarter" in the central Sch&#x000F6;neberg district in Berlin.<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  Before World War II the neighborhood was colloquially known as "Jewish Switzerland," home to wealthy assimilated middle-class Jewry. After 1933 a succession of ordinances, including the Nuremburg racial laws, curtailed, confined, and eventually removed all rights of public access to health, transportation, recreation, the right to practice a profession, partake in the public life in any way whatsoever, finally the right to existence itself. More than 6,000 Jewish citizens were deported from the neighborhood.

In 1991 the Sch&#x000F6;neberg Arts Department formed a commission of historians, artists, and architects and held an open competition for a central "place of remembrance" for the district's central "Bavarian Square" to accompany a decentralized installation to "provoke" and "irritate" remembrance against the background of everyday life in the bourgeois neighborhood. The winning concept by the artists Renate Stih and Frieder Schnock eschews a central memorial altogether, opting instead for a documentation center about Jewish life during the Nazi years to be housed in the district town hall.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>  The decentralized installation is composed of eighty small, enameled signs that have been mounted at a height of three meters on lamp-posts around the neighborhood, facing passersby. The signs have the same dimensions and location as conventional municipal signs and advertisements. On one side there is a typographic citation of a legal ordinance regarding the Jews and the date the ordinance was passed, on the reverse side a brightly painted, almost cartoonlike picture thematically related to the cited ordinance. For instance, one may come across a bright image of a thermometer and then read on the reverse side: "Henceforward Jewish doctors are not allowed to practice. 25.7.1938"; or an image of a loaf of bread, and on the reverse: "Jews are allowed to go grocery shopping in Berlin only in the afternoon between four and five o'clock. 4.7.1940." One of the earliest citations reads: "All Jewish employees are dismissed from the civil service. 7.4.1933" with a picture of a rubber stamp, and the last: "Documents, which relate to anti-Jewish activities, are to be destroyed. 16.2.1945" with a picture of the filing folders still used in offices today (<a href="#7">. 17a</a>, <a href="#7">17b</a>). These last

two signs are mounted virtually in the shadow of the Sch&#x000F6;neberg City Hall, while the law prescribing shopping times is mounted in front of a supermarket. There thus arises a complex interaction between text, image, location, and everyday practice to which I'll return presently.</p>

The relationship between colorful icon (often suggesting a child's pictorial vocabulary) and bureaucratic text is the first refraction; in many instances the relationship is further broken, often through irony. Thus the icon of a "welcome home" mat accompanies the text quoting an ordinance issued on the eve of the Berlin Olympic Games: "In order to avoid making a poor impression on foreign visitors, signs with extreme contents should be removed; signs such as 'Jews are not welcome here' [<i>'Juden sind hier unerw&#x000FC;nscht'</i>] will suffice. 29.1.1936"; the cited ordinance forbidding Jews to be members of singing groups is accompanied by an image of the notes to the hymn "Whomever God wants to show true favor He sends into the wide world" ["<i>Wem Gott will rechte Gunst erweisen, den schickt er in die weite Welt</i>"]; the image from the film <i>Der Berg ruft</i> is matched to the ordinance: "German film is recognized as one that is made in Germany by German citizens of German descent." Although the vast majority of signs cite such ordinances, a few quote reminiscences and reports. For example: "'Well the time has come, tomorrow I must leave and that of course hits me hard [ . . . ] I will write you . . . '&#x02014;Before the deportation, 16.1.1942" [reverse image: unaddressed envelope] stands before a post office. Two signs along a street of apartment buildings create a small narrative:

In several ways this memorial disintegrates the traditional aesthetic category of the unique and unified artwork. Firstly, of course, by its location outside of any institutionally defined aesthetic space, its decentralized dispersal within the material public sphere of anonymous information and command. Secondly, in several dimensions the memorial ruptures the "representational bond"&#x02014;the assumed affirmation between image or text (the former by resemblance, the latter by appellation) and referent by which an artwork creates a unified aesthetic difference; this rupture, however, does not content itself with merely thematizing the disjunction.<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  At the level of image the colorful icon, often suggesting a child's pictorial vocabulary, breaks the code of realistic resemblance to its referent; at the level of script, the text&#x02014;which does not denote nor name but rather <i>cites</i>&#x02014;breaks the code of realistic designation. At the level of representation the signs function virtually like a rebus: the bright icon evokes sheltered domesticity, the congenial workplace, familiar quotidian objects, the assurances of family and solidarity that the legal ordinances destroyed. And finally, at the level of utterance or mode, image, citation and location very often comment ironically on one another, as in some of the examples described above. 
</p>

<p>
Most importantly, however, in their mode of signification and seriality the signs&#x02014;being all similar to each other without resembling any original, that is, "artworks in the age of their technical reproducibility"&#x02014;no longer belong to the systemic order of representational or narrative resemblance/non-resemblance as do the dialectically related Holocaust memorials discussed earlier. The systemic order to which the signs belong is another: their authority, presence, production and reception are not correlative with their proximity to or representation of an original but rather lie in the communicational structures upon which they are parasitic. The signs merge into the quotidian life-world of the street because in their format and imagery, their <i>homomorphy</i>, they <i>mimic</i> conventional signs. This mimicry can firstly be interpreted as a survival strategy, in effect: by assuming the contact and codes of advertisements and municipal street signs, they merge into the quotidian life-world of the city and cannot be isolated into an autonomous memorial or ritual which can be as easily isolated as forgotten. Indeed, the signs happened to be put up in June 1993, just a week after the fatal arson attack in Solingen in which five Turkish women and children were killed. Citizens from the neighborhood complained to the police that Neo-nazis were getting "cheekier and 

<b></b>

cheekier," and representatives of Jewish organizations who had approved the project wondered whether the danger of misinterpretation was too great. It was thus decided to affix small "meta-signs" to the signs, explaining that they are part of a memorial:

But secondly, following Roger Caillois's observations on mimicry as sympathetic magic, we can consider the signs to be "a disturbance in the perception of space."<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  That is, the signs, to the extent that they mimete the anonymous discursive authority possessed by authentic municipal ordinances, also assimilate that authority and mode of address in a gestalt switch (Wittgenstein speaks of an "aspect change") that hovers between <i>use</i> and <i>mention</i>: in that momentary affective disorientation, perhaps what Benjamin might accept as a "moment of danger" in which an historical subject seizes hold of a memory, the addressee becomes interpellated into the coordinate system of authority and law which increasingly structured and eclipsed the permissible life of Jewish citizens during those years, in which they were, to speak with Paul Celan, "<i>auseinandergeschrieben</i>" [written asunder].<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  Each person is addressed as a <i>legal</i> (rather than cultural, ethnic, personal, etc.) subject of a <i>Rechtsstaat</i> precisely as the content of the sign documents the abrogation of that legal status in the advent of a <i>Gewaltherrschaft</i>. The homomorphy in contact, code, and implied addressee between past ordinance and present day memorial brings the specific cultural-political form of the period to material expression and possibly, hopefully, conscious reflection. That is, just as Benjamin demonstrated how in the Baroque the artistic form of allegory, irrespective of its particular contents, expressed the age's obsession with transitoriness [<i>Verg&#x000E4;nglichkeit</i>], so too this memorial brings to expression the political-communicational form specific to National Socialism&#x02014;and perhaps more generally the implicit political sovereignty that structures urban everyday life in mass society.<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Here one can perhaps claim a <i>tertium datur</i> between the alternatives Benjamin postulates in the polarity of ritual versus politics: the nineteenth-century individual viewer's attentive, even reverential contemplation of the unique and sequestered artwork versus the twentieth-century mass audience's collective absorption of the reproduced and public artwork in the mode of distraction [<i>Zerstreuung</i>] (film being the premier example).<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  Clearly the memorial's signs are parasitic on the rituals which structure everyday public life around the quarter&#x02014;commuting, shopping, etc.&#x02014;and are thus registered, taken in, used, one might say, in the mode of distraction; however, the shock produced by the signs, once they are in fact perceived, transforms the habitual user into a reflective viewer. Whereas Benjamin sees a revolutionary (communist) potential in the mass audience's self-correcting response to film, these signs recuperate the potentially liberal-democratic individual by inducing a critical, political 

<b></b>

awareness of the habitually used and thus largely invisible structures and institutions which make possible&#x02014;and conversely, which may make impossible&#x02014;everyday life in a modern society.
</p>

<p>
The Bavarian Quarter memorial thus undercuts the opposition between cultic ritual and progressive politics central to Benjamin's argument and underlying Pierre Nora's observations. Nora takes deritualization to be a characteristic of modernity because, I suspect, for him ritual is linked to a historically specific notion of the temporally and spatially sacrosanct, similar to both Benjamin's characterization of nineteenth-century aesthetic experience and to the experience war memorials like the incarnations of the Neue Wache incorporate into nationalist narratives. By contrast, the Bavarian Quarter memorial locates remembrance in the habitual rituals inherent in secularized capitalist public life, as practiced by the citizen as consumer and commuter. The signs' site and situational specificity creates a <i>stereoscopic</i> effect in which today's institutions and practices are momentarily <i>experienced</i> from the perspective of their past misuse during the Third Reich, when anti-democratic political goals where pursued under the cloak of legality, as Otto Kirchheimer among others has documented. A sign citing "Jewish lawyers and notaries in future may not engage in legal matters of the city of Berlin&#x02014;18.3.1933," mounted in front of the municipal courthouse, or "The baptism of Jews and the conversion to Christianity have no significance for the race question&#x02014;4.10.1936" placed before a Protestant church render these institutions, to again speak with Benjamin, monads laden with their own history (<a href="#8">. 18a</a>, <a href="#8">18b</a>). And sometimes it is a history that continues unbroken into the present. "Streets that bear the names of Jews, are renamed. Haberland Street, named after the founder of the Bavarian Quarter, is renamed as Treutlinger Street and N&#x000F6;rdlinger Street&#x02014;27.7.1938" stands today at the intersection of Treutlinger and N&#x000F6;rdlinger Streets (. <a href="#9">19a</a>, <a href="#9">19b<a//>). If everyday urban, public life is composed of secularized rituals against the background of legal order, one could perhaps call this memorial the bad faith of bureaucratic rationality.
</p>

<p>
We might characterize the experience of this memorial, which the artist Stih says is a "making visible of states of affairs," as a making legible of the implicit political sovereignty that structures the everyday life, the "second nature" of mass society.<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  The memorial preserves the history of that sovereignty for remembrance by withholding the closure afforded by rative conciliation or transcendent sublimity. Michael Rosen has suggested that Benjamin's concept of "non-sensible similarities" [<i>unsinnliche &#x000C4;hnlichkeiten</i>] be understood as the "tacit knowledge" by which the members of a specific society manifest "common structures" in a variety of contexts and exhibit a "shared, pre-discursive level of collective experience": " . . . despite not being able to express that knowledge in explicit or theoretical terms, the members of a culture share the capacity to 'map' one area of their experience into another one in such a way that they can recognize (though not articulate) its appropriateness."<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The juxtaposition between then and now of sign, site and above all practical situation perhaps provokes explicit awareness of the tacit knowledge by which citizens in Nazi Germany were addressed by, operated within and were removed from the political structures organizing their quotidian lives. This suggests that a successful memorial

does not recount a grand historical narrative or offer a re of closure to a contemplative viewer but rather places the addressee within a practical situation that can produce a recognition of the history embedded within the material structures and institutions by means of the non-sensible similarity between their past and present incarnations.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there is no possible confusion with the military tradition of conventional monuments and memorials, for this is emphatically a <i>civil memorial</i>, designed to induce the historical experience of a civil catastrophe by citing its material annunciation. The signs achieve their effect through their aesthetic askesis: in their form and decentered location they cite the <i>contact</i> (the physical channel of communication) and the <i>contextual content</i> (everyday life around the district) that was as operative then as now, and in their <i>code</i>&#x02014;their language&#x02014;they cite the juridical and municipal authority that also was as operative then as now. And each citation is a visitation, a haunting of today's juridical, municipal and private institutions by their former incarnation. If the present form of the Neue Wache seeks to entomb history&#x02014;including the history of its own previous incarnations&#x02014;within a maternal re of mythic sacrifice and redemption, that is, aesthetic semblance as myth (historical oblivion), the Sch&#x000F6;neberg memorial shows that institutions and discourses have ghosts. To draw on Kracauer, for Germany, now, that is not much, but perhaps that is precisely enough.

It has been remarked in the debates about memorials that any permanent memorial eventually becomes, as Musil noted, invisible, and the Bavarian Quarter street signs are no exception.<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>  At the conclusion of his reflections on coming to terms with the Nazi past Adorno entertained a sobering thought:

If people are reminded of the simplest things: that open or disguised fascist revivals will cause war, suffering and privation under a coercive system . . . in short, that they lead to a politics of catastrophe, then this will impress people more deeply than invoking ideals or even the suffering of others. . . .

Since reunification, construction and the modernization of the municipal infrastructure in Berlin, especially in former East Berlin, has been proceeding at breakneck pace. As they reopened foundations and streets, construction workers on the average were finding one undetonated bomb a week. The United States government eventually provided Berlin with aerial bombing maps from World War II to aid in locating undetonated armaments. Each time a bomb is located, construction sites are blocked off, traffic is rerouted, whole apartment buildings are cleared, and the vintage ordnance is defused or exploded in controlled detonations. The past continues to send its own material memorials to posterity.

On the American example, cf.

<p class="noIndent">
To students of twentieth-century modernism, 1971 was the year when Valerie Eliot published a facsimile edition of <i>The Waste Land's</i> pre-publication manuscripts. The event invited new accounts of the poem's genetics and fresh assessments of how those might bear on our understanding of the poem.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  One year later Hugh Kenner and Grover Smith published two essays which, while differing sharply in premises and procedures, reached a consensus that Part III, "The Fire Sermon," was the earliest portion of the poem to have been written, probably around midsummer 1921, followed first by Parts I and II, then by IV and V, the latter completed in December 1921.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Their efforts were followed in 1977 by Lyndall Gordon's attempt at "Dating <i>The Waste Land</i> Fragments," a wide-ranging survey which addressed both the principal parts of <i>The Waste Land</i> and the various drafts and ancillary poems.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  In the end, however, Gordon remained divided over the claims of two sharply incompatible hypotheses for dating the principal parts of <i>The Waste Land,</i> and concluded that the question was, at least for the present, "unresolved" ("DTWLF," 146). In 1979 there was still another consideration of the dating by Peter Barry.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Barry urged a complicated chronology which assigned priority to the first leaf in the typescript for Part I, a passage recounting a rowdy night on the town in Boston (assigned to April-May 1921), followed by all of Part III (September-October), then the rest of Part I and all of Part II (early November), and finally Parts IV 

<b></b>

and V (November-December). Finally, in 1984, Ronald Bush offered a reading of the poem which echoed Smith's and Kenner's thesis assigning priority to Part III, and relied on Gordon's conjecture that a specific fragment, the one beginning "London, the swarming life," might date from as far back as 1918.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
By 1985, however, debate had come to a standstill, and since then a lack of new evidence or argumentation has effectively put a halt to discussion. What had once seemed a new dawn has turned into a lunar landscape, with critics condemned to retracing the dusty tracks left by Kenner, Smith, Gordon, and Barry. At the same time, as Christine Froula has lately noted, more recent criticism has increasingly drawn upon the pre-publication manuscripts to offer "readings that cross easily between the 1921 and 1922 texts," despite lingering uncertainty about the date or status of virtually all the pre-publication manuscripts.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Indeed, as Froula's repeated references to "the 1921 manuscript" and "the 1921 text" indicate, the specificity of the pre-publication materials&#x02014;their heft, their material and historical density&#x02014;has been levelled by a process of abstraction into "text," or even "the 1921 text," that definite article urging a monolithic entity which jars against the experience of pondering the undated, disordered scraps that jostle one another in the facsimile edition. That experience inevitably raises a host of questions. Did one passage or fragment antedate the others and preserve the trace of an original program which had later dissolved? Were specific passages composed all at once or in discrete and discontinuous moments? Were the ancillary poems conceived as independent works or meant to form part of the poem's texture? Was the poem's composition a straightforward progress or did it entail more entangled loopings? If we are to address these, if we are to restore the specificity of the pre-publication materials and assess their bearing on critical understanding of <i>The Waste Land,</i> we must first return to the manuscripts themselves, revisiting the debates which ground to a halt in the mid-1980s. More concretely, we must resolve the vexing question concerning the priority of Parts I-II and Part III, a question that hinged on the identity of a mysteriously missing typewriter. Then, we must establish a chronology for the entire corpus of pre-publication materials to furnish a coherent account of the poem's production, assaying its significance for longstanding debates about the plan or program which shaped the poem's composition. And last, we need to integrate those considerations into a history specific to the early twentieth century, a culture of the book that gravitated around that epitome of modern communication flows, the typewriter, and that recognizably modern protagonist, the typist. "Such an exercise needs no apology," wrote Hugh Kenner at the outset of his own attempt to address the pre-publication manuscripts some thirty years ago. "<i>The Waste Land</i> is still a determinant of modernist consciousness, post-modernist also if it has come to that, and the profit . . . may be that we shall learn a little more about the history of our own minds" ("UA," 24; ellipsis added). Or, as Ezra Pound put it in his preface to the facsimile, "The more we know of Eliot, the better" (<i>TWL:AF,</i> vii).

I. Confessions of a Typewriter
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
The first two scholars who attempted to date the <i>Waste Land</i> manuscripts, Hugh Kenner and Grover Smith, agreed that the principal question was the problem of the typewriters&#x02014;three of them, to be exact. One was especially distinctive: its characters were discernibly larger than those of the others and, as Valerie Eliot noted that it had been used with the kind of "violet ribbon used by Pound" (<i>TWL:AF,</i> 63), both inferred that this machine was Pound's. Eliot must have worked on it while visiting him in Paris in January, 1922, and it had been used to type fair copies of Parts IV and V of the poem because these were apparently the last to be drafted and had still not been typed when Eliot came to Paris ("UA," 24; "MOTWL," 131). That left a more difficult question: what was the relationship between Parts I and II, typed on a second kind of typewriter, and Part III, typed on a third? The facts were both suggestive and confusing: suggestive because in theory the different typewriters offered a key to identifying discrete levels or times of composition; confusing because in practice there seemed to be no way of establishing the chronology of their usage.
</p>

<p>
Both the typewriters had smaller characters than the third and were generally rather similar in appearance. Yet on closer scrutiny they could be distinguished from one another by several features. One was the minuscule forms of the letters <i>t</i> and <i>f</i>. In the typewriter used for Parts I and II (<a href="#1"> 1</a>), the descender of the lowercase <i>t</i> ended with a finishing stroke that seemed oddly constricted, curving back sharply as it rose toward the cross-stroke above. Similarly, the ascender of the lowercase <i>f</i> concluded with an arc that curled back toward the character's body, giving it a crabbed appearance, and it ended at a point high above the level of the cross-stroke. The other typewriter, the one used for Part III, was recognizably different (<a href="#2"> 2</a>). The finishing stroke of the lowercase <i>t</i> culminated in a wide, stately curve, arcing beyond the length of the cross-stroke above, while the ascender of the lowercase <i>f</i> also finished with a wide, graceful arc, circling downward until it nearly touched the cross-stroke below. Moreover, this machine had apostrophes and quotation marks that were notably elongated, numerals such as <i>2</i> and <i>3</i> without serifs, alignment that was straight and even, as opposed to the often wobbly alignment of the other machine, and characters that were crisp and well-defined, as opposed to the worn appearance of the other machine ("UA," 24; "MOTWL," 131-2). There was one other distinction that Kenner and Smith did not notice: the machine with apparently wider characters, the one used for Part III, actually allocated less space per letter than the other, 2.10 mm in width, while the machine with the crabbed finishing strokes (Parts I and II) allocated more, 2.12 mm in width.
</p>

<p>
Both Kenner and Smith concluded that Part III, typed on the 2.10 typewriter, was the earlier material, though they did so on very different grounds. Kenner noted that much of the material in Part III was written in elegiac quatrains (a stanza pattern so named because of its use by Thomas Gray in his famous "Elegy in a Country Churchyard"). The same stanza, he observed, had also been used by John Dryden in his "Annus Mirabilis," a poem that celebrated the reconstruction of London after the fire of 1666 and elaborated a sustained analogy between modern London and ancient Rome. Eliot

published a review of a new book on Dryden on 9 June 1921, allowing us to infer that he was reading Dryden in May. Further, on 9 May he had notified John Quinn that he had "a long poem in mind," and that it was "partly on paper" already.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Thus, Kenner concluded, the material "partly on paper" was most likely the typescript draft for Part III. And even if this typescript draft was not completed by 9 May, it was certainly completed shortly thereafter, and certainly preceded the composition of Parts I and II. The 2.10 machine, with its rounded, stately finishing strokes, was Eliot's "London typewriter" ("UA," 25), which had first been used to type Part III; while the 2.12 was "the one he used at Lausanne" ("UA," 38).</p>

Grover Smith reached the same conclusion by a complex body of assumptions and inferences. First and foremost, Smith assumed that the passage depicting Madame Sosostris in Part I derived from Aldous Huxley's portrait of a fortune teller in <i>Crome Yellow,</i> a novel published in November, 1921. If so, he reasoned, Parts I and II, both typed with the 2.12 machine, could not have been written earlier. Second, Ezra Pound had once remarked that the passage beginning "Summer surprised us . . ." contained "snatches of conversation heard by Eliot from his fellow patients" in Lausanne ("MOTWL," 132).<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  If so, Smith inferred, it reinforced the hypothesis that Parts I and II were written after Eliot's journey there in November 1921. Third, Vivien Eliot's written comments on one copy of Part II indicated that she was surprised when she saw it for the first time; and though Smith did not explicitly state this, apparently he assumed that "the first time" could only have been in Paris in January 1922. If so, it corroborated the view that Parts I and II were primarily composed and typed in Lausanne. That inference, in turn, became the premise for another. If Parts I and II were composed and typed in Lausanne, then Eliot must have taken this typewriter with him: "It is assumed that Typewriter [2.12] was a portable machine and that Eliot took it to Lausanne" ("MOTWL," 133). And from this premise, yet another inference followed: Part III was neither composed nor typed in December in Lausanne, for Eliot would have used the same typewriter to do so; therefore: "It follows, then, that 

<b></b>

the fair [or typescript] copy of Part III was made before Eliot left England on November 18" ("MOTWL," 133). Indeed, it was very likely that "Part III, or some prototype of it, existed by the time Eliot and Vivienne went to Margate about the middle of October" ("MOTWL," 133).<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> </p>

Kenner and Smith, then, agreed that Part III, typed on the 2.10 machine with the rounded <i>t</i>'s and <i>f</i>'s, had been written and typed before Parts I and II, typed on the 2.12 machine. For Kenner Part III was "the earliest continuous stretch of the poem" ("UA," 25), for Smith "the first germ of <i>The Waste Land</i>" ("MOTWL," 133). They also agreed on its date of composition: Kenner assigned it to May 1921, or not long thereafter; while Smith thought it had "probably" ("MOTWL," 133) been composed by early May, and in any case sometime before Eliot left for Margate in mid-October 1921. Finally, they also concurred that the 2.12 typewriter, the one with the crabbed finishing strokes used for Parts I and II, was firmly linked with Eliot's experience in Lausanne: for Kenner it was "the one he used at Lausanne" ("UA," 25), for Smith "a portable machine . . . that he took . . . to Lausanne" ("MOTWL," 133). But that claim entailed an obvious puzzle: if Eliot used this typewriter in Lausanne to type Parts I and II, why did he not also use it to prepare a typescript of Parts IV and V? Why, in fact, bother to prepare a fair copy of Parts IV and V by hand if one had a typewriter at one's disposition? Smith never considered the question, but Kenner clearly foresaw it: when Eliot prepared Part IV, he said, "a typewriter" was "for some reason inaccessible" ("UA," 41). It was at least an answer, however vague ("for some reason"? which reason?). To Smith's hypothesis that Eliot had taken a "portable machine" with him to Lausanne there was a still stronger objection. For when Eliot went on to Paris in January 1922, why did he use Ezra Pound's typewriter to prepare typescripts of Parts IV and V? Had he jettisoned his own typewriter while in Lausanne, or lost it while en route to Paris?

Lyndall Gordon, writing seven years later, struggled to address these questions. She was the first to consult the manuscripts themselves and to focus on evidence offered by study of their papers. By collating the kinds of paper used in <i>The Waste Land</i> manuscripts with those used in poems whose dates of composition were already established, she hoped to date not just the major parts of <i>The Waste Land,</i> but all the fragments and independent poems. For our purpose, her comments on the chronology 

<b></b>

of Parts I and II, versus Part III, are the most important. Having examined the typescripts of other poems by Eliot, Gordon was aware that the 2.12 typewriter, the one with the crabbed finishing strokes, appeared not only in Parts I and II of <i>The Waste Land,</i> but in numerous poems that Eliot had composed much earlier. Gordon, in fact, dubbed it "his Harvard typewriter" ("DTWLF," 144), implying he had used it at least since 1914, perhaps even earlier. But if so, its usage typified not Eliot's stay in Lausanne, but his everyday life in London, and therefore it would seem that Parts I and II had been written not late in 1921 in Lausanne, but earlier. And this suspicion was buttressed by other evidence. First, Parts I and II were written on the same kind of paper as a poem titled "Song for the Opherion," and since "Song" had been published already in April 1921, in the <i>Tyro,</i> Parts I and II had been composed around the same time&#x02014;long, long before the Lausanne period (late November/December) urged by Kenner and Smith. Second, the original opening of Part I had described a raucous evening in Boston, a scene redolent of the Night-town episode in <i>Ulysses,</i> which Eliot was reading in manuscript in early May 1921, so corroborating an earlier dating of Parts I and II. And third, Eliot's letter of 9 May to Quinn, stating that his "long poem" was already "partly on paper," could be deemed further confirmation: "on paper" might refer not to Part III or some part of it, as Kenner and Smith had urged, but to Parts I and II.
</p>

<p>
But against this scenario were two arguments that Gordon found compelling. Eliot, she assumed, would always show any new poems almost immediately to Pound; and since Eliot and Pound were known to have met briefly in mid-October 1921, when Pound returned to London for a week, and since Pound's letter describing their encounter to John Quinn made no reference to Eliot's new poem, it could only be because no major poem was yet in existence. Also, Gordon accepted Smith's assumption that the name of Madame Sosostris came from "Sesostris the Sorceress" in Huxley's <i>Crome Yellow</i>, published in November 1921, completed only in August, 1921&#x02014;much too late to permit the inference that Parts I or II had been composed so much earlier, in the spring of 1921. On these grounds Gordon rejected her first hypothesis and advanced another. Since nothing about a major poem had been mentioned to Pound in mid-October, nothing had yet been composed. Immediately thereafter, Eliot went to Margate, taking only a few fragments assembled from poems written much earlier, and there wrote Part III, "The Fire Sermon." The different typewriter used for this manuscript, the 2.10, was "an office typewriter" ("DTWLF," 145) that he presumably borrowed from Lloyds Bank. (The idea that a bank would lend out office equipment may strike some readers as a bit far-fetched.) After leaving Margate, Eliot had returned to London, then traveled to Paris for a few days. It was there that Pound made his first comments on Part III. Eliot next proceeded to Lausanne, where he composed Parts I and II, then IV and V. Gordon confessed, however, to being puzzled by an obvious objection to this view: why had Eliot typed only Parts I and II in Lausanne, and not IV and V? She concluded: "The story of <i>The Waste Land</i>'s composition in 1921 remains, as yet, unresolved. There are two possible hypotheses and one can do no more at present than weigh one body of circumstantial evidence against the other" ("DTWLF," 146).

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Gordon's account revealed the impasse which had been reached in efforts to date the <i>Waste Land</i> manuscripts which were based primarily on the facsimile edition. Even her attempt to draw on the papers used in Eliot's earlier poems rested on a documentary base too slender to resolve the outstanding questions. It was only in 1988, when Valerie Eliot published the first volume of Eliot's letters through 1922, that scholars could gain a panoramic view of his correspondence, a precondition for an account of his writing practices that would have sufficient breadth to address not only the vexed debate about the typewriters, but also the papers used in the fragments and independent poems affiliated with <i>The Waste Land.</i> If we could collate data about the papers that were used in the <i>Waste Land</i> manuscripts with corresponding data from Eliot's letters from 1914 to 1922, we would have reasonable grounds to infer the manuscripts' dates, for most of Eliot's letters are dated, and those that are not can be conjecturally dated with sufficient accuracy.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Eliot's edition of <i>The Letters of T. S. Eliot,</i> vol. 1 <i>1898-1922,</i> contained transcriptions of 509 letters by Eliot. (It also contained 37 by his first wife, Vivien, and 40 by various third parties.) Not all the 509, however, were derived from extant originals. For sixteen letters included in Valerie Eliot's edition, the text was taken from published transcriptions, the originals being no longer extant (chiefly letters to the editors of periodicals); for another thirteen letters, the originals turned out to be held in private collections that could not be consulted. In addition, there are six letters for which the originals have been lost since they were first located by Mrs. Eliot; and for two other letters, both from Eliot to his brother Henry and both dating from December, 1922, I did not obtain permission to examine the originals (though these last two would not affect the dating of the <i>Waste Land</i> manuscripts.)<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  In short, there were 37 published letters whose originals I could not examine, leaving 472 of the published letters whose originals I consulted. In addition, I have examined another 166 unpublished letters which were omitted from the 1988 edition: all together then, 638 letters, written on more than 900 leaves. These letters, together with synoptic descriptions of the paper on which they were written, are registered in <a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>, which will be published in <i>Revisiting "The Waste Land"</i> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005). In addition, I have examined more than 200 leaves of Eliot's student papers, which range in date from 1910 to 1915 and are held at the Houghton Library of Harvard University. These are described in synoptic form in <a href="#tab02">Table 2</a>, which will be published in <i>Revisiting "The Waste Land."</i> Finally, I have also examined more than a hundred leaves containing poems and essays by Eliot in a variety of libraries, and these are described in <a href="#tab03">Table 3</a> (also to be published in <i>Revisiting "The Waste Land"</i>). Taken together, more than 1,200 leaves of Eliot's writing have been examined, ranging over a decade, from 1913 to the end of 1922.
</p>

<p>
The evidence from these tells an unequivocal story about the two typewriters. In all of Eliot's student papers from 1913 to 1915, in all his typed letters from 1914 up to 6 July 1921, and in all the typescripts of his poems and essays during the same period, Eliot uses only one typewriter, the 2.12 machine with the crabbed finishing strokes, the one also used in typing Parts I and II of <i>The Waste Land.</i> The other typewriter, the 2.10 machine with wider finishing strokes (the one used in typing Part III), appears for 

<b></b>

the first time in a letter to Richard Aldington, dated 8 September 1921, (<i>LOTSE,</i> 468-9), and it appears in every typescript letter and essay that Eliot wrote thereafter until the end of 1922. Moreover, the 2.12 machine vanishes forever, at least in Eliot's usage.
</p>

<p>
What brought about this change of typewriters is sketched in a letter by Vivien Eliot to Eliot's brother, Henry, written only three days after Henry, together with his mother and sister, had left England on 20 August 1921. Eliot's mother and sister had been staying in the Eliots' flat at 9, Clarence Gate Gardens for some ten weeks since their arrival on 10 June, while Eliot and Vivien had moved to a temporary flat at 12, Wigmore Street. Returning to their old flat in August after the Eliot family had vacated it, Vivien wrote to Henry:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

<p>
As he did, finally, on 3 October: "I was most painfully touched at finding that you had secretly left your typewriter behind instead of my old wretched one, which I hope will not fall to pieces" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 472). Henry, it is now clear, had done something remarkable when he left the Eliots' flat and England on 20 August: he had taken away Eliot's old typewriter, the 2.12 with the crabbed finishing strokes, the one Eliot had used a few months earlier to type Parts I and II of <i>The Waste Land,</i> and in its place left behind his own, newer machine, the 2.10 typewriter with the wider strokes, the one that Eliot would soon use to type Part III of <i>The Waste Land.</i>
</p>

<p>
In retrospect, we can see all too plainly how the speculative arguments about the dating of <i>The Waste Land</i>'s parts went astray. One mistake was the repeated attempt to postulate an opposition between a "London typewriter" ("UA," 25) and "the one [Eliot] used at Lausanne" ("UA," 38) or even "a portable machine . . . that he took . . . to Lausanne" ("MOTWL," 133), or "an office typewriter" ("DTWLF," 145) which Eliot borrowed and then mysteriously lost while in Lausanne. The other was the assumption that the name of Madame Sosostris in Part I could only be derived from the character of Sesotris the Sorcerer in Aldous Huxley's <i>Crome Yellow,</i> published in November 1921, and hence that Part I could only have been written thereafter.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  As if Eliot were incapable, on his own account, of using that most common expression, "so so," to invent a name meant to suggest equivocation.

Evoking the holidays in France which he had spent together with Eliot in the summer of 1919, Wyndham Lewis recalled that his companion possessed a curious habit:

<blockquote class="extract">

<p class="noIndent">
Eliot was a frugal man, at least in the years that ran from 1914 through 1922. Despite earning a relatively substantial salary at Lloyds Bank from 1917 onward, he was beset by worries over money, chiefly prompted by Vivien's many medical expenses and the need to keep a cottage in the country where she spent much of her time. His frugality extended to his consumption of paper as well: he seems to have purchased relatively small batches of paper that would last at most a few months, often only a few weeks, before he would purchase another. (<a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>.) As a consequence, his letters can serve as a control base for establishing the dates of the pre-publication materials of <i>The Waste Land.</i> No, we cannot identify the precise day on which a given passage or poem was composed; but often we can establish the week or weeks, and more broadly we can also establish a working account of the poem's documentary evolution and an understanding of its composition&#x02014;up to a point. And yes, the boundaries of that point will need to be carefully delineated later.
</p>

<p>
The twenty-six documents which make up the <i>Waste Land</i> manuscripts can be divided into four principal groups. One consists of the manuscripts and typescripts which contain the text (or a large block of it) for each of the five parts of the published poem:
</p>

<ol class="decimal">
<li>Burial of the Dead, typescript, 3 ll. </li>

<li> A Game of Chess, typescript, 3 ll.</li>

<li>A Game of Chess, carbon copy typescript, 3 ll.</li>

<li>The Fire Sermon, typescript, 5 ll.</li>

<li>The Fire Sermon, carbon copy typescript, 5 ll.</li>

<li>Death by Water, autograph fair copy, 4 ll.</li>

<li> Death by Water, typescript, 4 ll.</li>

<li>What the Thunder Said, autograph fair copy, 6 ll.</li>

<li>What the Thunder Said, typescript, 2 ll.</li>
</ol>

<p>
A second group consists of autograph fragments and independent poems which were written contemporaneously with the main text of <i>The Waste Land</i>; the fragments were wholly or partly incorporated into Parts I and III, while the independent poems were ultimately set aside:
</p>

<p class="noIndent">
<u>Fragments</u>
</p>

<ol class="decimal" start="10">
<li> "Those are pearls," autograph, 1 l., incorporated into Part I</li>

<li>"Highbury bore me," autograph, 1 l., incorporated into Part III</li>

<li>  "On Margate Sands," autograph, 1 l., incorporated in Part III</li>
<li> "From which, a Venus Anadyomene," autograph, 1 l., incorporated into Part III, then rejected

<li>"Elegy"/"Dirge," autograph, 1 l.</li>
<li>"Dirge," autograph fair copy, 1 l.</li>
<li>"Exequy," typescript, 1 l.</li>
</ol>

<p>
A third group consists of four poems, conserved in five documents, which are known to have been written some years prior to <i>The Waste Land,</i> though there is no agreement concerning their precise dates:
</p>

<ol class="decimal" start="19">

<li>"The Death of St. Narcissus," autograph draft, 1 l.</li>
<li>"The Death of St. Narcissus," autograph fair copy, 1 l., of which five lines, with alterations, are incorporated into Part I</li>
<li>"The Death of the Duchess," typescript, 2 ll., of which six lines, with alterations, are
incorporated into Part II</li>
<li>"So through the evening," autograph, 1 l., of which eight lines are incorporated into
Part V</li>
<li>"After the turning," autograph, 1 l., of which 1 line was incorporated into Part V</li>
</ol>

<p>
A fourth group consists of two brief poems, of which no part was ever incorporated into <i>The Waste Land</i>:
</p>

<ol class="decimal" start="24">
<li> "I am the Resurrection," autograph, 1 l.</li>
<li>  "Song [for the Opherion]," typescript, 1 l.</li>
</ol>

<p class="noIndent">
Finally, there is the title page, which was added to the manuscripts in January 1922, after Eliot had returned from Paris to London.
</p>

<p>
The earliest stratum of materials consists of three poems, of which two provided lines incorporated into Part V ("After the turning," and "So through the evening," <i>TWL:AF,</i>108-9, 112-3), while the third ("I am the Resurrection," <i>TWL:AF,</i> 110-1) left no traces in <i>The Waste Land.</i> "From the handwriting," Valerie Eliot urged that all three "were written about 1914 or even earlier" (<i>TWL:AF,</i> 130). Certainly all three are on the same kind of paper, which measures 267 x 205 mm and has a thickness of 0.12 mm. Each has a watermark reading "Linen Ledger," which measures 36 x 124 mm, and a pattern of quadruled lines that is distinctive. Though Eliot used several varieties of paper bearing the watermark "Linen Ledger" during the academic year 1913-1914 (<a href="#tab02">Table 2</a>), these can be distinguished from one another by their thickness and different patterns of printed lines. Only two exemplars match the paper used in the three poems. One is Eliot's "Notes on Eastern Philosophy," dated 3-10 October [1913], the other his notes on "Perry: Philosophy 25," dated 2 October [1913]. These leave little doubt that the poems should be dated to the same period, between 2 and 10 October 1913.
</p>

<p>
The second stratum of materials consists of two poems, one of which ("The Death of St. Narcissus," <i>TWL:AF,</i> 90-3) is conserved in both draft and fair copy form. From this poem there were five lines which, after revision, would become lines 26-9 of Part I in <i>The Waste Land.</i> From the other poem, "The Death of the Duchess" (<i>TWL:AF,</i> 

<b></b>

104-7) there were six lines which, after alteration, would becomes lines 108-10 and 136-8 in Part II of <i>The Waste Land.</i>
</p>

<p>
The draft version of "The Death of St. Narcissus" is written on paper which measures 262 x 203 mm, and has a thickness of 0.09 mm. The paper is laid and has 8 chainlines which appear as vertical lines on the leaf at intervals of 28 mm. It also has a watermark reading "EXCELSIOR | FINE | BRITISH MAKE," one that measures 71 x 125 mm. The same sort of paper turns up only once in Eliot's correspondence, in a letter to Ezra Pound which is dated 15 April [1915] from Merton College, Oxford. Tellingly, however, the same type of paper also appears in three of Eliot's student essays titled "[On Matter]," "[Matter and Form]," and "[Aristotle: Definition of . . .]" (<a href="#tab02">Table 2</a>, items 35-37.1). None is dated, but all clearly stem from the same period when, as he explained in a contemporary letter, he "was writing papers for Joachim on Aristotle" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 98; Harold Henry Joachim was the Fellow and Tutor in Philosophy at Merton College). The same paper also appears in the penciled first draft of "Mr. Apollinax" (<a href="#tab03">Table 3</a>, item 16) and we may assume that this poem should also be assigned to the same period, mid-April 1915.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The fair copy version of "The Death of St. Narcissus" is written on paper which measures 250 x 198 mm and has a thickness of 0.10 mm. The paper has no watermark, but it does have 8 horizontal chainlines at intervals of 27 mm. The paper is also quadruled, forming an identifiable pattern: the horizontal lines begin 29 mm from the top edge of the leaf, occupy a block of space that measures 207 mm and contains 24 lines, and come to an end 14 mm from the bottom edge of the leaf (or: 29.207.14). No such paper appears in Eliot's correspondence, nor among his student papers. However, the same sort of paper is used for the autograph fair copy of "Mr. Apollinax," written in black ink (<a href="#tab03">Table 3</a>, item 17). Since Eliot typically made fair copies shortly after writing a draft, the fair copies of both poems should be assigned to May 1915.
</p>

<p>
"The Death of the Duchess" is written on paper which measures 258 x 202 mm and has a thickness of 0.07 mm. It has no watermark, but is laid, with 9 horizontal chainlines at intervals of 27 mm. The same paper appears in a small group of five letters by Eliot, all written between 5 and 7 September 1916 (to Eleanor Hinkley, his mother, Henry Eliot, Harriet Monroe, and J. H. Woods; <a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>). The poem should also be assigned to the same period, early September 1916.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The third stratum of material for <i>The Waste Land</i> consists of a single poem, "Song [for the Opherion]" (<i>TWL:AF,</i> 98-9). A brief work of fifteen lines, it was published under the pseudonym "Gus Krutzsch" in the first issue of Wyndham Lewis's new journal the <i>Tyro,</i> which appeared on 9 April 1921.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  The typescript, with corrections in black ink and pencil, is on paper which measures 263 x 200 mm and has a thickness of 0.07 mm. The paper is laid, with 8 vertical chainlines at intervals of 26 mm. It also has a watermark, "BRITISH BOND | [device: S entwined with B]," which lies horizontally on the leaf and measures 65 x 125 mm. There are three different papers among Eliot's correspondence which have the British Bond watermark, but this one (which I shall designate British Bond [B]) is distinguished from British Bond [A] and British Bond [C] by having chainlines.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  In Eliot's correspondence, it appears it was used for sixteen 

<b></b>

letters which date from 13 September 1920 to 30 January 1921, a long period comprising nearly twenty weeks.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  I suspect, however, that "Song" was written at the very end of this period, around 23-30 January 1921. For on 30 January when Eliot wrote to Scofield Thayer, the editor of the <i>Dial,</i> to apologize for the poor quality of a "London Letter" he had sent him only "a week ago," he added a comment about his recent writing: ". . . but remember it is the first writing of any kind that I have done for six months; and therefore it came very hard" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 435). There is every reason to credit Eliot's testimony, and on the basis of it we should assume that "Song" was written not long after his "London Letter," in late January of 1921.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The fourth stratum of materials for <i>The Waste Land</i> marks the beginning of the poem as it was eventually published. It comprises four documents: first, a verse fragment beginning "Those are pearls" (<i>TWL:AF,</i> 122-3), one line from which is then incorporated into the next document; second, the typescript of Part I (<i>TWL:AF,</i> 4-9); third and fourth, the typescript and carbon of Part II (<i>TWL: AF,</i> 10-5, 16-21). All these are found on paper which measures 264 x 203 mm with a thickness of .08 mm. The paper has a watermark reading, "BRITISH BOND | [device: S entwined with B]," which lies horizontally on the leaf and measures 66 x 123 mm. What distinguished this paper from the British Bond paper used in "Song" is that is has no chainlines.

<p>
The "British Bond [C]" paper also appears in seven letters by Eliot from the first half of 1921:

(The letter to Robert McAlmon is incorrectly assigned to 2 May in Mrs. Eliot's edition.) In addition, the same paper appears in the typescript of Eliot's "London Letter: May, 1921" for the <i>Dial,</i> which appeared in the June issue.
</p>

<p>
In his correspondence from this period, Eliot makes three references to his work on the poem. Writing to Sydney Schiff on 3 April, he commented (<i>LOTSE,</i> 444):
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
My poem has still so much revision to undergo that I do not want to let any one see it yet, and also I want to get more of it done&#x02014;it should be much the longest I have ever written. I hope that by June it will be in something like final form. I have not had the freedom of mind.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Nearly three weeks later on 22 April, apparently replying to a query from John Middleton Murry, Eliot observed: "It is true that I have started a poem" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 444). Over two weeks later again, on 9 May 1921, Eliot wrote to John Quinn: "I am not 

<b></b>

anxious to produce another [book of criticism] for a year or two; and meanwhile have a long poem in mind and partly on paper which I am wishful to finish." But there were also problems: "The chief drawback to my present mode of life is the lack of <i>continuous</i> time, not getting more than a few hours together for myself, which breaks the concentration required for turning out a poem of any length" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 451).
</p>

<p>
Given the preponderance of letters of "British Bond [C]" which date from the period between 9 and 22 May, as well as the "London Letter: May 1921," which must have been posted by 1 May or thereabouts, it seems safe to say that the typescripts of Parts I and II were produced during this period, and that they represented a summation of work that had been in progress since March or February, perhaps even the last week of January.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Eliot had good reason for attempting to sum up his work on the poem at just this time: his mother, together with his sister Marian and brother Henry, was due to arrive in England on 10 June, and since he and Vivien were to vacate their flat for them, now was an appropriate time to summarize his progress to date. No doubt there were other autograph drafts and fragments, aside from "Those are pearls," which were jettisoned when Eliot prepared the typescripts in mid-May. How many, we shall see later.
</p>

<p>
Two qualifications need to be added to this account. The first concerns the first leaf of the typescript for part I, "The Burial of the Dead," which portrays several incidents in the course of a drinking binge that takes place one night in Boston. The protagonists go to a vaudeville show, stop in a brothel, and later are saved from being arrested by the police through the intervention of a Mr. Donavan, a respectable citizen who boasts about his influence down at City Hall. The episode loosely recalls the closing portions of the "Circe" episode in <i>Ulysses,</i> with Mr. Donavan playing much the same role as Corny Kelleher. Joyce evidently sent a copy of both the "Oxen of the Sun" and "Circe" episodes to Ezra Pound in April 1921. On 20 April Pound wrote to a friend: "Joyce's new chapter is enormous&#x02014;megaloscrumptious&#x02014;mastodonic." <sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Four days later he reiterated this view to his mother: "Joyce next chapter great stuff." <sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  It is not clear whether Pound forwarded the manuscript to Eliot or Joyce sent it to him independently, though it is far more likely that Pound did so just after 9 May.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Eliot must have read the material quickly, since he returned the manuscript to Joyce on 21 May and commented specifically on what he termed "the Descent into Hell," or "Circe": "I have nothing but admiration; in fact, I wish for my own sake that I had not read it" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 455). The very next day he also wrote to Robert McAlmon, praising "Oxen of the Sun" for its "marvellous parody of nearly every style in English prose from 1600 to the <i>Daily Mail</i>" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 450), and in a letter written the same day to Dorothy Pound he exclaimed: "the unprinted manuscript [of <i>Ulysses</i>] is even finer stuff than the printed" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 456). While the precise chronology of this complex of events is unclear at several points, it seems likely that the Boston incident, typed on a separate leaf, was a late addition to the typescript which had originally begun on leaf two, with "April is the cruellest month." If so, it may explain why what was then the provisional title of the poem as a whole, "He Do the Police in Different Voices," is so conspicuously out of alignment with the block of the text on the first leaf of the typescript. In this scenario, 

<b></b>

both the title for the whole poem and the page numbers of leaves two and three were added when the Boston incident was incorporated into the already existing typescript in late May 1921.
</p>

<p>
That scenario invites a second qualification to our tentative dating of Parts I and II. For if it is true that the first leaf of Part I, the leaf that follows a lead from Joyce in recounting a drinking binge in Boston, was added to the typescript only sometime after 9 May, it follows that the earlier or original version of Part I consisted only of the four verse-paragraphs that we also have in the published poem, the result of Pound's having deleted the drinking episode when he later edited the poem in Paris. That scenario is confirmed by a letter from Wyndham Lewis to Sidney Schiff, the generous patron who was funding the first issue of Lewis's new journal, <i>Tyro</i>. Reporting on his progress in gathering materials for it, on 7 February 1921, Lewis wrote:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Everything is practically now complete . . . Eliot I saw 2 nights ago. He is doing his article apace. He also showed me a new long poem (in 4 parts) which I think will be not only very good, but a new departure for him.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Lewis, we must infer, had seen Part I of <i>The Waste Land</i> in its original state ("in four parts"), before it acquired a fifth part or the beginning scene of the drinking binge which was added three months later, sometime in May 1921. If so, Eliot's progress had been rapid at first. Beginning sometime after 23 January, when he completed his "London Letter" ("the first writing of any kind I have done for six months"), he had already completed Part I much as we have it today by 5 February, when he showed it to Lewis. Distracted by the two essays he was writing for Lewis's <i>Tryo,</i> by another on "Prose and Poetry" for Harold Monro's <i>Chapbook,</i> by two more substantial ones on "Andrew Marvell" and "John Dryden" for the <i>TLS,</i> and by yet another "London Letter" due at the <i>Dial,</i> Eliot progressed slowly in writing Part II during the period from February to April. With the prospect of his mother and family due to arrive on June 10, sometime toward mid-May he summarized his progress so far, preparing the typescript of Parts I and II, and adding a new beginning, the incident of the drinking binge influenced by "Circe," to Part I.

</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Before we address the fifth stratum of materials in the <i>Waste Land</i> manuscripts, we must briefly recall the events which engulfed Eliot in mid-1921, and which shaped the conditions of his writing in this period. On 10 June, Eliot's family arrived in London, where they would stay for ten weeks before leaving on 20 August. Eliot's mother and his older sister Marian stayed in the Eliots' flat at 9, Clarence Gate Gardens, while Eliot and Vivien moved into some portion of a flat taken by Lucy Thayer, sister of Scofield Thayer (editor of the <i>Dial</i>) and a friend of Vivien's since 1915. Eliot's brother Henry, meanwhile, would be lodged in a separate room at 41, Gordon Square.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  But with Vivien still feeling poorly, as she had been since February, it was decided in early July 

<b></b>

that she would go out "to a place in the country on Chichester harbour" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 459), while Henry would leave Gordon Square and join Eliot in the flat at 12, Wigmore Street.
</p>

<p>
It was at this moment, however, that Lady Rothermere first broached a plan for publishing a literary and cultural journal, an idea that eventually led to the creation of the <i>Criterion.</i> In the short term, it threatened considerable correspondence to work out the terms of her support and Eliot's participation, and by mid-July Vivien was called back from the country to help. Now Eliot together with Vivien and his brother Henry were "encamped in an attic with a glass roof" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 461) at Wigmore Street, as Vivien put it, or in "very confined and uncomfortable quarters for three people" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 461), as Eliot put it. There they would stay for the next five weeks until the Eliot family departed. When they left, as we have seen, Henry Eliot took away Eliot's old typewriter, the one he had used since early 1914 at Harvard, and left in its place his own, much newer machine as a present.
</p>

<p>
The Eliots themselves spent yet another week at Wigmore Street and only moved back to Clarence Gate Gardens, the weekend of 27-28 August. Both Eliot and Vivien were increasingly ill. To Mary Hutchinson he wrote on 1 September: "Also I am feeling completely exhausted&#x02014;the departure of my family laid us both out&#x02014;and have had some splitting headaches" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 467). And six days later he reported to Richard Aldington: "My wife has been very ill, we have had to have new consultations, and to make matters worse we have been moving from Wigmore Street back here" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 468). There were also pressing commitments for journalism. In late August he wrote his regular "London Letter: September, 1921," for the <i>Dial,</i> his first essay typed on the new 2.10 machine that Henry had left him. On 16 September he "finished an article, unsatisfactory to myself, on the metaphysical poets" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 469-70), his review of Herbert J. C. Grierson's anthology, <i>Metaphysical Lyrics and Poems of the Seventeenth Century: Donne to Butler,</i> which would appear next month in the <i>Times Literary Supplement.</i><sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  By the end of September Eliot's condition was so poor that Vivien arranged for him to see a "nerve specialist" who promptly advised Eliot to "go straight away for three months complete rest and change and . . . live according to a strict regimen which he has prescribed" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 471). But because plans for the <i>Criterion</i> had now crystallized and called for Eliot to produce a first number in January 1922, he took a further ten days to postpone the journal's planned appearance and wrap up affairs in London. It was during this interval, on 10 October, that Ezra Pound arrived in London, where he stayed for eight days with his mother-in-law, Olivia Shakespeare, at 12, Brunswick Gardens in Kensington. Pound met Eliot on the evening of 12 October (Wednesday), went to Oxford to visit Yeats on 13 October, and reported to his wife Dorothy on 14 October: "Eliot at last ordered away for 3 months&#x02014;he seems rejuvinated [<i>sic</i>] at prospect." <sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Finally, on 15 October Eliot left for Margate, accompanied by Vivien. Vivien stayed with him at the Albemarle Hotel, Cliftonville, for almost two weeks until 31 October, then returned to London, leaving him alone. But already by 26 October she had reported to a friend that Eliot was "getting on <i>amazingly,</i>" looking "younger, and fatter and nicer" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 479). Eliot, in the solitude of a seaside resort grown quiet after its high 

<b></b>

season, stayed for another twelve days, then returned to London late on 12 November.
</p>

<p>
He stayed for less than a week, from 12 to 18 November, when he departed for Paris, again accompanied by Vivien. In Paris they stayed at the Hotel Pas du Calais, 59 rue des Saints P&#x000E8;res, Paris VI, where Ezra and Dorothy Pound had been residing until only a few weeks before. Pound and Eliot certainly met during the brief period when Eliot was still in the city. But it seems unlikely that Pound would have had enough time to go through <i>The Waste Land.</i> Eliot departed for Lausanne, either on 21 or 22 November, leaving Vivien behind in Paris.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  In the weeks ahead she would receive little companionship from the Pounds, who were preoccupied with other matters. On 1 November they had moved into a studio at 70bis, rue Notre Dame des Champs, and Pound was soon busy painting the walls and constructing furniture. More alarmingly, on 13 December Dorothy was hospitalized for an abscess on her left forefinger; it required surgery to cut off the tip of the bone and she remained in the hospital until 27 December.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  In Pound's extensive correspondence Eliot's visit went almost unnoticed, except for one letter written on 5 December to Scofield Thayer: "Eliot seemed fairly well when I saw him on his way through Paris last week." <sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In Lausanne, Eliot stayed at the Hotel St. Luce, a quiet pension, from 24 November until 2 January, when he returned to Paris. Lausanne, he wrote on 4 December, was a "very quiet town, except when children come downhill on scooters over the cobbles. Mostly banks and chocolate shops" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 490). But it was there, amidst "banks and chocolate shops," that Eliot finished his draft of <i>The Waste Land.</i> Now, having set out the parameters of Eliot's movements from June through December of 1921, we can turn to the remaining strata of his manuscripts.

<p class="noIndent">
The fifth stratum of materials for <i>The Waste Land</i> comprises five documents. The first is a single leaf containing two independent poems, both in autograph, "Elegy" and the first draft of "Dirge" (<i>TWL:AF,</i> 116-9). The second is also a single leaf (<i>TWL:AF,</i> 48-9), this one containing a section of verse of twenty-six lines, beginning, "The river sweats." With very light revisions, this becomes lines 266-91 of the published poem. The third document is yet another single leaf (<i>TWL:AF,</i> 50-1) which contains a section of verse of nineteen lines, beginning "Highbury bore me," a draft for two of the three songs of the Thames Daughters. With the excision of ten lines and some further revisions, these become lines 292-9 of the published poem. The fourth document is another single leaf (<i>TWL:AF,</i> 52-3), which contains twelve lines after cancellations, beginning "On Margate Sands." With no revisions at all these became lines 300-311 of the final poem.
</p>

<p>
The fifth and final document is a single leaf (<i>TWL:AF,</i> 36-7) which contains two fragments. One consists of seven lines and begins, "O City, City"; the passage is later lightly revised to become lines 259-65 of the published poem. The other consists of twelve lines and begins, "London the swarming life"; this passage, with further revisions, became lines 106-9 in the typescript of Part III which Eliot will type up later in London, discussed further below.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
All these five documents are written on a distinctive type of paper. Each leaf measures 227 x 177 mm, and has a thickness of 0.11 mm. The paper is wove rather than laid&#x02014;that is, it has no chainlines&#x02014;but has a watermark reading "HIERATICA | BOND | BRITISH MAKE | J. S. &amp; C<sup>O</sup> L<sup>TD</sup>." The watermark is vertical on the leaf, and measures 45 x 48 mm. Hieratica Bond was a popular brand of paper, and it is hardly surprising that other instances of it should turn up in Eliot's correspondence. The first time is in late 1914, but the size is very different (226-7 x 152 mm) and the paper has a printed letterhead reading "Merton College." (<a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>, T.19 and T.23; for the sake of clarity we'll call this paper Hieratica Bond [A].)<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  It also turns up in one letter of August 1918 (<a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>, T.143), but once again the size is very different (224 x 151 mm; we can call this paper Hieratica Bond [B].)<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  And it even turns up a third time in 1919 (<a href="#tab01">Table 1</a>, T.218 and T.222), but this time its size differs more sharply still (178 x 114 mm; we'll call this paper Hieratica Bond [C].<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The fourth time that a Hieratica Bond paper appears in Eliot's correspondence (Hieratica Bond [D]), its size exactly matches that of the five documents we have been discussing. And the dates of its usage are revealing:

Eliot, in other words, begins to use the Hieratic Bond [D] paper in his correspondence in the first letters that he writes after his return from Margate to London. Quite plainly, the paper was part of a small supply which he had purchased while in Margate, the remainder of which he then proceeded to use up while in London. The Hieratica Bond [D] passages, then, were all composed while Eliot was in Margate, an inference which is confirmed by Eliot himself. For while still in Margate he wrote on [4? November] to Sydney Schiff:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

I have done a rough draft of part of part III, but do not know whether it will do, and must wait for Vivien's opinion as to whether it is printable. I have done it while sitting in a shelter on the front&#x02014;as I am out all day except when taking rest. But I have written only some fifty lines.

These passages, then, were plainly the ones that Eliot had in mind when he wrote to Schiff that he had "written only some fifty lines." They were in good enough shape for Eliot to regard them as an identifiable unit: "a rough draft of part of Part III." 
</p>

<p>
But a word of qualification needs to be entered here. Eliot plainly wrote these passages sometime after Vivien left either on 30 or 31 October, since she had not yet seen them, and before he wrote to Schiff. But when did he write to Schiff? Eliot's letter to him is dated simply "Friday evening," and the date of [4? November] is Mrs. Eliot's conjecture. But is this the best conjectural date? Eliot's letter to Schiff complains that Vivien "tells me very little about her own health, in spite of my complaints." The plural "complaints" implies (a) that Eliot has already received several letters or notes from Vivien, and (b) that in reply to them he has already complained at least twice, something it would have been difficult to do in only four days time. Instead it seems more likely that the letter to Schiff should be conjecturally dated to Friday, [11 November], and therefore that the passages in question were written between 31 October, when Vivien left, and 11 November, the most likely date when Eliot addressed Schiff.
</p>

<p>
There are further implications which can be drawn from Eliot's comments to Schiff. We should recall that the four passages that I have listed immediately above do not exhaust the Hieratica Bond [D] documents. Three texts are conspicuously not included in Eliot's account to Schiff: the two independently titled poems, "Dirge" and "Elegy" (both written on one leaf), and the passage beginning, "London, the swarming life" (this last written on the same leaf that contains "O City, City," though separated from it by a line that slashes across the middle of the page). Let us deal first with the independently titled poems. Eliot makes no mention of them to Schiff. It is possible, of course, that he makes no mention of them because they were not yet composed, or, in other words, that they were composed only after he had written to Schiff on 11 November, and before he returned to London on 12 November. But that seems rather unlikely. And if they were not composed after the Schiff letter, if instead they were composed before, then Eliot's decision not to mention them carries the implication that the independent poems "Elegy" and "Dirge" were not viewed as part of the long poem which he had been discussing with Schiff since April, but were conceived as independent works. I suspect that this was the case, and there is further evidence for it in the way that Eliot treats the independent poems. For Eliot never mines them for lines or passages to be inserted into <i>The Waste Land.</i> Instead, they are conceived as having their own integrity. And this treatment differs sharply from how he treats the poems and passages contained in the first two strata of materials which date from October 1913 ("After the turning," and "So through the evening"), mid-April 1915 ("The Death of St. Narcissus), and September 1916 ("The Death of the Duchess"). 

<b></b>

These, though originally conceived as independent or potentially independent works, were now in 1921 considered simply raw material from which lines and passages might be wrested&#x02014;quite differently from the independent poems which Eliot wrote in the course of 1921, such as "Dirge" and "Elegy," or later "Exequy." Those poems, written contemporaneously with the drafts of <i>The Waste Land,</i> were a concession to Eliot's concern that his long poem might not be long enough to make up a book, and they were intended to do just that&#x02014;make up a book. In effect, their place was later assumed by the notes to the poem.
</p>

<p>
The third text not mentioned in the letter to Schiff is the twelve-line passage, beginning "London, the swarming life," written on the same leaf that contains "O City, City." Unlike the independent poems, which were neither incorporated into the larger poem nor treated as raw material from which individual lines or passages might be wrested, this passage was incorporated, with alterations, into the typescript draft of Part III (and its carbon) that Eliot would produce the next week while in London (<i>TWL:AF</i>, 30-1 and 42-3, lines 106-19). Why was it not mentioned to Schiff? There are two possible reasons. The first is that Eliot was describing a coherent "part of Part III," the section that would become Part III's conclusion and stretch across lines 259-311 of the published poem. Since "London, the swarming life" formed no part of that coherent section, there was no need to mention it. At the moment he was writing to Schiff, it was simply a fragment that might or might not be later incorporated into Part III, too trifling an affair to announce to a devoted reader and friend. The second possibility is that it simply had not yet been composed. On that hypothesis, it was written still later, sometime during the span of six days when Eliot was back in London (12-8 November), hurriedly preparing the typescripts of Part III, hastily packing for Lausanne. Possible, but not very likely. Better to assign it to the period between 31 October and 11 November, with the other Margate or Hieratica Bond [D] materials.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The sixth stratum of manuscript materials for the <i>The Waste Land</i> consists of two typescripts of Part III, a top copy and a carbon (each five leaves); one independent poem titled "Exequy" (one leaf), which is also in typescript; and an autograph draft of ten lines, beginning "The rivers tent is broken," which has been written on the verso of leaf one of the typescript Part III. For the moment we can set this last text aside and deal with the other three documents. All three documents are preserved on the same kind of paper, which measures 265 x 202 or 203 mm, and has a thickness of 0.06 mm. The paper has eight chainlines, which are vertical, at intervals of 25.5 mm. It also has a watermark reading: "VERONA LINEN." It measures 14 x 128 mm.

<p>
Dating the typescript copies of Part III presents little difficulty. Incorporated into both is the fourteen-line passage, beginning "London, the swarming life" (<i>TWL:AF</i>, 30-1 and 42-3, lines 106-19) which Eliot had recently drafted in Margate, the passage preserved in autograph draft on the same leaf as the "O City, City" passage (<i>TWL:AF,</i> 37). The typescripts, therefore, can only have been produced <i>after</i> the Margate or Hieratica Bond [D] passage, and can only have been produced when Eliot had access to the new, 2.10 typewriter which Henry Eliot had given to him as a gift when he left England on 20 August. That dovetails with what we already know: that Eliot did not 

<b></b>

have access to his typewriter when in Margate, since the eight letters and the Hieratica Bond [D] passages and poems which he wrote there were all written by hand. It follows that these typescripts were produced in the brief interval between Eliot's stays in Margate and Lausanne, the period of little less than a week, from 12 to 18 November, when Eliot was in London again and had access to his typewriter. It is most likely that the independent poem, "Exequy," was also typed up during the same period.
</p>

<p>
Having dated these typescripts to the six-day period when Eliot was back in London, or between his stays in Margate and Lausanne, we can also discern the broad arc of Eliot's intentions in producing them. Knowing that he would be away in Lausanne for some six weeks, and planning to make a final effort to bring his long poem to completion, Eliot was assembling a working version of the materials he had so far written, a neatly typed "working draft" which he could consult while in Lausanne. Not that Eliot managed to fulfil his good intentions: he plainly failed to type up the autograph leaves which form the fifth or Margate stratum of materials for <i>The Waste Land</i> (apart from the passage "London, the swarming life"), those that correspond to the closing portion of Part III of the published poem (lines 259-311). Most likely he simply didn't have enough time.
</p>

<p>
While we can pinpoint the moment when these typescripts were produced, and integrate that knowledge into a coherent account of Eliot's travel and writing plans, we can only speculate about when Eliot first wrote the rough drafts which he must have used (and then jettisoned) as he produced the typescripts of Part III and "Exequy." When were they written? Not, plainly, during the Margate period from 15 October to 12 November, when he was writing the autograph drafts ("O City, City," "The river sweats," "Highbury bore me," and "On Margate Sands") and the independent poems ("Dirge," "Elegy") which we have already discussed. The rough drafts that went into making the typescript of Part III must date from earlier. In fact, there are really only two periods possible: one, the period from 20 August to 15 October which followed his family's departure for the United States; the other, the period from 10 June to 20 August when his family was visiting and he was staying at Wigmore Street. The later period, 20 August to 15 October, seems less likely. Eliot was busy moving back into his flat from 20 August to 27-28 August, occupied with typing up his "London Letter: September 1921" for the <i>Dial</i> in early September, pressed with writing "The Metaphysical Poets" in mid-September, obliged to visit the Woolfs in late September, and worried by his health and hastily planned departure for Margate from 1-14 October. It is more likely that he wrote the rough drafts that went into the typescript of Part III during the ten weeks when his family was visiting, a lengthy period (10 June to 20 August) when he was wholly free from his regular round of social obligations, the dutiful visits to Mary Hutchinson, the Woolfs, the Schiffs, and Richard Aldington. Though we cannot be certain, this period is the more likely candidate.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we must turn to the passage that we momentarily set aside, the autograph draft of ten lines beginning "The rivers tent is broken" (<i>TWL:AF,</i> 24-5) which is found on the verso side of leaf one in the "Fire Sermon" typescript, the top copy. These lines are, of course, the famous opening to Part III of <i>The Waste Land.</i> It is possible that 

<b></b>

they were drafted contemporaneously with the production of the typescript, the period between 12 and 18 November before Eliot left for Lausanne. And if so, they would have been thought of as a fragment awaiting some future destination. But such a scenario defies what little we know of Eliot's compositional practices at this time: if his comments to Sydney Schiff are indicative, he wrote with the idea in mind that a new draft would form part of something already in progress or definitely planned, "a rough draft of part of Part III," for example, rather than just writing for the sake of writing. Yet if that is true, then it is much more likely that he wrote what would later become the beginning of Part III only when he was actually in need of a beginning to Part III. That was hardly the case when he was back in London from 12 to 18 November. Then he had a firm, perhaps even too firm, beginning for Part III:
</p>

(<i>TWL:AF,</i> 22-3)

</div>

<p class="noIndent">
Moreover, Eliot believed that the seventy-two-line passage about Fresca formed the beginning to Part III not just when he was briefly in London from 12 to 18 November, but during the entire time when he was in Lausanne, from 22 November till 2 January, so much so that while there he even drafted another passage of seventeen lines, "From which, a Venus Anadyomene" (<i>TWL:AF,</i> 28-9), that was to be inserted into the Fresca passage between lines 56 and 57. By now, of course, it will be obvious that Eliot needed a beginning for Part III only after Pound, in Paris, had repeatedly run his pen downward across the entire Fresca passage, with nine swift gashes, one so deep that it scored the paper and allowed the ink to bleed through to the verso side. Appropriately, it is on that very verso, and literally right on top of the ink left by Pound's pen, that Eliot wrote "The rivers tent is broken." For when in Paris, as we shall see in more detail below, Eliot lacked paper and had to borrow some from Pound. To write a new beginning to Part III, then, he used the only paper to hand, the discarded old beginning to Part III. In short, Eliot wrote this passage in Paris, probably between 5 and 10 January. It was the last passage that he composed for <i>The Waste Land,</i> wedged into the middle of the poem, and preserved in a documentary stratum that antedated its composition by two months.
</p>

<p>
The challenge posed by the passage beginning "The rivers tent is broken" throws into relief a potential problem which until now has remained only latent, a tension between the poem's documentary stratification and its compositional stratification. That tension surfaces only twice among the <i>Waste Land</i> manuscripts, both times within the sixth documentary stratum which we have just discussed. It surfaces here, with "The rivers tent is broken," and it surfaces again with the two typescripts for Part III which, though typed between 12 and 18 November in London, were clearly written earlier (between 10 June and 20 August, in my view). For the moment we need not tease at the implications of that tension, since it has no practical consequences for dating the prepublication manuscripts.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The seventh stratum of materials for <i>The Waste Land</i> consists of four documents: the autograph fair copies of Parts IV and V of the poem (<i>TWL:AF,</i> 54-61 and 70-9); an autograph fair copy of the independent poem "Dirge" (<i>TWL:AF,</i> 120); and an autograph passage of seventeen lines, beginning "From which, a Venus Anadyomene" (<i>TWL:AF,</i> 28-9), which was inserted into the Fresca episode that originally began Part III.
</p>

<p>
All four are written on paper which measures 270-71 x 208 mm and has a thickness of 0.06 mm. The paper is wove, and so without chainlines. It also lacks a watermark. It has however, a distinctive pattern of violet quadrules: the horizontal lines, which begin 21 mm from the top edge of the leaf, consist of twenty-seven lines that occupy a block of space that measures 234 mm, and come to an end 16 mm from the bottom edge of the leaf (or: 21.234.16). The paper is not of the quality which Eliot normally used in his correspondence. It should be no surprise, then, that it appears in only one letter, a note from Eliot to Sydney Schiff, dated 19 December 1921 and written when Eliot was in Lausanne. As scholars have long suspected, these materials were composed between 21-22 November, the date when Eliot left for Lausanne, and 2 January, the date when he returned to Paris with the sheaf of manuscripts which Ezra Pound would now edit.
</p>

<p>
The eighth stratum of materials for <i>The Waste Land</i> consists of two documents, the typescripts for Parts IV and V of the poem (<i>TWL:AF,</i> 62-9 and 82-9). The paper used in each is briefly described in <a href="#tab04">Table 4</a> (to be published in <i>Revisiting "The Waste Land"</i>), an account that need not be repeated here. The papers do not match any found in Eliot's letters, and for an obvious reason: we have no surviving letters from Eliot for the period between 25 December 1921 and 20 January 1922, and it is very likely that these papers were simply borrowed from Ezra Pound. The violet typewriter ribbon and the large sized typewriter (its individual characters are 2.54 in width) are recognizably those of Ezra Pound. There can be no doubt that these typescripts were prepared in Paris sometime between 2 January 1922, when Eliot arrived from Lausanne, and 16 January, when he left Paris to return to London. It is reasonable to infer that the typescript was made early in the visit, between 2 and 5 January.
</p>

<p>
Because we are tracing both the compositional and documentary strata of the pre-publication materials, we must devise an additional or ninth stratum here to account for the ten-line passage beginning "The rivers tent is broken." Composed by Eliot to serve as a new beginning for Part III after Pound had removed the entire Fresca passage, it represents the last stretch of continuous writing that Eliot did for <i>The Waste Land.</i>
</p>

<p>
The tenth and final stratum of materials for <i>The Waste Land</i> consists of a single typescript leaf, which contains the poem's title and an epigraph from Joseph Conrad's <i>The Heart of Darkness.</i> The paper measures 263 x 203 mm, and has a thickness of 0.06 mm. It has eight chainlines, which are vertical, at intervals of 25.5 mm. It also has a watermark ("VERONA LINEN") that measures 14 x 128 mm. The same type of paper appears in two letters by Eliot from January 1922: one, dated 20 January 1922, addressed to Scofield Thayer (T.391, <i>LOTSE,</i> 501), the other dated [26 January 1922] to Ezra Pound (T.394, <i>LOTSE,</i> 504).<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The second of these is the most important, for it replies to a letter that Pound had written two days earlier on "24 Saturnus," or January (<i>LOTSE,</i> 497-9), in which he had commented: "I doubt if Conrad is weighty enough to stand the citation." In his reply of [26 January], Eliot asked: "Do you mean not use Conrad quot. or simply not put Conrad's name to it? It is much the most appropriate I can find, and somewhat elucidative" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 504). Though Pound's response was diffident ("Do as you like . . . re the Conrad; who am I to grudge him his laurel crown" [<i>LOTSE,</i> 505]), Eliot decided to jettison the epigraph by Conrad and find another. All of which makes clear that the single leaf which we have been discussing, containing the Conrad epigraph and the title of the poem, was the topmost sheet of the nineteen-page manuscript seen by Pound on 24 January, containing the penultimate version of <i>The Waste Land.</i> It had never formed part of the materials which Pound saw in Paris between 2 and 15 January, 1922, nor was it part of that nebulous entity which recent scholars have called "the 1921 text." It was typed between 16 January, the day Eliot returned to London, and 20 January 1922, the day he probably sent the typescript off to Pound. Sadly, the rest of the famous nineteen-page manuscript has never been found, and was probably discarded by Eliot when he made a final draft of the poem sometime after 30 January; but if the missing manuscript ever does turn up, we can be sure that it will have been typed with the same 2.10 machine which Henry Eliot had left behind on 20 August 1921, and that it will be on paper bearing the "Verona Linen" watermark.

<p class="noIndent">
The creation of the title page for a penultimate version of the poem marked only a passing moment in the protracted conclusion to the poem's genesis. Even after Eliot returned to London on 16 January, his manuscripts now bearing Pound's editorial 

<b></b>

interventions, the poem had still not assumed the shape we know today. Writing on 20 January to Scofield Thayer, the editor of the <i>Dial,</i> to offer him the poem for publication, Eliot briefly characterized his new work as "a poem of about four hundred and fifty lines, <i>in four parts</i>" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 502; emphasis added). Remarkable as it seems to us, Eliot was planning to issue the poem without Part IV. Six days later, however, when writing again to Pound on [26 January], Eliot had second thoughts, asking: "Perhaps better omit Phlebas also???" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 504). Pound replied with characteristic vigor: "I DO advise keeping Phlebas. In fact I more'n advise. Phlebas is an integral part of the poem; the card pack introduces him, the drowned phoen. sailor, and he is needed ABSoloootly where he is. Must stay in" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 505).
</p>

<p>
For Eliot, at least, the decision to retain Part IV effectively marked the end of his actively composing the poem, a process that had required just over a year of time, from the final days of January 1921, when he had first begun the draft of Part I that he soon showed to Wyndham Lewis, to the final days of January 1922, when he was absorbing the last admonitions of Ezra Pound. Indeed, in contemporary letters Eliot repeatedly alluded to the length of time it had taken him to write the poem. When Scofield Thayer offered him $150 for the poem (sight unseen), Eliot refused because the sum "did not strike me as good pay for a year's work" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 507); he had no intention of accepting such a re "for a poem which it has taken me a year to write" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 515). The yearlong saga of the poem had indeed reached its end. But the story of its coda, the composition of the notes, was just beginning.
</p>

<p>
Even after he had acceded to Pound's demand that the ten lines of "Phlebas" or Part IV be restored, Eliot still faced a nagging problem which had intermittently troubled him throughout the time when he had been composing <i>The Waste Land.</i> The poem was too short to make up an independent book. Worse still, Pound had vetoed the idea of including what Eliot called the "miscellaneous pieces" (three independent poems, "Song," "Exequy," and either "Dirge" or "Elegy"), or what Pound termed "Those at end" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 504). Moreover, Eliot's concern over this question had been exacerbated by that of an eminent authority, the American publisher Horace Liveright. Back in January 1922, when Eliot had first returned to Paris from Lausanne, he had been introduced by Pound to Liveright, who was traveling in France and England in search of new authors. Liveright had promptly agreed to offer Eliot a $150 advance for the poem and a royalty of 15%, largely on Pound's recommendation, as he hadn't yet read the poem. But already on 11 January Liveright, by then in London, had written to Pound about his concern over the poem's length: "I'm disappointed that Eliot's material is as short. Can't he add anything?" he pleaded with Pound, who doubtless relayed his worry to Eliot, then still in Paris.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
It was Liveright's suggestion that Eliot "add anything" which ultimately led Eliot to furnish the poem with notes. While they might not make the poem long enough to suit Liveright, they would suffice to make up a small volume which could be published as a deluxe or limited edition in the event that Liveright balked. On 16 February, having learnt from his friend Conrad Aiken about Maurice Firuski, a publisher of deluxe editions who was situated in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Eliot wrote to pursue this prospect:

<b></b>

</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Your name has been given me by Conrad Aiken . . . I understand that you issue these books in limited editions, and that for the volumes you take in this series you give a sum down in advance royalty.
<p class="blockquote">
My poem is of 435 lines; with certain spacings essential to the sense, 475 book lines; furthermore, it consists of five parts, which would increase the space necessary; and with title pages, some notes that I intend to add, etc., I guess that it would run to from 28 to 32 pages.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
But Firuski was slow to reply, and by 12 March Liveright had confirmed his interest in publishing the poem as a book. When Liveright finally sent him a contract in mid-June, however, Eliot was alarmed at the vagueness of its terms and turned to John Quinn, the New York lawyer and cultural patron who had generously handled Eliot's contracts with his previous American publisher, Knopf, without charging a fee. To Quinn, therefore, he wrote describing his new work: "I have written . . . a long poem of about 450 words [lines], which, with notes that I am adding, will make a book of 30 to 40 pages" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 530). Even now, four months after his letter to Firuski, Eliot had still not completed the poem's notes, and at best had begun "adding" them. But "with notes that I am adding" may well have been more a pious aspiration than a statement of fact, and as late as mid-June 1922, Eliot may not have written even a portion of the poem's notes.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the deadline for submission of a final manuscript, if the book were to be included in the autumn list, was fast approaching: "Liveright said he would print it for the autumn if he had the poem by the end of July" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 531). When Liveright, around 9 July, sent Eliot a letter suggesting that he was amenable to the revised contract that Quinn had proposed in the interim, Eliot hurriedly addressed the problem of a typescript in a letter to John Quinn, dated 19 July:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
As it is now so late I am enclosing the typescript to hand to him when the contract is complete, or to hold if he does not complete. I had wished to type it out fair, but I did not wish to delay it any longer. This will do for him to get on with, and I shall rush forward the notes to go at the end.

<p class="noIndent">
If Eliot really had begun "adding" the notes in mid-June, he must have proceeded very slowly if he hadn't finished by mid-July. Plainly it was a task he approached with diffidence, even indifference.
</p>

<p>
When Ezra Pound requested a copy of the poem in order to show it to James Sibley Watson, Jr., the co-owner of the <i>Dial</i> who had been entrusted with negotiating for the serial rights to the poem after Eliot had quarrelled with his colleague Scofield Thayer, Eliot replied on 28 July: "I will let you have a copy of the Waste Land for confidential use as soon as I can make one. Of the two available copies, one has gone to Quinn to present to Liveright on completion of the contact, and the other is the only one I possess" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 552). If this second copy of the poem was an exact replica of the copy sent to Liveright, it too lacked the notes. Though we cannot be entirely certain, it appears that the notes were not completed until early August, and that they were then posted directly to Liveright. Only then was <i>The Waste Land</i> completed in the form that we know it today.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
By 15 September Eliot could tell Pound, in a brief postscript to a letter about other matters: "Liveright's proof is excellent" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 570). Eliot was much less happy, instead, with the printer who produced the <i>Criterion</i> version of the poem in London. To Richard Cobden-Sanderson he wrote on 27 September, "I am also sending you the manuscript and the proof of the first part of my poem, so that you may have a record of the undesired alterations made by the printers" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 574). And on 3 October Eliot wrote him again: "You will see that I am enclosing the corrected proof of the rest of <i>The Waste Land.</i> I shall ring you up tomorrow morning at about eleven and will explain why I have done so" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 576). But at last the long travails of the poem were drawing to a close. Two weeks later the first number of the <i>Criterion</i> appeared, on 16 October, containing the first publication of <i>The Waste Land,</i> without notes. Publication of the poem in the <i>Dial,</i> an American magazine, took place a few days later. Five weeks after that, about 1 December, the poem appeared for the first time as an independent book, complete with notes, issued by the American firm of Boni and Liveright.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>

Most of the pre-publication manuscripts for <i>The Waste Land</i> are typescript and autograph fair copies, rather than drafts, documents which Eliot assembled from extant drafts in anticipation of a turning point in his private life (Parts I and II in May before the arrival of his family in June; the typescript of Part III between 12 and 18 November, prior to leaving for Lausanne). Drafts, instead, can tell us more about the process of composition. If we set aside the materials produced prior to February 1921, or strata 1 to 3, then we have only seven or eight autograph drafts extant: seven if we think, as Mrs. Eliot does, that "Highbury bore me" and "On Margate Sands" formed a single draft; eight if we think, as I am inclined, that these were separate drafts. If we arrange them in order by their length, from shortest to longest, and then note how many lines from each draft were retained in the final poem, the result would look like this:

Whether these res represent seven or eight drafts, it remains remarkable how short was a typical draft by Eliot: 13.7 lines in length if they represent seven drafts, 

<b></b>

only 12 lines if they represent eight. Morever, since on average only two thirds of a draft typically survived into the published text, it is equally remarkable how many drafts it would have required to make a poem of 433 lines. If the 63 lines that have survived into the final poem represent seven drafts, it would have required 48 drafts. (These calculations suggest that between forty to fifty drafts were lost or discarded during composition.) The trick in writing such a long poem, then, was how to stitch together between 48 and 55 separate drafts. Connectedness, plainly, was a pressing problem.
</p>

<p>
Of the seven drafts that survive (henceforth we shall follow Mrs. Eliot's view that "Highbury bore me" and "On Margate Sands" are a single draft), one went into the making of Part I ("Those are pearls"), while the other six all went into Part III. Of those six, we recall that four were composed in Margate between 31 October and 11 November, and that three were already conceived as forming a "part of Part III" by [11? November] when Eliot described them to Sydney Schiff&#x02014;"O City, City" (<i>TWL:AF,</i> 36-7), "The river sweats" (<i>TWL:AF,</i> 48-9), and "Highbury bore me" (<i>TWL:AF,</i> 50-3). Together they make up lines 259-311 of the poem as published and form the conclusion to Part III. What unites the three is an associative logic dictated by motifs of music and the river, both fused (after line 266) by the ghostly echo of Wagner's Rhein-maidens, now the Thames-daughters. For our purpose, we needn't tease out all the possible implications of these passages, which are the subject of considerable debate.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Instead we want to stay close to the surface of the poem, to the associative logic and syntactic patterning which shape the flow of composition. The first of the three passages starts up just after the loveless coupling of the young man carbuncular and the unnamed typist, a scene followed by two lines that quote from <i>The Tempest</i> (already quoted in Part I), then surge eastward across the cityscape of London, as if traveling from the flat of the typist toward the heart of the financial district, the City (already invoked in Part I):

Now the poem resumes with a new draft:

<div class="indent">
<img src="thumb/12.1rainey01.gif" alt="draft image" width="402" height="196" />
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
What is striking in this draft is the repeated tension among three conflicting imperatives: the ambition to assert connectedness to earlier parts of the poem (and especially 

<b></b>

to earlier passages in Part III) through either repeated images or syntactic and aural patterning; a countervailing tendency to turn away or digress into new subject matter that threatens to prove a dead end; and a discernible worry that the assertion of connectedness will be too obvious. The phrase "I have heard and hear," for example, resolutely recalls "But at my back from time to time I hear" (a line that appears twice in the earlier portions of Part III), but is also vexed by the need to be different, to avoid mere repetition.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  When not working to establish external connectedness to previous portions of the poem, local revisions enhance an assertion of internal relatedness within the draft passage itself: the word "Beside" replaces "Outside" so as to reiterate the plosives of "public bar" and "pleasant," while "there" (in "there the walls of Magnus Martyr") must give way to "where" so as to create exact syntactic repetition ("Where fishmen lounge" and "where the walls"). Yet this way of proceeding also courts the risk of too much repetition, of being rather too obvious in its way of asserting relatedness, a dilemma that is played out in the last line of the "O City, City" passage: the phrase "inviolable music" obviously echoes the "inviolable voice" of the nightingale in Part II&#x02014;much too obviously, we want to say. And so it must be deleted, to be replaced instead with "Inexplicable splendour," a phrase which reinforces aural connectedness with the preceding lines (still three more plosives), but which is no longer too obvious in reinforcing the motif of music. "Inexplicable splendour" now harks back to "inviolable voice," but in a very muted way, having changed the ground of likeness from an auditory to a visual register. So muted, in fact, that the passage effectively reaches an impasse: for if one risk that attended this passage had been the danger that it might become too obvious in emphasizing music ("inviolable music"), the other was that it would simply trail off to nowhere, twist away into a dead end, turning into a "withered stump" of composition, we might say. And so it does. True, a very marvelous "withered stump"&#x02014;but still a "withered stump." And the passage comes to an end. There is no choice now except to begin again, which is precisely what Eliot will do in his next draft.
</p>

<p>
And just as we see these procedures at work at a micro-level, so they can also be discerned at a macro-level. For when Eliot completes the three drafts that now form the ending to Part III, with their insistent stress on music, the river, and nymphs or watery semi-deities (the Thames-daughters), the conclusion isn't just good, it is too good: it seems strangely unrelated to Part III's opening, the seventy-odd lines of acerbic couplets that depict the wealthy socialite Fresca. The only solution is to force the Fresca passage into having more relatedness with the conclusion, and that is just what Eliot does in the draft that he subsequently writes in Lausanne. As before, the point of connection must be water, and so Eliot puts a large asterisk and the command "insert" directly opposite a passage about Fresca's reading habits, her immersion "in a soapy sea / of Symonds- Walter Pater- Vernon Lee." Once more he begins, this time transforming Fresca into a version of Venus rising from the sea:
</p>

And so it continues for another thirteen lines, all in what Pound called the "too loose" manner of Eliot's pastiche of Pope (<i>TWL:AF</i>, 38-9). (The image of Venus Anadyomene even furnishes a neat echo of the "gilded shell" in which Elizabeth and Leicester sail, in the Thames-daughters' song.) But our concern here is not with the passage's success or failure, but with the kind of order which is dictating the composition of the poem: that order is fundamentally contingent and retrospective. It is not, in other words, an order being achieved as the realization of a plan or program, dictated by some predetermined notion of mythic structure or ritual pattern; what <i>The Waste Land</i> achieves are always relative and incremental orders of coherence that are local, contingent, and retrospective in nature.
</p>

<p>
Which brings us to the last of the six drafts written for Part III, the draft written so late it is effectively the final extended passage of the poem, penciled in only after Pound had gutted the eighty-seven lines devoted to Fresca. As before when drafting "From which, a Venus Anadyomene," Eliot starts with the same givens inherited from his earlier composition of the ending to Part III, music, the river, and nymphs or watery semi-deities:

<p class="noIndent">
In one sense, this passage does exactly what it was meant to do: it "anticipates" the City location, the motifs of music and song, and the nymphs (or Thames-daughters) that appear at Part III's end. Its diction resonates with calculated echoes that extend both backwards and forwards, with "clutch" looking back to Part I ("What are the roots that clutch?" line 19), or "brown," glancing not only back to a line in Part I ("Unreal City, / Under the brown fog . . .," lines 60-1) but also ahead to its repetition in Part III ("Unreal City / Under the brown fog . . .," lines 207-8), and still further ahead to the brown tones that dominate the opening of Part V ("the sandy road" [332], "the mountains of rock" [334], the "mudcracked houses" [345] and "dry grass" [355]) and culminate in the mysterious re "gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded" . And because this new introduction so closely "anticipates" the terms of Part III's conclusion, Part III now acquires an envelope, circular, or ring structure in which music, nymphs, and City location appear at both the beginning and the end, a structure that all the more firmly sets off the little five-line coda which has been excluded from the circle's interior and so contrasts all the more violently with, and comments all the more damningly on, what has come before it:

</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Surely it does. Surely the desolating power of the coda has only been enhanced by the new introduction to Part III. And yet many readers, I think, may still deem the introduction to Part III a bit forced, a tad strained. And signs of such strain are all too readily detected: why is that we are being asked to bid farewell to nymphs who, until this point in the poem, have never appeared? How can we say "good-bye" before we've managed to mutter "hello"? And doesn't this transparent rupture in logical-causal relatedness work to undermine the very assertion of connectedness which this passage was meant to achieve through the use of anticipatory repetition? Or is it perhaps the other way around? For isn't it the case that the factitious use of repetition to intimate connectedness, say at the beginning and ending of Part III, works to disable, to neutralize, to annihilate the claims to logical and spatio-temporal connectedness which are elsewhere being asserted, say in the line "and along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street" , that line which was to transport us from the flat of the typist to the locale of the City? Such attention to the demands of the cityscape, and to an implied logic of spatio-temporal coordination, is rendered otiose by the competing claims of a wholly different kind of order that is organized around the use of repetition and pattern to suggest symbolic depth, resonance, and development. The outcome is something of a standoff: the incremental moments of coherence which <i>The Waste Land</i> fashions are not only local, contingent, and retrospective in nature, they are also driven by conflicting imperatives derived from their claim to modes of coherence&#x02014;one appealing to repetition and pattern to invoke symbolic depth, resonance, enhancement; the other appealing to the kind of logical, causal, and spatio-temporal connectedness typical of narrative&#x02014;that are deeply contradictory, perhaps even self-cancelling.
</p>

<p>
Yet that self-cancelling quality is not solely or strictly an effect of juxtaposition. Consider the tensions at play in one especially notable instance of repetition and patterning which spins around the phrase "Unreal City" that turns up with artful symmetry in Parts I, III, and V:

Pattern, in this stunning sequence, dissolves into something that resembles patter &#x02014;the schemata of a list, that lowest of all literary forms, unorganized by any syntax; a bare heap lacking even the leaf of a comma. Surely repetition and pattern have been invoked in this sequence of passages; but just as surely they have also been undermined in a histrionics of non-relationship. "Unreal City / Under the brown fog of . . .": that phrase, we are led to infer, has somewhat the same status as the "inviolable music" which flickered into view when Eliot was drafting the "O City, City" passage. It is obvious, the poem seems to say, it is too obvious. And the effect is wickedly corrosive, for it also decomposes the claim to connectedness and resonance advanced by the repetition of "brown"&#x02014;the "brown land," the "sandy road," or the "brown mantle, hooded." Here are likenesses, the poem murmurs, but likenesses that only turn into illusions. So perhaps the real work of signifying, we reason, is being done somewhere else: perhaps there, in that grim catalogue of toponyms, or in the kind of spatio-temporal connectedness which place names imply, connectedness that is a property both of realistic fiction and our sense of the world to which such fiction lays claim. But of course, we have already traveled "along the Strand, up Queen Victoria Street" once before, and we have seen where that led.

Here is pattern and repetition&#x02014;and with a vengeance. As sentence after sentence uncoils, new modes of syntactic and lexical patterning spring into shape, creating recognizable if evanescent zones of coherence.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  No one, after all, can miss the five participial constructions that set off the line-endings in lines 1-6, or the insistent use of six adjective-noun pairings ("cruellest month," "dull roots," "spring rain," forgetful snow," "little life," and "dried tubers"). A second and overlapping zone of coherence springs up at line five with the appearance of the poem's first pronoun, an "us" first echoed and then elaborated in lines eight, nine, and thirteen before giving way to "me"  and "I" (15, 18). Still a third zone, overlapping with the second, looms into view at line eight, stretching to at least line thirteen and typified by words that are either German ("Starnbergersee," "Hofgarten") or associated with a German-speaking area, the former Austria-Hungary ("archduke"). While yet a fourth zone, overlapping again with both the second and third, begins to materialize at line ten with the conjunction "and," which is artfully reiterated at lines eleven (two times), thirteen, fifteen, sixteen and eighteen. And we might identify still other tonal zones within this verse paragraph&#x02014;the gnomic sobriety of the opening or the conversational banality of the closing, separated by the uneasy oscillations of the middle&#x02014;while we would certainly agree that a semantic vein that concerns the seasons flickers across the entire verse paragraph: "April" , "spring"  "winter" , "summer" , "winter" . Yet one may legitimately wonder why should there be no "autumn" in this catalogue of the seasons, if catalogue it be; or why the catalogue follows no discernible order. And is the winter that occurs in "Winter kept us warm, covering / earth in forgetful snow" really identical with the one that occurs in "I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter"? The one is oracular; the other, insipid. Yet the effect of their conjunction is devastating: for here repetition functions not to intensify semantic likeness, but to eviscerate it. Likeness, again, is giving way to illusion. And indeed, a similar movement occurs over the paragraph's entire trajectory, which begins by intoning a pattern of oracular solemnity, but ends by reporting empty patter&#x02014;those final spasms of vacant thought, twitching like the limbs of a dying animal.
</p>

<p>
The problem, then, is not in recognizing the syntactic and lexical repetitions that unfold in the opening verse paragraph. If anything, they are not just discernible, but are too readily discernible. Five participial constructions; six adjective-noun pairings; eight first-person pronouns; six instances of the conjunction <i>and</i>&#x02014;in only eighteen lines? Their obviousness seems to urge their unimportance; it is not here that the poem is 

<b></b>

doing the real work of offering an account of the world. And that impression is reinforced by another: the assertions of connectedness may be remarkably insistent, but the connectedness itself isn't really vivid; it remains inert and extraneous, like so much scaffolding erected around a building that remains obstinately and mysteriously invisible. (Even today, eighty years after the poem was first published, critics disagree about that building's shape or how many rooms it contains, still divided over how many speakers are voicing these lines.) As zones of coherence loom into sight and recede, like ghosts who beckon us down darkened paths that repeatedly issue in dead ends, they insinuate that the poem's real reckoning with the world must be happening elsewhere: perhaps in the intersection and overlap of those evanescent zones; or in the interchange of oracular solemnity and blinding banality; or in the overall play of opacity and transparency. Or perhaps somewhere else altogether.
</p>

<p>
Critics have not, of course, been slow to respond to that insinuation. After all, one "somewhere else" is quite explicitly indicated in the first note which immediately follows the poem proper: "Not only the title, but the plan and a good deal of the incidental symbolism of the poem were suggested by . . ." But surely this is just one more dead end, perhaps the deadest of them all. <i>The Waste Land</i> has as much to do with Grail legends and vegetation rituals as <i>Ulysses</i> has with the rickety schema that Joyce concocted as he neared the end of his masterpiece. Both writers, as publication approached, worried their works might seem too disordered, too structureless for contemporary readers and critics, and both responded by hinting that the work was governed by an arcane logic that could be reconstructed "by any who think such elucidation of the poem worth the trouble." But the core of <i>The Waste Land</i> is not to be found in the turgid speculations of Jessie Weston, nor in the pseudo-arcana of vegetation rituals.
</p>

<p>
Critics have also been fond of turning the poem into a narrative in which there is a "protagonist" or (in more Grail-inflected versions) "quester" who, in some mysterious way, moves through the poem's scenes. And there is a sense in which this responds, however crudely, to one aspect of the poem. Although much attention has been given to Pound's role in cutting out three major narratives from the draft poem (from Parts I, III, and IV), not enough has been given to his insistence that the final ten lines of the original Part IV be retained as an independent part. Pound was typically laconic when explaining his view, offering a rationale that borders on tautology. "Phlebas is an integral part of the poem; the card pack introduces him, the drowned phoen. sailor, and he is needed ABSoloootly where he is" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 505). Yet his appeal to the cards dealt out by Madame Sosostris is suggestive, for it implies that he assigned her and the card pack a certain degree of authority. Threadbare authority, perhaps, but enough for the needs of the poem. "She must," one critic has observed, "provide the dots that the rest of the poem must connect into a semblance of plot."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  This is a perceptive account, provided we understand that its key word is really <i>semblance,</i> to be taken in the strong sense as "an assumed or unreal appearance of something; mere show." What <i>The Waste Land</i> needed wasn't plot or narrative coherence, but the likeness of a plot, one that would instantly dissolve into illusion. For it requires only a moment to recall that Madame Sosostris is a charlatan, or that the drowned Phoenician sailor isn't even a card in 

<b></b>

the traditional Tarot pack. And when she discloses the drowned Phoenician card, the text swiftly divorces itself from straightforward narrative, intruding cruelly: "Those are pearls that were his eyes. Look!" Phlebas the Phoenician, whose reappearance (repetition) at first promises narrative connectedness between the first and later parts of the poem, turns out to be another re in the poem's grim histrionics of non-relationship. <i>The Waste Land</i> doesn't have a narrative; instead it has the scent of a narrative, hovering in the air like a perfume after someone has left the room.

Histrionics: an exaggerated, wild quality; and fierceness, a notion comprising wildness and rage, even cruelty&#x02014;<i>The Waste Land</i> thrives on those dark qualities. To say that, admittedly, is to depart sharply from our received notion of Eliot as a neo-classical poet. But depart from it we must. "It has been too tempting for too long," one of Eliot's most astute readers has recently observed, "to assimilate the poem to the events that came later in the decade, even shortly later, to see it as safely predicting the dispositions of the mid and late twenties: the poem as proto-Anglican, crypto-classical, or neo-monarchist."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Indeed, to read the ten essays that Eliot wrote in 1921 while working on <i>The Waste Land</i> is to discern the discontinuous but coherent outline of an aesthetics deeply at odds with the notions of decorum, repose, sobriety, and equilibrium typically associated with neo-classicism.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  One key word in Eliot's critical vocabulary is <i>surprise</i>, a term he stresses again and again. Writing about Andrew Marvell in February 1921, Eliot notes "the high speed, the succession of concentrated images" in his "Coy Mistress," then observes that these are the basis for another effect: "When this process has been carried to the end and summed up, the poem turns suddenly with that surprise which has been one of the most important means of poetic effect since Homer." Citing another passage by Marvell, Eliot remarks: "There is here the element of <i>surprise</i> . . . the surprise which Poe considered of the highest importance, and also the restraint and quietness of tone which makes the surprise possible."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  Writing in early April, when now well into work on Part II of <i>The Waste Land,</i> he praises Dryden's "Mac Flecknoe" because it offers "the most fun . . . the most sustained display of surprise after surprise of wit from line to line . . . Dryden's method here is something very near to parody . . ."; while in the same essay he dismisses a passage by Abraham Cowley because it lacks "the element of <i>surprise</i> so essential to poetry."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Writing in mid-June, when now at work on the first half of Part III, Eliot reformulates his view of "surprise": "The strange, the surprising, is of course essential to art . . . The craving for the fantastic, for the strange, is legitimate and perpetual; everyone with a sense of beauty has it."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  The strange, the surprising, the fantastic, something very near to parody . . . these are terms at some remove from the cool sobriety conjured by "Tradition and the Individual Talent." Not that "Tradition and the Individual Talent" doesn't encapsulate certain Eliotic aspirations which will grow more prominent over time, so much so that Eliot himself will eventually enshrine it as the gateway into that vast graveyard known as his <i>Selected Essays.</i> But that was much later. In 1921, instead, 

<b></b>

"Tradition and the Individual Talent" was only one of several options facing Eliot, and in relation to <i>The Waste Land,</i> "The Road Not Taken" might be the most appropriate title for it. And the road taken? The strange, the surprising, the fantastic, something very near to parody . . . histrionics.
</p>

<p>
Similar terms preoccupy Eliot over the course of 1921, among them "ferocity." Praising Marie Lloyd, the music hall star whose death a year later would elicit one of Eliot's finest essays, he praises her for having "wit" that is "mordant, ferocious." Of Nellie Wallace, another music-hall star whom he admired, Eliot writes: "The fierce talent of Nellie Wallace . . . holds the most boisterous music hall in complete subjection." <sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  He finds some of H. M. Bateman's caricatures compelling because they "continue the best tradition from Rowlandson and Cruikshank. They have some of the old English ferocity." And he adopts with relish Baudelaire's dictum concerning caricature: "<i>Pour trouver du comique f&#x000E9;roce et tr&#x000E8;s-f&#x000E9;roce, il faut passer la Manche</i>" ["To find comedy that is ferocious and very ferocious, one has to cross the English Channel"].<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  A related if more muted term is "intensity," and the cognate words "intense" and "intensify." They appear twenty-one times in Eliot's essays from the first half of 1921 ("The Romantic Englishman," "The Lesson of Baudelaire," "Andrew Marvell," and "Prose and Verse"). But Eliot also deploys another term far more extreme than "intensity." Quoting Dr. Johnson late in 1921, he praises the metaphysical poets because in their works "the most heterogeneous ideas are yoked by violence together."<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  A few months earlier he praises Baudelaire over Dryden because he "could see profounder possibilities in wit, and in violently joined images."<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  While around the same time he enthusiastically takes up Baudelaire's view on the distinctive trait of English comedy: <i>"le signe distinctif de ce genre de comique &#x000E9;tait la violence"</i> ["the distinctive sign of this kind of comedy was violence"].<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Ferocity, intensity, violence, companions to the strange, the surprising, the fantastic, something very near to parody: here is the core of Eliot's aesthetics while he was writing <i>The Waste Land.</i> Which is why, of course, his essays of the time also show him so responsive to caricature and music hall, modes of cultural production which thrive on wild exaggeration, hyperbolic repetitions which pivot on the play of likeness and illusion, a grotesque machinery of extremism.
</p>

<p>
If <i>The Waste Land</i> repeatedly engages in a histrionics of non-relationship which effectively undermines the modes of connectedness (repetition, narrative) that the poem elsewhere takes pains to assert, nowhere do the tensions between these assume starker form than in the grisly puppet show staged by the typist and the young man carbuncular at the heart of the poem, the middle of Part III. The typist, after all, is repetition personified, her task to repeat someone else's words whether dictated aloud or transcribed in longhand; while the young man carbuncular is a paradigm of the stranger or intruder whose arrival sets in motion the mechanics of event and plot, sparks narrated activity. Their story is a narrative of repetition, in the sense that their loveless coupling is inferred to be but one in a protracted series of similar encounters; while it is also a repetition of narrative, in the sense that it elaborates topoi associated with representations of the typist in realist and naturalist fiction of the period 1910-1922.

<b></b>

(We shall examine those topoi shortly.) Moreover, a juxtaposition of narrative and repetition serves to structure the presentation of their encounter from beginning to end: a laconic narrative, divided into three scenes or tableaux, is punctuated by the stark repetition (three times) that demarcates the presence of the observing "I Tiresias."
</p>

<p>
Little wonder that Eliot, in a note which he wrote as much as one year later, should assign this episode exemplary status: "What Tiresias <i>sees</i>, in fact, is the substance of the poem" (note to l. 218). True, that is "a declaration that critics have tended to view rather sceptically," as Carol Christ has noted, and the rationale behind their scepticism has been voiced by another critic:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
But it is doubtful . . . whether Tiresias attains within the poem as a whole the importance that Eliot attributes to him in his Note on this passage . . . The <i>persona</i> of Tiresias fails to control the tone of the whole passage and the result is a failure of proper impersonality.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Still, we may harbor suspicions about the standard that is guiding such evaluations. For it assigns "Tradition and the Individual Talent" a normative function epitomized in the phrase "proper impersonality," while that essay presents an aesthetics radically incommensurate with the sort articulated in the essays Eliot wrote while producing <i>The Waste Land.</i> We need, in short, to revisit a scene so casually dismissed by Eliot's admirers, a scene which also brings us back&#x02014;by what arcane logic?&#x02014;to the subject we first began with, the typewriter. For in the period that ran from Eliot's birth to roughly 1920, the typewriter and the typist were virtually one, designated by the same term, "typewriter." <i>Confessions of a Type-Writer,</i> a sensational novel published in 1893, recounted the seduction of a young woman by a caddish swindler, not the fantastic avowals of a machine; just as <i>Confessions of a Typewriter, or Merciful Unto Me, a Sinner</i> (1903, 1910), recounted a similarly lurid tale but culminated in the heroine's discovery of Christian Science. Or consider the play <i>Miss Robinson,</i> performed in 1918 and published in 1920: it shows us Lister, horrified by his mother's plan to marry his brother to the young secretary who has been working for their father, exclaiming, "You can't expect him to marry a typewriter." <sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
It is difficult today to appreciate just how unprecedented it was to make a typist a key protagonist within a serious poem. Prior to <i>The Waste Land</i> typists had appeared only in light verse that was humorous or satirical in nature.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>  Fiction, instead, was the medium which most fully registered the growing presence of typists in offices after 1885, first in short stories and then, after 1893, in novels. Only quite recently have literary scholars and historians taken note of the typist in fiction, in three essays which together assay seven novels (all British) published between 1893 and 1936.<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  But in general the typist, as a subject of cultural representation, has been tacitly dismissed as unworthy of serious study, an object of misogynist scorn. For millions of women, however, clerical work offered the first occupational alternative to teaching or nursing and marked a massive change in their range of experience. The phenomenon was at once international, spreading from the U.S. to Britain, then France and Germany, and irreducibly local, with specific histories in different countries, even cities.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
In 1921, when Eliot was writing <i>The Waste Land,</i> female office workers were still relatively new, more so in Britain than in the United States. Increasingly employed in nearly all kinds of business, typists were especially concentrated in the insurance and banking sectors, both centered in the City, or financial district, of London. Eliot began to work for Lloyds Bank in March, 1917, already a huge corporation and the second largest of the "Big Six" British clearing banks which had emerged after decades of merger and acquisition activity that straddled the turn of the century.<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  The process was just drawing to an end during Eliot's early years at the bank, as Lloyds absorbed four last banks during the period 1918-1923. As a result of this horizontal integration process, Lloyds represented an immensely powerful concentration of capital which was now expanding into the international arena. (In 1911 it had purchased Armstrong &amp; Co., with branches in Paris and Havre, and in 1917 it entered into a fifty-fifty partnership with National Provincial Bank to create the Lloyds and National Provincial Foreign Bank; by 1938 the firm would have twelve branches on the Continent, serving British companies operating in Europe and British nationals abroad.) Indirectly, it was this expansion which led to Eliot's employment. For it was a friend of Vivien's family, L. E. Thomas, then the chief general manager of National Provincial Bank, who gave Eliot his letter of introduction to Lloyds. Eliot was duly assigned to the Colonial and Foreign Department, with its offices at 17 Cornhill Street in the heart of the City, one of several abutting buildings owned by Lloyds.
</p>

<p>
After two years Eliot was transferred to the Information Department, a much smaller unit reporting directly to the bank's Board of Directors. Eliot himself was in daily contact with typists. He was one of 7,400 employees engaged by Lloyds, and it was during World War I that women clerks had first appeared at the firm. By late 1918 they totalled 3,300, nearly 45% of the bank's labor force. With the war's end, they were soon being dismissed, and after 1920 women were engaged only for typing or filing. (By 1925 there were still 1,500 left, all of them single, for until 1949 women were obliged to resign upon marriage). "My typist is in a bad temper now because I gave a couple of letters to do to someone else who happened to have nothing to do at the moment," Eliot laments to his father in 1917 (<i>LOTSE,</i> 204). "I have half of a room, two girls, and half of a typist," he explains to his mother the next year, adding "I share a typist with someone else" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 232). In September 1919, after completing his move to the new Information Department, Eliot tells his mother that he is awaiting "a French typist for foreign correspondence":

It may seem a small matter, but it's worth noting that comment about doing "card indexing." Card indexing was a relatively new office procedure, one of many which attended what business historians have increasingly recognized as "a veritable revolution 

<b></b>

in communication technology" which took place between roughly 1890 and 1910.<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  The epitome of that revolution was the typewriter, first manufactured in 1873, but only widely used in offices after 1890. Another was something as modest as the loose-leaf (ring or post bound) ledger system, first marketed in 1894 to replace the bound ledger books which had been used until then.<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  Whereas before a client's growing account had to be continued on the next available page at the end of a bound book, with laborious cross-referencing to connect the two parts of the account, now it was possible to extend or add new accounts as needed. In effect the loose-leaf ledger introduced the idea of interchangeable parts to the office. It was soon followed by the card file ledger, and then by the vertical file such as we still know it today. By roughly 1910 vertical filing was universal among larger firms. The recording of outgoing correspondence was done through carbon copies, another novelty which had also become standard in large firms by 1910, while the reproduction of internal documents for large firms was facilitated by the invention of the rotary mimeograph in 1888, and the creation of new stencil papers. Eliot, in short, worked in a new office culture which had only recently taken form, an interlocking grid of new communications and storage-and-retrieval technologies&#x02014;typewriters, telephones, dictaphones, adding machines, duplicators, loose-leaf ledgers, card indexes, and vertical filing systems. The typist was the epitome of that grid&#x02014;capital concentrated into flesh, flesh turned into a nexus of formal communication flows under the impress of systematic management.
</p>

<p>
That was one aspect of the typist as a distinctively modern re. Another was related to, yet also in contradiction with it. The typist was one of a family of res who represented the promise of modern freedom: an allegedly new, autonomous subject whose appetites for pleasure and sensuous fulfilment were legitimated by modernity itself, by its promise that those new technologies, harnessed under systematic management, would ultimately enhance individual agency and create a richer life-world. (More exotic members of this family included the aviator and the automobile racer.) It was this belief which prompted early feminists to embrace the typewriter and its emancipatory potential for women, even as they swiftly noted mounting signs of betrayal (low wages, depressing workplace routines, raw exploitation). And it was this same thematic which obliquely informed novels about typists, which often explore the boundaries of legitimate desire through the blunt but pressing question of how far a young woman should go in sexual relations with men.
</p>

<p>
But novels about typists did not emerge in a social vacuum. Often they developed topoi first articulated in contemporary journalism. Consider what might be called the food or diet debate, a subject taken up in an essay by "Frances," an otherwise anonymous journalist whose feature "Five O'Clock Tea Talk" appeared in the popular British newspaper <i>T. P.'s Weekly.</i> (The newspaper sold between 120,000 and 175,000 copies a week, reaching "an estimated half a million readers, chiefly among the culturally aspiring urban working- and lower-middle-classes.")<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  Frances notes widespread agreement that the lunch food available to typists and secretaries is extremely poor:

<b></b>

</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Over the quality of that mid-day meal there need not be any contradictions. Goldsmith's inquiring citizen might pursue his way from Broad Street to St. Paul's . . . putting his head in at the glass door of every tea shop he met, yet have naught to report at his journey's end but "coffee or tea and roll," with the sometimes addendum of "sandwich," or "sausage," or "pastry," or "jam." Can the girl-worker thrive and be happy on such fare, and does it content her?<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Frances goes on to give a journalistic history of "the girl-worker of to-day." The invention of the typewriter has led to the proliferation of typists, "the crowds of girls who go hurrying through the city's big highways morning and mid-day and evening." These, in turn, have given rise to another institution: "And as the typewriter was responsible for the girl-worker as she is to-day, so may she be said to be responsible for the tea shop." But the proliferation of tea shops has only led to increasingly poor diets for female office workers. The root of the problem is low salaries, especially for "the homeless girl":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
For the girl who lives in a comfortable home and goes out to business in order to have extra dress and pocket money, the tea-shop lunch is well enough &#x02014;a substantial dinner awaits her when the day's work is done. But the girl who has to provide food, lodgings, and clothing out of a salary which does not always reach a pound a week, and rarely exceeds thirty shillings, more often than not has to make her tea-shop lunch her principal meal. She would die rather than confess it, and I have heard her talk quite bravely of not being able to eat meat or vegetables in the middle of the day, and pretend to look forward to dinner, whilst I knew that it was only by the most exquisite manipulation of her pence that cold meat supper could be managed.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Frances wistfully urges that "a woman's restaurant" be established to meet the needs of these workers, but holds out little prospect for immediate change:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
. . . mark the tone of resignation with which they at last ask for the inevitable roll, or pastry, or sausage, or egg, or any of the other edibles which will not map out beyond the eightpence or tenpence which forms the lunch allowance . . . It does not require very strong powers of observation to see that all those girls who throng the tea shops would welcome any change which would give them a chance of getting varied and palatable food. Their sticking to the much-condemned rolls and coffees and pastries is purely and simply a matter of purse&#x02014;nothing else.

<p>
The problem was indeed genuine, and larger firms soon addressed it by building "bars" on site to cater for their employees. One of the first to do so was the Prudential Assurance Company which, having completed its new headquarters on Holborn in the City in 1906, soon employed more than 400 young women as office workers.<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>  One of them was Ivy Low, an aspiring writer who joined the firm in 1908 and later drew on her experience in creating the setting for <i>The Questing Beast</i> , her novel about a typist named Rachel Cohen.<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>  At one point in it the narrator describes the lunchtime routine:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Lunch time was a pleasant break in the day. The directors of the New Insurance Society were too careful of their female employees to allow them to go into the streets 

<b></b>

and seek their lunch in crowded restaurants. . . . At any rate, whether they admitted it or not, it was a distinct advantage to the girls that they were able to get even an indifferent lunch in the office. Anyone, that is to say any woman, who has attempted to get lunch at city restaurants of the cheaper kind will realize the truth of this. . . . Besides, grumble as the clerks might and did at the quality of the food, it was not worse, and certainly far cheaper, than that provided by the surrounding restaurants.

These accounts of typists and food, though dating from 1903 and 1914, were by no means irrelevant in the immediate aftermath of World War I. When some 1,100 women who had been secretaries or typists in 1919 were asked to recall their work experiences, they stressed the subject of food again and again. They recalled eating at Lyons or ABC tea-shops and getting "a boiled egg, ginger pudding with treacle and a cup of tea for 1/3d." Or, since even these cut into the weekly pay packet, "the large majority" brought sandwiches. Some companies even paid their women for overtime work with food: "Bread, jam and tea for one hour," and "Scrambled eggs, scones and tea for two hours." Summarizing their recollections, an unidentified writer commented: "it was not unknown for a girl to faint at her work from lack of adequate nourishment."<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>  And the topic persisted as a topos in contemporary fiction after the war. Consider the following scene from <i>Money Isn't Everything,</i> a novel published in 1923, which recounts a dialogue between Jim Rogers, who is a clerk at a City legal firm, and Elizabeth Tudor, a typist who lives alone and shares her daily lunch with him in the garden of St. Paul's:

<p>
When novelists took up typists as fictional protagonists, they inherited the topics and topoi of contemporary journalism. Food was one. Lodgings were another, and the small room, scarcely large enough to house a young woman and her belongings, also became a fictional topos. "I had one small room, at the top of a dreary old house, in a small turning off the Tottenham Court Road," says the first-person narrator of Tom Gallon's <i>The Girl Behind the Keys.</i><sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>  The single small room also presented a practical problem for receiving visitors&#x02014;the bed. When Fred Norman, a successful New York lawyer in David Graham Phillips' novel <i>The Grain of Dust</i> , goes to visit the room of typist Dorothea Hallowell, he immediately notes this feature:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
It was a small neat room, arranged comfortably and with some taste . . . The bed was folded away into a couch&#x02014;for space and for respectability.<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup> 

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The room of Rachel Cohen, the typist working in the London office of the New Insurance Society in Ivy Low's <i>The Questing Beast</i> , is equally small and Spartan:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Besides the bed, the room contained a small enamelled wash-stand, six deal shelves holding a good many books, and a little table-crockery, a round table, two rush-bottomed "bedroom chairs," one fairly comfortable-looking upholstered arm-chair, and a large knee-hole desk, fitted with a great many small drawers and littered, not only with books and papers, but with various articles of clothing, a bunch of bananas and a glass jar half full of potted meat.

<p>
And whether adopting the voice of the narrator or a character, the novels often focus on female sleeping and undergarments, stressing their threadbare quality. In <i>The Questing Beast,</i> the narrator tells us: "Rachel Cohen, rising twenty, standing barefooted in her meagre cotton nightgown (they can only be got rather meagre for two and eleven three), looked like a very tired child of thirteen years" (<i>TQB</i>, 9). A more elaborate account appears in <i>The Grain of Dust</i>:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

He went up with her [to her room] and helped her to pack&#x02014;not a long process, as she had few belongings. He noted that the stockings and underclothes she took from the bureau drawers were in anything but good condition, that the half dozen dresses she took from the closet and folded on the couch were about done for. Presently she said, cheerfully and with no trace of shame: "You see, I'm pretty nearly in rags."<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>

</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
<i>The Grain of Dust</i> is pertinent because Eliot evidently knew of its author, David Graham Phillips, damning him in an essay he wrote in late January 1921, just before beginning <i>The Waste Land</i>:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The conventional literature of America is either wretchedly imitative of European culture, or ignorant of it, or both; and by this standard one easily dispels . . .

<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Eliot was referring here to Phillips's most recent and posthumously published novel, <i>Susan Lenox: Her Fall and Rise</i> (New York: D. Appleton, 1917), which recounts the heroine's plunge to prostitution and her rise as a Broadway star. But at least he was familiar with Phillips, who enjoyed a considerable reputation in the period 1900-1920, and Eliot may well have known his earlier <i>A Grain of Dust.</i> Likewise, Ivy Low's novel, <i>The Questing Beast</i> could easily have come to Eliot's attention. Low was a good friend of Katherine Mansfield and John Middleton Murry, and Eliot was in frequent contact with Murry during the two years (1919-1920) when Murry edited the <i>Athenaeum</i> and published thirty-three essays and reviews by Eliot.<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup> <i>The Questing Beast</i> is doubly suggestive because Low uses the disarray of Rachel Cohen's room to index her character's moral confusion, the trait that lets her be seduced by a caddish young clerk

named Giles Goodey&#x02014;treatment which has striking similarities to the narrative trajectory which, it has been urged, Eliot adopts for the typist in <i>The Waste Land.</i>
</p>

<p>
These, then, were topoi of contemporary journalism and realistic fiction which treated typists: a single room with cramped conditions, poor food, a bed that doubles as a couch or divan, references to female garments and undergarments. <i>The Waste Land</i> evokes them all in the eight lines of its opening tableau:

Subject matter is being stressed here: details of setting, the props of the realist and naturalist novel, are being summoned. And the voice of the poem itself, Tiresias, directs our attention to this fact: "I Tiresias, old man with wrinkled dugs / Perceived <i>the scene</i> . . ." (emphasis added). We are, in short, in a play or novel about a typist, and the plot line is predictable ("and foretold the rest").
</p>

<p>
But that is not all. For our novel or play about a typist also does something else here: it invokes poetry. Beginning at the midpoint of this passage a quatrain slowly emerges into view, and by its end it lies spread before us as neatly as "Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays." Well, perhaps not quite so neatly: for the meter of this passage is marked by deep uncertainty, shifting uneasily between four and five stresses per line, ranging from nine to thirteen syllables, uncertainty that turns it into a sign of poetry's flimsiness, its fragility in the face of the modern world, or that tacitly asks a question about whether poetry's traditional resources, rhythm and rhyme, suffice for what the modern world can throw in its path&#x02014;a typist, her room, a scene of urban squalor. But at least now we have the rudiments of our story laid out before us: we have a typist, subject matter of the contemporary novel; we have a "scene" set with the props of realism and naturalism; we have signs of poetry's resources, or resourcefulness, to be tested against the matter of modernity; and we have our more or less predictable plot line ("and foretold the rest").
</p>

<p>
But "predictable" in what sense? What expectations about plot or genre conventions would contemporary readers have brought to a scene that turns on a typist? The answer to that question is more complicated than we might expect, chiefly because of changes in the constellation of popular genres that took up the typist as subject matter over the long period that extends from 1890 to roughly 1925.<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>  In the earlier decades, 1890 to 1910, typists were chiefly depicted in two kinds of novel. One was overtly melodramatic, drawing on conventions and plot lines derived from late Victorian melodrama. In these the heroine was typically threatened by the predatory desires of an unscrupulous employer, a villain who resorted to deception and violence to attain his 

<b></b>

end, and she was invariably saved from danger by her beloved, the hero whom she would eventually marry.<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>  The other kind of novel was broadly realistic, and was written by British authors such as George Gissing, whose <i>The Odd Women</i> (London: Lawrence and Bullen, 1893) is one of the earliest explorations of the "New Woman," or M&#x000E9;nie Muriel Dowie, a "New Woman" writer whose novel <i>The Crook of the Bough</i> (London: Methuen, 1898) probes the contradictory expectations faced by women entering the new world of work. Their American counterpart was Henry Blake Fuller, whose novel <i>The Cliff Dwellers</i> (New York: Harper, 1893) addressed the life-forms in the new skyscrapers being built in Chicago.
</p>

<p>
But in subsequent years, a period running from roughly 1910 to 1925, the melodramatic novel completely vanished from view, its place gradually assumed by a new, still-emerging genre, women's romance, the genre that would later produce Barbara Cartland and Catherine Cookson. In such novels the heroine typically experienced a series of temptations and tribulations, often precipitated by an older and wealthier man, and ended by marrying another man of considerable wealth or, what comes to the same thing, her employer.<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>  Realism, meanwhile, continued to serve as a counter-weight. Less driven by plot conventions than protocols of treatment, it was an elastic mode perpetually in search of subject matter which could not be represented within the conventions of other genres, and increasingly it was turning to that controversial topic, sexual activity outside or prior to marriage. It was epitomized by British authors such as Arnold Bennett, Rebecca West, and Ivy Low; or by American authors following in the tracks of Theodore Dreiser and Upton Sinclair, writers such as Sinclair Lewis, or the muckraking journalist David Graham Philips, or Winston Churchill, now-forgotten but from 1900 to 1920 "the author most widely read by the American middle class."<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>  Between 1911 and 1922 all six authors published a novel about a typist or stenographer, and four portray a heroine who engages in consensual sex before marriage&#x02014;depictions which explicitly transgress the convention which had made the preservation of the heroine's chastity a governing device of melodrama and romance.<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>  (One of the novels, Ivy Low's <i>The Questing Beast,</i> was banned by W. H. Smith and Son, which refused to handle it.)<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>  Yet it is precisely at this point that all four novels also encounter serious difficulties with plotting. For in the real world an unmarried and pregnant woman of limited financial resources faced only one prospect, the certainty of social ostracism, and most likely the necessity of putting an illegitimate child up for adoption. But for novelists bent on affirming the dignity of protagonists who engaged in a consensual sex before marriage, that outcome could only validate the social prejudice they hoped to question. The result was an impasse. Consider Ivy Low, whose novel <i>The Questing Beast</i> we discussed earlier. The heroine Rachel Cohen is first seduced by a caddish clerk named Giles Goodey, then engages in consensual sex with a young actuary named Noel Young and becomes pregnant. Low resolves the impasse by resorting to what can only be called a fairy-tale ending: the heroine's landlady miraculously possesses enough money to support her throughout her pregnancy, and meanwhile her former colleagues at the office type up the novel she has been working on, which is soon published to critical acclaim and commercial success. The 

<b></b>

final chapter jumps forward, leaping over seven years and several more novels: Rachel is now living in an isolated village by the sea, still accompanied by the benevolent landlady, where she is successfully raising her child by herself. Winston Churchill resolves the dilemma by having the pregnant heroine, Janet Bumpus, be taken in by two friends; the child's father is soon murdered, and when the heroine-mother dies only a few months after childbirth the child is adopted by her benevolent friends. Rebecca West, in a very daring strategy, leaves the future of the mother and child radically open and unresolved: the novel ends just at the moment when the heroine reaches her decision to sleep with the protagonist, even though she knows that he has killed his mother only a few hours earlier, that he will soon be apprehended by the police, and that she and he will never have a life together. Arnold Bennett, instead, depicts a heroine who frankly acknowledges her innate propensity to give pleasure to a man (a woman's true nature, it is implied): she freely accepts her employer's offer to lead a life of pleasure on the Continent; but when it is learned that he is gravely ill, he hastily organizes a wedding, carefully arranges his will in her favor, and conveniently dies within days, leaving her the proprietor of the typing agency in London where she had been employed. After childbirth she returns to London, admired and envied by all her former colleagues. Bennett is out to subvert the melodramatic and romance convention which makes the seductive employer into a villainous cad; but to do so he resorts to turns of plot as improbable and unmotivated as those of the genres he is subverting. Yet his dilemma was highly representative, shared by all the realistic novelists who wanted to shape a sympathetic account of a young woman who, having engaged in consensual sex before marriage, became pregnant: the consequences in the real world were unspeakable, ineffable in the most literal sense, and could be evaded only through recourse to a deus ex machina, a magical or fairy-tale ending. In effect the contradictory impulses at work in the realist novel's depiction of the typist turned her into something strange and paradoxical: a re for what was resistant to ration, a sign of what could not be signified, but had to be circumvented.
</p>

<p>
Which brings us back to the typist in <i>The Waste Land,</i> whose appearance in the first tableau has been accompanied by a "scene," set with the props of realism and naturalism; signs of poetry's resources or resourcefulness; and the promise of a fairly predictable plot ("and foretold the rest"). These elements, in turn, have been juxtaposed with two others. One is the way in which the poem takes pains to assert an identity between the typist and the re for its own activity: "I <i>too</i> awaited the expected guest," says Tiresias in the brief interlude that separates the first tableau from the second (emphasis added); "<i>And I</i> Tiresias have foresuffered all" (243; emphasis added), he will reiterate at the next interlude. Both comments merely reinforce an earlier identification drawn between the typist, Tiresias, and the modern machine, all three connected through reiteration of the word "throbbing" in the passage which brings the typist onstage:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">

<br />
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<div class="attribution">
<!--_attribution-->
(215-8)
<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
But that identification is further complicated by another element, the poem's oblique recognition that the typist exceeds the capacity of conventional representation.<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>  For which perspective is it that enables us to see, at the same time, "the eyes and back" of that "human engine"? 
</p>

<p>
All these elements make what happens next only the more startling. For when the curtain next opens on the scene, the principal actress is abruptly whisked off the stage:

<p class="noIndent">
In the second tableau the typist vanishes entirely as an autonomous agent. She exists only through the thoughts of the young man carbuncular, a present-tense variant of free indirect discourse ("as he guesses, / . . . she is bored and tired"), or as a pronominal object of his gropings ("Endeavours to engage her . . ."). And as the passage goes on, she dissolves into a ghastly/ghostly series of negations: "unreproved," "undesired," "no defence," "no response," "indifference," their horror amplified because four of them are placed in the emphatic position of ending a line of verse, reverberating with each other ("no defence"/"indifference") and other rhyme words ("tired"/ "undesired" and "at once"/"no response"). The privative prefixes ("un-," "in-," "no") throbbing across the desolate syntax sequester the typist in a region of inexplicable, unbearable privation.
</p>

<p>
Nor is it just the typist who disappears in the course of the central tableau. The young man carbuncular, as soon as he "assaults at once," is displaced with synecdoche ("Exploring hands encounter . . .") and then vanishes under personification ("His vanity requires . . ."). Even his "final patronising kiss" has nobody and nothing that serves as a grammatical subject to bestow it; we must infer that "bestows" is governed&#x02014;but is anything being "governed" here?&#x02014;by the subject of the preceding clause, "His vanity." Vanishing and vanity, both stemming from the Latin <i>vanus</i>, meaning "empty," or to cite a fuller definition: "1, <i>that contains nothing, empty, void, vacant</i>; 2, <i>empty</i> as to 

<b></b>

purport or result, <i>idle, null, groundless, unmeaning, fruitless, vain.</i>"<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>  Void and vacant; groundless and unmeaning: stark terms, but they seem to be all that this conjuncture of repetition and narrative leaves us. Yet is that all there is to "the substance of the poem," if we may borrow the language of the much-discussed note which Eliot later provided for this passage?
</p>

<p>
That withering final kiss is horrific. It toys with a convention, of course, one in which the novel makes a kiss into the climax of a scene, a chapter, or even a whole work. And lodged within that convention is another, those martial metaphors which crop up in the central tableau: "Flushed and decided, he <i>assaults</i> at once; / Exploring hands encounter <i>no defence</i>" (emphasis added). No doubt the lover as soldier has a venerable pedigree in lyric poetry, one that reaches back to Propertius and Ovid and flourishes anew in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century poetry.<sup><a name="REF79" href="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>  But by the early twentieth century it has become fossilized language in the novel. Ivy Low adopts it at the moment when Giles Goodey begins to seduce Rachel, a climactic moment in the book. He has been reading aloud a manuscript in her room, which she is typing up as extra work on a free-lance basis, and during a pause they both step to the room's window:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Then Rachel turned and faced him, her eyes a little ghastly, her cheeks suddenly flushed, her mouth almost imperceptibly trembling. The little bells over their heads chimed ever so faintly. Giles took a step towards her, and she suddenly shrank back against the window, never taking her eyes off his face. The sudden movement touched Giles. He stooped and kissed her wrist.

<p class="blockquote">
"Are you afraid of me, little girl?" he said.
<p class="blockquote">
"Oh, no, Giles, not of <i>you</i>," said Rachel, looking at her wrist with a quaint air of surprise. "<i>Of me!</i>" she continued, and looked up at him with a crooked smile.
<p class="blockquote">
The appeal was double-edged. There was an invitation to his chivalry and subtler invitation to his desire in it. "Poor little girl, I must help her," suggested one voice, and "The fortress is not impregnable. It <i>wants</i> to be stormed!" clamoured another.
<p class="blockquote">
Another short step forward and Rachel was in his arms, timid, unresponsive, but submissive. He kissed her dark head several times, then bent it back and tried to quench a long thirst at that traitorous mouth of hers. She remained cold and bewildered&#x02014;a girl under her first kiss. . . . Her acquiescence, coupled with such a truly virginal quality of coldness, was maddening, intolerable, adorable!

Eliot's use of the kiss could hardly be more different. It comes not as a climax, but as wilfully gratuitous anti-climax. What had promised to be a narrative has given way to a world in which characters vanish, actions are reduced to random flailings ("exploring hands"), and the conventions of a seduction scene only evoke a grisly pantomime of non-relationship.
</p>

<p>
The final tableau concludes with a ferocious coda, a savage travesty of the novelistic scene where the typist, in the aftermath of her sexual encounter, finds herself alone and reflects on her deed. When Rachel Cohen wakes up the next morning:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Exactly the question that this person would most naturally ask was constantly in Rachel's mind: "Am I like <i>that? I?</i>" . . .
<p class="blockquote">
Rachel, hitherto triumphant over other people's weakness, now thought, in her bitter humiliation, that none was so fallen that she was not sister to. Again and again the memory of her pride in being "not that sort of girl" stung her to fresh writhings.

A similar moment occurs in <i>Chickie,</i> a popular novel by Elenore Meherin that was serialized in newspapers in 1923 and turned into a successful film in 1925.

Horror and terror: they are the more powerfully present for being inscribed in silence.
</p>

<p>
But it is the "automatic hand" that is most arresting here, riveting the reader's attention. For in Western philosophy from Aristotle to Heidegger, the hand has been invoked to signal the critical difference between the human and the animal, at once the instrument of reason and its material counterpart.<sup><a name="REF81" href="#FOOT81">81</a></sup>  Yet the typist's gesture erases precisely that boundary between wilful human action and the helplessness of automatism. Paradoxically, at the same time it also invokes what might be called a lyrical 

<b></b>

temporality and effect: for it interrupts, shocks, and freezes the scene. Gesture, here, is being summoned to substitute for speech, assigned a total expressivity that rests upon the ineffability of what is to be expressed. It becomes the consummate re for what cannot be red, a sign of what resists, exceeds, or dwarfs signification. Connoisseurs of art history will inevitably be reminded of how the hand was used in early Byzantine churches to substitute for a representation of God at a time when it was deemed blasphemous to depict Him on the assumption that divine form exceeded the limits of human representation.<sup><a name="REF82" href="#FOOT82">82</a></sup>  Tellingly, Eliot himself urges that the hand performs an analogous function in the Jacobean play <i>The Duchess of Malfi.</i> Reviewing a recent performance of it in 1920, he singles out the notorious scene in which the Duchess, trapped in a darkened chamber, is deceived into kissing a dissevered hand, one which she is told is that of her lover Antonio. It was "extraordinarily fine," Eliot says, for "here the actors were held in check by violent situations which nothing in their previous repertory could teach them to distort." "The scene of the severed hand," as Eliot calls it, has an uncanny effect: it prevents the actors from acting, prohibits the presenters from representing. Frozen and contracted in the clutch of rigor mortis, the dead hand dispenses with all mediation, which can only "distort," and is transformed into an eery paradox: it is a trope of not troping and, at the same time, is pure, unmediated communication. "Here," writes Eliot in summarizing his view of the scene, "the play itself got through, magnificently, unique."<sup><a name="REF83" href="#FOOT83">83</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
What is it, then, that "gets through" the typist's "automatic hand," that hand momentarily and yet forever contracted in a gesture charged with communicating what is otherwise ineffable, unspeakable? Doubtless there are many answers to that question, and ours can only be a tentative one, a provisional extrapolation from two phrases perhaps insignificant in themselves. One is a note that Eliot most likely wrote in December 1921, when in Lausanne under the care of the Swiss psychiatrist Dr. Roger Vittoz. It is found in the margin of Eliot's own copy of Vittoz's book, <i>The Treatment of Neurasthenia by Means of Brain Control.</i> Opposite a sentence by Vittoz which reads, "The muscles are at first more or less contracted and sometimes painful," Eliot has penciled a single word: "handwriting" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 480, n. 1). The other, somewhat strangely, is found in the final words of <i>The Waste Land.</i> By that I do not mean the famous "Shantih shantih shantih" which closes the published poem of 1922, but rather the last passage of text proper which Eliot composed, the passage that he wrote in Paris in January 1922, after Pound had deleted the entire passage about Fresca which had originally opened Part III, leaving Eliot no choice but to find a new beginning. Oddly, it too begins with the image of a hand contracted:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
The rivers tent is broken and the last fingers of leaf
<br />
Clutch and sink into the wet bank. . . .
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Yet it ends not with a phrase or even an image intended to suggest the ineffable, but with ineffability itself, with speechlessness:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
By the waters

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
What is unbearable, what cannot be written even when concluding the poem, is the rest of that line: "I sat down and wept." The ineffable is that sense of immense commiseration, at once a profound pity at the lacerating horrors of modernity and an unspeakable sorrow that there is no language, whether in narrative or lyric (epitomized by repetition), adequate to the terror which the poem wishes to account for. Fictively situated beside the heart of modernity which is the financial district of London, the poem offers only speechless weeping, a wild pathos at once unutterable and irredeemable, over the conditions that have governed its production. Perhaps that truly is "the substance of the poem."

<p class="noIndent">
My first debt is registered in the dedication at the beginning of this essay. Donald Gallup kindly allowed me to consult his collection of letters by Eliot, which were indispensable to the project. I am also grateful to Craig Simmons, a former student of mine, who examined Eliot's letters at Northwestern University, the University of Chicago, the Lilly Library at Indiana University, the University of Virginia, Princeton University, the Rosenbach Museum and Library in Philadelphia, the McKeldin Library at the University of Maryland, the University of Bonn Library, the Schiller Nationalmuseum in Marbach am Neckar, Germany, and the Schweizerische Literaturarchiv in Bern. His help was invaluable. His travels were funded by an NEH Junior Scholars Grant, for which I am also thankful. I also wish to thank the Bibliographical Society of America for a grant which enabled me to travel to a number of libraries; and the Harry Ransom Centre for the Humanities at the University of Texas, Austin, which permitted me to survey their holdings of letters by Eliot. I am deeply grateful to private owners who made their collections available for consultation: Prof. David G. Williams, Prof. John Waterlow, and Herbert T. Greene. Several scholars were also kind enough to read and comment on early drafts of the essay. I wish to thank Ronald Bush, John Roe, Ronald Schuchard, and John Whitter-Ferguson for their helpful suggestions. Finally, my further thanks to Professor Hidehiko Shindo and Professor Nakai for their invitation to speak at the joint conference of the T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound Societies of Japan, the occasion that sparked this essay.

Smith offers several overlapping chronologies for Part III's composition. He suggests that Eliot's reference to a "long poem . . . partly on paper," advanced in his letter of 9 May to John Quinn (see note 71), "probably . . . included . . . Part III or the outlines of Part IV" ("MOTWL," 133). But later he observes: "Part III, or some prototype of it, existed by the time Eliot and Vivienne, went to Margate about the middle of October" ("MOTWL," 133). And elsewhere he remarks: "the fair copy of Part III was made before Eliot left England on November 18" ("MOTWL," 133). But in yet a fourth comment he writes: "the dates of composition of Parts III and IV are, at best, highly conjectural" ("MOTWL," 132).

The myth that the name Madame Sosostris was derived from "Sesotris, the Sorceress of Ecbatana" in Huxley's <i>Crome Yellow</i> was first promulgated by Grover Smith, "The Fortuneteller in Eliot's <i>Waste Land,</i>" <i>American Literature</i> 25 , 490-2. In support of his claim Smith cited a letter he had received from Eliot, dated 10 March 1952, in which Eliot had said it was "almost certain" that he had borrowed the name from <i>Crome Yellow</i> ("almost certain" are the only words of the letter which are directly quoted by Smith). Smith then paraphrased the rest of the letter: "he has also said that, being unconscious of the borrowing, he was unaware of any connection between the name of the clairvoyant and that assumed by Mr. Scogan." Eliot had better reason than he knew for being "unaware of any connection" between the two characters. As we shall see below, Eliot had probably completed the scene with Madame Sosostris by early February, if we accept the evidence of a letter by Wyndham Lewis; and at the very latest he completed the typescript of Parts I and II sometime in mid-May 1921. Aldous Huxley, then living in Italy, did not even begin to write his novel until the beginning of June that same year, "pledging himself to finish it within two months," according to his biographer. It took just a bit longer, and he finished it in the second week of August, the same biographer says (see Sybille Bedford, <i>Aldous Huxley: a Biography,</i> vol. 1 1894-1939 [London: Chatto and Windus, 1973), 117 and 119). Eliot and Huxley did not correspond during this period, as the two men were not close; Eliot, writing late in January 1921, had damned Huxley's recent poem "Leda" as "a concession to the creamy top of the General Reading Public." (See T. S. Eliot, "London Letter: March 1921," in <i>The Annotated Waste Land with Eliot's Contemporary Prose,</i> ed. Lawrence Rainey [New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2005], 139.) Smith went on to diffuse the claim in his subsequent monographs on Eliot: <i>T. S. Eliot's Poetry and Plays: a Study in Sources and Influence</i> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1956), 76, a work that went through numerous impressions and a second edition in 1974; and <i>The Waste Land</i> (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1983), 47, 67-8. Through these it has become a standard note in all commentaries on the poem. See, for example: B. C. Southam, <i>A Guide to the Selected Poems of T. S. Eliot</i> (New York: Harcourt, 1968), 74-75, note to line 43; and <i>The Waste Land: a Norton Critical Edition,</i> ed. Michael North (New York: Norton, 2001), 6 n. 4, which also reprints the entire passage from <i>Crome Yellow,</i> 40-2.

"Mr. Apollinax" is assigned to 1916 by Christopher Ricks in his edition of T. S Eliot, <i>Inventions of the March Hare</i> (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1996), xli, evidently on the basis of its first publication in <i>Poetry</i> 8.6 (September, 1916), 294. For the text of both the autograph draft and the fair copy versions of the poem see Ricks, 344, 345. Lyndall Gordon urges that both "The Death of St. Narcissus" and "Mr. Apollinax" were "written by January 1915 for, on 2 February, Eliot alluded to them in a letter to Pound ('I understand that Priapism, Narcissism etc. are not approved of . . .')" ("DTWLF," 143). But Gordon misunderstands Eliot's comment to Pound. He is referring to the notorious King Bolo poems that Wyndham Lewis chose not to publish in <i>Blast</i> II, not to "The Death of St. Narcissus" or "Mr. Apollinax."

The British Bond [A] paper appears in only a single letter, from Eliot to Wyndham Lewis, dated [Nov.? 1915], T.55, in <i>LOTSE</i>, 122. Between the British Bond [B] and the British Bond [C] papers there is also a small distinction in color: the British Bond [B] used for "Song" is yellow white (Centroid 92), while British Bond [C], used in other <i>Waste Land</i> manuscripts described below, is white. Lyndall Gordon confuses the two papers because, although she notes their distinct colors, she fails to note that [B] has chainlines, while [C] does not: "Eliot used . . . British Bond paper for the <i>Waste Land</i> copy. Parts I and II of <i>The Waste Land</i> use the same typewriter and paper [as "Song"], though the paper of 'Song' is slightly yellower, perhaps a different batch" ("DTWLF," 144).

That Eliot did not begin working on <i>The Waste Land</i> sometime during 1920 is abundantly evident from his own comments in various letters written throughout that year. True, already on 5 November 1919 he made a statement widely interpreted as his earliest reference to <i>The Waste Land</i> when, writing to the New York lawyer and cultural patron John Quinn, he enumerated his current projects: "I am at work now on an article ordered by <i>The Times,</i> and when that is off I hope to get started on a poem that I have in mind" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 344). But throughout 1920 Eliot was prevented from working on the "poem I have in mind" by a combination of events. First, writing <i>The Sacred Wood</i> proved far more difficult than he had anticipated: Eliot had originally hoped to complete it by the end of May, but the final manuscript was not posted to the publisher until 9 August 1920 more than two months late. Second, there was the flat, or apartment, at Crawford Mansions, which he and Vivien had "come to loathe on account of the noise and sordidness." In June he began searching for another one, horrified to learn that many were priced at "two to four times what we pay now" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 390). Only at the end of October did Eliot finally agree on rental terms for a new flat at 9, Clarence Gate Gardens, and only at the end of November did he move in. But there was a third event which further consumed his time, an enormous stomach abscess which nearly killed Vivien's father, requiring an emergency operation and weeks of painful recovery attended by Vivien. Finally, throughout 1920 Eliot complained of poor health, tiredness, and exhaustion&#x02014;sometimes his own, sometimes Vivien's, often that of both. Eliot's regrets over not working on his projected poem recur throughout the year. To a novelist who was finding it difficult to concentrate he wrote in January 1920: "I have been tyring to start work myself, and it is very difficult when <i>both</i> people in a household are run down" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 355). To his brother he wrote in September: "I have not done any writing for months, and now we are both sleeping very badly . . . I feel maddened now because I want to get settled quietly and write some poetry" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 407). A week later he wrote to his mother: "I do not suppose that I shall be properly 

<b></b>

settled at work again till November; I have several things I want to do; and I want a period of tranquility to do a poem that I have in mind" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 408). "Am I writing much?" he asked himself in another letter, echoing his correspondent's question. "Only signing my name to leases and agreements" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 409). In October he advised his mother regretfully: "I have of course been unable to write, or even read and think, for some weeks" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 412). "You see," he explained to one correspondent, "we began looking for a flat in June, and since then I have simply not had the time to do a single piece of work . . . But I want to get to work on a poem I have in mind" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 419). By December, even the success of <i>The Sacred Wood</i> was beginning to irritate him: "I am rather tired of the book now, as I am so anxious to get on to new work, and I should more enjoy being praised if I were engaged on something which I thought better or more important. I think I shall be able to do so soon" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 424).

That Eliot sent off the manuscript of his "London Letter: May 1921" by around 1 May can be inferred from his comment, made on 21 May, 1921, to Scofield Thayer, the <i>Dial</i>'s editor who was then in Berlin, Eliot noted: "I am glad to hear that my letter was received in time." Given how long it would take for Eliot to send his essay to the <i>Dial</i>'s office in New York (nine days), for the office then to notify Thayer in Berlin (another nine days), and for Thayer to acknowledge receipt to Eliot, the essay must have been posted by early May.

Valerie Eliot assigns Eliot's departure from Paris to "22? November" (<i>LOTSE,</i> xxxvi). But a difficulty for this date is posed by Eliot's letter to the editor of the <i>Times Literary Supplement,</i> which was datelined "Lausanne" and published on 24 November. Surely it had to be set in type by at least 23 November, and surely it must have been posted at least one day earlier, on 22 November. It seems to ask too much to suppose that Eliot could have taken the train from Paris to Lausanne, arrived, and then written and posted a letter the same afternoon. It seems more likely that he left Paris on 21 November, perhaps even 20 November. Pound's letter to Scofield Thayer (quoted further below in the text) indicates that Eliot was simply "on his way through Paris," not staying for a more extended period.

This dating differs sharply from that of Lyndall Gordon, "DTWLF," 144, who urges: "It is impossible, so far to date the Hieratica cluster exactly, but 1918 seems a reasonable guess." The guess is just that, a guess, and it is by no means a reasonable one. Her arguments are followed by Ronald Bush, <i>T. S. Eliot: A study in Character and Style</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1984), 53-78, in particular 56-7 and 248, nn. 14-5, who then uses this early dating of the passage of "London, the swarming life" to argue that Eliot began <i>The Waste Land</i> in 1918 with programmatic intentions that later "fell away" .

The letter to Pound is misdated by Valerie Eliot, who assigns it to [24? January 1922]. The mistake results from her error in dating an earlier letter by Pound, one which he had dated "24 Saturnus" according to an arcane calendar ("The Little Review Calendar") that he published in the <i>Little Review</i> 7.2 (Spring 1922), 2. The month "Saturnus" was to corresponded with January. Mrs. Eliot, in her edition of <i>LOTSE,</i> mistakenly assigned the letter to December, following D. D. Paige, the editor of Ezra Pound, <i>Selected Letters 1907-1941</i> (New York: New Directions, 1971), 169. Though Paige's error was first noticed back in 1972 by Hugh Kenner, "UA," 44, n. 7, it had not come to Mrs. Eliot's attention before she published her edition of the letters in 1988.

<i>TWL:AF,</i> 36-7; my transcription departs from Valerie Eliot's at line 5. She seems to think that the word "there" replaces "where"; but exactly the opposite is true, as a glance at the facsimile reproduction of the manuscript (<i>TWL:AF</i>, 36) suffices to indicate. My reading is also confirmed by the published text of the poem, which in all versions has always read "where" as a final reading.

In 1937 the biologist and ecologist Julian Huxley hosted a sumptuous farewell dinner party for Walter Gropius upon the occasion of his departure from London to become Chair of the Harvard School of Design. This major event took place at the fashionable Trocadero, Oxford Street, with a guest list that reads as a Who's Who in the English scene of modernist design.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Strangely, among the guests one also finds&#x02014;besides Huxley&#x02014;prominent ecological scientists and environmentalists, which raises the question of why <i>they</i> were invited to the festivity. After all, ecologists seem to be odd guests at a party in honor of a Bauhaus architect. Social gatherings are often telling indications of an intellectual climate, as Gropius' farewell dinner will illustrate. What brought Bauhaus designers and ecologists together, this article argues, was a shared belief that the human household should be modeled on the household of nature.
</p>

<p>
The importance of science to Bauhaus design hardly dominates the historical studies of the school.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  What significance had the sciences in general and ecology in particular to modernist architecture? Rightly labeled by one of their contemporaries as "scientific architects," the following pages argue that Bauhaus designers saw science as a key vehicle for design development.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Though some Bauhaus designers were inspired by biology while the school was active in Germany, this article holds that the fusion of biological reasoning in Bauhaus design took place during the process of trying to reestablish the school in London after its expulsion from Nazi Germany. This London interlude is often ignored by historians.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  The period was important for the school's development in terms of ecological reasoning. This article will first lay out where and how Bauhaus designers and scientists interacted

<b></b>

in London. The next section will point to the importance of ecology to L&#x000E1;szl&#x000F3; Moholy-Nagy. The third section will discuss the Bauhaus design at the London Zoo, showing that the Zoo keepers thought the human household should be modeled upon the household of nature, as this was understood in their research. Finally, the last section of the article will explain how ecological sciences and Bauhaus design merged in H. G. Wells' utopian visions for a society in harmony with nature's economy.

1. The London Bauhaus
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
The arrival of former Bauhaus faculty members in London energized the city's designers and intellectuals. After fleeing from Nazi harassment, Walter Gropius (who arrived in 1934 and left in 1937), Marcel Breuer, and L&#x000E1;szl&#x000F3; Moholy-Nagy (who both stayed between 1935 and 1937) were able to meet regularly again as a group. They set forth to reestablish the Bauhaus school in London.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  The guest list at Gropius' farewell dinner indicates who responded favorably to their ambition. This party may be labeled "The London Bauhaus," and the following pages will explain who they were. What brought the interdisciplinary group of designers, town-planners, and environmentalists together was a shared belief that Bauhaus design could solve social as well as environmental ills.
</p>

<p>
The former Bauhaus faculty settled in the Hampstead section of London which at the time was a community of avant-garde designers, intellectuals, and artists. They moved into a brand new apartment complex, the Lawn Road Flats, which was the first modernist residence in London. Designed by Wells Coates, the building featured a common room (which Breuer redesigned into the Isobar Club in 1937), as well as laundry, cleaning, meal, and garage services. From his window Moholy-Nagy could enjoy overlooking a garden of "only trees, which is very peaceful, especially in London."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  The list of carefully selected tenants included a host of left-leaning intellectuals and designers enjoying what Gropius described as "an exciting housing laboratory, both socially and technically."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Technically, the building was to be a true machine for living with state-of-the-art furniture and novelties like built-in cooking and washing facilities. Socially, the apartment complex was to promote collective life and liberate the tenants from the burden of personal possessions. Both Moholy-Nagy and Gropius suffered from the language barrier (the latter only spoke "three words of English").<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Yet they were able to overcome the obstacle thanks to the communal spirit of the Flats. The tenants were encouraged to nurture a fellowship modelled on the Bauhaus workshop, and the recruiting of the school's faculty as tenants was to secure the intellectual climate for what, in effect, was a socialist architectural experiment. The building was to function like a park where people could come and go, and it quickly became a hub for promotion of Bauhaus design. As the building's architect, Coates was in the midst of gatherings that soon evolved into the Modern Architecture Research Group or MARS. This group included notable designers such as Maxwell Fry (who collaborated with Gropius on several projects), Morton Shand, John Gloag, and the Russian &#x000E9;migr&#x000E9; 

<b></b>

Berthold Lubetkin (who arrived in London in 1930). The young Danish engineer, Ove Arup, was also among the frequent visitors of Lawn Road Flats.
</p>

<p>
One of the chief points of debate was the role of biology in reshaping society. The MARS group became advocates of environmental sensitivity: "There must be no antagonism between architecture and its natural setting," they pointed out in their exhibition manifesto of 1938. A drawing of a tree growing through a building was to illustrate that "the architecture of the house embraces the garden. House and garden coalesce, a single unit in the landscape."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  This appeal reflected values and ideas promoted by environmentalists such as Clough Williams-Ellis, who thought modernist design could save Britain from ecological destruction. Later hailed by Louis Mumford as the founder of the ecological movement, Williams-Ellis became known for his <i>England and the Octopus</i> of 1928 where he rages against the evils of aesthetic and physical pollution of the countryside.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Along with the professor of town-planning at London University, Patrick Abercrombie, Williams-Ellis was on a crusade against unregulated development of the English landscape. He had, along with his co-author John Summerson, a progressive view of history. Modern architecture with its focus on light and fresh air represented for them advancement in public health as well as a remedy that could halt environmental destructions of past developments. Bauhaus design was particularly promising since it hailed a regeneration of the craftwork Williams-Ellis associated with the traditional English cottage.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  This environmentalist group championed, as the historian David Matless has argued, modernist ecological order and fitness of buildings, towns, landscapes, and its people. What they feared was individualism, laissez-faire development, and rustic nostalgia for the past. They were all welcomed by the MARS group as visitors at Lawn Road Flats, and on the guest-list of Gropius' farewell party.
</p>

<p>
Another meeting place for the Bauhaus devotees was the residence of H. G. Wells, who also lived in Hampstead. As Wells also argued, the human condition should be understood from an ecological point of view. From the late 1920s and on, he used human ecology as his chief methodological tool. His home was known for what the bourgeois would call a salon, though his left-wing friends referred to them as meetings. Wells was a familiar re in Soviet circles in London, where he engaged with Lubetkin as well as the Russian-born architect Serge Chermayeff. It was through Wells' secretary Moura Budberg that Wells also came to know the Hungarian film producer Alexander Korda, who expressed a desire to make a film based on Wells's socialist ideas about architecture.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  One of the key debating points in their gatherings was the importance of evolutionary biology and ecology in understanding the history and future welfare of the working-class and the environment. These ideas became particularly important to Chermayeff, who later in life wrote a book about ecological architecture dedicated to Gropius.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The chief source of inspiration for Wells' interest in ecology was Julian Huxley. As secretary of the Zoological Society, Huxley enjoyed a spacious residence at the London Zoo, which he had made into a showroom for modernist design. Here scientists, architects, urban planners, as well as the environmentalist circle around Williams-Ellis met for discussions. The group, also present at the Gropius farewell party, included

Their program for saving mankind from environmental, economic and social destruction through scientific planning found its voice through the Political and Economic Planning Organisation&#x02014;known under the cheering acronym PEP. It was instituted in 1931 in response to an article by Nicholson about the urgent need for "A National Plan for Great Britain" to save the nation from economic depression.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Progressive architectural design was one of its core aspects, and many architects&#x02014;especially  Gropius&#x02014;looked at PEP with hope and admiration. As an outspoken socialist and Oxford trained ecologist, Nicholson argued that Londoners faced a serious population and slum crisis and that scientists, architects and planners offered new housing and urban designs to deal with the problem.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  He economically supported a village-college in Histon designed by Gropius and Fry that aimed at moving people out of cities into small and presumable healthy country towns. This project came as a response to a manifesto on minimum housing standards signed by a series of modernist architects and published in <i>Week-End Review</i>, where Nicholson worked as assistant editor. It promoted new standards for room size, light, ventilation, sanitation, heating, and access to water, as well as proximity to workplace, grocery stores and childcare.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  The basic idea was that old-fashioned housing design reinforced an unfortunate dualism between humans and nature while the new Bauhaus architecture promised a reunion of humans with nature through healthy living. The planning of cities that could secure the evolutionary survival of the human species was the issue at stake.

2. Learning From Nature's Workshop
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
The London writings of Moholy-Nagy may provide a window into debates about evolutionary survival of the human species, as this was discussed at the Lawn Road Flats. There are only sparse discussions of his biological outlook in the literature about Bauhaus, despite the fact that he stressed the importance of biology in his work and educational program. The architectural historian Reyner Banham, for example, focuses almost exclusively on the importance of mechanization to modernist design in general and to Moholy-Nagy in particular. Similarly with Moholy-Nagy's biographer, who also argues that Moholy-Nagy's "activities became highly disparate, even to the point of fragmentation" during his London years.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  What looks like fragmentation was actually a re-launching of Bauhaus as an ecologically-inspired program of design.
</p>

<p>
Moholy-Nagy, it is worth recalling, was Hungarian-born, the former professor of a metal workshop, and responsible for teaching the preliminary design course at Bauhaus, Weimar. He and Gropius had previously compiled a series of books about Bauhaus design, in which his own <i>Von Material zu Arkitektur</i>  appeared in English under the title <i>The New Vision</i> in 1930. For many English speaking designers it became their first encounter with Bauhaus research methods. He advised them to use "nature as a constructional model" and always look for "prototypes in nature" to determine functionality.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  "Functionalism" was a key word in the book. Late in life Moholy-Nagy 

<b></b>

would complain that the original meaning of Louis Sullivan's motto "form follows function" had been "blurred" to a "cheap commercial slogan" so that its original meaning was lost. According to Moholy-Nagy, it should be understood in view of "phenomena occurring in nature" where every form emerges from its proper function.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  This was also the basic assumption in <i>The New Vision</i>: humans were governed by their biological nature and cultural artifacts would consequently only be functional if they confirmed to human biology. Bauhaus design was to "guarantee an organic development" and allow its users to "follow biological rhythms" so that people's daily "lives would be less hysterical and less empty."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  The task of design was to create a culture which strengthened people's ability to function biologically, and the mean to achieve this end was to make sure design mirrored the balance of nature. "[T]echnical progress should never be the goal, but instead the means" for a healthy biological life, he argued."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The chief source of inspiration for this design program was the Hungarian biologist Raoul H. Franc&#x000E9; (1874&#x02013;1943). Though Franc&#x000E9; is largely forgotten today, he was, in the inter-war period, a best-selling biologist and Director of the prestigious Biological Institute of the German Micrological Society in Munich. He was an outspoken defender of psychobiology: the theory that a certain vital psyche in living matter is a driving force in evolution. As one of the founders of soil ecology, he argued that the earth had a dynamic power that gave plants a psychic goal-oriented energy aiming at evolutionary harmony among living organisms. Humans could benefit from the earth's vital powers, Franc&#x000E9; argued, if they learned to copy nature's inventions. (<a href="#1"> 1</a>) Under the label "bio-technique" he founded the science of bionics to pursue this end. The aim was to study nature's workshop to generate principles, techniques and processes that could be applied to human technologies so that human society would live in harmony with nature. The structure of plants as well as their biotic communities should serve as models for architecture and city planning, respectively. It is possible to imagine a "futuristic utopia," he argued, "if the Doctrine of Life would become the lode-star of human institutions" and "the optimally functional form" of plants and plant communities was applied to development of new technology, design, architecture and urban planning.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  One merely had to learn from nature's workshop to find out what humans should do, he claimed in <i>Die Pflanze als Erfinder</i> (Plants as Inventors) of 1920, a book which Moholy-Nagy would frequently quote.
</p>

<p>
It is worth noting that Moholy-Nagy was not the only modernist designer enthused by Franc&#x000E9;'s thinking. Both Siegfried Ebeling and Ernst May used the bio-technique in their design. May, for example, pursued the method when designing housing at Frankfurt-R&#x000F6;merstadt . Their bio-techniques and the housing project later inspired Lewis Mumford's visions of a future urban order for human culture.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The overall aim of Moholy-Nagy's research was to find a way of designing that would set human life in harmony with nature's economy, as this was understood by Franc&#x000E9;. In his artwork he investigated space relationships and functionality in relation to biological needs. He defined architecture "as an organic component of living" and argued that "[a]rchitecture will be brought to its fullest realization only when the deepest knowledge of human life in the biological whole is available."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  While living in 

<b></b>

London he drew up ambitious plans for a space-modulator (similar to his light-modulator of 1930) in the form of a kaleidoscope that could produce every possible space relationship. The aim was to research "[t]he biological bases of space experience," so that the architect and designer could proportionally transfer the spatial order of nature into the human realm.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  The numerous drawings Moholy-Nagy generated from this research should thus be read as attempts to understand how human biology functions in different types of spaces.

<p>
Bauhaus design was also meant to reconcile the artificial and the natural in a way that would enhance both human life potential and create a harmonious environment. Moholy-Nagy was pursuing an indirect argument for ecological protection, namely that a well-functioning biotic community was a precondition for a well-functioning human society. "The new architecture on its highest plane will be called upon to remove the old conflict between organic and artificial, between open and closed, between country and city," Moholy-Nagy told British architects. He was inspired by Franc&#x000E9;'s idea that every organic object had a harmonic organization that manifested itself internally as a balanced structure, and externally in the shape of ecological communities. Moholy-Nagy developed his program of social responsibility accordingly, by providing communities with structurally sound designs that gave support to human and non-human biological needs. "[T]he thesis on which the Bauhaus was built," he argued, pointing to Gropius' first public lecture in London, is "that art and architecture which fail to serve for the betterment of our environment are socially destructive by aggravating instead of healing the ills of an inequitable social system."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Bauhaus design will determine "the fate of our generation and the next" if it successfully uses the biological forces of life to improve social, economic, technical and hygienic matters so that society would live in harmony with nature.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The Bauhaus educational program was based on the bio-technique Moholy-Nagy explained in a series of articles written in London which were designed to mobilize support to reestablish the school there. One of them was an article entitled "Why Bauhaus Education?" later published as a manifesto in <i>Shelter</i> for the New Bauhaus in Chicago. The students would have to read a substantial amount of science literature to make them aware of the fundamental biological needs of the human society. This was an effort to develop "a new type of engineer" who would use "an organic approach" in design.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  The new science of "bio-technique," Moholy-Nagy explained, "deals with transportation of natural forms and design into the media of human production. Nature evolves ingenious forms, often technologically useful. Every bush, every tree, can instruct us in and reveal new uses, potential apparatus, and technological inventions without number."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In his photographic art, Moholy-Nagy also tried to capture the vital life force of evolution outlined by Franc&#x000E9;.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  He saw art as an expression of the dynamic forces of life in matter: one needed to "replace the <i>static</i> principle of <i>classical art</i> with the <i>dynamic</i> principle of universal life."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  In his abstract film projects such as <i>Light-play: black-white-gray</i> , he tried to capture the dynamic life force on the screen.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  This was also his agenda in his commissioned photo illustrations for <i>Eton Portrait</i> , <i>An Oxford University Chest</i> , and for the guidebook to <i>The Street Markets of London</i> . In these three picture books Moholy-Nagy uses a snapshot technique which captures the life of Eton and Oxford dons as well as marked dealers in action. By capturing the moment with snapshots (as opposed to posed photos), Moholy-Nagy saw himself as a scientist "providing a truthful record of objective determined fact."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  These facts were also evidence of a class-ridden society with images of places where the biological forces of life failed to unfold. At Oxford, for example, he would juxtapose well-to-do students and faculty members with images of the poor, as if to remind the reader that the creative energy of academic life all too often was a privilege of the rich.
</p>

<p>
Moholy-Nagy made two documentary films in London which further illustrate his biologically inspired design program. The first one was commissioned by a London documentary film company, released in 1935 as <i>The Life of the Lobster</i>. It is a sixteen-minute-long naturalistic documentation of the growth of the lobster from tiny 'crawfish' to old age, as well as the fisherman's struggle to search them out. What possible interest could an artist like Moholy-Nagy have had in the lifecycle of lobsters? A hint to this question can be found in an article of 1937 entitled "The New Bauhaus and Space Relationship." Using the horseshoe crab as his example, he explains that its "prehistoric animal shell is constructed in such a wonderful way that we could immediately adapt it to a fine bakelite or other molded plastic form."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  The horseshoe crab thus served as an example of the usefulness of natural forms as models for human artifacts. The point of the film was thus to show designers and architects alike that there was something to learn about form and function through observing the forms and life of animals like lobsters.
</p>

<p>
The second film Moholy-Nagy made in London was a fifteen minute silent documentary commissioned by Alfred Barr, the Director at the Museum of Modern Art, 

<b></b>

about <i>The New Architecture of the London Zoo</i> . It is an attempt to document the space relationships within a building, and it follows the space-modulator project outlined above. "I protested against such a naturalistic approach," the architect of the buildings, Lubetkin, commented, since the film apparently wanted "simply to record, and maintained that the world was full of new shapes, textures and movements."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Lubetkin was clearly expecting something in the line of Moholy-Nagy's earlier use of light and shadows from his pre-London films, though the naturalistic language of the film fits well with Moholy-Nagy's project of documentation of different biological experiences of space in the human and animal world. The comment also reflected a philosophical difference, as the next section will illustrate, between the vitalist-informed design Moholy-Nagy advocated, and the geometric or mechanistic biology Lubetkin's design was based upon.

3. From Animal House to Bauhaus
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
In the summer of 1934 the London Zoo opened their new Penguin Pool with fanfare, the latest culmination of a series of new buildings designed according to the Bauhaus style. It was immediately recognized as a masterpiece of the avant-garde, and its famous double helix ramps have since been a pilgrimage site for admirers of modernist architecture. (<a href="#2"> 2</a>) How did such design relate to ecology, animal welfare, and penguins? In the following pages I suggest that the zoo keepers used Bauhaus design to promote a socialist inspired view of the connection between animal and human nature. They saw a close connection between animals and humans, and consequently an evolutionary development from the animal house to Bauhaus which offered health, welfare, and peaceful relationships between humans and the natural world.
</p>

<p>
The pool was designed by the Tecton Company led by Lubetkin, with engineering support from Arup. Lubetkin was a political revolutionary who jumped at the opportunity to display modern architecture to the masses. Similar to Le Corbusier, Lubetkin believed geometric forms were fundamental building blocks of nature. Though he disagreed with Moholy-Nagy's vitalist biological outlook, he was also of the bio-technical opinion that forms of nature ought to be the model for functionalist design. Moreover, he argued that the "geometric" approach to zoo design "consists of designing architectural settings for the animals in such a way as to present them dramatically to the public, in an atmosphere comparable to that of a circus."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Animals have long played an important part in the Russian circus ring, so it is not surprising that Lubetkin evoked this idea as a model for explaining human relations to animals.
</p>

<p>
The architectural historians of the London Zoo have also understood its architecture as an example of seeing nature as a circus for human entertainment.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  The evidence for understanding the Penguin Pool in terms of a circus is found in architectural reviews that created a lasting image of the pool as a circus for human amusement. The <i>Architectural Review</i>, for example, wrote about the "theatrical quality" of the pool as "a suitable setting for any latent publicity talent" among the penguins.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Similarly, in <i>Architect and Building News</i> the reviewer marveled at how penguins with "a taste for 

<b></b>

publicity" enjoyed themselves.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  The reviewer in <i>Architect's Journal</i> argued that the pool was a genuine attempt "to preserve the birds from the boredom which generally overtakes all zoo inhabitants" since the birds now had an opportunity to display their social talents on the double helix ramps.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  These views were not taken lightly by an American zoo critic who argued that the London Zoo projects had a "flavor of a circus or a country carnival" for "pure pleasure and amusement of their owner" with the tragic result that "the educational or scientific value of an English zoo is nearly zero."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>

<p>
The problem with the interpretation of the Zoo as a circus by historians today as well as reviewers of the 1930s, is that it does not explain why the keepers of the Zoo chose to house their animals in such an environment. Being trained as biologists, they fashioned themselves as serious scientists and not as managers of a zoological circus. If one looks at the Tecton buildings from these scientists' perspective, a quite different view of the role of architecture and animals emerges. They were the ones who paid the construction bill, and as clients of Tecton, they had a significant say in how they imagined their new zoo buildings. Though they welcomed entertainment that could generate general interest in biology (and money from entrance fees), they were not willing to pursue amusement at the expense of their scientific integrity or the welfare of the animals.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
It was the promotion of public health and not amusement which prompted the Zoo keepers to build modernist architecture. It is telling that when the research anatomist at the Zoological Society, Solly Zuckerman, recalls the Tecton architecture firm, his first memories are of yoghurt.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  They were a group of seven young architects in their mid-twenties struggling to find work in a sluggish economy. One of Lubetkin's colleagues tried to make a buck selling his East-European family dairy secret, which incidentally introduced yoghurt to the English market. It was exactly such new, white, clean, and healthy diary products that intrigued Zuckerman, who was concerned about public health. He was decidedly on the left side of the political arena and consequently sympathetic to new ideas from East-Europe. Zuckerman heard about the yoghurt news through Godfrey Samuel (son of the Liberal politician Herbert Samuel), who had recently graduated from the Architectural Association and now worked on the Tecton team. A friend of his, Philip D'Arcy Hurt, introduced Zuckerman to the young Samuel. Hurt was at the time researching the alarming distribution of tuberculosis in England. He believed modernist architecture could provide a healthier home with better air and more light for the English poor.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Zuckerman might also have learned about Ove Arup through his father Paul Seidelin Arup who was a well known veterinarian among British zoologists.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  The story of how Zuckerman met and eventually came to promote Tecton among the zoologists thus points towards issues of public health, rather than elaborate design and circus.
</p>

<p>
There was more to the new architecture than public health and yoghurt. When the Zoological Society purchased two young gorillas for its Zoo in 1932, Zuckerman became the chief source of authority on how to house them. It was with respect to this problem that he started to promote Tecton. He had just published a major piece on "The Menstrual Cycle of Primates" where he argued that the cycle was the key to understanding the sexual, and thus social life of primates.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  The importance of fresh air and stable temperatures in a gorilla house was apparently vital for regular menstruation, a fact that came to determine Tecton's design. According to Zuckerman, the difference between human and animal behavior was "almost certainly one of degree only," and one could consequently see the life of primates as "a crude picture of a social level from which emerged our earliest human ancestors."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  He argued this in <i>The Social Life of Monkeys</i> , where the life of primates serves as a model for explaining deeper sexual and social instincts in humans. Visitors at the Zoo observing the gorillas would thus also observe and reflect upon their own primitive desires. It was consequently of moral importance to place the gorillas in a model home for healthy living.
</p>

<p>
Zuckerman was the first of several scholars at the Zoo who was interested in modernist architecture. He introduced Lubetkin to the superintendent Geoffrey Vevers and to the secretary of the Zoological Society Peter Chalmers-Mitchell, who also came to promote Bauhaus design. Chalmers-Mitchell believed evolutionary biology gave support to a cooperative model of social behavior, and that antiwar and peaceful coexistence was the best strategy for evolutionary survival among animals as well as humans.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  All species could prosper in a healthy and peaceful environment, and penguins were no exception. Using penguins as an example, he argued that "the most unlikely animals 

<b></b>

seem to thrive under what would seem the most unnatural conditions [provided that they] gain freedom from enemies, regular food and general hygiene."<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  The same would hold for workers and the poor who were in desperate need of being liberated from their 'natural' condition of criminal and filthy slums. It was thus of revolutionary importance to display thriving animals in an unnatural setting as if to prove that humans too could prosper in a new environment. Chalmers-Mitchell arranged for unemployed miners to perform a large part of the heavy work in constructing the Zoo buildings, since this allowed them to be in "good open-air conditions until they had recovered sufficiently, mentally and physically, to pass out into the ordinary labour world."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  The health and welfare of people and animals were of equal concern, and the new architecture was to promote it. The Zoological Garden, he believed, should be a place where humans could have a "close up view" and reflect on their shared instincts of cooperation with other animals.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The newspapers and the popular press wrote about the new buildings in the same language of healthy environments for animals and humans alike. <i>The Times</i>, for example, noted that the objective of the penguin pool was to have "architectural unity and pleasing effect, and at the same time be thoroughly hygienic, give the birds what they require, and afford ample space for visitors."<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  Likewise, the gorilla house was praised for being a healthy and hygienic home rather than for being inventively designed.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  A popular history of the London Zoo of 1936 took the zoo to be a "very good indicator as regards the nation's material, and indeed spiritual health." Its new architecture should serve as model for the "ultra modern human dwelling-house" complete with "access to the outer air" with opportunities to have a healthy "sun-bath."<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  A healthy environment at the Zoo was to be a model for healthy human living in tomorrow's society.
</p>

<p>
The cooperative view on society and evolution was based on a mechanist footing, as Chalmers-Mitchell argued in a lecture on "Logic and law in biology" in 1932.<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  Inspired by Marxist materialism, he thought sound social policies should be founded on logic, physics, biology and social psychology. The aesthetic language of geometric logic in Tecton's penguin pool was to Chalmers-Mitchell a visual representation of the foundation of modern biology. These ideas were inspired by new ways of understanding evolutionary biology among left leaning London scientists. Biologists had, since the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's theories, fought over whether their research should have an evolutionary or genetic footing, and a mathematical turn in biological methodology of 1930 was seen as a revolution in the field.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>  This evolutionary synthesis had its precursor in mechanistic views of nature promoted by John B. S. Haldane and Julian Huxley in their popular book <i>Animal Biology</i> of 1927.<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  The new mechanistic and mathematical approach in biology was to Huxley a key material basis for a successful, orderly planning of the human society, through a new urban matrix of mathematically inspired Bauhaus architecture.<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  The geometric order of the Zoo buildings became a visual representation of the promising mathematical turn in biological research models. The new Bauhaus households mirrored this new order of the household of nature.
</p>

<p>
In April 1934 the Zoological Society hired Huxley to replace Chalmers-Mitchell who retired (and subsequently went to t on the socialist side of the Spanish Civil War). 

<b></b>

In his new job he continued the program of Bauhaus architecture at the Zoo with a Studio of Animal Art designed by Tecton and completed in 1937. It was used daily by a group of about 200 students who came to draw live animals. Despite the success, Huxley tried in vain to convince the Council to extend the program of modernist design to a new elephant house, with two proposals designed by Fry and Lubetkin respectively. The Council rejected them both for financial, aesthetic, and political reasons.
</p>

<p>
Huxley was hired by the Council chiefly due to the public success of his nature film <i>The Private Life of the Gannet</i> , directed by Alexander Korda.<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  As soon as he got the job he published one of his most high-profile socialist books tellingly entitled <i>If I Were Dictator</i> . It did not go over well with the conservative dons at the Council. It is filled with grandiose socialist ideas for "the remodelling of the life of a nation" steered by a scientific elite elected not on democratic but on scientific merit.<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  His chief source of inspiration was the Tennessee Valley Authority in the United States. Huxley visited Tennessee in 1932 and came back deeply impressed by the project's large scale architectural reorganization of nature and society. It served him as a model for how to proceed with the British Isles. He encouraged Gropius to visit the region upon his departure for the United States. The Bauhaus architecture of TVA has only recently been subject to historical analysis, thanks to a first-rate study of Christine Macy and Sarah Bonnemaison.<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  They argue that the design project aimed at establishing a communitarian utopia where economic competition and conflict were replaced by expert planning and cooperation. The project was part of the New Deal, and aimed at restoring a landscape suffering from environmental degradation as well as helping rural farmers in adapting to a modern lifestyle. In the spirit of the old Bauhaus school, TVA promoted a culture of paternalism and 'macho' design solutions with respect to gender and the role of women.<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  The chief architect of the project, the Hungarian &#x000E9;migr&#x000E9; Roland Wank, evoked the bio-technique methodology of his compatriot Moholy-Nagy by using nature's energy as a model when designing buildings, dams, highways, landscapes, and recreational parks.<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In Huxley's many public appearances, he fashioned himself in the image of the TVA Director and architect conducting "major experiments in social planning" on the British Isles.<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>  As master builder of the nation he would offer a New Deal for the Brits that abandoned private ownership, cleared slums, and built new housing communities, all in the interest of the needy. In reality, though, Huxley was not a director of his country, but only secretary of the London Zoological Society. In this job he was free to project his grand visions into the animal kingdom by making sure that the animal's housing and living conditions served as a model for how to organize tomorrow's human world.

4. Things to Come in the New Bauhaus of Nature
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
H. G. Wells was a frequent visitor at the Zoo. As a collaborator with Huxley, he was involved in debates among urban planners, Bauhaus architects, and ecologists about the future welfare of the human and natural world. This section will discuss the TVA-inspired vision for remodeling the British Isles that appears at the end of his science 

<b></b>

fiction film <i>Things to Come</i> . Film historians have described in detail its socialist agenda, its creative use of new design and filming techniques, and its popularity.<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>  Yet, the same historians have failed to discuss how the science of ecological engineering informed its entire layout and set design. The final scenes of the movie summarize what the London Bauhaus was all about.
</p>

<p>
Wells' collaboration with Huxley on the book <i>The Science of Life</i>  triggered his interest in ecology. It became one of the most widely read books about the life sciences in the twentieth century. In it they developed a new "Ecological Outlook" on the relationship between the economy of nature and society.<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>  This relationship was in serious trouble, they argued, due to inefficient and extensive use of nature's matter and energy at the expense of future generations. One had to move from free market capitalism to planned economy in order to control the "breeding storm" of the human population and the impending danger of environmental havoc.<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>  They suggested taking action against smoke pollution, cleaning up the atmosphere by limited use of coal and oil, and ecologically sound ways of using fertilizers. Only progressive evolution of new machinery, architecture, and scientific discoveries would prove to solve the ecological crisis. They argued, for example that "from the point of view of Mr. Everyman's skin," architects should make sure "to keep the air in a room fresh and stimulating" by securing ventilation and climate control.<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The basic principle behind their way of ordering society was to channel nature's energy into more efficient and thus better human use. Wells thought of this understanding of an efficiently planned economy as "a branch of ecology; it is the ecology of human species."<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>  Through his 900-page treatise about a scientifically planned future entitled <i>The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind</i> of 1931, he explains not only architecture but all economic activity in terms of how human animals learn to conquer and control the economy of nature for the benefit of a progressing civilization. Advancements in architecture were signs of evolutionary progress in Wells' ecologically informed outline of human history.<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>  For Wells, human ecological adaptability became a guiding tool in judging the success of various human activities and policies.<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>  The latest development in modern architecture was particularly instructive as a vehicle for rebuilding a new world on the ruins of past environmental destructions. Le Corbusier's <i>Urbanism</i>, which Wells read in its English translation as <i>The City of Tomorrow</i> , was one of his sources of inspiration.<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>  Le Corbusier's focus on the importance of air, sunlight, geometry, and orderly planning was to Wells an example of the importance of architecture in laying out a new ecological world order that would secure the evolutionary survival of humankind. The British architects appreciated the support of modern design from an influential writer like H. G. Wells. He was invited to lecture at the Royal Institute of Architecture where he argued Corbusier-style that "light was becoming a material of architecture."<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Architecture was at the heart of Wells' visions of how people of the future would live collectively to control effectively the climate of air and light in buildings. Town and city planning based on ecological zoning of the environment was urgently needed to fix the number of people living in one place and thus get the population problem 

<b></b>

under control.<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>  A "possible rebuilding of the world," Wells argued, should be the chief task of "Modern Architecture," and he pointed to the work of Ronald Aver Duncan as a promising example.<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>  Duncan, a Lecturer in the History of Architecture at the Architectural Association in London, argued that there was a historical shift in construction techniques from wet materials like mud, cement, mortar and brick to dry materials like steel, plastic and glass. This was all due to a shift in manufacture from skilled handicrafts to mass production. Wells, who grew up in a poor, wet, subterranean brick basement, found Duncan's argument about the coming of an age of dry materials compelling, because it meant more fresh air and sunlight in buildings.<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>  He saw the movement from wet to dry and from handicraft to mass production in architecture as a leap forward in the biological evolution of human development.
</p>

<p>
In <i>The Shape of Things to Come</i> of 1933 Wells predicts the rebuilding of society with the help of the bio-technique and scientific management of the economy of nature.<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>  The book caught interest and a theatre adaptation of the story subsequently played in London.<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>  Wells agreed that Korda could make a film version of the book under the unusual condition that he would be in editorial control of every aspect of the film.<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>  It became the most costly movie of the time due to the large and complex set designs that Wells requested as a way to illustrate the shape of the future. The result was a saga about the downfall of industrial society caused by endless wars and environmental problems. At the end of the movie Wells chooses to save humanity when a group of engineers, planners, architects and ecologists mysteriously arrives in one of Norman Bell Geddes' futuristic planes of 1932.<sup><a name="REF79" href="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>  This sequence was also inspired by Le Corbusier's <i>Aircraft</i> of 1935, which focuses on the importance of aerodynamic design for future societies.<sup><a name="REF80" href="#FOOT80">80</a></sup>  They land, and in military formation march out to save Everytown, Wells' image of anywhere on earth. The hero John Cabal forms a governing board to steer the world's natural and social economy through enlightened ecological dictatorship.<sup><a name="REF81" href="#FOOT81">81</a></sup>  He then tells this exclusive group of engineers, planners, architects and ecologists that "we have ideas in common; the freemasonry of efficiency&#x02014;the brotherhood of science. We are the natural trustees of civilization when everything else has failed."<sup><a name="REF82" href="#FOOT82">82</a></sup>  This brotherhood establishes a regime of authoritarian enlightenment founded on principles of ecological reasoning, planning, and architecture.
</p>

<p>
The story then fast-forwards to 2054. The population problem has solved itself quietly and mysteriously, and a new fantastic society has arisen. This sequence, which lasts for about one-and-a-half minutes, was designed by Moholy-Nagy. It captures the vitalist evolution of humankind from the world of the warlords to the glorious rule of scientific design and management. Using bio-technique, the architects of the future were able to create a better human world by capturing the vital energies of the earth. It is a story of how engineers first built a huge mining machine which blasts its way into the earth, building a second nature inside an enormous cave. The process of building the cave recapitulates the development of construction techniques from wet to dry materials (following Duncan's theory). A huge electric power plant empowers steelworks which transform wet rocks into shining steel plates from which the new city is being built. Indeed, Moholy-Nagy's wife Sibyl recalls that her husband tried with 

<b></b>

"[t]he fantastic technology of the Utopian city of the future [to] eliminate solid form. Houses were no longer obstacles to, but receptacles of, man's natural life force, light."<sup><a name="REF83" href="#FOOT83">83</a></sup>  The sequence&#x02014;accompanied with modern music by Arthur Bliss&#x02014;holds a series of experimental images which capture the evolution of human ecology in action.<sup><a name="REF84" href="#FOOT84">84</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The Bauhaus style cave-city had an ecological order. (<a href="#3"> 3</a>) Originally, Wells and Korda asked Le Corbusier and his colleague Fernand Leger to design the cave-city, but both of them declined.<sup><a name="REF85" href="#FOOT85">85</a></sup>  This may be due to the fact that Wells and Le Corbusier did not see eye to eye politically. As a second choice, Alexander Korda asked his younger brother Vincent to execute the job with Wells' son Frank along with special effects director Ned Mann. Vincent Korda believed in a division of labor between the set designer and the artist,<sup><a name="REF86" href="#FOOT86">86</a></sup>  and he therefore outsourced much of the architectural work of creating the cave-city to Moholy-Nagy, who for his part had argued for artistic independence.<sup><a name="REF87" href="#FOOT87">87</a></sup>  Gropius served as a consultant to Vincent Korda at one point, making sure the cave would reflect Bauhaus design principles. All of them might also have been inspired by Breuer, who at the time was busy drawing up his own plan for a garden city which bears some of the same features as the cave-city in <i>Things to Come</i>.<sup><a name="REF88" href="#FOOT88">88</a></sup>  The basic scheme of the cave, however, was Ebenezer Howard's garden city which Wells admired as the city plan of tomorrow.<sup><a name="REF89" href="#FOOT89">89</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Wells envisioned a perfectly geometrically ordered ideal ecological society as a sort of island Eden dominated by technology which would channel nature's energy into maximum food production without causing pollution or other environmental problems. Here people moved on flying walkways, sat on curved balconies, and were transported through transparent ducts: all emphasized the movement of people and energy in a streamlined ecological city system. Living in a cave meant full control over all life forces including light and air. Everytown was built as a closed environmental ecosystem with a perfect balance of air and light securing the best possible living conditions for everyone and thus evolutionary survival for the species. As a pleased ecologist explains in the movie: "Our light is brighter than the sunshine outside and never before has mankind breathed so sweet an air. We have got the better of nature."<sup><a name="REF90" href="#FOOT90">90</a></sup>  A series of oxygen machines (trees) on the eleventh floor and the food machines (bushes) on every floor inside the cave secured daily needs. These were stacked in levels within the cave to save space, (thus anticipating current design of Winy Maas's "Datacity-Metatown" project).<sup><a name="REF91" href="#FOOT91">91</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
<i>Things to Come</i> received raving reviews in the press. It became a box-office hit, but not a financial success due to the costly set designs of the movie. Though some were skeptical of the "mystic communion with machinery" in tomorrow's society, the Bauhaus design was regarded as "the real triumph" of the film.<sup><a name="REF92" href="#FOOT92">92</a></sup>  The architects were also excited about the film, and located the design of the cave-city in the ongoing debate about urban planning. One architect reviewer suggested that the film pointed towards a path of horizontal rather than vertical organization of living spaces, where people could enjoy town life in the vertical cave and country life in the horizontal surface.<sup><a name="REF93" href="#FOOT93">93</a></sup>  Another comment proposed that the cave design was "easily the best work" of functionalism "yet done in England."<sup><a name="REF94" href="#FOOT94">94</a></sup>  <i>Architectural Forum</i> published a note arguing that the underground city represented "Man's final break with his natural environment," a 

<b></b>

remark which makes sense if one recalls that the cave was to be a second nature based on a new ecological order.<sup><a name="REF95" href="#FOOT95">95</a></sup>

The film was by no means the culmination of Wells' ecological opinions. He would, for the rest of his life, promote the urgent need for humans to adapt to the ecological reality of life through technology.<sup><a name="REF96" href="#FOOT96">96</a></sup>  As Britain plunged into war he published a <i>Guide to the New World</i>  in order to cheer up the nation. This was basically the old vision in a modified 1951 (instead of 2054) version. Reborn Britain, as he saw it, would 

<b></b>

be "green as ever," freed from capitalism with plenty of nature reserves and small high-tech and neatly designed villages with people living in harmony with the ecosystem. The housing will be "more of an open air camp," due to scientific advances in air-conditioning systems. These accomplishments "will make architecture the most enviable of professions in the world ahead." "Architecture will [in 1951] become a master art, as it was in the days of Pericles," he argued.<sup><a name="REF97" href="#FOOT97">97</a></sup>  All slums will disappear and people will live as nomads, moving around with the energy flow of nature. The book was written at the darkest time of the war for the Allies, and Wells thought of his war effort as providing his fellow countrymen with some hope at a time of despair. Yet disillusion caught up with his utopian visions, as indicated in the title of one of his last novels, <i>All Aboard for Ararat</i> . <sup><a name="REF98" href="#FOOT98">98</a></sup>  With Europe lapsing into chaos, he now envisioned himself as Noah sailing species and scientists in his ark through rough weather to the Promised Land of Ararat, where they would lay the foundation for the new sustainable ecological world state.
</p>

<p>
In reality, Gropius and Moholy-Nagy became the Noah res for the London Bauhaus, taking the reminiscence of their school respectively to Harvard University and The New Bauhaus School in Chicago. Gropius landed his ark on an "Ararat" next to Walden Pond where Henry Thoreau once lived. In similar fashion to the American environmental philosopher, Gropius warned against industrialism and capitalistic greed that could come to dominate human life unless architects approached design and the environment in a responsible way. Responsibility to him was a question of nurturing an "organic social structure" by designing with natural and not greedy capital forces: "Overwhelmed by the miraculous potentialities of the machine, our human greed has interfered with the biological cycle of human companionship which keeps the life of a community healthy."<sup><a name="REF99" href="#FOOT99">99</a></sup>  A similar line of argument was pursued by Moholy-Nagy at Chicago when he envisioned "happy and organic cities of which inhabitants have the experience of being amidst gardens and vegetation daily, not on their weekend trips only."<sup><a name="REF100" href="#FOOT100">100</a></sup>  His famous <i>Vision in Motion</i>  was in effect "an attempt to add to the politico-social a <i>biological 'bill of rights'</i>" for people to live in harmony with nature's household.<sup><a name="REF101" href="#FOOT101">101</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Their visions for rebuilding America were basically a blueprint of Wells' Everytown in <i>Things to Come</i>, a movie which built on ecological arguments developed by the London Bauhaus. This was in line with Gropius' "lifelong aim," according to Huxley, which "was to work for the reunification of art and science, without which there can be no true culture."<sup><a name="REF102" href="#FOOT102">102</a></sup>  They both saw a science-based culture as a precondition for human health and evolutionary survival. Then, as today, architects fashioned themselves as "design outlaws" inventing sustainable houses modeled on the household of nature that would safeguard the future ecological existence for the human species.<sup><a name="REF103" href="#FOOT103">103</a></sup>

1. Expressing Speed
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
In <i>Under the Volcano</i>, Geoffrey Firmin, a former British consul, despairs over a failed marriage in the bars of Quauhnahuac, Mexico. On this day his former wife, Yvonne, returns to save him, hoping to lure him away from Mexico to an Elysian cabin. Stagnant failures of the past coalesce with apocalyptic visions when the narrative engine of a lifetime comes to a halt and all the boxcars of a lifetime collide with the present.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  The Consul is physically killed by an Indian's runaway horse that is frightened by the storm, so the express train is only the rative cause of his death. On the Day of the Dead, November 2, 1938, from seven <small class="caps">A.M.</small> to seven <small class="caps">P.M.</small>, a lifetime is contained in a day that speeds towards death in a stream-of-consciousness narrative with the accelerating structure of an express train. Typographically, we are on a swift course winding through the Mexican terrain. From the rative broken track ending Chapter 1 to its continuation in Chapter 2, <i>Under the Volcano</i> makes it clear we have boarded a speeding narrative that conveys death:

<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
As a noun, "express" can refer to hyper-chronology, an excess of minutes, a zeal for adventure, a speeding train, or an alcoholic's disease; as a verb, "express" is to communicate, love, and forgive.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  The linear track from the first chapter in 1939 carries the express train into 1938 of the second chapter, traveling backwards into the black tunnel&#x02014;or black hole&#x02014;of the past for a final, fleeting act of forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
Upon her arrival in Mexico, Yvonne asks the taxi driver, "But why, Fernando, why should a corpse be transported by express, do you suppose?" Then she reconsiders, "&#x02014;on the other hand, damn it, Fernando, why shouldn't it? Why shouldn't a corpse be transported by express?" (<i>UV</i>, 44). Fernando reasons: "Absolutamente necesario" (<i>UV</i>, 44). Why is death in a hurry? Why should time speed for a corpse that has vacated time rather than setting a slower pace that would prolong its passage and sustain its longevity? Speeding trains also convey death in Charles Dickens' serial novel, <i>Dombey &amp; Son</i>  and in Alfred Hitchcock's film, <i>The Lady Vanishes</i> <sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> . Dickens' novel prophesies that industrialized, express time will cause vertigo that leads to death and in Hitchcock's film, the train's velocity is indicative of the vulnerable psychological state of a rushed passenger&#x02014;such as a spy or a woman separated from her fianc&#x000E9;&#x02014;who currently lacks the ability to rest securely at home and must keep moving.
</p>

<p>
The path of life is charted as though on train tracks, relentlessly moving to its final depot despite our itinerary. The train is not only speeding but it is also heading to a destination unstoppably. If a mountain stands in its way, it passes through a dark tunnel. But in <i>Under the Volcano</i>, the express is subterranean&#x02014;never appearing on stage. With only a few references, the trace of the railroad tracks is faint, even imperceptible; after all, in Quauhnahuac, "there was little to suggest any train ever arrived at this station, let alone left it" (<i>UV</i>, 8). Lowry does not show us the train or its course, but he announces its passage. To consider this image is to interpret the force of speed and read its movement.
</p>

<p>
Etymologically, "locomotive" comes from <i>locus</i> ("place") and <i>motivus</i> ("causing motion"). As a noun, a locomotive is a self-propelled vehicle for pushing or pulling cars along tracks; a driving or pulling force; an impetus. As an adjective, "locomotive" pertains to the power of progressive motion, or the ability to move independently from place to place, apparently without a conductor or author; yet a locomotive's movement is determined by the railroad track's successive, linear structure. Paradoxically, in <i>Under the Volcano</i>, the trochal or wheel-like revolutions of speed are read and paced according to the chronology of the narrative track.
</p>

<p>
Prominent events of the three main characters' lives are memorialized on the Day of the Dead as a swan song for Yvonne and Geoffrey Firmin. Express adventures whisk Hugh across the globe; out of his zealous need to communicate and be admired, travel becomes the impersonal escape from his vulnerability and fear of being common. Express idealism conjures Yvonne's starry vision of her dream home with the 

<b></b>

Consul; in an instant, her tendency towards catasterism transforms quotidian reality into superstardom. Express alcoholism speeds the Consul to his own submersion at the bar where the drinks cannot come quickly enough. The downward-destined Consul drinks in steady tempo to ease his plummet into the liquid abyss, engulfing him like a geyser at the earth's core. He drinks to stay sober. An idealist who is dissatisfied with easy answers, he has lost his faith in himself, others, and God. He bides his time until he expires downward into the mire, drinking because he cannot plunge into a pool and drench his soul in waters of vitality on the earth's surface. Like Charon's boat carrying souls to Hades, the express train transports a corpse in Chapter 2, ushering the reader to a speedy death. When express alcoholism reaches the station in Chapter 12, the corpse has been delivered by day's end when the unidentified corpse becomes recognizable as the Consul's.
</p>

<p>
As Lowry's text explores the basin of a volcano, the possibility of a sudden eruption is imagined, as is the struggle to convey words that will restore a broken marriage&#x02014;the express expressions that should be exchanged quickly to defeat the prevailing silence. <i>Under the Volcano</i> may summarize Lowry's deepest feelings about his life in the context of the Spanish Civil War and Second World War. In Chapter 12, his reflections are narrowed down to a single chapter; condensed in time, history is abridged and the pace quickens. Subjective and historical material fuels the novel's velocity; the speed of a lifetime and history become tangible mental processes in the image of an express train. All the strands of the book gather in the presence of all-time and in the wake of apocalypse. In the twelfth chapter, in the twelfth hour of the day, the Consul is murdered when the express train reaches its destination.
</p>

<p>
The rush of events attains the speed of light and is no longer traceable; the narrative ends when the pace of a lifetime measured by the clock reaches vertigo and outruns grammatical conveyance. Motifs lie in wait as the chapter opens, dammed and damned by the Consul's obsessive order at the bar, "Mescal." The silence is filled with the tempo of waiting: "the ticking of his watch, his heart, his conscience, a clock somewhere" (<i>UV</i>, 349). The mescal creates rivulets in the suspended moment and the hallucination seeps in. Once the dam breaks, the Consul is drowned by the surging flood of images from the Day of the Dead&#x02014;<i>Las Manos de Orlac</i>, the volcanoes Popocatepetl and Ixtaccihuatl, the Ferris wheel, skeletons, the express train&#x02014;that merge with those from a lifetime&#x02014;the tequila bottle, Atlantis, St. Catherine, angels, Dante, Yvonne.
</p>

<p>
With reference to Chapter 12, Lowry proudly notes it "is definitely the best of the lot," and he adds,
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Ultimately, a confluence occurs at the bend of silence in the culminating Chapter 12 when the stream of consciousness floods life before the moment of death.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

2. The Moving Image: From the Big Bang to the Big Crunch
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Critics have understood the novel through its trochal structure, and even Lowry admits that he attempted to design a circular novel, but the image of the express train has been overlooked as <i>Under the Volcano's</i> interpretive key. Like the view from a speeding train, the stream of consciousness technique presents existence as a temporal blur of the living (the bartenders, revelers dressed as skeletons on the Day of the Dead, and the Consul's brother, Hugh) and the dead (his ex-wife who is as symbolically dead to him as the dormant volcanoes). Despite recurrent images in the fluid stream of consciousness narrative improvised like a jazz performance, the novel proceeds from a beginning through the middle to an end in Aristotelian form. The straight arrow of its course makes its primary concern speed, rather than the architecture of time and space so graphically depicted in Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i>.
</p>

<p>
In 1951, Lowry wrote to a young novelist remarking on the difficulty of following Dante's direct path to paradise led by Virgil: "For no wonder Dante found the straight way was lost. There is no straight way. There is no path, unless metamorphosed. Dante's wood was an abyss [ . . . ] And I ain't no Virgil" (<i>SL</i>, 253). Having given himself fully to the moment, the Consul experiences the eternal time of Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i> with its map charting the eternal vertical horizon from the inferno to paradise, instead of making a terrestrial pilgrimage on a horizontal plane moving from the past into the future. The Consul sits on a rushing train of time, contemplating the whirl of events encircling his compartment, expecting that at the speed of light, he would encounter the brilliant realm of Dante's paradise.
</p>

<p>
However, a simultaneity of past, present, and future would be meaningless. Time requires a readable order of events structuring the narrative. Stephen Hawking's <i>A Brief History of Time</i> envisions the universe arising from a black hole and collapsing into one&#x02014;the birth and death of time with an instantaneous initial bang and an equally rapid final crunch.
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
According to the general theory of relativity, there must have been a state of infinite density in the past, the big bang, which would have been an effective beginning of time. Similarly, if the whole universe recollapsed, there must be another state of infinite density in the future, the big crunch, which would be an end of time.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Like Hawking's brief history of scientific time, Lowry's Chapter 12 of <i>Under the Volcano</i> is "a brief history of fictive time" in which all the novel's themes converge into another hole&#x02014;the funnel of a volcano&#x02014;where the Consul feels himself racing into the abyss. Stephen Hawking mentions the "arrow of time that we observe," a symbol that not 

<b></b>

only indicates a straight path but also blinding speed (<i>ABHOT</i>, 190). Like partakers of literary time, Hawking, the scientist, is awed by the rush of time. An arrow is directive and determined to reach its aim, even when it points into a black hole or a black tunnel. The direction of time's arrow is crucial to destiny. In the barroom of the Farolito, the Consul mentally climbs the sheer height of the volcano with his gaze, then falls to the abysmal bottom of the ravine (<i>UV</i>, 351).
</p>

<p>
The key to understanding Lowry's text comes through the image and Gilles Deleuze offers a useful hermeneutic and rationale for considering Lowry's poetic image of speed. In a two-volume series, <i>Cinema 1: The Movement-Image</i> and <i>Cinema 2: The Time-Image</i>, Deleuze cites the Second World War as a break between the classical cinematic image based on <i>movement</i> and the post-war image based on <i>time</i>. Lowry wrote <i>Under the Volcano</i> between the two world wars, which is the period when Deleuze believes the brain became cinematic. The textual express train parallels the movement-image as it races towards its final depot in the apocalyptic Chapter 12 when all threads of the narrative converge, as well as the time-image as the train attempts to meet its scheduled arrival. Lowry's narrative express train occupies the very gap between Deleuze's movement- and time-images; the novel forms a suspension bridge for the moving blur of Lowry's locomotive like the dash on a tombstone between life and death.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Movement and time are the locomotive and its track.
</p>

<p>
Deleuze's cinematic model is defined by the use of associative images, the rhythm of the noncommensurable and irrational, and a preoccupation with movement; qualities that allow us to read <i>Under the Volcano</i> as though turning the pages of a flipbook, visualizing linguistic signs as images in the act of reading. Early cinema relies on moving images that indirectly create filmic time through narrative, subordinating editing to the story which <i>Under the Volcano</i> accomplishes; modern cinema reverses this paradigm, which Lowry also paradoxically achieves through his unlinked images including <i>Las Manos de Orlac</i> and autonomous scenes like the characters' backstories which are important in themselves.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Lowry also experiments with the noncommensurable onslaught of independent, apocalyptic images that are relinked through irrational cuts, rather than through clear association; Deleuze calls this direct presentation of time a "chronic non-chronological time which produces movements" (<i>TI</i>, 129). Like a passenger on an express train, after the Second World War, a direct time image is conveyed by time, wholly dependent on the vehicle, bypassing stops and proceeding with "voluntarily involuntary" movements; the direct time image is a passive being, swept through time, submissive to its destination.
</p>

<p>
Neither the movement- nor the time-image has to predominate in a binary paradigm. Rather, a system of relationships between movement and temporal elements can be formed out of which the variable present flows. The rush of the locomotive defies standard time, becoming a postmodern time-image of associative rather than successive connections; however, it also needs its track which signifies the static movement-image of classical cinema that relies on a predictable, navigable course. Because it is not simply one type of image, Lowry's express train allows an approach with the creative freedom to ask "What is there to see in the image?" instead of "What are we 

<b></b>

going to see in the next image?" (<i>TI</i>, 272). Lowry's will to art reveals unknown aspects of the time-image in the express train, but does not abandon the rail. Just as the novel occupies the gap between Deleuze's two volumes, the narrative is never located in the present, but in the representative network of tensions&#x02014;a blur between the Big Bang and the Big Crunch.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
<i>Under the Volcano</i>'s accelerating structure takes the locomotive of classical cinema, in which the engine pulls the train, and lays the track in a tunnel of nonlinear time with a vertigo of images and a circular track that begins and ends at the same depot: the Consul is dead in Chapter 1 in 1939, and he dies in Chapter 12 in 1938. The beginning, middle, and end of the track presupposes linearity, but the passengers on board Lowry's narrative look out the window to discover nonlinear time. This simultaneous movement- and time-image is a phenomenon of imaginative literature, metaphysics, and life, but not of the empirical sciences that stipulate a successive past-present-future. Velocity is always variable and relative, and the relationships between speeds "can only appear in a creation of the image" that cannot be seen in the object and cannot be reduced to the present.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Art has the power to capture velocity&#x02014;coexisting in different durations&#x02014;in the image.

3. The Trochal Design is on Track
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Ronald G. Walker's study, "'The Weight of the Past:' Toward a Chronology of <i>Under the Volcano</i>," finds the Ariadne thread of chronology and reconstitutes the novel's narrative structure in a chart. Events in the present unfold chronologically, repeatedly interrupted by departures into anterior time from 1900 to 1939.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  And yet Lowry consciously attempted to avoid chronology, insisting in an often-quoted letter:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The book should be seen as essentially trochal. I repeat, the form of it is a wheel, so that, when you get to the end, if you have read carefully, you should want to turn your eyes back to the beginning again [ . . . ] For the book was so designed, counterdesigned and interwelded that it could be read an indefinite number of times and still not have yielded all its meaning or its drama or its poetry.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<div class="attribution">
<!--_attribution-->
(<i>SL</i>, 86)
<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
The structure compels the reader to return to the first chapter set in 1939 and begin re-reading at the text's completion set in 1938. The Consul's life represents a timeline culminating on the Day of the Dead, 1938, but with every new reading his death is re-read, re-considered, and re-enacted in the first chapter. The reader experiences the dizzying effect of an engine chasing its caboose.
</p>

<p>
But how is it possible for <i>Under the Volcano</i> to be both nonlinear according to Walker's critical study and trochal according to the novelist? If we accept that the image of the express train accurately signifies the structure, then it reconciles the two. The train's measurable course has a beginning, middle, and is deprived of reincarnation with the finality of its ending.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  In contrast to the Aristotelian denouement of a movement-image, the uninterrupted, trochal cycle of birth, death and rebirth invokes the 

<b></b>

Buddhist concept of "samsara," reinforced by the nine references to the Ferris wheel.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  The track preres a narratable lifetime, helping us grasp our place on earth, one that rotates daily and circles the sun annually on its trajectory; Walker's chronological narrative track is the movement-image, but Lowry lays its rails on the solar system with its whirlpool of reincarnate revolutions.
</p>

<p>
The Consul embodies the novel's tension of movement and time. From his stationary point of view, the Consul is the narrative's relaxed passenger seated at the bar in the face of the intensifying plot. Even in a drunken stupor, the Consul is an image of movement (drinking successively) as well as of time (having hallucinatory visions of history and myth, the past and eternity).<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  The express train on its straight track&#x02014;the movement-image of successive railroad ties and the time-image of speed itself&#x02014;is crossing the bridge between Deleuze's movement- and time-image. The tension of the textual locomotive&#x02014;and the source of its re-readability&#x02014;comes from the relentless, unbridled power of the engine that spins the wheels relentlessly and the restraint of this invincible force by the guiding rails. One does not exist without the other: the linear movement-image of the track and the circular time-image of the wheel. Without the symbiosis, the speeding locomotive would be wrecked, just as Dante would have been lost in the inferno without Virgil as his guide. Even Quauhnahuac itself becomes an image of the express train on its course&#x02014;located as a point on a circle, the globe-girdling 19<sup>th</sup> parallel&#x02014;but also as a point on a line between two mountain chains.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The paradox that the novel is both linear and circular dominates all the facets of <i>Under the Volcano</i>, and this apparent contradiction makes either the timeline or wheel alone an inadequate representation of a mythical narrative with a sequence of events that is repeatedly interrupted by departures into anterior and posterior time, but has a clear beginning, middle, and end.

4. Sir Sanford Fleming Tames Equus Time
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Attempting to estimate the time of arrival of the express train carrying the corpse, characters obsessively check clocks in the Farolito, the bar where the Consul has his last drink. Desperate to become synchronized with his environment, the Consul sees the clock on the prison archway pointing to 6 <small class="caps">P.M.</small> and makes a mental note to order his next drink, tabulating the minutes and hours between drinks as though awaiting the corpse's arrival by express. Time feels insufferably slow for the Consul, but a novel depends on a character's willingness to suffer standardized clock time. Lowry may have known or intuited that trains may be the perfect symbol for relentless time since the time we observe in the twenty-first century began with nineteenth-century trains.
</p>

<p>
In <i>Time Lord: Sir Sanford Fleming and the Creation of Standard Time,</i> Clark Blaise traces standard time to its Victorian origin when organic faith clashed with mechanical science. Temporal position based on solar approximation resulted in temporal nightmares when the train accelerated pace to such an extent that passengers had to frequently reset clocks. Before Sir Sanford Fleming, engineer-in-chief of surveys for the 

<b></b>

Canadian Pacific Railways, standardized time zones in the late nineteenth century, time had been reckoned in a natural world by the biblically-sanctioned solar noon; maintained by the fixed laws of nature overseen by God; and determined by municipalities based on the sun's local position. Solar time allows every town to be its own Greenwich as the sun speeds along at 12 <sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup> /2 miles a minute, with a new solar second every 1,000 feet of the earth's 24,000-mile circumference (<i>TLSSF</i>, 37, 84). The modern age could not calculate this multiplicity of local times quickly enough. In the world of travel and commerce, standardization ended the temporal nightmare&#x02014;for making appointments and meeting deadlines&#x02014;reducing the number of time standards in the world "from infinity to twenty-four" (<i>TLSSF,</i> 160).
</p>

<p>
Pre-industrial cultures know the wheels of cosmic time: daily rhythms of sunrise and sunset, the moon's monthly cycle, and the earth's annual orbit around the sun causing the four seasons. In his brief 1936 essay, "Time and the Machine," Aldous Huxley observes that pre-industrial people never forgot "the majestic movement of cosmic time," whereas industrialized people have "lost the old awareness of time in its larger divisions."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Although paradoxically aware of the smallest constituents of time, "We have a new consciousness; but it has been purchased at the expense of the old consciousness" (<i>TATM</i>, 300). The Consul experiences both cosmic time and mechanized time on his final day&#x02014;a train ride into a black hole. The invisible wheels sustaining the solar system are reduced to <i>Under the Volcano's</i> locomotive wheels racing along a pitiless course toward death. Since the invention of the first steam engine, industrialization has been accelerating. The machinery of industrial time whirls on rapidly in the modern factory, and twenty-first century digital time leaves all gears behind and travels at the speed of light in waves that arrive instantly.
</p>

<p>
Blaise suggests that the two types of time&#x02014;natural and rational&#x02014;should have two names, like "horse" and "equus": analogous to time, "horse" describes the civil, domesticated standard version that is hard-working and obedient, the type we can control and describe, while "equus" is the untamed, mysterious phenomenon of the Big Bang, the one nature withholds (<i>TLSSF</i>, 14). Sir Sanford Fleming initiated modernism's temporal revolution in a demystified "Big Bang" that remapped, and recast, the globe. Modern time was created in 1876 when Fleming missed a train, so the frustrated engineer began devising standard time, dividing the world into 24 time zones (one zone for every thousand miles of the earth's 24,000 mile circumference) in an attempt to accommodate technological speed. (<a href="#1"> 1</a>)
</p>

<p>
These vertical lines dividing the globe would allow us to travel by gaps with an adjustment of the clock, rather than by minutes. To avoid the irregular sunrise and sunset and the shadowless, sun-dial moment when the sun stands directly overhead, standard time begins at midnight.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Blaise traces the pre-condition for the modern stream of consciousness novel, like the new consciousness Huxley defines, to the standardization of time.
</p>

<p>
The train made time in its own image. Huxley proclaims: "In inventing the locomotive, Watt and Stevenson were part inventors of time" (<i>TATM</i>, 299). Consciousness of minutes and seconds became acute when machines set the pace in factories and 

<b></b>

railways. "Our awareness of time has reached such a pitch of intensity that we suffer acutely whenever our travels take us into some corner of the world where people are not interested in minutes and seconds," (<i>TATM</i>, 299). In an express age, the goal is power, which increases speed and decreases time. (Elapsed time equals the distance divided by the rate of speed, and the rate is affected by increases in power.) The steam engine's velocity exceeded the usefulness of the horse, sail, and eventually, the sun (<i>TLSSF,</i> 24). The sun is too slow a metronome for the Industrial Revolution's velocity with its trains and telegraphs. Accelerated time leaves not only the horse and sail, but also the human laborer behind. The speed of time has increased, requiring adjustment to new velocities and the equal distribution of municipalities; nature is replaced with reason; and religion with humanism (<i>TLSSF,</i> 77). Technology replaces God and rapid progress governs trade and justice; velocity itself becomes the goal.

In <i>Cinema 2: The Time-Image</i>, Deleuze suggests a preference for a model like solar time that requires imaginative, heterogeneous readings without becoming a clockwork automaton, like the commercial film or novel that is deficient in thought, "a business, a pornography, a Hitlerism"; the cinema Deleuze envisions will serve the brain so that it has a direct experience of time (not movement) since "it is the time-image which calls on an original regime of images and signs, before electronics spoils it or, in contrast, relaunches it" (<i>TI</i>, 267). Lowry directly experiences this primordial consciousness in <i>Under the Volcano.</i> When the Indian is murdered by the Fascists in <i>Under the Volcano</i>, his horse becomes a frantic symbol of the apocalypse; the Consul unties the horse, stolen 

<b></b>

by the corrupt police, and it tramples Yvonne to death. The horse is from a past epoch when the couple shared time. Perhaps only their reconciliation&#x02014;and a return to the time of the natural, passionate, domesticated horse&#x02014;would prevent their deaths.
</p>

<p>
Yvonne and the Consul cannot keep up with the velocity caused by the upheaval of their conjugal relationship. In the rush of events from the past, present, and future, the couple fails to find a moment of rest together, so a once-synchronized couple is split, alienated from natural time, and destined to die in two time zones. Curiously, the former husband and wife die at the same time in the same city&#x02014;an image of simultaneous differences. Despite this synchronicity, their perceptions are in different dimensions in alternate lifetimes because time is relative. The couple reaches a fork where two time zones originate: an express train advances carrying a corpse on one; on the other a rider-less horse, frightened by the storm, stampedes through the forest. Had Yvonne and Geoffrey Firmin compromised in order to embrace the synergy of inter-dependent time, they might have survived the day through awakened time&#x02014;a standard that would have unified their weaknesses into a strength. On Fleming's train Yvonne and Geoffrey would share one, inseparable time. Horses keep pace with the sun. The medieval morality drama's protagonist, Everyman, makes a final, contemplative walk to his reckoning at a pace that is far too leisurely for the twentieth century; in the nineteenth century, Everyman would be steamrolled by the train.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

From Chicago to a nearby city in the east, a few minutes by car, we jump an hour. This infiltrates our internal chronology and it becomes forgivable to jump from A to Z without the intermediary steps: we may feel fragmented in the rush, transitioning from train station to train station, from the past to a present hundreds of miles away. We too rarely travel with the meditative second hand of footsteps. What happens when someone maintains alignment with the local sun in municipal time&#x02014;microscopically-attuned to place&#x02014;while the synchronized time of a zone causes a macrocosmic displacement? We learn the answer by reading about the disoriented Consul. Seated at the barstool in the Farolito, the Consul's conception of time is analogous to living simultaneously in two time zones. But like the two volcanoes and its valley, there is a yawning gap between the man he thought he would be and the man he is.
</p>

<p>
Fleming inherited the Victorian's solar time, and the twentieth century inherited Fleming's railway time. Likewise, the digital twenty-first century uses an outmoded time that is inherited, unchanged from the age of the train and telegraph, but requires a new model since it has already pulled ahead of its progenitor in the accelerating race to the end of time, its final depot when eternity begins. Perhaps it will be a globalized time reflective of time's absolute unity, like international Zulu time used by the airline industry. With an exponentially accelerating rate of progress, the future time could never be the intensely personal experience of the retired Consul. Speed finds its timeline as the steam engine finds its rails.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  In a culture of wakened time, the speed that light travels in .000000003335640952 of a second is a metre, a unit of standard measure for the velocity of the industrialized world with progressive frequency. But as technology caught up to the speed of light, human experience was left behind; an intuitive sense of pacing and an inner rhythm in sync with the sun, seasons, horse, and 

<b></b>

sail was forever changed once time had to keep up with the speeding telegraph and railway. Time calculates duration according to its superhuman velocity. Stopping time would mean stopping a speeding train at the unbreakable barrier of the speed of light, which is the speed of time.

6. Vanishing Time
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
As Lowry began writing <i>Under the Volcano</i>, Alfred Hitchock's <i>The Lady Vanishes</i>  was released. The film is set in a day, sharing the 24-hour, diurnal period of <i>Under the Volcano</i>. Even more concretely than in Lowry's metaphoric, express narrative, the majority of Hitchcock's film is visibly set on board a speeding train.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  The train's reckless speed and the inescapable sense of containment guarantees a relentless rush of adrenalin. The train is a stage on which characters perform without the props of daily life in an unlocatable metropolis where life and death situations force international people to act on their firmest convictions, either as a collective or in self-interest. In the film, an avalanche causes stranded international travelers to confront one another in the fictive country of Mandrinka somewhere in Eastern Europe. The prologue is set in a crowded hotel (the twenty minutes of diegetic time which is actually overnight in narrative time) before the train's departure the next morning and arrival at its destination before the day's end, like the express train's symbolic arrival at twilight in the final lines of <i>Under the Volcano</i>. The unspecified hours of departure and arrival reflect the tenuous circumstances surrounding the ominous trip. The avalanche cancels the train's initial schedule, and since part of the train is hijacked, it arrives late. It is the site of deception, abduction, and ts; it is uncoupled and ambushed in a shootout. Hitchcock's train is not the ominous express speeding beneath the surface of <i>Under the Volcano</i> without any obstruction. Despite setbacks, the express carrying its corpse does complete its trip&#x02014;with fatalities.
</p>

<p>
The screenplay is based on a novel, <i>The Wheels Spin</i>, and the train wheels shown in close-up suggest the determination of Fortune's wheel as well as samsara&#x02014;the cycle of reincarnation before release into nirvana&#x02014;or the Ferris wheel of <i>Under the Volcano</i>, as well as the hands of a clock rapidly spiraling across its face as time runs out. Hitchcock uses train wheels to signify the urgency of a deadline as time runs rampant, but will soon expire; the train's velocity reinforces the vertigo experienced by two passengers suffering from physical trama. The speeding train overpowers the protagonist, Iris, who takes a nap, feeling dizzy from an actual blow to her head; the train also facilitates the drugging and kidnapping of Miss Froy, a British spy. The train persists, while Iris and Miss Froy are abducted from the present; when the travelers come to a halt as a result of unconsciousness or sedation, time outdistances them. In the 1938 film, the two women reconnect with the present, consistent with the successive movement-image predominant at the time; however, in the 1947 novel, Geoffrey and Yvonne Firmin are tragically abandoned and forced out of mortal time, like disjointed time-images that have fallen into another dimension, and are not retrieved merely to complete narrative chronology. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Hitchcock constructs speed. Without a master shot objectively grounded outside of the train, we rely on its self-referential, subjective temporality. Time may be speeding, but in art it speeds at the director's pace as perceived by the viewer. When the camera shoots the train from its interior, the train with Hitchcock as its conductor, becomes its own Greenwich. While the opening credits show a master shot of the snow-covered Mandrinkan valley, the railroad tracks are not visible. The camera pans along the model set of a village, past a train depot where two idle trains sit, and continues to pan into the hotel window. The stranded passengers seem to have no way out from beneath the looming mountains, as though "under the volcano" and, like the Consul, they are looking for an escape.
</p>

<p>
Only once do we see a master shot of a real train crossing a bridge high above a valley, and it is one-third of the way into the film immediately after Iris and Miss Froy have breakfast and just before Miss Froy is abducted. The shot functions as the literal bridge between peace and crisis; the shot of the moving train announces the quickening pace. After the master shot of the train crossing the bridge, the clickety-clack grows louder and a sequence suggests delirium by atomizing the train, as if mechanized speed thrusts Iris into delirium. During her blackout, we see a medium shot of the engine, the wheels spinning, telephone wires passing by, the wheels again, the phone lines, the train tracks; as the whistle screams, Iris wakes to discover Miss Froy's disappearance. Conspirators planted on the train dismiss her suspicions as hallucinations; the high-speed train ride makes Iris susceptible to believing she is traumatized, processing data too slowly, and therefore mistaken.
</p>

<p>
According to Blaise's study tracing the standardization of time to the railroads, the speed of the train causes the inner clock of the human psyche to become unbalanced, causing travelers like Iris and Miss Froy&#x02014;or unsettled wanderers whisked into an express narrative like Yvonne and Geoffrey Firmin&#x02014;to suffer the effects of combat. Nineteenth-century psychiatrists reported nausea, hysteria, and a disorientation that could lead to madness among train passengers. Traveling 500% faster than the fastest stagecoach, perceived distances shrank by a factor of five, "which is a formula for social hysteria" (<i>TLSSF,</i> 139&#x02013;40). The litany of symptoms describes post-traumatic shock: anxiety, sleeplessness, headache, loss of appetite, generalized dread (<i>TLSSF,</i> 138, 141). Blaise diagnoses: "Locomotion is the life-force, and it is death; it is fate itself" (<i>TLSSF,</i> 141). To counter the disorientating fragmentation of a blurred foreground, travelers developed "panoramic vision"; a long-distance perspective focused on a faraway steeple or tree. No longer swaying to the natural stride of the horse on a leisurely stagecoach, travelers had to become defensive to protect their health against the temporal onslaught.
</p>

<p>
Like the Consul, Yvonne, and Hugh, all the characters in Hitchcock's film are affected or exposed by the dissociation from their habitual, grounded sense of time. Although Iris suffers from a physical blow to the head, her dizziness on the train recalls early psychiatry's association of train travel with trauma. Hitchcock's 1938 film was made when the cinematic movement-image predominated, yet the master of cinema anticipates the postmodern cinema of the time-image. His train becomes Deleuze's 

<b></b>

time-image and Iris finds herself traveling in "chronic non-chronological time" with its noncommensurable, involuntary movement on her way to an unknown destination, revealed only in the final shot in the British Consulate where the couple discovers Miss Froy in a grounding master shot, providing a movement image that resolves all of the narrative's questions.
</p>

<p>
With the foreseeable future ahead of the train and the past securely in place, the railroad track in both <i>The Lady Vanishes</i> and <i>Under the Volcano</i> is an image of certain succession. As Deleuze notes in <i>Cinema 2: The Time-Image</i>, post-war films no longer rely on continuity editing in which seamless images present a knowable subject and world; the seams of Lowry's novel are also visible. If the train were the perceiver, movement would remain essential, but the train orients an entirely new consciousness for a passenger's experience of speed&#x02014;which begins with cinema after the Second World War for Deleuze, and with standardized time and the locomotive for Sir Sanford Fleming. The perception of speed is not unified, even on the same train, so couples can become separated in the same physical location because of each individual's relative speed of travel. Paradoxically, the artificial reconstruction of velocity&#x02014;in a time-image or as time zones&#x02014;provides a municipal or international site for considering how quickly different lifetimes arrive at the final depot. Hitchcock's and Lowry's images of trains allow for interpretive consistency following travelers at various speeds: Iris with her trauma caused by an accidental blow to her head exacerbated by a kidnapping and the rushing train, or the Consul with the traumatized present on his final day.

7. Express Death
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Geoffrey sits at the bar of the Farolito examining ads on the wall that announce last night's events. A dead scorpion clings to the ads, an image of the fleeting daily news. Geoffrey understands that the new day is a commodity to be consumed. Yesterday's products are moth-eaten&#x02014;we must buy anew. In the Farolito, the bartender's son crams himself with chocolate skulls as he reads a magazine, linking an ephemeral publication with the day of death. If the Consul buys into the moment, he, too, will be consumed. He knows he must grasp for tomorrow's news, the next thing, because moments are always new: "<i>Su&#x000E9;lteme!</i> Save me, thought the Consul vaguely" (<i>UV</i>, 350). Was he petitioning the day, death, or eternity?
</p>

<p>
In <i>Under the Volcano</i>, three sinister police officers laugh at the Consul's feeble attempt to outwit their plan to frame him for an Indian's murder. The <i>polic&#x000ED;a</i> weave a tale of the Consul's alleged crimes, measure the degree of his guilt, and pronounce the sentence: "You are no a de wrider, you are de espider" (<i>UV</i>, 384). The fascists usurp the roles of time, as if becoming the three daughters of Zeus and Necessity to whom the ancient Greeks attributed authorship of a life: Clotho weaves life, Lachesis measures it, and finally Atropos cuts the thread. Instead of spanning generations, all three are present at once in Chapter 12, creating a black hole of the Consul's lifetime. The Consul recognizes the tangibility of the danger present in these personages of omnitemporality: "They were taking their time" (<i>UV</i>, 373). Time, including the Consul's time, was theirs 

<b></b>

to take. Alternate thoughts define his state of flux. In one paragraph, the Consul himself, like the <i>polic&#x000ED;a</i>, embodies the three fates, experiencing at once the past, present, and future. Past: "He <i>was</i> where he <i>was</i>, there <i>was</i> nowhere to fly to" (<i>UV</i>, 375, italics mine). Present: "[The pimp] had been talking to him <i>for the last five minutes</i>" (<i>UV</i>, 375, italics mine). Future: "Now once more, he <i>could go</i>" (<i>UV</i>, 375, italics mine). The eternal express train bound for glory has always existed but is still becoming realized in the time-image defined by Deleuze and interpreted by Lowry.
</p>

<p>
The Consul makes no move. His action is to remain still&#x02014;the motion of perpetual stillness, and its dead calm. "It was not the end quite yet [ . . . ] He could neither climb up nor down [ . . . ] The abyss yawned, waiting" (<i>UV</i>, 374). The yawn of time as it waits indicates falling asleep; a character falling into the yawning abyss will be put to rest. Since Lowry admits in a letter that throughout the novel "it is as if I hear a clock slowly striking midnight for Faust," and also cites Goethe's <i>Faust</i> as an epigram, we may conclude that in Lowry's mind, the Consul is saved because of his striving.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  <i>Under the Volcano</i> is a life that ends as the new life of eternity begins. The idle pace of ticking has ceased at the apocalypse of express, all-present time.
</p>

<p>
On the Day of the Dead, the Consul's future and past converge at the center of the hourglass, where Stephen Hawking would pinpoint a black hole. The disparate granules of his identity are funneled through the cylinder; themes become a unified theme when a life becomes a death; the sequence of life's moments reaches its apex when they fuse at the single moment of death. The Consul falls into his bottomless drinks and down into the volcano. While Dante's architecture of the inferno and paradise are clearly diagrammed, Geoffrey Firmin reaches the inferno where there is no grammar or structure to delineate experience into points of view and narrative time. Under the volcano, the past, present, and future are simultaneous, as are the <i>life</i> and <i>time</i> of a lifetime. The locomotive's wheels spin without a track, and still carry its passengers from the vertigo of samsara to nirvana.
</p>

<p>
Stephen Hawking's image of the past and future forms an hourglass, with the future at the top, and the past at the bottom. The Consul has fallen into the ravine of the barglass, volcano, Inferno, and hourglass, and passed to the other side. To live is to remain in the upper chamber of hope, even while the quicksand of life slips away, but to fall is to lose hope. The Consul ascends into the future above, but loses his footing and plummets into the past with the sands of time, as a hopeless, but forgiven man. The voluntarily involuntary end engulfs him with its time-image of speed.

8. The Triumphant Monster
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
While Charles Dickens' <i>Dombey and Son</i>  is not a limited duration novel restricted to the 24 hours of <i>Under the Volcano</i>, Dickens' Chapter 55 can be read alongside Lowry's Chapter 12 as an ur-moment of speed just before the moment of death. Carker steals the second wife of Dombey, a wealthy London merchant, and makes an escape on horseback after ruining their marriage. Carker, like the Consul, is falling into a black hole because of a woman. Neither Carker nor Geoffrey Firmin has a Virgil who will 

<b></b>

escort him to paradise; instead, is the murderous re of a train and a ride through hell. Like the stealthily advancing express behind the scenes of <i>Under the Volcano</i>, a speeding train pursues Carker. The insentient express train has the hostile intention of a relentless demon plunging headlong through life, indiscriminately leaving a trail of deaths in its wake: the unscrupulous Carker and the faithful Consul.
</p>

<p>
An outcast on the run for stealing his boss' wife, Carker is unsettled by train travel, so he follows an intensely personal journey on horseback, forging the course of the time-image. Conversely, the Consul is wary of rejoining the community, acting like a pariah after losing his wife; he experiences a hallucinatory narrative rush, although not on horseback like Carker, and is finally overrun by a daemonic horse terrified by the storm. Horses and trains are only the vehicles for the fatal velocity that ends a lifetime. Like Lowry's Chapter 12, Dickens' Chapter 55 "was a fevered vision of things past and present all confounded together; of [Carker's] life and journey blended into one."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  In a scene that could have happened in the Farolito, a drowsy Carker is disconcerted and experiences the Consul's mescal-induced vertigo. Carker turns to a waiter as he attempts to catch up with time:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
"What day is this?" he asked of the waiter, who was making preparations for his dinner. "Day, Sir?" "Is it Wednesday?" "Wednesday, Sir? No, Sir. Thursday, Sir." "I forgot. How goes the time? My watch is unwound." [ . . . ] How long he sat, drinking and brooding, and being dragged in imagination hither and thither, no one could have told less correctly than he.

Like the Consul, Carker fails to escape the painful present through the numbness alcohol promises, but is instead "drawn at the heels of wild horses" (<i>DAS</i>, 740).
</p>

<p>
Whereas the Consul has been riding an express narrative, Carker is on horseback. In passive states of exhaustion and drunkenness, both Carker and the Consul seem to be passengers carried away by their own lives. The natural force of a violent rushing horse and a man's innate strength contrasts with the industrialized confusion of railway travel and the resulting enervation. At midnight, disordered from both wine and exhaustion, a terrified Carker stays awake listening as trains pass nearby like fiery devils. The fierce transit of a locomotive fills his consciousness:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
A trembling of the ground, and quick vibration in his ears; a distant shriek; a dull light advancing, quickly changed to two red eyes, and a fierce fire, dropping glowing coals; an irresistible bearing on of a great roaring and dilating mass; a high wind, and a rattle&#x02014;another come and gone, and he holding to a gate, as if to save himself!

<p class="noIndent">
The end approaches with its divine flourish; Carker, like the Consul, does not dare to hope for life since death has almost overtaken his flight. They share a self-preservative need to escape the siphon of the end: "Save me, thought the Consul vaguely" (<i>UV</i>, 350). But the end is final.
</p>

<p>
Carker's horse carries its rider on a visionary ride with the momentum of a powerful beast that is reminiscent of the rider-less, frenzied horse of the murdered Indian 

<b></b>

in <i>Under the Volcano</i>&#x02014;or like an express train rushing its passengers to a destination: "Some visionary terror, unintelligible and inexplicable, associated with a trembling of the ground,&#x02014;a rush and sweep of something through the air, like Death upon the wing" (<i>DAS</i>, 731). The runaway horse runs through an apparent eternity on an "endless road" that encompasses a man's lifetime and future, through "morning, noon, and sunset; night, and the rising of an early moon," then sunset, nightfall, dawn, and daybreak again (<i>DAS</i>, 736, 738). Even landmarks are intertextual rhymes; Carker sees "the distant Jura, fading along the plain" in Britain like the ever-present volcanoes looming above the Consul in Quauhnahuac, Mexico (<i>DAS</i>, 733).
</p>

<p>
The speeding horse is an omen of death&#x02014;the end of life advancing with a fury&#x02014;as it runs by cemeteries on long roads to the treacherous horizon. Carker's horseback journey creates a sense of vertigo: a rush chills his blood and memories pass with the scenery as the present fuses with the past and future (<i>DAS</i>, 741). The trochal image of the fulfillment of time is prominent in Carker's fevered, somnolent vision reminiscent of the Consul's, when Carker sees images of wheels: "a vision of change upon change, and still the same monotony of bells and wheels, and horses' feet, and no rest" (<i>DAS</i>, 738). All night, he is troubled by the monotonous vision of what would be his final journey: the civil, domesticated movement-image of wheels and horses' feet before another train would pass with the disconcerting, untamed, and mysterious time-image of equus speed. Recurrent time spirals with increasing rapidity as it unwinds, or conversely, as it winds itself into the density of a black hole. In both cases, the end hastens to unfold.
</p>

<p>
During Carker's final thirty minutes, however, the narrative pace slows. Like the Consul asking for the time just before his murder, Carker asks for the time of his train: "About a quarter after four, Sir. Express comes through at four, Sir.&#x02014;It don't stop" (<i>DAS</i>, 741). An <i>absolutamente necesario</i> vehicle for conveying the narrative velocity, the express train of <i>Dombey and Son</i> seems to continue on its course into Lowry's novel. In the final thirty minutes, Carker learns that two gentlemen have arrived and he panics; running toward the railroad track, he is chased by Dombey.
</p>

<p>
In Chapter 20 when Dombey takes a trip after the death of his son, the train becomes an anthropomorphic re of death, foreshadowing the later accident:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The very speed at which the train was whirled along mocked the swift course of the young life that had been borne away so steadily and so inexorably to its fore-doomed end. The power that forced itself upon its iron way [ . . . ] piercing through the heart of every obstacle, and dragging living creatures of all classes, ages, and degrees behind it, was a type of the triumphant monster, Death.

</blockquote>

<div class="attribution">

<p class="noIndent">
With similar rhythm and language used to describe the horse in Chapter 55, the train is a harbinger of relentless mortality, becoming a remorseless, indomitable monster of Death: passing faces in a station, leaving them behind, small and insignificant; tearing through mountains and ruined towns; crossing valleys on bridges, and proceeding on in remorseless triumph until Death overruns Carker in Chapter 55. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
In the Consul's final moments after being shot by the police, he hears the sounds of a world at war, and the newly freed horse can be imagined galloping off stage as the link to the synchronized deaths of the Consul and Yvonne. The last page of <i>Under the Volcano</i>'s Chapter 12 reads like the last page of <i>Dombey and Son</i>'s Chapter 55 when Carker experiences the pandemonium of a private war before he is thrown to the dogs:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
[Carker] heard a shout&#x02014;another&#x02014;saw the [pursuer's] face change from its vindictive passion to a faint sickness and terror&#x02014;felt the earth tremble&#x02014;knew in a moment that the rush [of the train] was come&#x02014;uttered a shriek&#x02014;looked round&#x02014;saw the red eyes, bleared and dim, in the daylight, close upon him&#x02014;was beaten down, caught up, and whirled away upon a jagged mill, that spun him round and round, and struck him limb from limb, and licked his stream of life up with its fiery heat, and cast his mutilated fragments in the air. When the traveler, who had been recognized, recovered from a swoon, he saw them bringing from a distance something covered, that lay heavy and still, upon a board, between four men, and saw that others drove some dogs away that sniffed upon the road, and soaked his blood up, with a train of ashes.

The glaring red eyes of a speeding lifetime rush at its victim with the force of a wild stallion in <i>Under the Volcano</i> and <i>Dombey and Son</i>. Apart from being transported safely and in sync with the speed of time like a rider on horseback or a passenger on a commuter train, the inhuman speed causes the vulnerable to land in a pile on the rails. The streams of life&#x02014;men, horses, the fleeting landscape&#x02014;are caught up in the speed of an industrial whirlpool and mutilated. Arriving at the station, Dombey reflects that the blackened, deteriorated town "was the journey's fitting end, and might have been the end of everything; it was so ruinous and dreary" (<i>DAS</i>, 271). Dickens' and Lowry's trains deliver a corpse when they arrive at a halt and eternal time begins. The pariah dogs who lap up death first appear in <i>Dombey and Son</i>, and make a later appearance in the final line of <i>Under the Volcano</i>: "Somebody threw a dead dog after him down the ravine" (<i>UV</i>, 388).
</p>

<p>
Velocity, like time, is artificial and will cease. The Consul's descent into the abyss is traceable and narratable even though it is rapid; after death, the final resting place is beyond expression, beyond images in the black hole Hawking predicts. The Consul has been speeding on a symbolic, fatal express train while seated at the bar. His consciousness rushes into the poetic time of eternity during a lifetime that becomes the speeding train itself. Time is the train on its course, and he is its passenger. The Consul remains utterly alone in his symbolic compartment with the blurred scenery passing by his window; the train has divorced him from the natural world and he is literally embodied by industrial speed.
</p>

<p>
By definition, speed will accelerate, creating the need for new images and models that help us understand the nature of velocity. Speed outran its nineteenth-century paradigm of municipal time; and then its twentieth-century of standardized, industrial time; and now in the twenty-first century, digital time is already trailing behind. With the imminence of the end, it is <i>absolutamente necesario</i> that a corpse be transported

<b></b>

by express or even death will leave it behind, and we will be unable to express twenty-first century velocity. Like the light we view from a star, express time has left its origin even before our births. Perhaps the new image of time will arrive soon from the twentieth-century.

The express train signifies death and relentless speed in the traditional gospel song: "This train is bound for glory, this train. / This train is bound for glory, this train. / This train is bound for glory / Don't carry nothin' but the righteous and the holy / This train is bound for glory, this train." Written in 4/4 time, the tempo shifts from quarter notes to eighth notes at "Don't carry nothin' but the righteous and the holy," giving the illusion of speed as a chugging train hastens to reach a modernist's ideal of "glory" in which heaven's streets are paved not with gold but with railroad ties and the train becomes the vehicle of salvation.

Two versions of <i>Under the Volcano</i> survive from 1940 and 1947, which might explain the phenomenon of its construction as both a movement- and a time-image. Pierre Schaeffer discovers chronology to be the most significant change in the versions. Without mentioning the text's velocity, Schaeffer cites the shift from a "fairly traditional mixture of narratorial report and free indirect discourse" to "a patchwork of discourses defying the laws of novelistic verisimilitude but foregrounding dialogism" in the final version.

Critics regard Gaston Bachelard's <i>The Poetics of Space</i> (<i>La po&#x000E9;tique de l'espace</i>, 1958) as the inception of phenomenological criticism. E.M. McAllester, "Gaston Bachelard: Towards a Phenomenology of Literature," <i>Forum for Modern Lanugage Studies</i> 12.2 : 93&#x02013;104, especially page 101. For a phenomenologist such as Bachelard, experience is a structure; every reading is a crossroads bound by horizons that are constantly shifting, but ultimately subjective; the key to understanding comes through the image, and through understanding images, we appreciate the meaning of a text. Bachelard attempts a personal understanding by allowing impressions to possess him entirely; an image "emerges into the consciousness as a direct product of the heart, soul, and being of man, apprehended in his actuality." Gaston Bachelard, <i>The Poetics of Space</i> (<i>La po&#x000E9;tique de l'espace</i>, 1958), trans. Maria Jolas (Boston: Beacon Press, 1994), xviii; hereafter abbreviated as <i>PS</i>. As a new offering, this revelatory image is a direct ontology with no past: "a sudden salience on the surface of the psyche" (<i>PS</i>, xv&#x02013;xvi).

<i>Times</i>, Selfridges's Advertisement, "London's Greatest Store," 1909<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
The opening of Selfridges Department Store in London in 1909 marked a pivotal moment in British marketing. "London's Greatest Store" perfected the commercial selling of the non-commercial, paradoxically inscribing within its elegantly decorated interior a cultural location outside the marketplace. Visitors on the store's opening day found a luxurious, almost enchanted space, where soft lighting illuminated the vast array of goods from clothes to china to books, where price tags were absent or at least discreet, and where concealed string quartets provided a soothing musical accompaniment for the spectators. In this new commercial environment, the message was that even large-scale stores were free of mass market taint; amid the refined atmosphere the shoppers&#x02014;or guests, as Selfridges called them&#x02014;would find an abundance of authentic and exclusive objects, not to be confused with the mass produced goods available elsewhere. This extraordinary atmosphere marked a dramatic realignment of London's commercial energies, representing one of the first mass market campaigns to sell a disdain for the mass market. <sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Any half-awake twenty-first century cultural critic will be able to list the commercial tricks deployed on Selfridges' opening day: the selling of products as lifestyle, the lure of spectacle and visual intoxication, the fetishizing of the commodity, and so on. Indeed, as the first two contemporary reactions printed above suggest, even in 1909 the non-commercial aesthetic of Selfridges raised cynical eyebrows. "What do you sell?" writes the first indignant commentator. "Why don't you say what you sell in your advertisements?"&#x02014;his query offering one of the earliest protests against the marketing of image and lifestyle over goods themselves. The more sophisticated irony of the <i>Bystander</i> writer reveals his careful understanding of the strategy; he lets his audience know that despite the "gracefully worded advertisements" implying that shoppers would be transformed into "connoisseurs contemplating a choice collection," acquiring new possessions will still be possible in this new establishment. He will not be taken in by the non-commercial appearance, he hints, or by any idea that this is somehow not a shop with profit as its central motive.  And trained in skepticism as we are, readers then and now will not be fooled by the claims made by Selfridges in the third quotation; dress it up as you might, business is about profit, about money-grubbing, about accumulation. We won't believe the hype.
</p>

<p>
This article takes these critiques as a given. Incisive critical commentary on advertising and on marketing abounds, and exploring the false claims and schemes within a commercial culture is an essential and ongoing project.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  This critical approach, however, is not the end of the story, for armed only with skepticism, we are blinded to the dramatic commercial revolution offered by Selfridges, one that is intrinsically tied to British modernism. Selfridges embodies and deploys a surprisingly modernist set of tensions between low and high culture, and between the specter of the mass market and an alternative, non-commercial aesthetic. As this article will explore, at the same time that Selfridges' marketing strategies seem to exploit these tensions, they 

<b></b>

also anticipate the work of recent modernist critics by dismantling them, deliberately highlighting the commercial production of a realm theoretically independent of the market. In the advertisements, philosophy, and physical space of the store, Selfridges offered an intoxicating promise: be awash in a modern sea of plentiful and accessible goods, yet maintain (or obtain) a sense of authenticity, of originality, of non-commercial purity. Examining such a blending from the perspective of the mass market offers a vital new strategy for assessing a divide that has been intrinsic to modernist studies since its inception: the alleged separation of aesthetic modernism from mass culture. Exploring how a commercial venture not only represented this divide, but in fact offered a way for its customers to negotiate it, in turn allows us to re-assess some of our own critical divisions within modernist studies.

1. Dismantling the Great Divides
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
In recent years, numerous scholars have fundamentally questioned the separation between modernism and the market, and the critical road map that begins their arguments is now familiar terrain.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Huyssen's well-known formulation of "the great divide," which describes how modernism defined itself against mass culture, and Jameson's oft-quoted assertion that modernist writing relies on a "distinction between high and so-called mass culture" have proven irresistible targets for many contemporary critics.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  While visions of modernism as disdainful of popular values and commercial culture still dominate many definitions (especially outside of literary studies), a wealth of new books has now fully challenged and dismantled much of the great divide. Far from being above mass culture, and by extension commerce, advertising, and even the mass market, literary modernists should be viewed, as one critic writes, through "the lens of consumption," and writers from James to Woolf to Joyce have been usefully linked to a range of commercial concerns.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Running alongside and often overlapping these efforts are critical works that reassess the divisions between high and low moderns, both by bringing renewed attention to neglected (read: low) writers, and by skillfully showing how each category overlapped and indeed influenced the other.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Examining Selfridges allows us to continue questioning the great divide but&#x02014;critically&#x02014;from a position that begins on the mass culture side. Rather than examining how modernists appropriated the market, we can consider how the market might use modernism, or more precisely, how the market itself embodies the vexed relationship between high and low culture. If we only study how modernists use the market both within and for their works, we ironically reify modernism as the central cultural location of these tensions, and we further risk treating the market as a monolithic entity, rather than as an immensely complicated set of strategies and commercial exchanges, something in fact as variable as modernism itself. Selfridges encapsulates a broad stream of competing concerns, a stream influenced by currents of nostalgia for an authentic, commercial-free past overlapping another stream of desire for an authentically new future, not derived from an outmoded tradition; currents that dream of exclusivity and a select audience flowing into currents that desire a ready accessibility and a wide 

<b></b>

market. One of the reasons that modernism is so notoriously and wonderfully difficult to define is that it too encompasses all these currents; by exploring how a commercial venture itself negotiates such tensions, we gain critical perspective on modernism as well. It is the movement across the gap&#x02014;by Selfridges, by modernists, by critics themselves&#x02014;the ability both to perform the great divide and to dismantle it when needed, the <i>action</i> of this, rather than the vantage point on either side, that offers the most vital critical model of both modernism and modernity.

2. The Commodified Authentic
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Central to my discussion of Selfridges is a phenomenon I term the "commodified authentic," a marketing strategy that enjoyed an unprecedented rise in early twentieth-century Britain, with Selfridges' opening marking a central moment in its history. This strategy promised to balance the seemingly contradictory desires for an autonomous "authentic" realm separate from popular culture or the mass market, and the desire (or need) to accommodate the growing pleasures and demands of the consumer age. In its broadest form, this strategy involved linking places or objects usually considered outside the mass market&#x02014;the domestic home, a weathered piece of furniture, an original artwork&#x02014;to the goods for sale. Critically, the strategy also presented, with no sense of paradox, the market itself as the best way to obtain this desired non-commercial aura, for the market would provide shoppers access to such purified goods.  At Selfridges, for example, the goods and the space were presented as exclusive and refined, defined against the mass market and indeed theoretically not even part of the market itself, existing instead in a purified cultural location outside conventional markers of commerce. Many advertisements implied that the goods at Selfridges were one-of-a-kind objects, in direct contrast with the mass-produced goods available at lesser stores. On the other hand, however, Selfridges simultaneously invoked the modern pleasures of the mass market: the goods were available to all, they would be produced in numbers that implied an unimaginable plenty and endless supply, everyone in London was invited, and no one would be turned away. The term "commodified authentic" encapsulates this dual&#x02014;and even paradoxical&#x02014;strategy, for Selfridges was not simply selling notions of the authentic, but frankly avowing that this authenticity was commodified, and that this very commodification in turn made the authenticity that much more appealing and available. By embracing the commodified authentic, customers could perform an (alleged) oxymoron; they might be pure and shop as well, for Selfridges offered a complete education in negotiating and even transcending the divide.
</p>

<p>
I distinguish between two types of the commodified authentic in the discussion that follows: the nostalgic and the aesthetic. Selling a nostalgic version of the authentic meant invoking an originary and unified past before mechanical reproduction and fragmentation: images of old country houses or warm domestic interiors, references to "primitive" cultures, or, to borrow from Benjamin, the aura of an original artwork.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  On the aesthetic side, the commodified authentic drew from an alternative sense of "authenticity" as original, new, something that was not a copy and not derived from 

<b></b>

tradition or previous models: appeals to exclusive new fashions, the one-of-a-kind item, the limited edition. Naturally, the nostalgic and the aesthetic can overlap&#x02014;appeals to an original model might be both, for example&#x02014;but the distinction elucidates an important nuance in this neglected phenomenon. What both types share is the evocation of a realm outside of the mass market, and the simultaneous acknowledgement, and even celebration, of the commercial availability of the goods.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Selling the authentic is certainly a hypocritical move, a trick, an expression of commercial duplicity, and such a move is usually greeted with criticism ranging from simple derision to horror. Recipients of Pottery Barn catalogues as well as critical journals, we are all adept at unmasking the commerce behind the authentic. Simple unmasking, however, misses the complexity of the commodified authentic at the turn of the century, for it in fact represented an enormously powerful fantasy, with egalitarian possibilities, one that offered the mostly middle class customers at Selfridges a chance to participate in both the pleasures of authenticity and the pleasures of abundance and accessibility. Such a combination had important gender implications as well, for Selfridges promised to provide female shoppers a public space of domestic purity, a place where they might remain within a non-commercial sphere and still fully participate in modern commercial exchanges. The vital new ways to transcend class and gender barriers offered by the commodified authentic had far reaching implications not only for the commercial history of the twentieth century (with Laura Ashley or Pottery Barn the logical inheritors), but also for the development of both British culture in general and British modernism in particular.

3. The Genuine Article
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Our first destination on the Selfridges' shopping excursion is to the goods themselves and the unique form of commercial erasure Selfridges mastered within its initial flood of advertisements. The marketing campaign to announce the store's opening was unprecedented. The store's founder, Gordon Selfridge, hired thirty-eight of the best illustrators in London, headed by Sir Bernard Partridge from <i>Punch</i>, and commissioned them to create over one hundred full-page advertisements for eighteen different newspapers, along with half and quarter page advertisements. He spent an extraordinary 36,000 thousand pounds to promote his new store before opening day, setting a new standard for London retailers.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>   Within this initial campaign, and for several months following, Selfridges worked to distance its goods from the taint of commerce both by evoking a nostalgic aura around the production process and by linking the goods to various markers of high class taste. At the same time, Selfridges deliberately unmasked these efforts, insisting&#x02014;often in the same advertisements&#x02014;that the goods were easy to purchase, plentiful, and available to all. By both unsettling and reinscribing distinctions between a low, commercial commerce and a high, non-commercial one, Selfridges offered shoppers a chance to enjoy both the distinction and the pleasure of transcending it.

</p>

<p>
Critical theory stretching back to Marx has acknowledged the role of the glorified commodity in Britain and the cultural values that can swirl around advertised objects. As Marx famously observed, in the nineteenth century, goods had come to exceed their use value, becoming commodities that were "fetishized," "transcendent," and even "mystical."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Thomas Richards has argued that from the time of the Great Exhibition of 1851, commodities were typically set on pedestals, under lights&#x02014;both literally and ratively&#x02014;hiding any sense of production in favor of the final, seemingly ahistorical product. Commodities so represented could sell the ideology of England, from its imperial fantasies to its moral codes.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  By glorifying commodities and hiding production, sellers could distance a product from a sense of everyday use or from mundane suggestions of actual work; even the sense that such objects were for sale could be obscured. Advertisements, as Jennifer Wicke has pointed out, can form an "aesthetic space" around these objects, which could in turn "put the actual act of commercial exchange under a unique form of erasure" (<i>AF</i>, 70; 83). Selfridges was one of the first advertisers in England to exploit fully the "not for sale" aura surrounding the shop goods, and exploit it in a fully realized, mass market, campaign. I will first consider this purified commodity within Selfridges, before turning to the unique union of this message with its opposing twin, the message of ready availability and abundance.
</p>

<p>
A central early advertising strategy for Selfridges involved the nostalgic version of the commodified authentic, a strategy that cast a misty glow over the production process and implied that the goods were made not en-masse in factories, but the old fashioned way, in small cottage industries that transferred that purification to product and eventually to the buyer. As one example, consider <a href="#1">re 1</a>, which shows one of Selfridges' article advertisements that appeared in the <i>Times</i> in the weeks before the store opened.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  (<a href="#1"> 1</a>) By mimicking the paper's news stories, the layout emphasizes the continuity between the established, and less obviously commercial news of the <i>Times</i>, and the new news about Selfridg&#x000E9;s. The writer relates here "How Selfridges Gathers Its Goods From All Parts of the World." On romantic journeys, buyers scour the globe, looking for distinctive, original articles, made at home or in cottage industries. The advertisement decries the mass-produced nature of most goods, made by machines churning out identical finished products.  This "painful uniformity," however, has been addressed by avid Selfridges' buyers; forever "In Search of the Original," they seek goods that "strike a distinctive and individual note" ("HSGG"). To this end, the buyers try to find the original makers of articles, going

According to the advertisement, peasants in places such as Japan, Germany, and even Britain are still making goods using time-honored methods; crucially, such goods maintain their aura of distinctiveness even when they have left their surroundings. The Japanese articles obtained by the buyers, for example, are

Selfridges' shoppers can, as it were, buy this authenticity, located in vague references to peasants, the countryside, home industry, and timeless traditions, and set against the 

<b></b>

impersonal forces of mechanization, industry, and mass-produced objects. The nostalgic authentic lies not simply in the past, but in the way a connection to a tradition becomes inscribed on to an object. These objects are made in the home, by an individual, who creates an object that "embodies his own personality" in its very distinctiveness. The objects come to stand in metonymically for the authenticity located in the production process and in the peasants themselves, and such objects brought to Selfridges can, the advertisement implies, not only bestow on the store this sense of distinctiveness, but can in turn bestow on the shopper's home the sense of authenticity originally located in the cottage industry. By simultaneously advancing and erasing production, Selfridges sought to sell the very kind of authenticity that a writer such as E. M. Forster would see as antithetical to London's commercial district. The buyer could shop in a capitalist market without taint, could return, with carefully selected purchases, to an earlier mythic past located in an imagined pre-industrial world.
</p>

<p>
Evoking such an idealized production process was certainly nothing new. Selfridges drew on Victorian traditions such as the arts and crafts movements, for William Morris, along with a host of precursors and followers, had imagined a similar production process. Morris, who exposed the actual factory conditions of the "peasants" whom Selfridges mythologized, praised the many virtues of the hand made and carefully crafted goods.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  What marked Selfridges as a departure, however, was how the store borrowed these "refined" models of commerce, usually by definition separate from the mass market, and deployed them in a structured, mass-market campaign. Such a strategy certainly served an ideological function, hiding the bleak conditions that likely went into producing these goods; as one article heading notes, the Selfridges' buyers "ransack the world" for the products. The strategy also served an intriguing cultural function, however, promising to address the emerging disdain for mass market production.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
A close cousin of the nostalgic version of the commodified authentic blended a Morris-like attachment to the hand-crafted item with a high class aesthetic purity. A second example from print advertising, an ad for "famous Teco Ware" (<a href="#2"> 2</a>), offers a contrast for the reader between the cluttered, hard-to-read news, and the three refined pottery pieces in the advertisements.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  "Teco," says the copy, "is without a doubt the refinement of Art in Pottery." It cannot be described "by word or picture," but every piece "is a chaste, dignified, refined, and valuable specimen of Pottery, unique of its kind, and suggestive of the reincarnation of a lost art. Every piece is an embodiment of the genius of a well-known artist, and bears its designer's name to attest its individual character." These are works of art in the age of mechanical reproduction, suggesting not copies, but the original objects from which lesser imitations (for sale at lesser stores) might be made. The Selfridges' shopper can obtain objects that, in effect, pre-date any commercial "contamination." The goods are surrounded with the language of art, rather than the language of commerce; while this of course remains a commercial strategy familiar to modern readers, it was a new trend for British advertisers.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Alongside these efforts to present the goods as one-of-a-kind objects, purified of commercial "contamination," the print advertising simultaneously evoked a more mass-market narrative: the goods were plentiful, they were readily available, and they were 

<b></b>

sold at prices accessible to most buyers. Within the same article-advertisement that declares the goods at Selfridges were made in cottage industries, the writer declares
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

The store would be a veritable cornucopia of the latest goods. In a similar move, another large advertisement listed Selfridges' many departments, and just a sampling of the goods available in each. The very size of the full-page advertisement suggested the store's vastness, the sheer number of goods that would fit under one roof.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  The tag line that frequently appeared in the early advertisements, "London's lowest prices&#x02014;always" further served to emphasize ready availability. Shoppers might take pleasure in the goods' uniqueness, but might simultaneously take pleasure in the goods' abundance.
</p>

<p>
This cheerful paradox between unique and available goods paralleled the simultaneous move to hide the monetary transaction and to acknowledge it. These contradictions may be seen in a long advertisement that presents the script of a short play for the readers. The play takes place in the "Morning-room of Mr. Carew's little house in Mayfair" (<a href="#3"> 3</a>).<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Mr. and Mrs. Carew have just returned from the Continent to find that their house has been burglarized; along with their possessions have gone all their markers of taste and class. Facing a dinner party that night, the couple is in despair, since their traders are scattered all over town and they could not possibly be reached in time. Turning over a newspaper, Mr. Carew spies an advertisement for Selfridges, and they quickly telephone in an order. Mrs. Carew selects a houseful of goods, all the "best quality," including dresses, china, glasses, a clock, and a variety of fruits and flowers. Mrs. Carew dismisses her husband's concern over prices, telling him that "we're getting the best bargain of our lives." The Selfridges assistant assures her that the vases, for example, are "the same things that one buys in the antiquity shops at fancy prices" and that the candle-shades are "unique."
</p>

<p>
The play highlights low prices and offers a clear indication that a whole houseful of goods might be bought at a moment's notice for the specific purpose of constructing the illusion of stable taste and class that the Carews will need for their visitors. The act of buying is at once effaced and foregrounded:  the goods are unique aesthetic objects purified of the suggestion that they were ever actually purchased, and this aura may be purchased with a simple phone call. Readers are in fact offered a performance of how they might perform the Carews' trick. This Janus-faced approach is notable for how readily it changes direction. The very dexterity that Selfridges allows in presenting the latest old goods, and the genuine reproduction, suggests an irreverent blend of high and low styles; the chance to smooth the gap between different values, and still be free to reinforce this gap, is part of what is so effectively sold.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>   Selfridges may offer commerce in a non-commercial guise&#x02014;but at the same time it happily exposes this guise not simply as a shopkeeper's trick, but as a powerful strategy to possess goods that are both authentic and up-to-date, untainted by commerce, and still readily available.
</p>

<p>
The physical placement of the goods in the store itself offered a literal performance of the Carew's play and its self-conscious paradox. On the one hand, the store's window displays offered spaces for the transcendent commodity. Far from the cluttered window of the Victorian merchant, who crammed as many goods into the display as possible, Selfridges initiated a new era of window design in Britain. Displays were carefully constructed, often using classical detailing, or displaying a single re or object in a romantic setting. The objects for sale were set under lights, often literally on pedestals,

surrounded by the suggestion of distinction&#x02014;the single, beautiful object. As a writer for the <i>Daily Mail</i> noted, "Each window-frame formed a sort of proscenium for a deep-set scene with a painted background in colours delicately harmonizing with the articles occupying what may be termed the centre of the stage. The windows were not crowded with selling articles. No price tickets were displayed."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  The commodity was the star in the spotlight. On the other hand, the store's interior also presented models of abundance. While many of the special displays and showcases within the store continued the idea of the transcendent commodity appearing outside, the sheer number of goods suggested plenty over particularity and exclusivity.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  As one contemporary reviewer commented, on opening day, visitors could find "large quantities of woollens," "about 1000 washing robes," "Dress materials too numerous to be mentioned" and thousands of 

<b></b>

other items, all set, of course, within a refined atmosphere. <sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Selfridges built a mutable aura around its commodities, one that might shift at the customers' discretion and that built on the consumers' willing, pleasurable consent to the paradox.
</p>

<p>
Selfridges' use of the commodified authentic to sell its goods had clear class implications for London shoppers. Selfridges largely appealed to the rapidly rising middle class and contributed to the emergence of the "middlebrow" culture. As Lawrence Rainey has observed, the term middlebrow actually comes into existence at precisely this time, with its first recorded use in 1904 (<i>IM</i>, 3). Shoppers were offered all the exclusivity implied by the higher class Bond Street stores, but without the high price tags and snobbish disdain for the middle class customer that was found there, as well as all the spectacle and pleasures of the Oxford Street Emporiums, without the negative associations of cheap goods and frenzied shopping. The commodified authentic in fact united what appeared to be two contradictory models, and made these models available at middle class prices. The Selfridges' shopper might obtain&#x02014;as the Carews did&#x02014;a houseful of apparently old stuff, infused with an instant familiarity that intrinsically suggested an erasure of monetary exchange. Such an erasure was usually considered a special purview of high class dwellings, embodied in the country house or the old urban residences, places where the purchases were made so long ago as to purify them of commercial stain. The commodified authentic, however, cheerfully pricked the sacred bubble surrounding such established places, not only exposing them as constructed environments that were commercial in origin, but in the same breath offering this tantalizing high class erasure to the middle class shopper. The authentic was of course manufactured, but with the potentially egalitarian result of making high-class models more universally available. Selfridges captured the understandable longing to possess authentic goods&#x02014;and the perhaps hypocritical but perhaps honest admission that these must be purchased like anything else. The middle class shoppers at Selfridges could perform different class identities depending on the goods chosen and, as I go on to discuss in the next section, on where they were in the store.

4. Redefining Commerce
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Selfridges not only used the commodified authentic to shift radically the image of shop goods, but also to redefine British commerce in general, and the department store in particular.  The initial ads repeatedly chastised the English public for thinking of commerce as a tainted endeavor. Commerce was, on the contrary, a dignified and respected profession, and the department store an established institution. Selfridges declared that viewing business as "mere money-grubbing" was an outdated model of commerce, an older evolutionary stage now superceded by a new and improved commercial vision.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  This new vision linked commerce and Selfridges to older, less commercial models. Both the depiction of Selfridges in the advertisements, and the store's actual layout, suggested a readily exchangeable set of lived environments, each with its own form of commercial erasure. Selfridges, at turns, was an established institution, a museum, an art gallery, a self-contained village, a domestic home. The shoppers themselves could 

<b></b>

decide which model to embrace; Selfridges thus worked to move commerce from its tainted position as contaminated other into the very heart of British culture. As another advertisement declared, Selfridges was ready to "enter into and take its place in the life of the whole of London, indeed, the United Kingdom, and in its own time of the whole British Empire."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Two of Selfridges' constructed images&#x02014;the store as village and the store as domestic home&#x02014;offer especially potent models of the commodified authentic. I will turn to them now.
</p>

<p>
The print advertising and the store's policies presented Selfridges as an urban village, a gathering place for people motivated by more than economic ties. Gordon Selfridge himself insisted that the store was a community center, not a shop, declaring, "'My object was to make Selfridges a civil center where friends could meet and where buying was only a secondary consideration'" (qtd. in <i>SB</i>, 254). Selfridge worked to form the staff, store, and customers into a self-sufficient community, announcing at a staff meeting that the goal was "not merely to provide the goods of civilization. It is to <i>be</i> civilization" (qtd. in <i>SB</i>, 213). As the familiar communities of the countryside&#x02014;so nostalgically re-imagined by writers such as Forster&#x02014;were disappearing, Selfridges re-created a community in an urban setting, one that echoed the kind that Forster believed urban commercialism was dismantling. Selfridges almost seemed to be responding to the lament C. F. G. Masterman cite in his popular 1909 work <i>The Condition of England</i>:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
'A village which once fed, clothed, policed, and regulated itself cannot now dig its own wells or build its own barns. Still less can it act its own dramas, build its own church, or organize its own work and play.'<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Selfridges in effect took up this call, creating an urban village within London. The staff formed its own community groups, including a popular drama league. Like small villages across England, Selfridges' employees organized support efforts during the First World War, a group of men formed a "House Corps" and actually drilled on the roof and practiced musketry, and the employees created the "Selfridges Red Cross Detachment" that met wounded soldiers at the train stations. Like a new and improved town elder, the information desk advertised that it could answer any reasonable question on any topic. In 1929, Selfridges even added a traditional country garden on the roof of the store, where the vegetables prepared in the restaurant were grown. <sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  By gesturing towards older, nostalgic visions of town centers, Selfridges simultaneously redefined the commercial landscape using non-market models and at the same time suggested to its guests that they might literally and ratively buy into such a model. The customer might visit this idyllic town in the position of feudal lord, gathering the goods desired before retreating home, and yet avoiding any of the guilt or responsibility that might have attached itself to such a position. Alternatively&#x02014;or simultaneously&#x02014;the shopper could participate as a valued member of the community, equal to any within the town and invited to share in its bounty, but without the labor such a position might once have required. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Selfridges also linked the store to that perennial icon of non-commercial ties, the private home. Visitors, especially women visitors, were instructed to make themselves at home while the staff endeavored "in every way imaginable to create and cherish that comfortable sentiment."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Visitors were given small silver keys on opening day, with the wish that they would feel "at home" in Selfridges.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  At the top of the store, elaborate and luxurious rooms of rest awaited the guest: Reception rooms, a library, the Silence Room, and the Retiring Room, each with special attendants ready to serve the visitors.  Several rooms offered free use of phones and were stocked with paper and writing utensils available at no charge. There were even special rooms for different European guests, decorated in the d&#x000E9;cor of the visitors' home country.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Material transactions disappeared; the rooms were free and open to all, and no tips of any kind were required or allowed. A Luncheon Hall and a Tea Garden provided food "in a dainty, home-like fashion" ("VD"). This domestic model was encouraged not simply among the guests, but among the employees as well. One of the expressions among the staff was "I'm home," meaning the sales target had been met for the day; bonuses were then given out in what Selfridges called "a little family ceremony" (<i>SB,</i> 182&#x02013;3). Of course, Selfridges did not re-create the home, but offered a vision of a new and improved home, one that had the markers of comforting familiarity, yet improved on the reality. As Gordon Selfridge said, his female customers came to the store "'because it's so much brighter than their homes'" (qtd. in <i>SB</i>, 107).
</p>

<p>
The use of this nostalgic version of the commodified authentic had two important implications for female customers. First, Selfridges united competing versions of the modern woman. As Rita Felski argues in <i>The Gender of Modernity</i>, women at the turn of the century were on the one hand associated with a nostalgic vision of a primitive, pre-industrial world separate by definition from the bustling and commercial public sphere. On the other hand, however, a competing vision of women began to emerge in the form of the voracious consumer, caught up in the frenzy of spending.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Selfridges, however, deftly combined these images and erased both the contradictions and any negative associations. The careful female shopper at Selfridges could, in effect, remain within the private sphere of the home, surrounded by a domestic atmosphere and home-made products. At the same time, however, she could still shop, not becoming a mad consumer exactly, but a discriminating shopper, selecting goods that would in turn bring her home closer to the Selfridges' model. The woman shopper could indeed perform the commodified authentic, becoming new and fashionable at the same time that she remained authentic and "non-commercial."
</p>

<p>
Second, Selfridges offered female shoppers the chance to experience the home from the male perspective. Women might enjoy the room of Silence, the carefully arranged and decorated interior, the sense of service and security&#x02014;in short, all the classic images of home&#x02014;but not have to produce the ideal themselves, at least not while they were in the store. With echoes of the exclusive male clubs in London, with all the comforts of home minus the spouse and children, Selfridges gave women shoppers the chance to sit within the picture of comfort without obligation. As Selfridges understood, misty visions of home derive much of their power from the viewer's lack of responsibility for 

<b></b>

the scene itself; adults may be nostalgic for a childhood home, both men and women may be nostalgic for homes they never had, but the fantasy is to be within the scene, the beneficiary of the maternal, home-like comfort, but not usually to create the comfort oneself. Selfridges allowed women a rare chance to "Feel at Home," without actually having to maintain the home. The ideal modern woman could enjoy the privileges of the ideal modern man.
</p>

<p>
Selfridges' suggestive re-creations of non-commercial environments, and the class and gender mobility such re-creations promised, were literally represented in the store's interior. A shopper could experience an intriguing geographic hierarchy of monetary associations by simply walking through the store. A shopper might begin in the Bargain Basement, the lowest floor accessible to the public, where an enormous mass of goods were jumbled together and where low prices were the central theme. She could travel upwards to the more exclusive floors, visiting departments where goods were tastefully arranged and price tags available but not obvious. As the efficient lift whisked her to higher floors, she could relax in the elegantly decorated lounging rooms, where she might write a letter, read a book, or simply rest. She might enjoy a home-cooked meal in one of the restaurants or, continuing to the roof, simply sit in an English country garden. The farther up she went in the building, the farther away she moved from actual material transactions, where money was exchanged for specific objects.  The shopper could, in effect, choose the environment in which she shopped, and by extension, select the class and even gender associations she wished to perform. Within the store, the identity of both class and gender might be created and maintained within objects and also elided by their ready exchange within a seemingly infinite, expanding market of goods.  This sort of mobility was not necessarily liberating but neither was it necessarily a sinister manipulation. Selfridges presented a new commercial landscape for London, one which used the purity implied in nostalgic laments or markers of high class taste&#x02014;a purity usually invoked to place commercialism in the role of contaminated other&#x02014;as central to a new definition of commerce.
</p>

<p>
Selfridges' use of the commodified authentic not only anticipated the modernist dream of a separate, autonomous aesthetic, but also anticipated recent modernist critiques of this separation. Selfridges fundamentally questioned the organizing binary that divided the authentic from the mass market, or a pure art from a sullied materialism, declaring without embarrassment that its anti-market aesthetic was for sale. It was a true full-service store, offering both the cultural text and the critique exposing it, achieving the cultural equivalent of a vertical monopoly.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  In its development of the commodified authentic, Selfridges offers us an important critical model for approaching modernism's simultaneous drives to elitism and egalitarianism, one flexible enough to acknowledge the pervasive desire for a cultural location apart from the marketplace, while at the same time acknowledging and even celebrating the commercially constructed nature of such a location.

Retrochic lacks the sentimentality or the high seriousness associated with the Victorians, "is untroubled by the cult of authenticity" and is happy to "blur the distinction between originals and re-makes" . While Samuel assigns retrochic to post-World War II society, we can see here at least a glimmer of what Samuel describes.

&#x02014; Isadora Duncan, <i>My Life</i>
<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
In the first decades of the twentieth century, F.T. Marinetti's futurist cheer, "Hurrah for motors," collided against Victorian invocations of spirituality&#x02014;or so the period divide is often oversimplified.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Performers and artists during the period, however, did not adhere to assumed antagonisms between spirituality and materiality, human culture and the machine age, or the soul and the motor. "I must place a motor in my soul," declares the American-born dancer, Isadora Duncan (1877&#x02013;1927) in her 1927 autobiography, and she consistently positions her choreography at the juncture of motorized movement and soulful expression. Her efforts to reimagine spirit through machine processes are shared by many key res of modernism, including the Russian director Constantin Stanislavski and even Marinetti. Although Duncan is credited with the invention of the performance form now called "modern dance," her influence on modernist performance has not been recognized. Her theories are dismissed as "romantic grandiloquence,"<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  primarily due to her use of terms associated with Victorianism ("soul," "inner self," and "human spirit").<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Even the best critical studies argue that Duncan "never completed the leap" from "late-nineteenth-century-romanticism" 

<b></b>

to modernism's "secular collectivism" (DID, 220). Yet, this presumed secularity is belied by the Christian and classical interests of res such as T.S. Eliot and H.D., and the notion of a divide between Victorianism and modernism to be leapt across has been questioned by Michael Levenson and others.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Duncan's conjuncture of metaphysical and materialist thought is actually a dominant feature of twentieth-century art, shared by such diverse movements as Italian futurism, the Moscow Art Theatre's innovations in drama, Greenwich Village Radicalism, and U.S. feminism.
</p>

<p>
As the motor in the soul indicates, Duncan'sideas of spirit are grounded in twentieth-century movement practices and especially that icon of modernist industrial society, the motor. This essay locates Duncan in the context of modernist performance by tracing her influences on more canonical res, recognizing that her dances represent a diverse body of choreography that developed and responded to modernist aesthetics, and reading her many essays and speeches as attempts to theorize her practice. <sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Duncan repeatedly res her fundamental movement principles through the symbol of the motor. First, the motor's ability to move several objects suggests the possibility of representing a "multiplied body," an interest she shared with Marinetti and other futurists. The constant, tireless motion of the motorized machine also offers the ideal of continuous dance movements that appear to be executed effortlessly, without the intervention of the "will," a concept she derives from Friedrich Nietzsche. Third, the motor's repetitive motion inspires Duncan's rehearsal process and desire to simulate spontaneity, a goal that significantly influenced Stanislavski's acting theory. As the "Muse of Modernism," an international star, and a polemical speaker, Duncan's motorized movement practices shaped modernist understandings of the body and soul, influenced spheres of performance from futurism to method acting, and launched an important trajectory of feminism.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
An overview of Duncan's career reveals that she was performing simultaneously with the most significant gestures of aesthetic modernism. Like many key modernist literary res, Duncan left the United States and began her career in Europe, arriving in London in 1899. By 1908, Duncan was touring the U.S. with an established reputation in Europe, and John Butler Yeats, father of the poet, added his sketch to the many images of her by Abraham Walkowitz, John Sloan, Jos&#x000E9; Clar&#x000E1;, Auguste Rodin, and Gordon Craig (IDA, 35&#x02013;63). Also in 1908, Duncan developed a close friendship with Constantin Stanislavski, introduced the acting theorist to Gordon Craig, and initiated their collaboration on the 1912 Moscow Art Theatre production of <i>Hamlet</i>.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  The 1914 publications of the first Imagist anthology and the Vorticist <i>Blast</i> marked Duncan's famous choreography to <i>Ave Maria</i> (Schubert), a tribute to her children who drowned after their car plunged into the Seine. With the onset of World War I, Duncan choreographed the political <i>Marseillaise</i> , set to the French national anthem and designed to arouse support for U.S. involvement in the Allied cause. In 1917, the year Marinetti discussed her art in "Manifesto of the Futurist Dance," Duncan became interested in the Russian Revolution, and her piece, <i>Revolutionary</i> (Scriabin, 1924), depicting a worker's awakening self-consciousness, reveals her engagement in the political debates of her time. The 1922 publications of <i>The Waste Land</i> and <i>Ulysses</i> 

<b></b>

correspond to Duncan's marriage to Russian poet, Serge Esenin, and her controversial American tour leading to accusations of communist sympathies and the loss of her U.S. citizenship. Duncan died in 1927 in a highly publicized accident when her scarf became entangled in the wheel of a car and broke her neck.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Duncan's historical period is obviously modernism, but periodization would be insignificant if it were determined simply by dates. Duncan's art has not been considered sufficiently modernist, in part, because aspects of her dance became common practice and other features have been overlooked. She developed an innovative performance form: the solo dance choreographed to romantic music (Chopin, Wagner) followed by curtain call speeches.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Although soloists became common in modern dance with Martha Graham and Ruth St. Dennis, the shock of Duncan's single female body dancing on the stage was frequently the focus of both complimentary and negative reviews.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Similarly, classical music has become a staple accompaniment to modern dance, but Duncan's use of "high music" was extremely controversial. Carl Van Vechten, reviewer for the <i>New York Times</i>, protested the "sacrilege" of her musical choices for her 1909 performances at the Metropolitan Opera House, claiming that Gluck's "Iphig&#x000E9;nie en Aulide" was "never designed for dancing."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  By July 1917, however, Van Vechten was applauding Duncan's new experiments: "More than the dance this new art partakes of the fluid and unending quality of music. Like any other new art it is not to be understood at first and I confess in the beginning it said nothing to me . . . "<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Here, Van Vechten frames Duncan's performances as a new art, as does Duncan in her curtain-call speeches, the final element of her performance form.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Duncan's speeches educate her audience as they explain and defend her choreography, theories of education, and political positions. In a speech delivered during her unsuccessful American tour of October 1922, Duncan recognizes her curtain call statements as integral to her performance, in spite of the protests of her manager, Sol Hurok: "My manager tells me that if I make more speeches the tour is dead. Very well, the tour is dead!" (IS, 138). The speeches were also central to Duncan's thought and often served as seeds for expanded essays.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Duncan's speeches consistently mix metaphysical (soul) and materialist (motor) concepts and have therefore been dismissed as "grandiloquence." Yet her brief polemical statements can be better understood in the context of the modernist manifesto, a performative genre employed by contending avant-garde groups.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Attempting to transform political argumentation into a theatrical construct, manifestos were published in a layout designed to shout in print and performed by Marinetti and others after 1910.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  The performed manifesto was a crucial component of early modernism's jostling for social, literary, and danced positions. All factions, however, shared hostility for elements of "tradition," and Duncan also rails against the entrenched forms of dance, most notably ballet. Just as Marinetti asks, "Why poison ourselves? Why rot?" by touring museums (VP, 88), Duncan insists, "I do not mean to say <i>copy</i> it, <i>imitate</i> it; but to <i>breathe its life</i>, <i>to recreate it in one's self with personal inspiration</i>."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Additionally, Marinetti's manifestos and Duncan's speeches both establish a relation of provocation and effrontery to the audience, a stance that is at odds with images of Duncan as the flitting Victorian nymph. With manifesto-like disdain, Duncan insults her audience: "Thank God the 

<b></b>

Boston critics don't like me. If they did I should feel I was hopeless" (IS, 53). Futurist manifestos are known for their celebration of technological achievements, like the motor, which alter the manner of human movement through the world, yet they also draw on metaphysical expressions.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  In "The Futurist Cinema," Marinetti admires the filmic media but also describes a "rhythm of soul and rhythm of legs" (SW, 134). The Aerial Futurists of the 1920's "intend to use the plane . . . to express the 'spirit of the epoch.' These pictures therefore break the circle of reality to indicate the mystery of a new spirituality."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  The fusion of technology and spirit manifest in Duncan's motor in the soul is evident even among the technophilic futurists.
</p>

<p>
Duncan's practice of giving curtain call speeches predates Marinetti's London manifesto-lectures of 1910, but she became more confrontational as the manifesto fever took hold in the following decade.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  That Marinetti frequently attended Duncan's performances and found them provocative is evident from his little-known "Manifesto of the Futurist Dance" . Discussing her work in relation to futurist performance aesthetics, Marinetti reveals that he admires her "free improvisations" and "free dance," although he considers her "childishly feminine" (SW, 137). Marinetti prefers her contemporary, Lo&#x000EF;e Fuller, because she produces machine-like motions and appears to transcend the constraints of the human body through innovative lighting techniques and mechanisms designed to manipulate yards of cloth skirting. For Marinetti, the futurist dance will "go beyond muscular possibilities," aim for "that ideal <i>multiplied body</i> of the motor," and "imitate the movements of machines" (SW, 138). Although Duncan emphasized the possibilities of the <i>human</i> body and worked for simplicity in her light tunics and stage designs, she influenced the futurist dances of Valentine de Saint-Point and Giannina Censi. Saint-Point's futurist "m&#x000E9;tachorie" (performed between 1913&#x02013;1917) featured a recitation of her poems by a narrator while she performed abstract, geometrical dances thought to be a reaction against Duncan's "childishly feminine" movements. This Duncan stereotype is not accurate, however, and her more weighted, political pieces undoubtedly inspired Saint-Point. Duncan's celebration of the female warrior in <i>The Amazons</i>  and battle cry in <i>Marseillaise</i>  epitomize Saint-Point's <i>Manifesto of the Futurist Woman</i> : "Women are Erinyes, Amazons, Semiramis . . . warriors who t more ferociously than men, lovers who incite, destroyers who contribute towards natural selection by breaking those who are fragile . . . "<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Here, Saint-Point uses Marinetti's rhetoric of violence to oppose his "contempt for women," <sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  and he probably drafted his "Manifesto of Futurist Dance" after her 1917 performance at the New York Metropolitan Opera House in an attempt to control the realm of futurist dance (OCTFM, n.14).
</p>

<p>
Giannina Censi's performances of aerial dances in the 1930's are advertised as the realization of the futurist dance, as she represents the motor's "<i>multiplied body</i>" and imitates the movement of machines, particularly airplanes (OCTFM, 397). Photographs of Censi on a poster for Teatro Garibaldi (1932&#x02013;33) dramatically demonstrate the influence of Duncan's technique, particularly in the pliant chest and back, upward lift of the torso, parallel leg positions, and leg lifts with bent knee. In images from <i>Aerofuturist Dance</i> , Censi kneels on the floor in positions recalling Duncan's innovative floor 

<b></b>

work and poses with her back arched in a position Duncan named the "Bacchante."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Censi uses these motions to interpret the myth of the machine rather than the diverse natural scenes and human dramas of Duncan, but Censi's comments on her dances reveal similarities that complicate the futurist "<i>multiplied body</i>": "everything that the plane did had to be expressed in my body. It flew and, moreover, it gave the impressions of these wings that trembled, of the apparatus that trembled . . . And the face had to express what the pilot felt" (OCTFM, 400). The "multiplied body" of the futurist dancer does not simply imitate machines or the motor's autonomous moving parts; Censi represents the pilot in the machine, the plane's movements as it encounters other forces and "trembles," and her own experience of the plane. Anja Kl&#x000F6;ck states that these performances "blur the boundaries between woman and machine, materiality and spirituality, mind and body, signifier and signified" (OCTFM, 408).
</p>

<p>
This sense of the body that represents multiple material and spiritual elements is an important feature of Duncan's dance aesthetics, and one that Censi may have inherited along with Duncan's technique, but then applied to the machine. In her early Schubert Waltz, <i>Water Study</i> , Duncan choreographs the crashing of waves, the spiral motion of an eddy, and the drawing current, but the dancer is also variously a person playing in the water and a seagull skimming its surface. She achieves this effect by dividing the body so that parts simultaneously express different energies or emotions. Renowned second generation Duncan dancer, Julia Levien, describes this difficult element of Duncan technique as the use of several "voices of the body."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  In <i>Water Study</i>,the feet follow a standard three beat waltz rhythm while the arms and torso express the lyrical, flowing melody.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Another corporal opposition develops as the ribs and torso shift away from the center of the body, thereby pulling the dancer off-balance as if she has been struck by a wave. The feet follow to catch the body, the dynamic of fall and recovery adds more undulations to those of the torso, and the danceexplores all movements related to water.
</p>

<p>
Another manifestation of the "multiplied body" in Duncan's practice is her ideal of a dance that can encompass several bodies and represent numerous characters in a given story. She famously claims, "I never danced a solo,"<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  and describes a "feeling of multiple oneness" while dancing as the fifty daughters of Danaus in <i>The Suppliants of Aeschylus</i> (ML, 100): "At the end of <i>Iphigenia</i> the maids of Tauris dance in bacchanalian joy for the rescue of Orestes. As I danced these delirious rondos, I felt their willing hands in mine; the pull and swing of their little bodies as the rondos grew faster and madder" (ML, 103). That reviewers recognize Duncan's effort to multiply her body is evident in Van Vechten's description of a New York audience's enthusiastic response to a 1916 performance of the <i>Marseillaise</i> (Rouget de Lisle). He applauds Duncan's ability: without making a sound to invoke "the hideous din of a hundred raucous voices." According to Van Vechten, this is accomplished through the interactions of various body parts. At "times, legs, arms, a leg or an arm, the throat, or the exposed breast assume an importance above that of the rest of the mass, suggesting the unfinished sculpture of Michael Angelo [<i>sic</i>] . . . " (TNI, 31). By creating oppositional relationships in her body, Duncan's single form represents the "unfinished" 

<b></b>

potential of the masses. Van Vechten mentions Michelangelo, but Duncan actually incorporates poses directly from Rude's sculpture of <i>Marseillaise</i> on the <i>Arc de Triomphe</i> and other postures suggestive of Marianne, the French symbol of war. Although Van Vechten carefully buries Duncan's "exposed breast" in a catalogue of other body parts, her famous and controversial final pose was an evocation of Delacroix's <i>Liberty Leading the People</i>, which would also remind an American audience of the Statue of Liberty and the historical friendship with France. The partially realized living picture of Delacroix's <i>Liberty</i> invites the audience to join the battle and fill in for the missing res, the mass of soldiers following Marianne. In a letter to Gertrude Stein<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  after a 1917 New York concert including <i>Marseillaise</i> and a final speech for the Allied cause, Van Vechten claims, "I tell you she drives 'em mad; the recruiting stations are full of her converts" (IASL, 365).
</p>

<p>
Like Saint-Point, Duncan's <i>Marseillaise</i> celebrates war, and while she does not dance as the machine in the manner of Censi, Duncan's motor in the soul quote reveals her insistence upon the soul's materiality. In fact, she designates the physical region of the solar plexus as "the temporal home of the soul" (ML, 244) in the account that has become the "foundational narrative of modern dance, its myth of origin."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

I was seeking, and finally discovered, the central spring of all movement, the crater of motor power. . . . The ballet school taught the pupils that this spring was found in the centre of the back at the base of the spine. From this axis says the ballet master, arms legs, and trunk must move freely, giving the result of an articulated puppet. This method produces artificial mechanical movement not worthy of the soul.

Situated in the center of the body, just above the abdomen, the solar plexus is engaged whenever the body travels in space rather than gestures with appendages like a puppet. Duncan locates the "human spirit" and the source of "divine expression" as well as the soul in the solar plexus and then defines her dance as movement from this locus. Thus, dance is a bodily response to a "central spring" or "motor power" that reveals the stirrings of a physicalized soul and provides a visible sign of inner spirituality. She rejects ballet's virtuosic kicks and codified gestures, which she associates with "mechanical movement," in favor of the technological and spiritual advance represented by fluid, motorized motion.
</p>

<p>
Duncan's designation of the solar plexus as the physical location of the soul and the motor propelling dance, according to Hillel Schwartz, establishes the trend of twentieth-century motion.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  The solar plexus assumed a politico-anatomical place as "centre of action and sympathy" early in the nineteenth century, and its centrality was further strengthened by the neurophysiological experiments of David Ferrier (1876, 1886). Schwartz describes the "new kinaesthetic" as "torque," the "model of motion as a spiral at whose radiant center was a mystical solar plexus"  or a "spiraling outward from a soulful center" (T, 108). The movement concept of "torque" was popularized 

<b></b>

by Duncan and then made its way into nearly every movement experience of the century, from the embodied motions of handwriting to the external propulsion of the escalator. Schwartz's argument opposes the current wisdom that modern industrialized life with its "assembly lines, time clocks...flashbulb photography, silent films, ragtime music and Cubism" fostered experiences of isolated, punctuated moments and fragmentation (T, 105). Schwartz maintains that the new kinaesthetic's flowing, spiraling motion is not simply a movement ideal opposing the dominant experience of motion during the period, because people have not begun to move like machines (T, 108). Duncan's image of the motor in the solar plexus/soul, however, suggests that the movement ideal she popularized for modernism actually integrated elements of industrialized motion to imagine qualities of movement, like a multiplied body, that only a motor could produce.
</p>

<p>
Another quality of motorized movement emphasized by Duncan is the illusion that an exterior force propels the body the way a motor propels a vehicle. Duncan describes placing a motor in her soul before she goes on stage and claims that after this agentive act, "my legs and arms and my whole body will move independently of my will" (ML, 123). The motor thus becomes the <i>will</i> of the soul, a complicated concept that Duncan derives from her study of Nietzsche.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  She adapts ideas about will into movement principles that manifest themselves in two different, even contradictory, qualities in her pieces: an effortless spontaneity and a willful display of the labor to move. These qualities correspond to opposing muscular experiences described in Nietzsche's theory of the will; using the language of movement, he suggests that in "every act of willing" there is a muscular sensation, even if we do not move, due to "a sort of habit."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  This sensation includes the "feeling of the state <i>away from which</i>, the feeling of the state <i>towards which</i>," a "commandeering thought," and the "affect of the command" (BGE, 18-ss19). Thus, the process of willing creates a duality whereby the individual is both "the one who commands <i>and</i> the one who obeys," simultaneously experiencing the sensations of the commander's power and freedom and the subordinate's "compulsion, force, pressure, resistance, and motion." Nietzsche ultimately relates the will to the soul by defining the body as "a society constructed out of many souls" (19-ss19). This many-souled, social body resembles the motor's <i>multiplied body</i>, and in pieces such as <i>Marseillaise</i>, Duncan represents both aspects of the Nietzschean will: the power of the commanding force and the restriction of obedience.
</p>

<p>
In "The Dance of the Future," the expanded version of her address to the Berlin Press Club, Duncan repeats Nietzsche's idea that the willing individual both commands and obeys, and applies this to her dance.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Demonstrating again the conjuncture of discourses that characterizes her writing, Duncan defines will as "the movement of the universe concentrating in an individual" and dance as "the natural gravitation of this will of the individual" (TDF, 55). As an instance of cosmic force, the "individual" discovers "natural" dance movements when she is in "harmony" with the gravitational movements of the earth. For Duncan, the dancer's will submits to these forces and allows them to move her, just as she places a motor in her soul to propel her. That is, her "natural" dance should appear spontaneous and unchoreographed, like the "movement

<b></b>

of free animals and birds." Duncan argues, "It is only when you put free animals under false restrictions that they lose the power of moving in harmony with nature, and adopt a movement expressive of the restrictions placed upon them" (TDF, 54&#x02013;55). The human will also asserts itself in unnatural contortions when restrictions hinder its movements; thus pieces exploring oppression, like <i>Marseillaise</i>,depict the muscular effort of the will to rise against tyranny.
</p>

<p>
Duncan's idea of the motor as the will of the soul and Nietzsche's theories of the will's two muscular manifestations (the natural, harmonic and the restricted, oppressed motions) become primary choreographic principles for Duncan. If she hopes to create the impression that dance is the "natural" expression of a soulful inner self, she must not appear to be dancing choreographed steps, and she works for an illusion of spontaneity, the feeling that a motor is propelling her body. Reviewers often misunderstand this technique and suggest that Duncan is a "solo artist who gave little thought to choreography as such."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  The prevailing theories of Duncan's choreographic process continue to be that her dance is an improvisation of emotional self-expression or music visualization.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  The argument hinges on the ultimately inconclusive discussion of whether personal experience, music, or narrative is the initial inspiration for the choreography.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Emotion, self, and music are all important sources of choreographic ideas, and she associated each with her image of the motor. In "Depth," she writes, "Emotion works like a motor. It must be warmed up to run well, and the heat does not develop immediately; it is progressive." Moreover, the running of this emotional motor allows us to "lose ourselves in an inner self."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup> A careful choreographer, Duncan's analogy of motorized propulsion helps her achieve a desired effect, a trance-like, spontaneous performance.
</p>

<p>
Duncan's achievement of the illusion of spontaneity influenced Stanislavski's innovations in acting theory and dramatic performance, as did one more quality of her motorized movement: repetition. Significantly, Duncan's passage in her autobiography on the motor in the soul quotes from Stanislavski's chapter devoted to her and Gordon Craig in his own autobiography . Stanislavski describes the first time he saw Duncan dance in 1905 and the close friendship they developed when she returned to Moscow in 1908, and he discusses her influence on his ideas of performance using the trope of the motor in the soul:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
At the time I was in search of that very creative motor, which the actor must learn to put in his soul before he comes out on stage. . . . . I watched her during her performances and her rehearsals, when her developing emotion would first change the expression of her face, and with shining eyes she would pass to the display of what was born in her soul.

Stanislavski hopes to replicate Duncan's effect of motorized movement, the appearance that an exterior force propels the performer through an emotional experience that results in a "display" of the "soul." Duncan's impact on Stanislavski has not been recognized in dance and theater history.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  In fact, Joseph R. Roach's <i>The Player's Passion</i>, a fascinating study of the history of acting theory in relation to science and

<b></b>

prevailing understandings of the human body, fails to mention Duncan among the lines of influence from Diderot to Craig and Stanislavski.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Nonetheless, Stanislavski's theories and Roach's discussion of his "System" reveal points of connection with Duncan. According to Roach, Stanislavski sought to "objectify the phenomenon of spontaneity" by defining spontaneity in performance as "an activity repeated so often that it becomes automatic and therefore free" (TPP, 197). In Stanislavski's rubric, "Habit creates second nature, which is a second reality."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  The repetitive rehearsal process fosters habits and a "second nature," which emerges on the stage as an "unconscious" or "natural" response that then enables the actor to recreate lived experience on the stage as a "second reality."
</p>

<p>
Stanislavski's mention of Duncan's rehearsal process in his autobiography, in addition to their shared interest in the motor as an image of repetition, would suggest that she too seeks to "objectify" spontaneity through habit formation. In an interview with Mason Redfern (ca. 1917), she insists, "When I am dancing, the movements succeed one another so rapidly, so spontaneously, it would seem&#x02014;though every effect is carefully worked out beforehand&#x02014;that I hardly know what I am doing and my state of mind is akin to clairvoyance."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Before each performance, Duncan clearly choreographs in the traditional sense, "carefully" organizes the effect she hopes to produce, establishes movement patterns, and rehearses until she no longer needs to think about each individual step and the dance becomes habit. The modernist concept of habit, as Lisi Schoenbach has recently demonstrated, is more significant than has been recognized by critics reading modernism through the lens of avant-garde principles of shock. Defining a "pragmatic modernism," a version of modernism founded on the tradition of American pragmatism, Schoenbach discusses John Dewey's view of habit as both a force for "machine-like repetition" and a necessity for any process of social reorganization.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  For Dewey, a society without habit is in chaos and the dominance of habit can produce blind recurrence, but "with conflict of habits and release of impulse there is conscious search" (PE, 242). Duncan and Stanislavski translate this view of habit to the stage and use the repetition of rehearsal to form habits that will alter the usual consciousness of performance and allow for a state of "creative unconscious" or "clairvoyance." The habits developed for performances will likely conflict with other, more quotidian habits to release Dewey's "impulse" for "conscious search."
</p>

<p>
For Duncan, only the disciplined, rehearsed, moving body can produce a trance-like state and the experience of an unconscious performance. While Stanislavski is interested in spontaneous speech and other modes of drama in addition to movement, his psychophysical techniques suggest that bodily movement is an important aspect of his training as well. Stanislavski writes that both physical and psychological or "inner" habits are used on stage as the actor develops "creative objectives" that "lure" emotions and desires: "All these necessary objectives are so habitual that we execute them mechanically, with our muscles. In our inner realm, too, we find an infinite number of necessary, simply psychological objectives" (TCT, 255&#x02013;256). Stanislavski theorizes the relationship between the performing mind and body using the scientific and psychological advancements of the early twentieth century, just as Duncan adopts evolutionary 

<b></b>

theory and the physics of gravitation to explain her ideas of will and spontaneity. Like Duncan, Stanislavski theorizes the "soul" into this relationship, insisting, "The bond between body and soul is indivisible . . . In every physical act there is a psychological element and a physical one in every psychological act" (TPP, 205). Although interpreters of Stanislavski's System and American Method acting outline a purely materialistic and mechanistic performance theory, "a bald equation of organism and machine" (TPP, 217), Stanislavski uses phrases such as "spiritual activity," "inner aspiration," and "inner calls to action" (TCT, 253&#x02013;254). In fact, Stanislavski, like Duncan, hoped to create a "religion of art" with theater as a temple, audience as worshippers, and actors as initiates at the ritual. As Roach explains, "A mystic and idealist, he tolerated his own mechanization of the art he loved only within definite limits, and such sonorities as the 'inner life of the human spirit' rolled off his tongue far more naturally than technical terms like <i>cerebral reflex</i>" (TPP, 217). The metaphysical language of Stanislavski, Duncan, even futurist manifestos, and Nietzsche's philosophy, suggests that invocations of spirit and soul are more prevalent in various spheres of modernism than critics often recognize.
</p>

<p>
Both Duncan's image of the motor in the soul and her desire to create the illusion of spontaneity shape her choreography and rehearsal methods, which have been passed down to contemporary Duncan dancers studying at the Isadora Duncan Dance Foundation (IDDF). In addition to frequent rehearsals to render the movements so familiar that performers need not think about separate motions (dancers call this muscle memory), Duncan technique as taught by IDDF requires that the execution of movements be a fraction of a count behind the music (CS). Thus, the dance appears to be a response or reaction to the music, and the dancer can produce the illusion that the movement is not choreographed. Duncan dancers also train themselves to produce this spontaneous quality in their dance by practicing improvisational exercises at the conclusion of each IDDF class. Duncan technique further stipulates that a thought or intention motivates every movement; describing her teaching philosophy, Duncan claims, "We do not allow the child to make a single movement unless it knows why it makes it."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Prior to every gesture, the dancer must convey a desire and decision to make the motion so that she appears to be moving in response to an instantaneous impulse rather than following the choreography of a previous desire. In <i>Water Study</i>, the Chopin Waltz discussed above, the face registers excitement at the thought of a new "game" when the dancer decides to emerge and chase a water bird. In addition to facial expression, the qualities of the physical movement can also indicate intention. In Duncan technique, every motion must begin from the solar plexus, unfold from this center, and involve the entire body. To perform correctly a reaching gesture, the solar plexus initiates a vector by shifting the torso in the direction of the reach, the upper arm continues the motion as if the force were traveling progressively from shoulder to hand, and the fingertips finish the gesture by pointing to the shape it would make in the air. Duncan contrasts the continuity of motorized motion with ballet technique's end-stopped feats of physical virtuosity: "The expression of the modern school of ballet, wherein each action is an end, and no movement, pose or rhythm is successive or can be made to evolve succeeding action, is an expression of degeneration, of living death" (TDF, 56). 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The requirement that an intention or thought precede each gesture might appear to contradict the state of "clairvoyance" Duncan describes or her claim that the motor works without the intervention of her will. Crucially, the spontaneous performance she desires is notthoughtless, although it seems not to have been thought prior to the performance, just as Stanislavski's actor does not appear to have previously chosen a response. Nor is Duncan dance effortless. Returning to Duncan's Nietzschean definition of the will as an instance of gravitational motion, it is clear that even when movement is propelled by a motor, the forces of gravity still operate on the body as the weight shifts and a leg lifts or an arm reaches. In fact, Duncan technique requires recognition of the weight of gravity in every motion, a very difficult effect for dancers to produce, especially those trained in ballet technique. Another of Duncan's critiques of the "corps de ballet" focuses on the painful, "unnatural" toe shoes that attempt "to create the delusion that the law of gravitation does not exist" (TDF, 56). Whereas the ballerina is taught to conceal the effort of her movements with a pleasant face and a rigid torso, the Duncan dancer is taught to acknowledge the effort to move the leg's weight as it responds to the force of gravity, even in Duncan's small waltz steps. Duncan rarely choreographs ballet's <i>degag&#x000E9;s</i>, kicks with a straight leg that tend to accentuate length and suggest lightness; instead, her leg swings require a bent knee. This weight is also evident in Censi's <i>Aerofuturist Dance</i>, which most prominently presents the thigh, the heaviest part of the leg, to the audience.
</p>

<p>
The literal weight of Duncan's thigh exerted pressure on the image of the <i>new woman</i> of modernism as Duncan became an internationally recognized symbol for women's liberation. Her significance for early feminism has not been fully realized, perhaps because her suspicions of mass political movements led her to disassociate herself from the suffragettes. Floyd Dell's <i>Women as World Builders</i> , a surprisingly early (and forgotten) summary of trajectories of feminism, devotes a chapter to Duncan. According to Dell, the American movement, following her lead, was more concerned with liberating the body than agitating for the vote.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  He argues, "[I]t is to the body that one looks for the Magna Charta [<i>sic</i>.] of feminism," and Duncan "renovated the modern soul and made us see . . . the goodness of the whole body" (WWB, 45&#x02013;49). For Dell, as for the other prominent res in this study, modern life requires the renovation of the soul and body rather than a complete rupture from spiritual modes of life. Duncan's 1915 American tour introduced her to Dell and other members of New York's "Young Intellectuals," a group of artists and revolutionaries centered in Greenwich Village. Dell, Max Eastman, and John Sloan were members of the collective editorship of <i>The Masses</i>, a radical publication structured as "a worker-owned cooperative with all stock held by the artists and writers."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  In addition to its revolutionary politics and advocacy of artistic freedom, <i>The Masses</i> was instrumental in developing the image of the <i>new woman</i> in drawings and articles that supported economic equality and suffrage (TMM, 191). Duncan's expressive, free (uncorseted) body, dancing alone onstage, became the prototype for this image of the modern woman.
</p>

<p>
The May 1915 edition of <i>The Masses</i> features a cover designed by Sloan, a leading artist of the Ashcan school, illustrating the preparation for a leg extension in Duncan's 

<b></b>

<i>Marche Militaire</i>.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  The September 1917 edition includes one of the many famous Duncan drawings by Abraham Walkowitz, and both Walkowitz and Sloan depict a shapely, full-breasted woman dancing alone in an empty space without scenery to distract the eye from the singular body. With thickly shaded lines, they emphasize the weightiness of the thighs that are a trademark of the Duncan technique. Sloan's sketch of <i>Marche Militaire</i> is particularly suggestive of the lightness of the lower leg falling from the bent knee in opposition to the heaviness of a thigh. Duncan's thigh appears to have been pulled upward toward the chest rather than lifted away from the body, as ballet technique would prescribe. Sloan saw Duncan perform several times and describes her as, "Not angelic, materialistic-not superhuman but the greatest human love of life. Her great big thighs, her small head, her full solid loins, belly-clean, all clean&#x02014;holy&#x02014;part of God."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  This might be a list of the qualities he was attempting to capture in his 1911 painting "Isadora Duncan" (begun March 3, repainted March 8). In this image, too, Duncan is dancing alone and the positions of the legs again emphasize their weight; she stands on one slightly bent leg, lifting the other as if to present her thigh to the audience. (<a href="#1"> 1</a>)
</p>

<p>
Duncan's thigh and mature, womanly body, dressed in flowing tunics with free breasts, captured in an arrested moment of movement, served as the paradigmatic image of the self-sufficient, emancipated woman. Sloan's description of Duncan as "not angelic, materialistic" and yet a "part of God" reveals that audiences saw both the political weight of her performance and the soulful, clairvoyant aspect. The influence of Duncan's singular body on Sloan's other drawings of women is evident in the same thick lines and full thighs. The significance of these depictions of the womanly body lies in their deviation from the image of the sleek and stiffly posed "commercial cover girl" that, to the artists of <i>The Masses</i>, "represented the forces of capitalism because it used art&#x02014;and by implication sex&#x02014;to sell a magazine filled with illustrated advertisements designed to sell goods" (TMM, 203).<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  In response to a letter complaining of "crude" drawings, Eastman writes that <i>The Masses</i> offers alternatives to the "slippery girls in tights and tinted cupids" featured in conventional magazines (TMM, 206). Eastman echoes Duncan's own chastisement of ballet and vaudeville dancers in "horrid salmon-coloured silk tights" (ML, 115) with their "half-clothed suggestiveness" and "burlesque semi-exposures" (IS, 48&#x02013;49). The extent to which Duncan changed conceptions of the female body is also revealed by a comparison of images from early and late in her career. A series of drawings, signed "Aspell," from a New York recital in 1898, depicts Duncan as a slight, nymph-like re wearing toe shoes with ribbons. (<a href="#2"> 2</a>) Aspell presents her in the genre of nineteenth-century ballet, but a decade later, when Walkowitz and Sloan begin drawing Duncan's weighty thighs, her body had changed, but more importantly, she changed the way the dancing body and the female body more generally could be represented.
</p>

<p>
Dance criticism and modernist studies alike have failed to recognize the extent of Duncan's participation in international modernism and influence on several of its more significant movements in addition to modern dance: futurism, the Moscow Art Theatre, Greenwich Village radicalism, and feminism.

soul resembles Victorian spiritualism, Duncan assigns the soul a physiological location and reveals a modern suspicion of its immanence. The word "soul" functions as a placeholder for all that is outside rational logic and "verbal teaching" in her 1924 Speech at the Kamerny Theater (IS, 81&#x02013;84). Duncan claims that children learn not through words but "through movements; up to the age of ten or twelve they learn more from the soul. But nobody believes in the soul any more, so I say they learn from the spirit, or from intuitions" (IS, 82). Duncan advocates romantic principles of education, but recognizes the necessity of changing her terminology for modern life. If her audience no longer understands "soul," she finds another word that marks the same sphere of human experience. In this late speech, Duncan argues against continuing accusations that she is "mystical." Instead, she advocates the "natural" dance of the soul, which she explains with images of unfolding plants and flowers but also with the motor: "&#x02026;here in our breast is a motor supplying power for our most wonderful emotions" (IS, 82).
</p>

<p>
Duncan employs the language of technology as a dialectic to ways of being (the motorized machine rather than the mechanical puppet), and her motor in the soul suggests the renovation of the spiritual through images of modern industrial technology. Duncan's conjunction of scientific, evolutionary, and metaphysical discourse in her speeches and published writing is actually a central modernist trope that can be found among futurists, philosophers, and feminists alike. Just as Duncan refuses to establish an opposition between the soulful human and the mechanized motor, she combines, dissolves, and dances around many of modernism's fundamental dualisms without resolving them: spirit/body, sacred/profane, self/society. Unlike other early modernists, she choreographs these ideas and contradictions into dances seeming so fluid and continuous that they appear to be the spontaneous movements of a body propelled by a motor, so weighted that her thighs become symbols of political struggle.

As her two children were also killed in an automobile, it is tempting to read the tragedies of Duncan's life as comments on the invasion of the motor. Such autobiographically driven discussions are common in the literature, and she has been packaged as the "natural" dancer who monolithically protested machines before one killed her. Of course, she actually had a more complicated perspective on the infusion of technology into modern life.

In 1910, Shaemas O'Sheel wrote, "This solitary re on the lonely stage suddenly confronts each of us with the secret of a primal desire invincibly inhering in the fibre of each, a secret we had securely hidden beneath our conventional behaviors, and we yearn for a new and liberated order in which we may indeed dance." O'Sheel, "Isadora Duncan, Priestess," <i>Poet Lore</i> 21 : 481. While Duncan was a consistent favorite with artists like O'Sheel, reviewers for more mainstream publications were less pleased with her solos. The anonymous <i>Variety</i> reviewer of Duncan's August 2, 1908 performance indicates a preference for vaudeville's renditions of <i>Salom&#x000E9;</i> seduction dances and burlesques of <i>The Merry Widow</i>, complaining of "Isadora Duncan's attempt to monopolize a whole audience&#x02014;and a $2 audience at that&#x02014;for an entire evening."

Gertrude Stein's <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> (New York: Vintage, 1990) reveals, "Raymond Duncan, the brother of Isadora, rented an atelier in the Rue de Fleurus" . Treating family intrigue with her wry humor, she writes, "Raymond had gone completely greek and this included a greek girl. Isadora lost interest in him, she found the girl too modern a greek" . Even if Duncan was avoiding her brother (her autobiography indicates that she accepted his marriage), the link suggests that her dance may have influenced Picasso, Matisse, and other artists of the Stein circle. Stein's writing also invokes the aesthetics of the motor; in <i>Lectures in America</i> (London: Virago, 1988) she attempts to give her words constant motion through the rhythms of repetition: "It is something strictly American to conceive a space that is filled with moving, a space of time that is filled always filled with moving" .

Contemporaneous reviews frequently designate Duncan's performances as self-expressive, and her influential student, Irma Duncan describes the dance of her teacher as a "personal expression" and an "individual manifestation that cannot be duplicated." Irma Duncan, <i>The Technique of Isadora Duncan</i> (New York: Dance Horizons, 1970), xi. The notion that Duncan's choreography is a practice of music visualization still receives credence; after viewing reconstructions of Duncan's choreography during the Duncan centennial celebration, Robert J.

Ann Daly discusses the debate and argues, "Duncan's dancing was not the spontaneous expression of her own personal emotions. Neither was it the description of music . . . Rather, music

served as her starting point suggesting to Duncan visual/emotional imagery" (DID, 137&#x02013;39). It is also possible, however, that Duncan initially became interested in the visual/emotional imagery of a story, like the myth of Iphigenia, and then chose a piece of music from Gluck's opera, <i>Iphigenia in Tauris</i> as accompaniment. Moreover, Duncan occasionally choreographed pieces, such as <i>Death and the Maiden</i> , without musical accompaniment (IASL, 248).

Several dance articles give general and inaccurate overviews of Duncan in relation to the theater. David Weiss mentions Duncan's influence on Method acting, but minimizes the contributions of both Duncan and Craig, describing them as "pioneers in theatrical self-expression." "Isadora Duncan...Actress: And Her Influence on the Theater," <i>Dance Magazine</i> (Feb. 1960): 40&#x02013;43. N. Roslavleva uses the motor in the soul quote to differentiate Duncan's practice from Stanislavski's interest in the development of character: "Duncan started that motor within herself for the purpose of self-expression . . . She expressed emotions of a general kind, never showing any interest in characterization, never being anyone but herself." Roslavleva, "Stanislavski and the ballet," <i>Dance Perspectives</i> (23.15): 16. As her dance as the daughters of Danai reveals, Duncan invoked several characters and chose crucial scenes to represent. A spectrum of variations complicates the distinction between performing as self and as another character, and Duncan explored many of these options. Even in Method acting, the technique of emotional recall suggests that the actor remembers past emotional experiences and uses them to inspire the performance.

In August 2003, a group of protesters stormed the Pra&#x000E7;a dos Tr&#x000EA;s Poderes ("Plaza of the Three Powers") in the center of Bras&#x000ED;lia.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  All three branches of Brazil's federal government have their main palaces around this great plaza at the southern tip of the capital's "Monumental Axis;" the particular target on this day being the Congresso Nacional. At one point a small group among the hundreds of protesters around the Congress armed themselves with office chairs and whatever else they could find, and began to smash the large plate glass windows that form a wall along the northern flank of the structure. This violence was, of course, primarily political in nature, although it is doubtful that many of the protesters realized just how profoundly political it was. The immediate cause of their outrage was a severe diminution of state pension benefits proposed by the government of President Luiz In&#x000E1;cio "Lula" da Silva of the leftist Partido dos Trabalhadores ("Worker's Party"). The protesters were current and retired state bureaucrats, a class of workers who have traditionally been promised rather exorbitant retirement benefits by every political regime (democratic and autocratic alike) since Get&#x000FA;lio Vargas's modernizing Estado Novo (1937&#x02013;46). Although Lula had been elected to the presidency as the representative of this bureaucratic class, immediately upon assuming his post he was faced with an impossible fiscal choice brought on by a pension system the nation could no longer afford: either betray his own constituency, or plunge Brazil into bankruptcy, destabilizing international finance markets in the process.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The protesters in Bras&#x000ED;lia that day were making as much of a <i>poetic</i> statement as they were making a <i>political</i> one. My 

<b></b>

purpose in the present essay is to show how the aesthetics of modernism come to bear upon these sorts of political actions which are themselves the result of impossible economic choices. Modernist poetics has traditionally been theorized in terms of detachment; as Peter B&#x000FC;rger would have it, for instance, the avant-garde work of art refuses to provide coherent meaning, and only through extreme semantic difficulty does the work purport to initiate a radical change in the reader's life praxis.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  When viewed in relation to Brazilian modernism and its architecture, however, this sort of negatively-charged, deferred engagement with political praxis is not quite relevant. More to the point, the modernist architects who designed Bras&#x000ED;lia&#x02014;most notably Oscar Niemeyer, the architect of the city's principle monumental structures&#x02014;were directly commissioned by the nation-state to create their works. Brazilian modernism is thus inconceivable without reference to the international political economics of Brazil's development; in short, we will find that modernism always depends upon modernization. Yet the surfaces of Bras&#x000ED;lia&#x02014;precisely those surfaces first imagined by Niemeyer and later fractured by the protesting bureaucrats&#x02014;exhibit a form of lyricism that is also highly critical of developmentalist modernization. Ironically, in order to properly comprehend the link between modernism and modernization, it is necessary to link modernism to modernism, to enjoin architecture and poetry in a truly structural form of poetic close reading.
</p>

<p>
By smashing the plate glass of the Congresso Nacional, in other words, the protesting bureaucrats were "closing" a rather dizzying historical circuit between modernism and modernization. "Modernization" here may be understood as not just the development of an industrial economy, but also the consolidation of a national state under a forceful, centralized government, which itself facilitates economic development.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Since the Estado Novo, such consolidation has been sought through state patronage of national aesthetic projects and state co-optation/incorporation of entire social classes such as industrial labor. In essence, a large state bureaucracy was created after 1930 as Brazil sought to modernize its political infrastructure. Members of this bureaucracy, in turn, have been incorporated into the state as a formal constituency&#x02014;one that has been satisfied through the promise of a generous social security net. With this political base of the population (along with heavy borrowing from international development banks), the populist president, Juscelino Kubitschek, embarked on an aggressive path towards industrialization in the 1950s, and led efforts to build an entirely new capital in the interior of the country as a sign of Brazil's "great leap forward" into industrial modernity.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Bras&#x000ED;lia was to shine as both an emblem of the nation's aesthetic and economic "maturity"&#x02014;a sign that Brazil could produce the world's greatest art and industrial goods. In attacking the Congress building, therefore, the protesters were destroying part of a structure that could not have existed without their political support, even as it had come to symbolize the very debility of their own political power.
</p>

<p>
As concerns the aesthetics of the place, the bureaucrats were also physically disrupting a "pure" architectural surface that had been intentionally placed there by Niemeyer in accordance with the precepts of functionalist style. We may find it ironically poetic (or poetically ironic?) that government functionaries would so violently clash 

<b></b>

with the architectural functionalism of the Congresso Nacional. There is another link between poetry and architecture, however, on which I wish to elaborate. It is still not clear whether we can speak of a common "modernism" in architecture and literature, or whether we must think in terms of plural modernism<i>s</i>.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Recent studies by Jeffrey Schnapp,<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Mark Wigley,<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  and Charles Perrone<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  (among others) point to strong links between urban architecture, literary-cultural studies, and state formation in the past century. Modernist architects, for instance, especially in the early phases of the International Style (ca. 1925&#x02013;35) often directly served the "modernizing" political regimes of the day, as Schnapp has convincingly demonstrated in the case of fascist Italy. Perrone has shown in the specific case of Brazil that the advent of its poetic <i>modernismo</i> after 1920 is inconceivable without the rapid urbanization of the country, particularly in S&#x000E3;o Paulo. Modernist poets actively sought the re-fashioning of national identity, and in many cases they were co-opted into Vargas's proto-fascist Estado Novo.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Thus, in spite of the disparities between their respective art-forms, both modernist architects and modernist poets in Brazil may be linked in terms of their official institutionalization by the state. This is nowhere more apparent than in the professionalization initiatives after 1930. One of the hallmarks of the Estado Novo was the formalization of professional higher education. It was in this period that the Faculdade de Letras would be founded at the Universidade de S&#x000E3;o Paulo (USP) under the leadership of the great literary scholar, Ant&#x000F4;nio C&#x000E2;ndido; and that the architectural school of the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes in Rio de Janeiro would be created under the directorship of the poet L&#x000FA;cio Costa. A discernibly Brazilian aesthetic sensibility would emerge in the first generations educated in these institutions. C&#x000E2;ndido's disciples at USP, the poets Haroldo de Campos and Augusto de Campos, would lead the charge of the "cannibalistic" <i>poesia concreta</i> which they formulated as members of the Noigandres group: the "concrete" of the concrete poetry, however, being a direct reference to Brazilian architecture and its predilection for reinforced concrete. Costa would collaborate with his first (and greatest) disciple, Oscar Niemeyer, in the construction of the Brazilian Pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair, a work that would establish the young Niemeyer as a rising star of international modernism. In the 1940s Niemeyer received commissions throughout the Western Hemisphere, and would work with Le Corbusier on the initial plans for the United Nations headquarters in Manhattan. Perhaps most significantly, Niemeyer grabbed the attention of the then-governor of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, Juscelino Kubitschek, who commissioned several works from him for the state capital, Belo Horizonte. When Kubitschek assumed the presidency in 1955, he spearheaded efforts to design and build Bras&#x000ED;lia as part of his program to advance Brazil "50 years in five." The distinctive urban plan of the new capital, of course, would be designed by L&#x000FA;cio Costa; and the majority of the city's monumental projects would be awarded to none other than Oscar Niemeyer.
</p>

<p>
The monuments of Bras&#x000ED;lia are the showcase of an architect who had recently come into his own fully mature, individual style&#x02014;particularly in the exquisite curvature that is now so characteristic of Niemeyer's work. Yet this style can only be properly understood within the context of Niemeyer's formation as an architect. In addition to his affiliation 

<b></b>

with the Escola Nacional de Belas Artes, L&#x000FA;cio Costa was also the first Brazilian representative in the Congr&#x000E9;s Internationale de l'Architecture Moderne (CIAM). Costa became particularly close (personally and professionally) to Le Corbusier, and as such he became a strong proponent of the functionalism at the center of CIAM's so-called "International Style." <sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
This particular type of functionalism serves as the backdrop to the "poetry" of Niemeyer's work, and thus merits a brief digression. We are inclined to think of functionalism as a theory of use. Modernist architecture can be described as functional in the way it strives to accommodate the intended uses for which it has been charged or commissioned, such that all elements of design serve rational and utilitarian ends; or as Louis Henry Sullivan succinctly and alliteratively put it, "form follows function." However, as it was originally imagined by CIAM after 1925, functionalism is much more a theory of production than use. Chief among the functionalist tenets of the International Style were: an understanding of structure in terms of geometric volume (grids, matrices, cubes) in order to economize structural stability and maximize interior space; a utilization of regularized and standardized elements in construction in order to promote the use of pre-fabricated components and also as a way to drive down construction costs; and an elimination of decoration except as functional "integral ornamentation," which effectively eliminates the need for highly paid artisans in construction.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  In the heyday of the International Style (1925&#x02013;50), projects of similar stature were produced in Europe and the United States following these tendencies: for one, the so-called "cult of whiteness" or "Purism" emphasized pure white and clear glass surfaces and constructions utilizing regular linear forms or quadrilateral volumes in particular. In all respects, it is necessary to underscore that the intention of CIAM was always to re-scale urban architecture according to the exigencies of mass production and industrial pre-fabrication.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, in one of the first theoretical manifestations of the International Style, <i>Towards a New Architecture</i> , Le Corbusier consistently refers to "architecture" not as an "art" or as a "craft," but as an "industry." He intends his new architecture to bring this "industry" into the age of mass production:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
Industry has created its tools.
<br />
Business has modified its habits and customs.
<br />
Construction has found new means.
<br />
Architecture finds itself confronted with new laws.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Unmistakably, Le Corbusier's perspective is epitomized here in the iconic connections his characteristically aphoristic style establishes. "Architecture" is to be (re-)conceived in line with the other grammatical subjects that precede it on the page: "Construction," "Business," and "Industry." The overt goal of Le Corbusier's theories, moreover, was to utilize modern architecture towards utopian ends&#x02014;as a constructed "rational" environment that would lead to civilization, peace, and prosperity. Le Corbusier's architectural revolution, in other words, is geared to put an end to violent military or 

<b></b>

political revolutions. Such statements are often made in <i>Towards a New Architecture</i> through the iconic juxtaposition of Le Corbusier's text and rather peculiar visual images. For instance, the chapter from which the above citation has been taken, "Architecture or Revolution," ends with a rather disturbing image: a drawing of a briar pipe.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  The purpose of this image could not be clearer: by design the pipe fits comfortably into the hand, but its design is also so simple that the pipe is suitable for mass-production; because mass-produced, furthermore, the pipe becomes an affordable commodity that allows every man the luxury and relaxation of smoking tobacco. In essence, the briar pipe is the very epitome of both functionalist design and all the "civilizing" benefits made possible by industrialization.
</p>

<p>
Yet the aesthetic pleasure of the briar pipe as presented by the Swiss architect would seem antithetical to modernist poetry. In response to Le Corbusier's image of the pipe, for instance, we can find Ren&#x000E9; Magritte's 1929 work, "Treachery of Images" &#x02014;an image of a briar pipe underlined by the words, "Ceci n'est pas une pipe." No doubt this coincidence has received attention elsewhere. While Le Corbusier remains firmly focused on concrete materiality, Magritte's words attempt to convince us of the utter immateriality of the poetic&#x02014;or rather, of the reality of the canvas as opposed to the unreality of what is spoken by it. The poetic sense of Magritte's work derives from the literal meaning of words puncturing the lack of literal meaning in the image; while we seemed trained to think of the relation between the object represented and the image representing it as one of tautological equivalence, the words in Magritte's painting compel us to view this relation in terms of metaphorical difference.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  This action may carry over into the general relation between modern architecture and modern poetry. There is no place in Le Corbusier's usage of the briar pipe for the sorts of poetic effects achieved by Magritte's usage of the briar pipe. Since Le Corbusier uses the image iconically to utopian ends, there is no room in his usage for a full-scale failure of reference and substantiality. On the other hand, Magritte's poetry may serve to critique Le Corbusier's utilitarianism, but this critique is not necessary to the immanent functionalism of the briar pipe. The relation between the two is casual, not causal. In general terms, then, lyricism could be construed as superfluous to the explicit aims of functionalism&#x02014;and not just in the lack of ornamentation in functionalist design, but more generally to the civilizing ends of industrial architecture. Would the imputed superfluity of poetry vis-&#x000E0;-vis architecture thus negate the possibility of meaningful critique? And would it necessarily translate into mutual exclusion between poetry and architecture?
</p>

<p>
As alluded to earlier, Niemeyer's work seems born of an ironic relationship to the kinds of industrial modernization in the immediate background of functionalist design. Niemeyer's earliest projects seem perfectly situated within the Le Corbusier, Purist line of modernism. The lines and color of the 1930s Costa-Niemeyer collaborations, such as the Ministry of Education and Health (Rio de Janeiro, 1937) and New York World's Fair Brazilian Pavilion , resemble nothing so much as Le Corbusier's work of the late 1920s and 1930s. Niemeyer's first solo commissions, as for example the Grande Hotel Ouro Preto (Minas Gerais, 1941), are likewise marked by the predominance of stark straight lines and flat white surfaces. Indeed, in working with Le Corbusier in the late 

<b></b>

1940s on the initial site plans for the United Nations Headquarters, Niemeyer worked quite comfortably within the limits of the Swiss architect's modular design scales of the time. However, as Niemeyer progressed into the 1950s, he also began to veer noticeably from the International Style. The Pra&#x000E7;a da Liberdade apartment building in Belo Horizonte  appears like a "stack" of cantilevered concrete slabs ringed around an amoeba-shaped tower lacking any sharp corners. (<a href="#1"> 1</a>) The contrast of linear horizontal striation and fluid vertical curvature on the structure's exterior produces a sort of vibrating gestalt when viewed from the street. A similar contrast occurs in the complex of exposition spaces that Niemeyer built for S&#x000E3;o Paulo's Ibirapuera Park. Here, in what amounts to S&#x000E3;o Paulo's Central Park, we find three quadrilateral structures and a dome arrayed in a rectangle relative to one another; yet the four structures are linked by a giant, free-form canopy made of reinforced concrete that covers the pathways connecting the structures. Viewed from the air, the Ibirapuera complex literally looks like an element from a Mir&#x000F3; canvas.
</p>

<p>
In fact, surrealism&#x02014;and certainly not something like "pragmatism" or "utilitarianism"&#x02014;would appear to be the guiding principle in Niemeyer's work after Bras&#x000ED;lia. The headquarters of the French Communist Party in Paris  is essentially a glass-and-concrete quadrilateral akin to any number of urban constructions of the time; yet this one seems to have been warped or melted such that it twists around its site, such that parallel lines on its surface almost appear skewed. Subsequent works in France and Algeria are notable in their almost hallucinatory use of reinforced concrete. The Cultural Center in Le Havre , for example, creates the illusion of being a single, mammoth slab of concrete forming a plaza set just below the level of the landscape around it; out of this plaza two irregularly-shaped "mesas" appear to spout up from the plaza as if pushed upwards from beneath the plaza floor. The plan for the National Mosque in Algiers (1968, not executed) is, in my estimation at least, the strangest of all of Niemeyer's work&#x02014;a flattened tear-drop shaped structure with an ovate opening as its entrance, which would have seemed to hover over a pond surrounding it like a UFO. In designing all of these projects, Niemeyer has behaved more like an abstract sculptor than a functionalist architect. Perhaps in the twenty first century we have already become accustomed to architectural irregularity and wild curvature &#x000E0; la Frank Gehry's Bilbao Guggenheim or the Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. Yet we must remind ourselves that unlike Gehry, Niemeyer had no recourse to AutoCAD for the execution of his drafts, nor any recourse to computer technology to calculate the structural loads of his designs. Most all of Niemeyer's projects have been executed manually, as if by sheer intuition. They are "analogue" structures, not "digital" ones.
</p>

<p>
It is within this trajectory of Niemeyer's oeuvre, then, that I locate Bras&#x000ED;lia as a decisive break with contemporary European design philosophies that dominated the architectural world at the time, even as many of Bras&#x000ED;lia's monuments adhere to the International Style. Niemeyer's Bras&#x000ED;lia, in other words, represents a moment of maximum ambivalence on the part of the architect with respect to his contemporaries both in Brazil and abroad. Bras&#x000ED;lia itself exhibits many of the tendencies of International Style functionalism (e.g., open-use volume, linear geometry, and pure surface).

almost all of these structures are based on core repetitions of quadrilateral volumes (cubes and boxes), such that the roofs of the buildings cut straight horizontally parallel to the ground. (An exception to this rule is the Catedral Metropolitana, based on the re of a cone.) Furthermore, these quadrilaterals are made primarily of glass and reinforced concrete. Glass and concrete surfaces are typically left bare, with little extraneous markings beyond marble facing. Reinforced concrete also serves as a cost-effective material that, particularly when mixed with asbestos, has proven remarkably

durable in tropical climates. Within the buildings, Niemeyer's interiors are also typically "open-use"&#x02014;large volumes not divided by permanent walls, but rather open to any number of semi-permanent variations depending upon the immediate requirements or desires of the buildings' occupants.

Although these aspects indicate certain economical considerations in Niemeyer's designs, however, their economy is not necessarily indicative of industrialization. Architectural functionalism must invariably be viewed as an aesthetic of the first world&#x02014;of industrialized societies with extant capacities for the pre-fabrication of components. We may now be accustomed to a world in which even "underdeveloped" nations are now fully industrialized, but this certainly was not the case in mid-twentieth-century 

<b></b>

Brazil. Indeed it is the very lack of industrialization that we can recognize in the highly poetic effects of Niemeyer's work in Bras&#x000ED;lia.
</p>

<p>
Niemeyer himself has placed lyricism at the center of his general aesthetic principles. In his acceptance speech for the 1988 Pritzker Prize for Architecture, for instance, Niemeyer states:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
First were the thick stone walls, the arches, then the domes and vaults&#x02014;of the architect, searching out for wider spaces.
<p class="blockquote">
Now it is reinforced concrete that gives our imagination flight with its soaring spans and uncommon cantilevers. Concrete, to which architecture is integrated, through which it is able to discard the foregone conclusions of rationalism, with its monotony and repetitious solutions.
<p class="blockquote">
A concern for beauty, a zest for fantasy, and an ever-present element of surprise bear witness that today's architecture is not a minor craft bound to straight-edge rules, but an architecture imbued with technology: light, creative and unfettered, seeking out its architectural scene.
<p class="blockquote">
As Charles Baudelaire once said, "The unexpected, the irregular, the surprise, the amazing are an essential part and characteristic of beauty."
<p class="blockquote">
And this, my friends, is what I have to say about architecture, a practice that has held me fast over the years, to my drawing board, at the beck and call of governments in compliance with the ruling classes, indignant at the misery that weighs upon a world socially unjust, a misery ignored, which our profession is powerless to better.
<p class="blockquote">
It is with regret that I am unable to attend the ceremony, and with great pleasure that I receive the prize with which I have been honored.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Niemeyer here exposes the paradoxes in which he operates. His work relies upon the patronage of the ruling classes to whom he is at "the beck and call," and at the same time he remains attuned to social injustice. Despite his indignation, Niemeyer continued to provide designs for Bras&#x000ED;lia after the military assumed power in 1964, and was commissioned by the very right-wing dictators who were violently repressing political dissent at the time&#x02014;strange for a Marxist-Leninist who in the speech just cited feels compelled to remember the incredible misery that surrounds him. Nevertheless, nowhere in these statements does the architect point to industrialization and modernization as a panacea to his nation's misery. Instead he underscores the importance of lyrical surprise. His buildings have been designed to stun and amaze the occupant or visitor; and to this end reinforced concrete, with its ability to support "uncommon" structure (bold curvatures and cantilevers above all), is the perfect medium with which to disrupt the rational expectations of the beholder. Perhaps most surprising of all, Niemeyer ties surprise to the experience of pure beauty; and indeed, he quotes a nineteenth-century French symbolist poet to justify his own modernist position.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the apparent contradiction of an "aestheticist modernism" fits well in Bras&#x000ED;lia. As the exemplary modernist city in the world, Bras&#x000ED;lia's only purpose for being has always been its symbolism.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The Pilot Plan was never intended to function merely towards the efficient transit between work and residence, or towards the rational zoning of services. In literal terms, Bras&#x000ED;lia is a colossal concrete poem, and as such its 

<b></b>

dominant trope is metaphor. Bras&#x000ED;lia is a giant airplane in the subtropical high plains of Brazil. Bras&#x000ED;lia is the re-centering of the state, and therefore represents the re-ordering of the nation. Bras&#x000ED;lia is, furthermore, the industry of Brazil thrown into high gear in order to achieve velocities unprecedented in Brazil's history. Obviously, the metaphorical sloganeering I have provided here is highly suspect&#x02014;except as an index to the desires of the capital's founders. Yet the metaphors inherent in Bras&#x000ED;lia does allow us to gauge Niemeyer's stance vis-&#x000E0;-vis the International Style: to wit, Niemeyer sets architectural structure in Bras&#x000ED;lia against poetic structure&#x02014;relaying functionalist architecture into the terms of the poetic function as proposed by Roman Jakobson: "The poetic function projects the principle of equivalence from the axis of selection to the axis of continuity."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
When analyzing what Niemeyer has done in Bras&#x000ED;lia, in other words, one needs to pay attention to the ways in which metaphor slips into metonymy, differential similarity into contiguity. The starting-point for this analysis must be Niemeyer's anti-rationalism, marked in his radical use of curvature. To repeat, Niemeyer's constructions often approximate dream-scapes in which discrete elements are distributed in space in a fashion similar to the disposition of objects in surrealist painting. Indeed, in discussing his plans for the Pra&#x000E7;a dos Tr&#x000EA;s Poderes, he has stated:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Yet, when thinking out the forms for those Palaces, I also bore in mind the kind of mood they would impart to the Plaza of the Three Powers. It should not seem, as I saw it, cold and technical, ruled by the classical, hard and already obvious purity of straight lines. On the contrary, I visualized it with a richness of forms, dreams and poetry, like the mysterious paintings by Carzou, new forms, startling visitors by their lightness and creative liberty.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
This is evident particularly in his designs for the Pra&#x000E7;a, in the linear geometry (the "purity of straight lines") of the edifice often interrupted by curvilinear elements "draped" over the main structure&#x02014;elements Niemeyer himself equates with "dreams and poetry." In the case of the Pal&#x000E1;cio do Planalto (the palace of the executive branch), the roof and floor-levels of the palace appear as two horizontal planes of reinforced concrete that extend several meters beyond the sides of the main structure&#x02014;a glass-and-concrete "box." These two planes are, in turn, connected with a series of thin, curved concrete columns (faced with marble) that appear to flow between the upper and lower levels. (see detail, <a href="#6"> 6</a>) In effect, these curving columns of the Pal&#x000E1;cio do Planalto serve dual functions. They are first and foremost load-bearing, serving to hold the entire structure upright. Paradoxically, beyond merely buttressing the structure against the forces of gravity, they have also been given their particular form in order to defy gravity and to create space around the structure's mass. To repeat, the extension of the roof- and floor-planes beyond the area of the "box" creates a portico surrounding the entire palace, the space of which is delimited by thin columns. These columns, however, assume the shape of asymptotic segments of hyperbolas which begin horizontally from points along the lower plane and then "fly" both upwards towards roof-level and downwards to the level of the Pra&#x000E7;a. In this way the columns create the illusion that the entire structure, surrounded as it is by an airy portico, floats just above the grounds of the plaza. It 

<b></b>

seems perched rather delicately upon the few minimal points of its columns&#x02014;columns which are themselves attached to the structure only at a few minimal points of contact. Significantly, these contact points occur at the asymptotes of the hyperbolas&#x02014;that is, precisely at the segment of the re which reaches an infinite limit.

<p>
Such a juxtaposition of quadrilateral and curvilinear res in Bras&#x000ED;lia is not unique to the Pal&#x000E1;cio do Planalto. Niemeyer's Supremo Tribunal Federal (Brazil's Supreme Court which lies directly opposite the Pal&#x000E1;cio do Planalto on the plaza) repeats the use of hyperbolic columns to "float" the building above the ground. The Pal&#x000E1;cio da Alvorada (the president's residence, located just beyond the Plano Piloto) likewise uses hyperbolic columns to support its otherwise quadilateral form. The Congresso Nacional at the entrance of the plaza (perhaps the most famous structure in Bras&#x000ED;lia) consists of the two chambers of Congress (Assembl&#x000E9;ia dos Diputados and Senado) at ground level of the city, separated by two thin rectilinear office towers that rise well above any other structure in the Plano Piloto.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Yet against the rectilinear form of the office building we find that both chamber houses are in fact paraboloid "bowls" &#x02014;one paraboloid that widens downward, and one that bowls upward.
</p>

<p>
Such contrasts/unities of line and curve reach their maximum expression in the Catedral Metropolitana at the entrance of the esplanade leading to the Pra&#x000E7;a dos Tr&#x000EA;s Poderes. The Catedral consists of 16 reinforced concrete columns interspersed with glass. The Catedral has no doors at its entry, merely a ramp under the small mote that rings the structure which leads underground and into the main chapel (the floor of 

<b></b>

which lies below ground-level.) At first glance, the Catedral comes into view as a cone that points to the sky, surrounded by the columns that lend the appearance of hands crossed in prayer, or of a crown of thorns. In point of fact, this "cone" does not exist at all, but is rather an optical illusion suggested by the structure of the building. That is to say, the structure of the Catedral is only the 16 reinforced concrete columns that balance against one another at the top of the structure; these columns do not rest on top of a "cone" of glass underneath, but in fact support the glass itself. And each column, it should now come as no surprise, comes in the form of the asymptote of a hyperbola.
</p>

<p>
How can we account for this obsessive reiteration of hyperboloid and paraboloid res? We are not in the habit of considering the preponderance of quadrilateral volumes in European architecture as obsessive; the use of such forms is pragmatic in the sense that they tend to be stable and thus easy to build with a minimum of structural deficiencies. Thus we might conclude that Niemeyer shuns pragmatism, since he has incorporated curvilinear forms simply because he can. Curvature serves as an expressive element of design that is both functional and anti-functionalist: reinforced concrete does function to support stable structures, yet this is not to say that Niemeyer's use of reinforced concrete to support hyperboloid or paraboloid res serves any function beyond its own being. The true "function" of curvature in Bras&#x000ED;lia's monuments is simple, and therefore, surprising: curves ornament the site, curves are beautiful.
</p>

<p>
Niemeyer's buildings in Bras&#x000ED;lia are, literally, flights of fancy. In the case of the two Pal&#x000E1;cios on the Pra&#x000E7;a dos Tr&#x000EA;s Poderes, the hyperbolic columns have been incorporated only to lend a sense of lightness to the general aesthetic effect of the buildings. Rather than utilizing "heavy" cylindrical columns, both palaces have been designed to appear as floating on a few minimal points above the ground and reaching to infinity.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  These buildings, in turn, form part of a complex of monuments marked by a sense of irregularity. Certain forms repeat from structure to structure, but these forms in one monument are seldom symmetrical with respect to those in another. The arrangement of the monuments on site, moreover, leaves ample space between buildings for the natural landscape around the city to come into view. (<a href="#7"> 7</a>) One is constantly reminded, in other words, that the swirling architectonic forms of the capital have been planted in the tropical horizons of Brazil.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Despite the fundamental distinction between the thoroughly "artificial" environment of Bras&#x000ED;lia and the "natural" environment in which the city has been constructed, both environments must be seen in tandem at any point along the Monumental Axis. Wherever one's line of sight originates, then, the site itself seems to invite what we might call "disruptive continuities." Structures exhibit similar motifs, but not in a pattern that one might deem regular or symmetrical. This asymmetry also appears to play in the relation between the structures and the landscape. As a sign of "modernity," Niemeyer's buildings would seem fundamentally different from the landscape, itself a sign of "primordial" nature. Yet his architecture is not completely differentiated from the landscape: it doesn't block it from view. Rather, the differences between Niemeyer's architecture and Brazilian nature&#x02014;differences we could only call "metaphorical" since they are signs of something else&#x02014;are always poised on the verge of metonymical contiguity as the viewer beholds them together in the same space. Such 

<b></b>

contiguity of differences between metaphor and metonymy&#x02014;"disruptive continuity" between "primordial" tropics and "modern" concrete structure&#x02014;produces a sensation that can be identified as quintessentially Brazilian.

<p>
This kind of poetic production should not be confused with any sort of escape from reality. On the contrary, the lyricism of Niemeyer's constructions arises as a means to cope with the social and economic disequilibria of Brazil. Bras&#x000ED;lia, we should recall, was built for a nation that had not fully "modernized" by the time the capital opened in 1960; at the same time, it is precisely the urge to modernize that produced a city that seemed far more "modern" than any other at the time, either in the third world or the first. Paradoxically, much of the sense of modernity surrounding it stems from Niemeyer's employment of "surreal" curved forms&#x02014;to produce the sense that something "new" had been built unlike anything built before. These curvatures most likely would not have been possible in Europe or the United States. Because Niemeyer operated in a semi-industrialized context, he could not be confined to the rigidity of regular pre-fabricated components. On the contrary, the most cost-effective building materials at his disposal were those that could be assembled on-site&#x02014;concrete poured over steel frames,<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  precisely the technique which allows maximum flexibility for experimentation with curvature. The architect's use of unconventional forms in Bras&#x000ED;lia thus stands as a direct index to the nation's level of industrialization at mid-twentieth century. Since many parts and components could not be pre-fabricated, Niemeyer was forced to improvise, which in turn promoted an architecture of improvisation.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  In short, Niemeyer's work of the period could not have been functionalist per se, since it was situated in the context of a political economy of underdevelopment: a modern "third world" economy that does not itself "function properly."
</p>

<p>
Niemeyer's work is intended for those who actually live in this precise economic predicament of semi-industrialization, for those who strive to function in a decidedly "dysfunctional" situation. The exemplary case of this may be found in the middle of the Pra&#x000E7;a dos Tr&#x000EA;s Poderes, between the Pal&#x000E1;cio do Planalto and the Supremo Tribunal Federal, the very center of state power in Brazil. Here we find a rather strange columnar "statue" (for lack of a better term) known as the "Pombal." (<a href="#8"> 8</a>) The Pombal 

<b></b>

consists of two conjoined slabs of exposed concrete that stand some 10 meters high and a meter or two wide. The two slabs connect to one another at four symmetrically distributed points to create oblong ovate openings up the sides of the structure; these openings in turn give way to open space running up the core of the entire statue. Each slab tapers diagonally towards the exterior side of the structure at both the top and at the bottom, such that the Pombal appears as a kind of gigantic clothespin delicately balanced upside down upon the grounds of the Pra&#x000E7;a. Most importantly, the interior of either slab has been "lined" with rows of thin horizontal shelves&#x02014;in actuality, concrete shelves that are integral to the slabs themselves. These shelves are the perfect size to give the hundreds of birds that live in the Pra&#x000E7;a a place to roost.

<p>
Indeed, the Pombal has been designed precisely for this reason, as a dovecote for the pigeons (<i>os pombos</i>) that give the structure its name. Niemeyer's dovecote, however, bears no resemblance to the cottage-like structures of rural Scotland which one would typically associate with a "dovecote." The Pombal by comparison appears more of an abstract sculpture than a quaint, rustic home. In this sense, the most prescient feature of the Pombal is its economy. Without paint or color, and with a reduced number of elements, the Pombal serves its function with minimal distraction: its inhabitants are left just enough space to enter the structure, and just enough "open-use" space integrated into the structure to use as they please. As a home for wayward pigeons, then, 

<b></b>

the Pombal responds to the first world dictum that "form follows function" with a kind of post-colonial response: "<i>Obede&#x000E7;o, mas n&#x000E3;o cumpro</i>" ("I obey but I do not comply"), the motto of colonial subjects in the Americas who received imperial orders yet refused to abide by them. The form of the Pombal, in other words, adheres quite forcefully to the formal restrictions of functionalist modernism, it is merely that the function itself is superfluous. As a result, the spectator is left with certain residual structural effects beyond the structure's own inherent functionality: whimsy, humor, brief moments of respite from the austerity of the concrete, an accidental surprise in encountering the object that may in turn lead to a momentary suspension of other preoccupations.
</p>

<p>
The spectator may be stunned, moreover, by the architect's audacity in placing such a structure as the Pombal in such an important place. Seemingly balanced on its end, the structure itself balances great significance with utter insignificance. The Pombal, placed at the heart of human power in Brazil, provides a home for the lowliest of creatures, the <i>pombos</i> of the Pra&#x000E7;a. But can we not also hear the name "Pombal" and not also think immediately of the Marqu&#x000EA;s de Pombal?<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  And so, what is the relation between enlightened dictatorial Bourbon regents of eighteenth-century Portugal, and pigeons and clothespins in twentieth-century Brazil?
</p>

<p>
In name, the connection between the Pombal and the Marqu&#x000EA;s de Pombal may be entirely accidental. If so, the accident would only accentuate its force. The goal of functionalism from its outset was to eliminate accidents altogether: not only would the surface of the architectural mass be cleansed of ornamentation ("accidental" accents), the "new" architecture would also promote social order and rationalism in order to mitigate political and military revolution (and other such social "accidents," or collisions.) By its very form, Pombal (the dovecote, not the dictator) works with great efficiency, yet the real work performed by the Pombal is symbolic or rhetorical. The shape of the structure bears metaphorical similarity to a tool (the clothespin) utilized in the basic forms of labor by which many Brazilians attempt to survive: manual service labor, or rather domestic manual labor (laundry) usually coded as "feminine." (At the very least, laundry has been assigned to women in Brazil from its colonial period up to the present.) We can imagine, then, senators and presidents and justices looking onto the Pra&#x000E7;a and being forced to confront a symbol of the nation's poverty. If the Pombal serves to "air Brazil's dirty laundry," it also does this by means of another trope. That is, the metaphorical presence of the structure just as quickly establishes metonymic contiguities to one of the main achievements of Pombal (the dictator, not the dovecote): the reconstruction of Lisbon after the earthquake of 1755 which left the Portuguese capital in rubble. The result was the construction of a "new" Lisbon built according to the "rational" lines of the late Enlightenment. In its name, then, the Pombal establishes a historical contiguity between the re-construction of the colonizer's capital (Lisbon) and the re-placement (re-positioning) of the post-colonial capital (Bras&#x000ED;lia) two centuries later. The symbolism of the dovecote may not function in terms of similar differences so much as it functions in terms of historical connections of the body-politic over time. The Pombal may thus lead us to reflect on a certain irony between colonizer and colonized: between the powerful despot of the nation that colonized Brazil (Pombal) and the common pigeons that now colonize Bras&#x000ED;lia (in the Pombal).

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Bras&#x000ED;lia clearly functions not only to house political and economic power, but it also serves to materialize this power in a particular conration. This is unquestionably the function for which the city was commissioned, and for which Niemeyer made his designs. Yet the architect has just as clearly superceded Bras&#x000ED;lia's purely functionalist concerns. "Excessive" or "superfluous" elements of his structures serve purely aesthetic aims: to surprise, to give delight. In turn, these delightful elements, wholly integrated into the overall design, may draw symbolic contiguities with the history of the nation. And most significantly, beyond metaphors or even metonymies of national triumph, the superfluous accidents in Niemeyer's designs lead directly to ironic displacement&#x02014;ironic moments in which the ideology of the place itself may be recognized&#x02014;and critiqued.
</p>

<p>
It makes sense here to return to the moment of breakdown with which I began. The use of plate glass in modernist architectural constructions, the use of a transparent, industrially manufactured material that is integrated into the structure rather than merely adorning it, speaks to notions of aesthetic "cleanliness" and "progress" that have dominated over the past century's modernism. Shattering of the plate glass of the Congresso Nacional can therefore be read as a moment of rupture with respect to both the aesthetics of the building as well as the power that operates within it. The temptation would be strong, I think, to read this act of popular protest as a moment of postmodern fragmentation, signaling a definitive end to "elite" forms of modernism.
</p>

<p>
Bras&#x000ED;lia is often viewed, moreover, as a colossal failure of modernist and functionalist aesthetics. Earlier I mentioned Niemeyer's connection to surrealism, and indeed when walking through Bras&#x000ED;lia one may feel as if inhabiting a Mir&#x000F3; canvas. Yet a more accurate point of reference for the experience might be one that is more plastic than concrete: Tomorrowland at Disney World. That is, Niemeyer's Bras&#x000ED;lia has largely been conserved to this day as a nostalgic futurism, a bygone vision of the future from 50 years ago. And this vision remains incomplete: construction has not yet been completed along the residential Wings of the Pilot Plan; the metro was never built, and it is doubtful that it ever will; it is impossible to circulate around the city without a car, and the city's rigid zoning (built into the Pilot Plan) makes it difficult to access essential services by foot. In essence, Bras&#x000ED;lia has never been allowed to grow properly. Civic leaders remain intent upon maintaining the original Pilot Plan, like a kind of museum piece hung on the terrain, even though Bras&#x000ED;lia has grown far larger than the population capacity for which it was originally conceived. These same leaders are nonetheless content to regulate poorly all the spaces outside the Pilot Plan, in the Distrito Federal. Developers have been given free-reign to build architecturally ghastly suburban sprawl. And where developers haven't built, the land has been occupied by the dreadful <i>favela</i>.
</p>

<p>
Bras&#x000ED;lia may be a failure, but it is too easy to dismiss it as a dead relic. If people continue to move to Bras&#x000ED;lia as they do, it stands to reason that they have some purpose for doing so. That is to say, Bras&#x000ED;lia is not a dead city even in the slightest sense, but is rather a place where important potentially world-changing events are taking place every day. Along with China and India, Brazil has emerged over the past decade as a major global economic power. It has recently overtaken the United States as the largest

<b></b>

agricultural producer in the world; it is one of the largest steel producers on the planet, and one of the world's top ten heavy industrial manufacturers. There are also strong indications that Brazil is poised to become a nuclear power in the near future. Modernization for Brazil is not a pass&#x000E9; free-market Chicago School theory doled out by the IMF and IADB in the 1950s; quite the opposite, modernization is only now reaching its full force there. Significantly, the center for concrete policy decisions regarding the nation's continued modernization remains inside the modernist reinforced concrete of Niemeyer's architecture.
</p>

<p>
I do not at all mean to imply that these "developments" have erased the gross iniquities in Brazilian society. The country remains a zone of horrifying contrasts. Bras&#x000ED;lia's elite tend to fly first-class every weekend on Brazilian-made jets, fleeing the rather boring capital for Rio or S&#x000E3;o Paulo or other cities, yet their ennui cannot hide the truth. Brazil is one of the richest countries in the world, but suffers one of the worst distributions of wealth in the world as well. The minimum wage in Brazil is currently about US$ 80 per month, with an estimated 40 million people (or one-quarter of the total population) earning less than US$ 40 per month. An estimated 23 million Brazilians live in "extreme poverty," meaning they lack money to feed themselves properly.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Illiteracy rates remain high, and malnutrition is epidemic. The protesting bureaucrats that I began with thus represent the middle socioeconomic sector of society, but the pension benefits for which they were ting could only be called "exorbitant" with respect to the pittance that any one of them would most likely receive over a lifetime. Most of them were therefore ting for their livelihood. I cannot emphasize enough here that the Brazilian experience of modernity is thoroughly ambivalent&#x02014;ambivalent on the verge of schizophrenia. In this sense, I have attempted to display Niemeyer's work as a kind of concrete hallucination, which when read as a form of literature might open meaningful ideological possibilities for those who come in contact with it. Bras&#x000ED;lia remains, after all, a site of violent contestation&#x02014;violence played out against the city's architecture.
</p>

<p>
Brazilian modernism exists because of modernization, and in turn modernism has come to promote modernization, and even house modernization. We might well say that Brazilian modernism and modernization are functions of one another. Yet to say this alone would be insufficient, since Niemeyer has encoded a typically Brazilian ambivalence into his constructions. Niemeyer's modernism, in this sense, is not the mute servant or foot soldier of modernization, but can in fact serve as a site of resistance, as a dysfunction of modernity. Given the increasing strength of globalization, our main problem is not that Bras&#x000ED;lia merely exists as a concrete failure of modernity. Our main problem is rather how to find ways to read the concrete that continues to exist there in relation to continual processes of modernization. Globalization, in other words, compels us to think concretely in terms of the persistence of modernism, the very world which we inhabit.

Brazil, like other Latin American nations, has historically been dominated by strong regional powers ruled by landed oligarchs. It was not until the early- to mid-twentieth century, however, that broad-based, often technocratic federal governments would emerge (such as began under Get&#x000FA;lio Vargas in Brazil) that could be capable of asserting dominance over regional interests.
</p>

<p class="noIndent">
<a name="FOOT5" href="#REF5">5</a>.
I cannot fail to note, however, that the construction of Bras&#x000ED;lia under Kubitschek eventually bankrupted the federal government, causing Brazil to default on its debts to international development banks in the early 1960s. The ensuing political and economic crisis would lead directly to the military coup d'&#x000E9;tat of 1964 and a series of repressive, authoritarian military regimes that maintained power until 1985.

While literary modernism seems to have reached definitive closure some four or five decades ago, architectural modernism is still the dominant aesthetic mode, as the recent high-end monumental works of Richard Meier and Santiago Calatrava attest. Moreover, it remains doubtful as to whether we can even speak of a singular literary modernism: to what extent is an Anglo-American modernist like Ezra Pound relevant to a subsequent Brazilian modernist like Jo&#x000E3;o Cabral de Melo Neto, or indeed previous nineteenth-century Spanish-American aesthetes like Rub&#x000E9;n Dar&#x000ED;o?

"Functionalism" as a concept may in fact be a Brazilian invention, having first been utilized (among modernists at least) by Costa in his "Manifesto of Functional Architecture" published in 1925&#x02014;several years before the work usually cited as the concept's launch-point, Alberto Sartoris's <i>Gli elementi dell'architettura funzionale</i>. Cf. Stamo Papadaki. <i>Oscar Niemeyer</i> (New York: George Braziller, Inc., 1960), 10. In any event, it is important to clarify that architectural functionalism is <i>not</i> equivalent to other sorts of functionalism in use at roughly the same time in other fields. Although we may be able to draw relations to philosophical functionalism and sociological/anthropological structural-functionalism, "functionalism" as it is employed in the present study should be understood as specific to architecture.

As David Underwood has commented: "The [Pilot Plan]&#x02014;two axes intersecting to form a cross&#x02014;directly and monumentally asserts a territorial acquisition that reflects the Renaissance ideals of the Iberian conquistadores. Costa described it as "a deliberate act of conquest, a gesture of pioneers acting in the spirit of their colonial traditions." The plan conflated colonial symbolism with Catholic imagery and established a baroque hierarchy of primary and secondary axes that intersect at 

<b></b>

the modern traffic interchange of a multilane highway. Costa's plan thus recasts traditional elements in modern terms. Whether one sees a bird or an airplane, Costa's "pilot" plan conveys an unmistakable image of flight wholly appropriate to Kubitschek's emphasis on modern speed, as well as his promotion of Brazil's fledgling aviation and automotive industries."

As Niemeyer has commented: "[F]orms that would seem not to rest heavily on the ground as required by technical reason but make the Palaces look airy, floating light and white in the endless nights of the Brazilian highland; surprising and breathtaking forms that would lift the visitor, if only for a little while, above the hard and sometimes insuperable problems which life puts into everyone's path."

Such an urban arrangement might be compared to that of New York City or S&#x000E3;o Paulo, cities in which the natural landscape has been leveled and highly compacted skyscrapers often block the horizon (or form their own horizon). In contrast, although Bras&#x000ED;lia has a high population density&#x02014;housing well over a million inhabitants in a fairly small space&#x02014;one always has visual access to the terrain in which the city is set, due in large part to Niemeyer's site plans. A key distinction between Bras&#x000ED;lia and these other cities, however, is that the "natural" landscape around the Pilot Plan is man-made, replete with artificial lakes and forested green spaces.

"The technology already existed in Brazil, however, for the development of the new architecture: reinforced concrete frames had been used since the 1910s for large-scale constructions. The first tall buildings in Rio de Janeiro and S&#x000E3;o Paulo, at the turn of the century, had been built with steel frames, along with bridges and similar structures. Steel proved to be an expensive system in Brazil, however. There were no rolling facilities for structural steel members in Brazil; these, and the technical supervision of the construction, had to be imported from the United States. Although Brazil did not initially produce cement or reinforcing rods, reinforced concrete had the advantages of being prepared on site and of not requiring specialized labour, which greatly reduced cost."

Our [i.e. Brazilian] modern architecture reflects the social contradictions in which we live and in which it has developed. Presented to clients not interested in problems of a general building economy and to a governmental body that shies from plans of national dimensions and from large scale construction projects, our architecture is forced to make improvisation its basic element . . . Some of these buildings are often appreciated from a design point of view but they always reflect the social disequilibrium of the country with a majority of its citizens living in the most miserable quarters. The great variety of forms that is seen in our architecture stems from the lack of an effective social and economic basis. The absence of a large building industry with prefabricated assemblies and parts further encourages the development of a wealth of individualistic architectural forms and solutions.

Upon returning home from World War I, Oskar Kokoschka found that his lover, Alma Mahler, had married another man. In response, he commissioned the creation of a life-size doll to match Mahler's exact proportions. Kokoschka provoked rumor and scandal as he escorted his doll to the opera, held parties in its honor, and hired a maid to dress and service it. This provocative public performance inspired rampant speculation about what else, exactly, Kokoschka did with the doll. The doll met its "unnatural" demise when one of Kokoschka's parties got out of hand. Police questioned Kokoschka in the morning about a murder; a beheaded and bloody body was reportedly seen outside his home. Evidently it was the naked, wine-splattered doll, which had somehow lost its head during the revelries of the previous evening. This was the story that Kokoschka and his critics, both then and now, loved to tell, embellishing racy details, speaking to fetishism, sex dolls, pranks, and occasional misogyny.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  While titillating, Kokoschka's tumultuous relationship with Mahler and his spectacle with the doll mean little for scholars of modernism unless we can connect them to Kokoschka's project as an artist. Indeed, much less discussed than the doll episode are 

<b></b>

the three "portraits" Kokoschka painted of the doll, and their connection to it. The first, <i>Woman in Blue</i>, 1919, is still considered Kokoschka's masterpiece of this period, though it is seldom analyzed in detail; and the two latter, <i>Painter with Doll</i>, 1920&#x02013;21, and <i>At the Easel</i>, 1922, are among Kokoschka's numerous self-portraits, and rarely noted by critics.
</p>

<p>
My premise in this paper is that the doll itself must be considered an artistic project that enhances the significance of Kokoschka's doll paintings and illuminates our understanding of Kokoschka as a modernist artist. In the process it challenges the boundaries between art and life. To consider the doll as an artistic project, both as material art and as a kind of performance art, makes Kokoschka's biography significant&#x02014;not only because he linked it publicly to his doll project, but also because biography was an integral aspect of the modernist agenda of bridging art and life&#x02014;exemplified in the works of such artists as Giorgio de Chirico, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf. Certainly this process reveals Kokoschka's nostalgia for the traditional masculine artist-genius, embodied in the re of Pygmalion. But what I find most fascinating about the subject is the women who inspire and create Kokoschka's infamous doll, especially Alma Mahler and Hermine Moos, who complicate Kokoschka's efforts to reinvent himself as the modernist masculine artist-genius. This paper concerns the mostly unspoken and unrecoverable influence of these women on Kokoschka's art and suggests the importance of gender and procreation in the art/life tensions of modernism. I speculate that the influence of these women is most evident not in Kokoschka's autobiographical writings and published letters, which generally conform to stereotypically masculine traditions, but instead in the three paintings Kokoschka creates of the doll and himself. These works betray a more subtle discomfort with the traditional masculine persona of Pygmalion as Kokoschka increasingly portrays <i>himself</i> as doll-like. They reveal that Kokoschka came to find himself a feminized object, even as his artistic gaze often disempowered and objectified the women who inspired him.

The paintings and the doll have garnered more tabloid interest than critical interest over the years. Perhaps this is because the earliest sources to document this event in Kokoschka's life dismissed the incident as temporary insanity: "If the story of the doll became the most notorious of the antics of the 'mad Kokoschka,'" Edith Hoffman wrote in 1947, "it was not the only one. [Kokoschka] was, in fact, incapable at this period of reacting rationally to anything."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Indeed, earlier sources took the "mad Kokoschka" at his word. As J. P. Hodin comments in 1966,
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
[Kokoschka] succeeded in breaking loose in an altogether uncanny way, and this chapter of his life is to some extent pathological. Unnerved by his personal experiences, and by the war, he came very close to insanity. [ . . . ] In his determination that [Alma] should have no further part in his life, that no woman should ever hold him in bondage, and from the desire to rid himself for ever of her image, he substituted a fetish for reality.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
If later critics were less confident about dismissing Kokoschka's behavior as aberrant, this did not make his doll portraits any more viable. Giuseppe Gatt writes that Kokoschka's post-World War I work was "less visionary, his symbolism was weaker" than in his pre-war

<b></b>

works, in part because the artist became more nostalgic; "he meditated on the masters of the past" and was even "evolving towards rather impressionistic ideas."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Richard Calvocoressi suggests that "not until the Second World War would Kokoschka be roused to produce works of equal emotional intensity" to those of his pre-World War I period.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  In short, within the art historical contexts in which it is discussed, the notorious doll incident has often been written off as a post-war episode of shock-induced insanity on Kokoschka's part, or, more recently, an artistic misstep.
</p>

<p>
Yet there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that Kokoschka understood this doll as part of a formal artistic project intimately tied to (auto)biography and his other modernist works. At the same time that he was working on the doll, Kokoschka was writing his play, <i>Orpheus and Eurydice</i>, based on the Ovidian story relating Orpheus's failed attempt to bring his dead lover to life through art. For Orpheus, this event inspires his envious narration of the great sculptor Pygmalion, who&#x02014;through genius or madness&#x02014;is more successful in bringing his "dead" art to life. Variations on these stories of male artistic genius abound in visual and literary art of the moment throughout Europe. And both stories resonate with Kokoschka's efforts to bring his own doll to life. In this sense, his work on the doll was consistent with other avant-garde artists of the moment, and his own work to date.
</p>

<p>
As part of this project, Kokoschka commissioned avant-garde dollmaker Hermine Moos<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  to create the doll for him, in collaboration with him. He sent Moos his own (often abstracted) paintings, drawings, and instructions to which he asked her to respond in creating the doll; he thus served as the doll's designer. Later, he would formally publish his half of the letters of their correspondence regarding the doll's creation. Once he received the doll, he hired servants to spread rumors about the doll to other artists and the general public, more evidence that the rumors were part of the project, rather than delusion. Directly following the doll incident, the "mad Kokoschka"&#x02014;who was "incapable at this period of reacting rationally to anything"&#x02014;was offered a professorship at the Dresden Academy of Art, a fact which suggests that Kokoschka's "madness" was recognized even at that time as part of an artistic agenda, rather than a debility. Given this evidence, and the widely accepted definition of modernism as challenging the limits between art and life, we might give a bit more attention to the artistic value of Kokoschka's bizarre efforts to play Pygmalion.
</p>

<p>
Critics have long suspected that a combination of war and relationship trauma inspired Kokoschka's artistic work, but his use of the doll has remained a mystery. In a 1993 dissertation, Lisa Street maintains that Kokoschka's interest in dolls was related to an interest in puppetry, common among the avant-garde artists, especially the Dadaists, with whom Kokoschka was acquainted.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Another possibility, however (and one related to what Street and others have identified as Kokoschka's contempt for modern man's materialism and corresponding "spiritual bankruptcy" ), is the rise and mass production of dolls in the form of the life-sized mannequin throughout European cosmopolitan centers.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Before World War I, mannequins were available, but their physical makeup (and sheer tonnage, at over 200 pounds each) prevented their broad distribution. But by the end of World War I and into the 1920s when Kokoschka's 

<b></b>

own doll was first created, new mannequins weighing a hollow forty pounds each were seen everywhere. (<a href="#1"> 1</a>) They testified to the artistic, life-giving genius of the new commercially inspired artist, the window dresser.
</p>

<p>
Certainly the history of the mannequin is notable for its attempted vivification of the inanimate object. But the opposite was also true. Because mannequins of this period were based upon human models, the human form was perfectly reproduced in mass form, along with the human name once attached to the "original." Kokoschka was not the only artist basing his doll upon an actual person. Indeed, the vivification of the mannequin seems to go hand in hand with a dehumanization of the human re&#x02014;as if part of the real "Marjolane" and "C&#x000E9;lim&#x000E8;ne" remained attached to the oversized doll that shared their physical features.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Meanwhile, real people became mere "buying machines," as Rita Felski suggests.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Within the historic development of mannequins, together with traditional objectification that conspired to ornament women and view women as ornament, women were encouraged to aspire to the graces of their mindless window-dressed doubles. With the simultaneous rise in potential for female artistry, many women artists of the 1920s worked to subvert this tendency, often by revising the Pygmalion myth to envisage female artistry or to create a subjectivity for the feminized art object. In so doing, they undermined the great Romantic male genius in favor of alternate paradigms.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The mannequin was a pivotal re in these gendered reconrations. For it was women, not men, who were reflected in this modern variation on the statue: quite simply, male mannequins did not sell products.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Hillel Schwartz speculates that the male mannequin may have been linked to images of a war that people were anxious to forget. Especially during wartime, men practiced combat or inquisition tactics on these same life-like dummies, designed as objects of mutilation and destruction in preparation for battle or as decoys in trench warfare . In fact, the primary purpose of regulating garment sizes was to provide clothing for an entire army at once. As C. de Dunin, maker of the still headless, male mannequin "Apollo" on display at the Crystal Palace recognized, "Blessed with several Apollos . . . you could fit uniforms to an army of several hundred thousand men" (qtd. in Schwartz, 111). In a sense, the Apollo meant to clothiers what the assembly-line process meant to Ford automakers, offering identical replicas and interchangeable parts.
</p>

<p>
In Schwartz's account, men avoided male mannequins because they did not want to be identified with the "immobilized and impotent" . But perhaps mannequins discomfited men because, in their post-war lives, they identified with these res to uncanny extremes, sometimes even requiring prosthetic additions to their own amputated limbs. Mannequins, with their removable body parts, seemed all too real, as Schwartz remarks: "[M]utilated bodies . . . were more underfoot than ever, as a result of railway accidents, injuries at large factories, and the casualties of modern warfare&#x02014;shell fragments from land mines and ricochet bullets from repeating rifles and machine guns" . Nowhere was this insecurity more palpable than in post-war Weimar Germany, site of the ideologically defeated and psychically emasculated. Men returned from World War I as shells of their former selves: wooden, hollow, mutilated 

<b></b>

and stony, unable or unwilling to delve into their traumatic experiences of the war. In this sense, men, especially veterans, unwillingly identified with the mannequins they saw around them that symbolized a loss of individuality, linked with weakness and passivity. Mannequins suggested an objectification and feminization. Returning from the war less whole than they had set off, men did not identify with storefront mannequins, or if they did, they were unwilling to pay for the experience.

Kokoschka returned from the war well positioned to speak of art, war and gender. Prior to World War I, Kokoschka had been recognized for his importance as a Viennese Expressionist, though his work differed particularly with his emphasis on portraiture from the two major Expressionist groups, <i>die Br&#x000FC;cke</i> and <i>Blaue Reiter</i>. He met Alma Mahler, widowed after the death of Gustav Mahler, in 1912, and first asked her to marry him within 24 hours of their initial meeting.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Though Alma Mahler refused to marry him, they engaged in a passionate affair, inspiring some of Kokoschka's best-known works. Critics almost immediately associated her with the high point of Kokoschka's career; no one believed this more fully than Kokoschka's himself.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  But in 1914, as the war began, Kokoschka's tumultuous relationship with his lover and muse ended, their difficulties exacerbated by her abortion of their child that same year.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  As Kokoschka later put it, "[S]urely scandal and the advice of friends had been no more than contributory factors in the decision Alma now took, and which I never forgave. She went into a clinic in Vienna and had the child, my child, taken from her. And so, 

<b></b>

for me, our affair had already ended even before the war" (<i>My Life</i> 77). Kokoschka volunteered in the Austrian cavalry in 1914 and entered a Vienna hospital in 1915 to recover from a head injury and a bayonet wound in the lung, received on the front of Galicia. While recuperating, he learned that Mahler had remarried and soon returned to the Italian front at Isonzo. By 1917, after treatment from shellshock in Dresden, Kokoschka went to Stockholm for further recovery, where he acquainted himself with the Z&#x000FC;rich Dadaists. While healing in Sweden, Kokoschka gained perspective on his wartime experiences. As he would later comment in <i>My Life</i>, "the newsreels [in Stockholm] . . . showed not idealized heroics but authentic shots of the battlefields. Audiences shuddered uncomfortably and congratulated themselves on their own neutrality."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  As with so many artists with first-hand experience of the bloodshed, the impact of the physical and psychic injuries Kokoschka sustained during World War I had a tremendous effect on his work.
</p>

<p>
The chance timing of these events may explain why, directly after the end of the war in 1918, Kokoshka devised the notorious scheme that he claimed would come resolved his dual anguish over the war and his failed love affair with Mahler. Kokoschka commissioned Hermine Moos, an avant-garde doll-maker whose exhibitions he attended in Dresden, and who had served as a one-time dressmaker for his beloved,<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  to create a life-size doll of Alma Mahler. (. <a href="#2">2</a> and <a href="#3">3</a>) Moos's place as an exhibiting artist of the moment suggests that if Kokoschka saw the doll as a ritual target for his sexual and psychical frustrations, as critics have argued, he was also earnestly invested in it as an artistic object in its own right. <sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Calling the doll his lover and "fetish," using detailed sketches, diagrams, anatomical drawings and poetic similes, Kokoschka directed the construction of the doll via letter for the telling duration of nine months.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  On important points, Kokoschka was quite direct about his desires for the doll:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Although I feel ashamed I must still write this, but it remains our secret (and you are my confidante): the <i>parties honteuses</i> must be made perfect and luxuriant and covered with hair, otherwise it is not to be a woman but a monster.

</div>

<p class="noIndent">
Eventually identifying himself as "Pygmalion," Kokoschka oversaw the production of the doll, but refused to participate in its assemblage or touch any part used for it; instead he insisted that Moos's feminine sexual and procreative powers were essential to the doll's vivification.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
An element of Kokoschka's involvement with Moos indicates the respect he had for Moos and, by extension, the role that women artists were increasingly playing within the modernist avant-garde, as both consumers and creators of art. But the gender roles implied by Kokoschka's letters to Moos in the construction of his doll constantly change; this complexity is part of the doll's scholarly significance. Kokoschka initially mystifies the power dynamics between himself and Moos in serving as both her patron and employer, insisting on her service as both female artist/creator and petty laborer. In becoming a consumer of her work, Kokoschka constructs his own feminized consumer identity&#x02014;he shops for a product he desires. The desired object is a doll, usually sexless,

<b></b>

but in this case it is designed to replace a living woman. Thus, Moos's position as artist or even craftswoman is morphed into that of a madam. In this sense, Kokoschka reduces Moos's artistic talent to her feminine procreative powers, which are paid for: she not only sells a doll she has sexed into a "woman," but sells herself&#x02014;an intricate linking of motherly creation and the female artist with "public" commerce and prostitution. This idea is reinforced in Kokoschka's letters, in which he requests that Moos, in order to enhance the realism of her work, touch and feel herself:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

If the drawing is not quite clear as to the position of a muscle, to a tendon or a bone, it is better not to consult a book of anatomy, but rather to examine the place on your own body, which you must move with your hand until you have the feeling of it warmly and distinctly.

<p class="noIndent">
The eroticism inherent in Kokoschka's directions testify to his attempt to link female artistic creativity with female sexuality. Kokoschka metaphorically controls Moos by making her at once pimp and whore, a projection of a punishment for both the lover who had spurned him and, arguably, the female artist who threatens his masculine genius.

Even so, Kokoschka does not always maintain this masculine control. His reenactment of a nine month incubation/creation period suggests a sort of womb-envy, a parthenogenesis, as though Kokoschka aspires to usurp women's traditional role, to create life. And through Moos, he works not only to replace the lover he still wanted, but also to reclaim the child he lost when Alma Mahler aborted their baby. In some sense, Moos plays a stereotypical masculine role, merely providing the hull of the doll, and then is expected to have nothing more to do with it. It is left to Kokoschka to 

<b></b>

"care for" and "nurture" their creation. But any sense of Kokoschka as a grown man playing with dolls, wishing for a simpler, "primitive" world, is subverted as well. The hint of his sexual play with Moos's creation reminds us that if deliberately mischievous, Kokoschka's play is also stereotypically masculine and liminally violent: it suggests the sexual violation of an unwilling woman through the medium of an object that cannot refuse his bidding; it suggests Pygmalion's statue. Most importantly, Kokoschka supplies the inspiration, the genius for his project. Moos, whose responses to Kokoschka's letters, unfortunately, were not preserved, is almost incidental to his sense of the work. This power dynamic with Moos allows Kokoschka to reenact several of his problems with Mahler.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Whether or not successful as "art," Kokoschka's doll is a conduit for controlling, venting anger upon and humiliating his once-lover.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  His staging of the death of the doll suggests a violent working through of these issues.

<p>
Kokoschka's least controlled aspect of the final product was the doll's outer layer. He insisted on such details as padded thighs, the tactile illusion of muscle and bone, and an overall covering for which he recommended the use of silk or the finest linen.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Critics agree, as Keegan puts it, that "no artisan on earth would have been capable of bringing Kokoschka's fantasy to suitably lifelike form" (<i>Eye</i> 115). Instead of taking his recommendations, Moos chose to use swanskin, the feathers of which detracted from any naturalism that the doll might have possessed at earlier stages. As his final letter to Moos makes clear, this soft, feathery outer covering was for Kokoschka a bitter disappointment:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
What shall we do now, your doll . . . has quite taken me aback. I was prepared to make allowances to subtract from my fancy in favour of reality; but in too many ways she belies what I demanded of her and expected of you. The outer shell is a polar-bear pelt, suitable for a shaggy imitation bedside rug rather than the soft and pliable skin of a woman. [ . . . ] The result is that I cannot even dress the doll, which you knew was my intention, let alone array her in delicate and precious robes. Even attempting to pull on one stocking would be like asking a French dancing-master to waltz with a polar bear.

Kokoschka would come to insist that he had erred in allowing a woman to use her own imagination in his creation, thus reasserting once more his own masculine creative primacy. He also inadvertently reenacts the conventional masculine response to the Kristevan "abject" of the "birthing" process. What Kokoschka got was, if his letter is to be believed, not what he had anticipated. It is particularly unclear why Moos so deviated from Kokoschka's recommendations for the skin. In an attempt to exonerate Moos, Street speculates that Kokoschka's insistence that the doll be made entirely of hand-made materials, many of which were scarce or unreliable in a time of war rations, made this outer layer particularly difficult.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Lack of critical commentary on the doll often implicitly condemns Moos's effort. Street herself is uncharacteristically critical, commenting that "we too [as spectators] are shocked that Moos made such a horrible mess of the project when she was already skilled in doll-making and was given such detailed instructions" . But as Kokoschka lists the faults he finds with the doll in his last letter to Moos, some of his difficulties are striking: he cannot dress the doll; he cannot array her; his imaginative mastery is insulted. It becomes, to my mind, uncertain which of these defects resulted from Moos's failed attempts to accommodate him, and which of his demands Moos ignored or deliberately thwarted. In thinking about the specific difficulties Moos creates for Kokoschka, I am tempted to find the doll a worthy artistic object in part because of its skin. Had he wanted naturalism, Kokoschka might have had it in the form of a mannequin or some more direct facsimile. But instead, he hired an avant-garde dollmaker, an exhibiting artist in her own right. To my mind, this fact means that neither Kokoschka then nor we now should necessarily judge the work Moos produced on the basis of its adherence to naturalism.
</p>

<p>
As representations of women went, Moos's doll is consistent not with mannequins, but with avant-garde dolls. In thinking of Moos's work in this way, her doll is compatible 

<b></b>

with the work of her colleagues like Pritzel, Erna Muth, Relly Mailander or Hannah H&#x000F6;ch, whose dolls also deconstructed conventions of human anatomy and beauty. Indeed, the resulting doll defies Kokoschka's fetishizing, objectifying conventions that liken, for example, woman's skin to silk, through a witty exaggeration of Kokoschka's demands that the skin be soft. Moreover, Moos's enhancement of the feathery outer layer makes the doll even more precisely a "fetish" object, in line with imported (or stolen) artifacts and "primitive" art, even as she undermines Kokoschka's intended use of the doll as (gendered) "fetish" object. <sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  In this sense, Moos appropriately responds to Kokoschka's own avant-garde drawings and illustrations with her avant-garde artistry. Her use of swanskin for the doll's outer covering, repeats the kinds of artistic canvases that Kokoschka himself used for a series of fans he sent to Alma Mahler.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  That Moos leaves the feathers in place, just as Kokoschka worked with untanned goat skin, suggests an emphasis on the origins of the skin, back to the swan from which it came. In linking the doll/woman and the swan, Moos evokes the myth of Leda: she might justifiably have seen that Kokoschka's relationship with Alma-as-doll is less comparable to the revivification of the dead lover than it is to the violence of rape&#x02014;a justifiable assessment as well of Pygmalion's actions upon his modestly immobile statue. Confronted with the objectifying gaze of a great male artist, Moos returns with a feminist critique on multiple levels. As such, the doll demands a revision of the events as Kokoschka describes them. His proposal for a doll for his personal use, having been rebuffed by at least one other (possibly appalled) female artist, was taken on by Moos. If Kokoschka did not think the doll looked like the lover he had described, if he was incapable of dressing the doll up in the pretty lingerie he had bought for it, if he was unable to "use" the doll as he had hoped and expected, this may be less a failure of Moos's craftsmanship and more a complement to her artistry: she critiques male artistry as dehumanizing and fetishizing, she challenges the ideal of the creative "male-artist-genius."
</p>

<p>
But if the letters he writes are an accurate description of his reaction to the finished work, Kokoschka missed this message. Having a role in mind that he and Moos would play, Kokoschka would stick to the script, with or without Moos's participation. But it took a third woman to help Kokoschka redeem his doll and reclaim his masculine genius. As he mentions in his letters, part of Kokoschka's attempt at playing Pygmalion,becoming in some sense a "window artist," involved dressing the doll with special clothes.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  He hired a woman to help circulate stories about his activities with and obsession over the doll, which included hiring a carriage to take the doll out and purchasing an opera box to show her off. According to Kokoschka's account in <i>My Life</i>, this housekeeper, Hulda, renamed "Russerl" by Kokoschka, was also hired to wait upon the doll in a maid's costume . As he reports in his memoirs:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Moonlight shone through the cellar window, and there, to my surprise, like Undine in the story, Russerl emerged from the water. With a provocative casualness she said that she simply wanted to take my mind off thoughts of death. Though her duty was to act only as lady's maid to my doll, the destined companion of my life, her sound common sense had told her that I would be lacking warmth in my bed.

<p class="noIndent">
In his comparison of Russerl to Undine, Kokoschka invokes an inversion of the Pygmalion myth: the lover killed by the beloved's touch. <sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Complicating the tenuous distinctions between the two stories, Kokoschka's account suggests that Russerl is able to bring him&#x02014;a dead object&#x02014;to a kind of new life, by providing "warmth" in his bed. Though her duties are to treat the doll as if it lives, she understands her work to more correctly involve treating the "dead" artist as living, by replacing the doll's own "duties." As proof of the new muse's success, Kokoschka transforms the narrative back into the Pygmalion story he had wanted to tell in the first place: "Now, the cloth-and-sawdust ef, in which I vainly sought to trace the features of Alma Mahler, was transred in a sudden flash of inspiration into a painting: <i>The Woman in Blue</i>. The larva, after its long winter in the cocoon, had emerged as a butterfly."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Once the dead artist is revived, Kokoschka's narrative no longer requires the existence of the doll. While the willful dismissal of his real-life lover and the creative abilities of the female artist prove destructive for the vivification of the doll and the artist, the sexual abilities of the female servant/slave, controlled even to the point of masculine renaming, are successful in enlivening and inspiring the artist. For Kokoschka, only the subservient woman, the silent muse, who knows her place in relation to great artistry, can be useful in the great artist's production, and only through her sexuality, in the pursuit of inspiring the artist-genius, can she produce great art herself. For the transgressive female or the female artist, Kokoschka's anger at his own resulting sense of emasculation is embodied in the violence of the loss of the doll's head.
</p>

<p>
And yet, if Kokoschka's treatment of the doll as a living being suggests a bleak automatism, his reputed abuse of the doll suggests an awareness of this impotence. It is this sense of emasculation at the hands of the women who inspired him, and vociferously denied by Kokoschka's letters that, in my view, becomes increasingly visible in Kokoschka's doll paintings. Kokoschka admits to having been inspired enough by the doll to reclaim it as his artistic subject through the painting <i>Woman in Blue</i>. (<a href="#4"> 4</a>) <i>Woman in Blue</i> is a half-length portrait of a full-breasted re in a blue dress. Her face, as she looks out from the canvas, is highly wrought, and she sits up partially from sheets or pillows, leaning on her right hand. The background contains irregular, indefinable shapes of rich blues and greens, which suggest the re's shadow. Kokoschka may have hoped for some shock value from <i>Woman in Blue</i>, by evoking the provocative woman/artist's model who returns the gaze in Edouard Manet's 1863 painting of the nude prostitute <i>Olympia</i> (Street 280).<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  But there is little that is overtly shocking in Kokoschka's image. Unlike Manet's <i>Olympia</i>, Kokoschka's re is fully, if provocatively, dressed. What might make Kokoschka's painting outrageous is that it portrays not a prostitute, but rather a sex doll&#x02014;one step more illicit than Manet's courtesan, and tacit confirmation that all the rumors of Kokoschka's behavior with the doll were true. Despite critical claims to the contrary, I would propose that, unless we are told the story, little in the final painting <i>Woman in Blue</i> suggests that this "woman" is the doll Kokoschka commissioned.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Even the slightly disjointed appearance of the re is masked within the layers of paint. And the title does nothing to mitigate the impression that the image is of a woman, not a doll. Kokoschka passes a doll for a woman in his life, and as his muse. 

<b></b>

As mannequins replace real people as models in the world of capitalist consumption, Kokoschka's <i>Woman in Blue</i> serves the spectator as the object of desire, making him or her complicit in the production of a non-human inspiration.

In addition to Manet's <i>Olympia</i>, Kokoschka's <i>Woman in Blue</i> also appropriately alludes to Manet's 1881&#x02013;82 <i>Bar at the Folies-Berg&#x000E8;re</i>.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  The shape of the re's head and square breast in <i>Woman in Blue</i>, for example, echo the shape of the barmaid's face and breast in <i>Bar</i>; both res also share the centralized placement of their prodigious bosoms, an ambiguity of their smiles, an indeterminacy of their gazes, a sexualization of the commodity and a commodification of the female re.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  In fact, in playful reversal of Manet's claim, where woman has been reduced to mere commodity, Kokoschka's doll, successfully masquerading as real woman, captured and displayed by the male artist, testifies that commodity is eminently capable of serving as fully woman, for both the sake of artist and spectator. Through his doll/woman Kokoschka makes an implicit commentary, in this light, on the cultural values of postwar society, which have replaced real people with reproductions: automatons, mannequins, and dolls. Where Manet expresses concern, Kokoschka here embraces the change seamlessly, if satirically. With the light blue halo over the doll's head, he emphasizes that materialism is modern man's spirituality, its virginity. But the silhouette of color in the background of <i>Woman in Blue</i>, which hints at this idea of reproduction once more, is reminiscent of an apparition that sits behind and props up the doll, with its arm around the doll's back. Even in this earliest "doll" painting, it is almost as if Kokoschka himself were 

<b></b>

standing in to stage himself as the doll's double, present in his own absence, and visible in the shadows.
</p>

<p>
The re of Kokoschka emerges fully in his second doll image, <i>Painter with Doll</i>.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  (<a href="#5"> 5</a>) In this second image, the doll, nearly neckless and staring directly out of the image, sits in front of the painter with its clothes now removed. Its extreme light color and the blockish strokes with white highlights suggest the furry skin that the doll actually possessed. The doll is, as the title attests, much more puppet-like than it appeared in <i>Woman in Blue</i>, except, notably, for its face. The male re, Kokoschka himself, sits directly behind the doll, almost its exact opposite in position. He holds his left hand on its raised left knee and pointing, with his right, to the doll's genitals. The work suggests Kokoschka's god-like control over the inanimate object even to the hint of ventriloquism.
</p>

<p>
With its nude female re and dressed male re, this work recalls another Manet painting, his 1863 <i>D&#x000E9;jeuner sur l'herbe</i><sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  with its scandalous luncheon: two fully dressed contemporary men cavorting with two nude (or nearly nude) women, that is somehow desexualized, a maintaining of tension between the sexual space of the prostitute and the "sacred" space of the artist's model that inspired Manet. <sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  But Kokoschka's image, which collapses his sexual attraction with the artist's model in the nude doll insists that for Kokoschka as artist-genius, the source for creative activity and inspiration was eminently sexual. This idea is confirmed by the second allusion, made through the doll's hands, in <i>Painter with Doll</i> to the <i>Venus of Willendorf</i>, an ancient fertility idol (Street 286). Though the doll lacks the <i>Venus of Willendorf</i>'s disproportionately huge breasts, stomach and thighs&#x02014;an exaggeration of its procreative qualities&#x02014;Kokoschka's indexing of the doll's genitals serves to direct attention to the source of the doll's "sexuality" and "fertility." Kokoschka's position, a sardonic reversal of the traditional <i>Piet&#x000E0;</i> (Street 287), emphasizes his spiritual adoration of physical love as a method of bringing the dead to life.
</p>

<p>
But Kokoschka's pointing to its genitals tends also to accentuate the procreative abilities a doll lacks. After all, in the case of Kokoschka's doll, a close up of its body's function can only desexualize and dehumanize it. Kokoschka's pointing is ambiguous because the doll serves neither as nurturer nor as procreator in any usual sense; it indicates less the doll's (pro)creative abilities than Kokoschka's, as artist, with his modern source of inspiration. Its "womb" is empty while Kokoschka remains able to create, inspired by its artificiality and unthreatening passivity. Indeed, at the same time Kokoschka is poking fun (so to speak) at his obsession with the doll's sex, his anger at Alma Mahler (to the extent that the doll represents her) becomes perhaps all the more biting. <sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  It was Mahler, after all, who made her womb barren to him, whose heart was, from Kokoschka's perspective, cold and empty of love for him and their child. If Kokoschka believes himself to be exorcising Mahler with the creation and destruction of the doll, this painting becomes a significant part of his "working through."
</p>

<p>
But Kokoschka's own position in <i>Painter with Doll</i> is visually indefinite as well. Does the red paint behind the doll suggest red pillows upon which the doll leans, or are these Kokoschka's legs? Or is the doll on a table, higher up than he? Is he scrunched

down, sitting cross-legged and leaning forward? If so, his position is contorted even more impossibly than his doll's: both of his arms are awkwardly occupied in posing and exposing his doll. In fact, in some sense, the doll's body parts and Kokoschka's are transposable. This visual process of transforming subject into object is advanced through Kokoschka's hands, which serve as interchangeable parts, in <i>Painter with Doll</i>. His left wrist points down at the doll from a position that makes it unclear where the rest of his arm or body is placed. Similarly, his right wrist is turned with the thumb out so extremely that the rest of his arm seems to conflict with the twisted left arm and hand. These hands, when compared with the position of the non-naturalistic hands on the doll appear almost interchangeable. The doll's left hand, at a naturalistic length and position, would fall at precisely the position of Kokoschka's left hand. If Kokoschka were supporting the doll from the front, his left hand would fall at precisely the position of the doll's left hand above her breast. The doll's right hand falls almost where Kokoschka's hand might have been if he were supporting her from the back, around her neck. Taken to this extreme, the doll's hands exchanged for Kokoschka's, the procreative gesture that recalls the <i>Venus of Willendorf</i> is transformed into an image of strangulation, the murderous end of the infamous doll foreshadowed. And in this seeming detachability of limbs, Kokoschka's self image begins to be associated with the mutilated mannequin, the very doll he objectifies. Painted as if he is her clothed mirror image and alter ego, Kokoschka too portrays himself neckless with an oversized head, disjointed and contorted, possessing awkward limbs and interchangeable, prosthetic parts that anticipate Hans Bellmer's dolls. Kokoschka becomes disembodied, reflecting, perhaps, 

<b></b>

those who returned from the war less physically whole than he did. Kokoschka here paints himself as the very feminized object he elsewhere criticizes. The pun contained within the title, "<i>Maler</i>" (painter) / "<i>Mahler</i>" (Alma) <i>with Doll</i>, makes this ambiguity, Kokoschka's own feminization, all the more poignant.
</p>

<p>
The transformation from subject to object is accentuated once again in Kokoschka's final, unfinished image with the doll, <i>At the Easel</i>.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  (<a href="#6"> 6</a>) The image is almost a full-length self-portrait in which Kokoschka holds his brush to paint on an easel, which corresponds to the edge of the picture frame. The doll, now relegated to a shelf on the artist's studio and visually lacking in animation, is only partially visible in the lower left side of the image. It is deposed of any glory attributed to it in Kokoshka's earlier paintings. What strikes me, though most critics read this moment as Kokoschka's decisive separation from the doll, is that the painter still touches the doll's thigh with his left hand. And if Kokoschka is himself now well defined and central to his own image, he is also the least naturalistic aspect of the painting. His cartoonish face and re are set off by the brilliant whiteness of his artist's smock, while the more naturalistic Dresden cityscape, which becomes his subject subsequent to this last doll image, appears outside the artist's studio. Kokoschka's right arm appears to be on backward and shortened out of proportion, a prosthetic gone wrong. The head is lowered so that Kokoschka's shoulders are depicted as higher than his ears. Indeed, Kokoschka appears transformed from the genius Frankenstein in <i>Woman in Blue</i>, into the re/membered, animalistic, "primitive" monster in <i>At the Easel</i>. Though Kokoschka's writings depict an artist with increasing self-confidence as the doll deteriorates, his paintings depict a kind of automatization of the deteriorating artist. Yet in this transformation, because we, the spectators, become the canvas upon which the artist Kokoschka works in some fashion (the picture plane and Kokoschka's implied canvas occupy the same space), this re/membered Kokoschka successfully brings his work to life for the first time. In seeing the world through both empowered and disempowered eyes, perhaps Kokoschka is better able to become an artist-genius. Or in other words, perhaps the doll he still touches and the female influence it carries with it makes him able to bring his work to life. We are left only to wonder what effect Kokoschka's deadening and enlivening gaze&#x02014;which had so transformed Moos and Mahler&#x02014;will have when it turns away from the inward world of Kokoschka's artistic and sexual fantasies, his masculine insecurities and fears, and outward onto us.
</p>

<p>
Kokoschka's doll serves as visual testimony of the artist's modernist fascination with gender as a method of investigating the tensions between "art" and "life." Kokoschka's investment in publicizing his relationship with Mahler, the publishing of his biography, the preservation and publication of his letters detailing the infamous doll, his staging of events surrounding the doll, and his use of the doll as model for his work, all confirm his attempt to bridge art and life in a manner that places Kokoschka's doll and 1920s paintings in dialogue with the most important avant-garde artists of his moment.
</p>

<p>
But Kokoschka does not deserve sole credit for this doll that, I submit, was not merely a performative accomplishment, but an aesthetic success. Whether through his disappointment in its lack of realism or through his refusal to recognize a poignant 

<b></b>

critique made by his female collaborator, Kokoschka fails to acknowledge Hermine Moos's feminist revision of the Pygmalion myth&#x02014;one that de-romanticizes the male artist-genius Kokoschka admires. Though he textually denies the strengths of Moos's work, Kokoschka's visual response to her, in the form of paintings of himself and the doll, indicate that she caused him to question his own masculine artistry. In contradiction to his written sentiments, Kokoschka portrays his own "objectification" and he emphasizes the similarities between himself and his doll. As Kokoschka's self-portraits with the doll demonstrate, the male artist's gaze eventually reduces not only women, but even himself to a feminized object. In Kokoschka's later writings he clings to his Romantic and phallocentric illusions, but these paintings suggest a bleak introspection that may reflect something Kokoschka has learned not only from his experiences in the war, but also from the women who inspired him.

The actual facts here are speculative at best. See Lisa J. Street, 1993, "Oskar Kokoschka's Doll: Symbol of Culture,"Ph.D. diss., Emory University. Street's is the most recent and extensive investigation of Kokoschka's work on the doll in English, and this paper relies heavily upon her research. Street spends a good deal of time attributing the various accounts of the doll, many of which were embellished long after the incident occurred. For my purposes in this article, I am interested in the reason for the constructed narratives surrounding the doll, regardless of their veracity.

Also convinced that the doll constitutes art, Street works to demonstrate a connection between the doll and Kokoschka's interest in puppets in his earliest plays, including his "Moving Light Pictures: The Speckled Egg," 1907 (81&#x02013;83) which Street describes as a "puppet play" , and the general avant-garde artistic interest in the puppet or doll (especially the work of Ranier Maria Rilke (249&#x02013;52) and, through Albert Ehrenstein, the work of both the Z&#x000FC;rich and Dresden dadaists (257&#x02013;70)).

Kokoschka attended an exhibition of Moos's dolls in Dresden at the Richter Gallery in September 1918. As Street notes, "From this we conclude that her dolls were apparently considered to be of artistic importance, at least as examples of expert craftsmanship, although she is not nearly as well known as Lotte Pritzel" . Street notes that Kokoschka initially approached Pritzel with the idea for this commission. She refused the job, but perhaps recommended her colleague, Moos (270&#x02013;71). See also Whitford, 119. Street declines to speculate on why Pritzel refused the job, but such an audacious commission&#x02014;a life-sized doll built to the proportions of an ex-lover, which the artist might dress and amuse himself with&#x02014;would have scandalized some women. Moos's reasons for taking this job, which other women had already refused, may suggest a certain bravado in her character.

You must get it yourself, otherwise I cannot believe in it, and that is so important" (Kokoschka "Fetisch" 71; trans. Hoffman 146).

Kokoschka was greatly preoccupied with this skin. From the first letter, he writes, "On my drawing I have somewhat schematically indicated the planes and the resultant hollows and folds, which I regard as important. I can scarcely wait to see how you fashion the skin. The character and differentiation it will lend to the various parts of the body are bound to make them all the richer, more delicate and human" (Kokoschka "Fetische" 67; trans. Keegan <i>Eye</i> 105&#x02013;06). In the letter from August 20, 1918, he recommends various fabrics as possible coverings: "The skin will probably have to be made of the thinnest fabric available, gossamer silk or the very finest linen, and will have to be built up in small patches. . . . " (Kokoschka "Fetische" 70; trans. Keegan <i>Eye</i> 106). And again in his letter of December 10, 1918: "Finally, the skin must be peachlike in its feel. There mustn't be seams at any place where you have reason to believe it will offend me, reminding me that the fetish is nothing but a wretched ragbag . . . " (Kokoschka "Fetisch" 73; trans.

Manet's <i>Bar</i> has been historically understood to comment upon the commodification of society, and especially women, linking Manet's barmaid's golden hair, white square breast and black dress with the golden-foiled, white-labeled, black champagne bottles to her right. Also of central importance to the image is the mirror, which adds to the sense of production and reproduction and only imperfectly reflects what appears in front of it.

Street argues that the last of these three "doll portraits" is not a portrait of Kokoschka's doll, but is merely an artist's dummy, and therefore only ambiguously related to the other two pictures (289&#x02013;90). While I agree with Street that the latter doll portrait does not closely resemble the photographs of the doll Kokoschka commissioned, I would suggest that Kokoschka's gesture in the self-portrait&#x02014;with his hand on the doll's thigh&#x02014;implies a relationship between artist and doll that is more consistent with the earlier portraits than Street allows. Similarly, the inclusion of Kokoschka's own self-portrait with the large doll, given his own work to "automythologize" the events surrounding a particular large doll, does not seem likely to be coincidental.

To call Ezra Pound's experimental epic, <i>The Cantos</i>, a monument of literary kitsch would be nothing short of blasphemy: no epithet more contrary or perverse could be applied to Pound's ambitious and learned poem, or indeed to any canonical work of high modernism. The cultic substance of <i>The Cantos</i> has been evident now for decades, yet the poem remains, when viewed from the perspective of kitsch, apotropaic&#x02014;inscrutable to eyes blinded by the dogmatic principles of modernism. To describe <i>The Cantos</i> as kitsch is unthinkable, however, only because modernist critics&#x02014;Clement Greenberg, most notably&#x02014;defined kitsch in the 1930s in opposition to the principles of modernism and the avant-garde.
</p>

<p>
Kitsch is the most important, if still largely misunderstood, category of aesthetic production to have emerged from the political turmoil of the 1930s and from the polemics of late modernism. Yet the antithetical relation between kitsch and the principles of modernism (or art in general) is dangerously unstable and ambiguous: Greenberg identified kitsch as a parasite feeding upon the productions of the avant-garde,<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  while Hermann Broch (the Austrian novelist whose 1933 essay on kitsch established the framework for all later formulations of kitsch, including Greenberg's) claimed that kitsch is "lodged like a foreign body in the overall system of art."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Furthermore, Broch (an unlikely defender of modern formalism) declares: "Kitsch is the element of evil in the value system of art. . . . Its relationship to art can be compared&#x02014;and this is more than a mere metaphor&#x02014;to the relationship between the system of the Anti-Christ and the system of Christ" (63, 62). That is, kitsch is the dialectical "system" opposed to art (and to modernism in particular), whose unmarked 

<b></b>

resemblance to the "system" of art only enhances its catastrophically destructive challenge to the values of art. Broch's recognition of the perilous correspondences between art and kitsch led him ultimately to view kitsch as a <i>Luciferian</i> phenomenon&#x02014;not as a static category distinct from art, but as the fallen condition of an exalted aesthetic ideology. He describes Romanticism's susceptibility to "a disastrous fall from the cosmic heights to kitsch": a Luciferian "swerve" from cosmos to cosmetics. That is, properly speaking, kitsch is a matter of becoming rather than being. To characterize a poem or painting as kitsch therefore implies that the work need not have been produced as kitsch and, moreover, it is revealed to be kitsch&#x02014;an apocalyptic orientation&#x02014;in the course of its historical transmission.
</p>

<p>
The same modernist critics who constructed the opposition between kitsch and avant-garde tended to view kitsch as a form of degraded Romanticism, suggesting that the attempt to isolate kitsch from art is related to the antagonism displayed by modernist writers toward Romantic poetics (and to the phantasmagorical properties of Romantic values in modernist texts).<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Further, we should bear in mind that modernist theories of kitsch emerged in the 1930s (the period when Pound revived the compositional principle of the ideogram) and that references to Romanticism in this context often served as a means of linking kitsch to the aesthetic ideology of National Socialism. In Pound's case, one finds encrypted in the modernist image a residue of Romantic hermeneutics and necrophilia which repeatedly disrupts his formalist doctrine, and which later contributed to the fascist coloring of the revised, mythical ideogram. Thus one could argue that the foreign body encrypted in the modernist image (and modernism in general) is the problem of kitsch (as a degraded form of Romanticism). Indeed, a cryptological reading of the problem of kitsch first becomes evident, as I indicated earlier, in Broch's alarming re: "Kitsch is certainly not 'bad art'; it forms its own closed system, which is lodged like a foreign body in the overall system of art" . Similarly, Adorno writes, "It [kitsch] lies dormant in art itself, waiting for a chance to leap forward at any moment."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Furthermore, Adorno explains, "the revolt against art's a priori affinity with kitsch has helped guide the development of art towards the decomposition of works. What art used to be, kitsch may become in the future. Kitsch may be a corrective to the decomposing trend in art, perhaps it is even the true progress of art" . Adorno suggests here that the rative "death" of art (its "decomposition") in modern formalism arises from an allergic reaction to kitsch. Moreover, it is kitsch, the apparition of "mimetic enchantment," that will rise, eventually, from the grave of modernism. In this passage, Adorno predicts the "return"&#x02014;after modernism&#x02014;of kitsch, an orientation exceeding, and revising, the thesis that kitsch is merely a degraded form of Romantic poetics.
</p>

<p>
I want to argue that a similar encrypting and reanimation of kitsch occurs, under the "spell" of fascism, in the modernist precinct of <i>The Cantos</i>. To gain some perspective, one should bear in mind that, just as the problem of kitsch, generally, is associated with the power of images in modern society, so the problem of kitsch in Pound's work emerges first in the context of Imagism. In the most obvious sense, the modernist image in poetry emerges as an emblem of opposition to the dangerous potency of Victorian 

<b></b>

"rhetoric," the catch-all term Pound uses to condemn the symptoms of poetic kitsch: ornament and falsification. In his Vorticist writings, Pound explains, "The point of Imagisme is that it does not use images <i>as ornaments</i>" (Pound's emphasis).<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Pound is careful to distinguish the new poetic image from "false metaphor, ornamental metaphor" and "applied decoration."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Indeed, one could argue that poetic modernism, in its early stages, attempted to counteract the general perception, infecting literary culture as well, that poetry, in contrast to prose, is the verbal embodiment of kitsch (a legacy of Romanticism that continues to haunt the public estimation of contemporary poetry).
</p>

<p>
Despite Pound's strategic success in isolating the modernist image from the symptoms of literary kitsch, it must be emphasized that this manifest opposition is fatally undermined by the extravagant and polarized rhetoric of Imagist poetics. "Hugh Selwyn Mauberley," (written by Pound as an "autopsy" of the Imagist period), offers a brilliant account of the medusal power exercised by kitsch over the creator of the modernist image. The poem condemns, on one hand, the kitsch sensibility of "the age":
</p>

<p class="noIndent">
In these lines, a perfume marketed under the name of the ancient Greek word for beauty becomes a symbol for the antithesis of modernism, a symbol despised by the obituarian prospect of the poem, yet embraced by the Imagist Mauberley: "The 'age demanded' chiefly a mould in plaster" . The most unstable and troubling aspects of the poem arise therefore from its acknowledgment that the destructive character of kitsch finds its fullest expression in the sensibility and "mediumistic" art of Mauberley, who is clearly one of the primary "faces" (if not the occluded source) of Imagist poetics.
</p>

<p>
Though "Hugh Selwyn Mauberley" may condemn Mauberley's hyper-aesthetic sensibility, the poem cannot disguise the rhapsodic, yet forbidden, allure of poetic kitsch:

The fact that Mauberley is both an image-maker and a self-destructive addict of beauty suggests that Pound's early crypt poetry, which we must now, by analogy with Mauberley's art, regard as kitsch, is one of the hidden well-springs of Imagism. Indeed, <i>The Cantos</i> itself is riddled with passages recalling the pre-Raphaelite cult of beauty. Furthermore, it is Mauberley's death&#x02014;some would say suicide&#x02014;in the poem from an excess of pleasure which establishes the terms for a phantasmic revival of kitsch, as a form of ethnographic "possession," in the context of Pound's fascism.
</p>

<p>
The many passages in <i>The Cantos</i> which betray the rhapsodic sensibility of kitsch in the most conventional manner frequently occur at the three principal sites of Pound's historical imagination (which he calls the "phantastikon"): medieval Italy or France, ancient China, and Greek antiquity. Often, the scenes mix details and references to several places, or cultures, at once, as in this Chinese tableau alluding to the Roman god of sleep:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">

<br />

The Hellenic version of this scene usually involves some nudity, lots of water, and perhaps a peep at a pagan god:

As these passages indicate, the lyric substance of epic kitsch tends towards archaism&#x02014;a lost language to render lost worlds&#x02014;a verbal palette designed to catch the eye and ear of the carriage trade.
</p>

<p>
The primary solution to restrictions and categories imposed by a formalist understanding of kitsch derives from a counter-argument <i>within</i> the modernist discourse on kitsch, which yields an esoteric form of kitsch that resonates with the principles of high modernism. From the standpoint of this counter-perspective, one could argue that Christmas tree ornaments painted with Hitler's portrait belong in the same aesthetic domain as the cryptic insignia of the SS uniform; or that the aggressively modernist installations of the 1932 fascist exhibition in Rome provide the context for processions of Italian youth dressed in togas. The sources of these two ostensibly divergent modalities of kitsch are identical: the cryptology of myth, nostalgia, and death.
</p>

<p>
In the context of Pound's work, the spirit of modernist, totalitarian kitsch emerges from Mauberley's grave: the cult of beauty revives as a formal paradigm of "possession," modeled after the tropes of ethnographic collecting and symbolized by the principle of <i>paideuma</i>. The fascist poetic is no longer possessed simply by objects of beauty (though that experience, too, persists in <i>The Cantos</i>), but by "dead" objects, charged with mythological significance, which the poet has rescued from a tawdry modernity, yet also arranged in a collection according to the esoteric and didactic impulses of Pound's aesthetic ideology. This collection is itself a monadic "image" (in the sense that a museum collection is an image) of a fascist utopia. The anachronistic and totalitarian features of kitsch are therefore evident in <i>The Cantos</i> not merely in the sentimental or rhapsodic effect of some of its images, but, by implication, in the praxis of collecting which governs <i>The Cantos</i>. This collection provides in turn a simulacrum of the mythological community to which the nostalgic images refer. Pound's poetic praxis in <i>The Cantos</i> therefore fuses kitsch and high modernism, most obviously, in it atavistic seizures of pre-Raphaelite "beauty" (which occur like blackouts in the experimental ethos of the text); yet also in its sometimes hysterical impulse to display its verbal booty, its contraband, its sentimental treasure. In addition, directly imitating the kitsch sensibility of Fascist propaganda, certain sections of the later cantos employ melodrama and simplistic myths to mobilize support for the Fascist regime. These various modalities of kitsch coincide in the notorious Italian cantos.
</p>

<p>
The cryptological reading of kitsch was initiated, as I mentioned, by Broch, who associates kitsch with "that atmosphere of quite indecent necrophilia which so largely dominates Romantic literature."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  More recently, the historian Saul Friedl&#x000E4;nder has examined the necrophilic dimension of kitsch, as well as its nostalgic character, in relation to fascist culture. In an essay on kitsch and the apocalyptic imagination, he refers to "the use of kitsch and death motives in representations meant to exorcise the past by re-invoking its specific kind of fascination."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  In his seminal work, <i>Reflections 
</i>
<b></b>
<i>
of Nazism: An Essay on Kitsch and Death</i>, Friedl&#x000E4;nder develops a conception of what he calls "a kitsch of the apocalypse," and observes, "The paradox of kitsch and modernity is that kitsch is often an antimodern face of modernity."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Further, he claims, "Kitsch death is a means to digest the past" , and that kitsch often signals "a cult of primitive and archaic values" . Thus he associates kitsch with "exorcism" and the "work of mourning"&#x02014;an aberrant mourning, I would add, that calls to mind the permutations of Pound's fascination with death . Friedl&#x000E4;nder's necrological and apocalyptic reading of kitsch focuses on the phenomenon of myth, which he defines as "a footprint, an echo of lost worlds, haunting an imagination invaded by excessive rationality and thus becoming the crystallization point for thrusts of the archaic and the irrational" . "Kitsch," he argues, "is a debased form of myth, but nevertheless draws from the mythic substance" .
</p>

<p>
Quite clearly, Friedl&#x000E4;nder's understanding of kitsch, as it appears in the context of fascist culture, calls to mind many of the features of Pound's archaism, as well as the more specific features of his mythological revision of the ideogram (which occurs under the spell of fascism, in concert with the ethnographic doctrine of <i>paideuma</i>). In addition, although Friedl&#x000E4;nder adheres to the formalist view of kitsch as depending upon "an unreflective, immediate emotional response," he also lays the groundwork, through his conception of myth, for a theory of high kitsch, of esoteric kitsch, which would help to account for Pound's fascist modernism. He refers, for example, to "the pseudo-spirituality that envelopes such kitsch, finding there constant exploitations of esotericism and mystery as well as the no less frequent evocation of the universe of legends and myths" . He also notes that "the kitsch of death, of destruction, of apocalypse, is a special kitsch, a representation of reality that does not integrate into the vision of ordinary kitsch"&#x02014;not at first glance, one must add . Just as Friedl&#x000E4;nder's historiographic model presents kitsch as a phenomenon that is at once immediate and esoteric, so Pound views myth&#x02014;the modernist matrix of high kitsch&#x02014;as being implicated at once in ratio (in totality) and in secrecy; as a phenomenon that is both violently direct and mysterious in function: a veritable black box of aesthetic production.
</p>

<p>
I want to close my discussion of kitsch by considering briefly a moment in <i>The Cantos</i> where the two modalities of kitsch&#x02014;low and high, vulgar and refined, immediate and esoteric&#x02014;coincide. In fact, while works of reactionary modernism such as <i>The Cantos</i> may invoke the hierarchy implicit in the concept of kitsch, they also call into question such distinctions, since the esoteric mode of kitsch, which submits the "possessive" logic of the collection to the principles of high modernism, aspires to complete transparency and immediacy (just as the obscurity of the ideogram is an effect of literary positivism). I want to turn, finally, to cantos 72 and 73, originally published in 1945, but withheld from the standard edition of <i>The Cantos</i> until 1987. Written by Pound in Italian and published in an official newspaper of the Fascist Sal&#x000F2; Republic near the end of the war, these cantos represent some of the most blatant and simplistic material written by Pound in support of the fascist regime.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  They fulfill to a remarkable degree Friedl&#x000E4;nder's thesis that "Kitsch related to death scenes and ceremonies of sacrifice seems to be at the very core of a certain type of extreme political motivation" ("Apocalyptic Imagination"

<b></b>

205). That is, these cantos display the features of "ordinary" kitsch (immediacy, sentimentality, etc.) placed in the service of a totalitarian regime (a function of kitsch emphasized by Broch) and permeated by an atmosphere of death.
</p>

<p>
The fact that these cantos were written and published in Italian indicates, I think, Pound's desire to present these emblematic narratives to his audience with as little mediation as possible, but also the degree to which he continued to identify with Italian fascism in its final desperate hours. Canto 72 presents the poet absorbed in a visitation from the underworld by three ghosts, including the recently deceased fascist, and leader of the Futurist movement, F.T. Marinetti. Pound's former nemesis, whose fascist views have apparently softened Pound's antagonistic stance towards Futurism, asks Pound to lend him his body so that he may continue ting for the Fascist cause&#x02014;a bizarre episode of body-snatching which serves well as an emblem of late modernism. Canto 73 presents a related scenario, with considerably less ambiguity concerning its political aims: Pound receives a dream-like visitation from Cavalcanti's ghost, who tells Pound (and the reader) an uplifting tale of heroism from the contemporary battle-front. The story involves an Italian peasant girl, "un po' tozza ma bella" (a little stocky, but pretty), who meets a group of Canadian soldiers in the Italian countryside with several German prisoners in tow, scouting for stray enemy combatants in the final months of the Allied clean-up in northern Italy. The girl, a fascist partisan, leads the Canadian outfit into a minefield, where she and the Canadians are killed, while the German prisoners escape to t once more. The poet celebrates the girl's heroism, claiming "The brave young girl's spirit was singing, singing with joy... Glory of the Fatherland, Glory! Glory to die for the Fatherland in Romagna! The dead are not dead."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
This melodramatic narrative reflects, without qualification, the features of what Friedl&#x000E4;nder calls the "kitsch of apocalypse," seeking to elicit from its audience, through mythical scenes of death and sacrifice, an emotional, unreflective response. (More specifically, canto 73, in particular, clearly aims to mobilize support for the German-backed Sal&#x000F2; government.) At the same time, however, the dramatic setting of these cantos&#x02014;a conversation with the dead&#x02014;cannot help but recall the interview with the dead that inaugurates <i>The Cantos,</i> thereby suggesting that these cantos, inspired by fascism, subscribe in the most explicit manner to the impulse guiding <i>The Cantos</i> as a whole. There is also a formal continuity: these cantos are composed according to the high modernist principles of the ideogrammic method. Canto 72, in particular, like the cantos that precede it, is fragmentary, allusive, and didactic. Restored to its place within <i>The Cantos,</i> one notes that canto 72 follows the last of the Adams' cantos, which are composed almost entirely of citations from other texts, and therefore offer an example of Pound's literary positivism, under the guise of the ideogram, at its most extreme. Canto 72, itself, sustains the logic of preservation, accumulation, and display that informs the collection of curiosities stored in <i>The Cantos:</i> one finds familiar and scurrilous references to Churchill and usury, to medieval history and to the "mysterious bed of divine Isotta," to Confucius and Gemisto, etc. In this context, one should not fail to note Friedl&#x000E4;nder's thesis that "Cumulation is a characteristic of kitsch," that the language of kitsch is "one of accumulation, repetition and redundancy: a massive use 

<b></b>

of synonyms, an excess of similar epithets, a play of images sent back, in turn, from one to the other in echoes without end."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Thus the phenomena of accumulation and "possession" are central not only to the ideogrammic logic of the collection but to the phantasmagoria of kitsch. Despite the ostensible opposition between avant-garde and kitsch, the esotericism, allusiveness, and formal complexity of high modernism are not necessarily antithetical to kitsch. Indeed, as Greenberg observed, these avant-garde strategies are easily appropriated by the "system" of kitsch&#x02014;a condition suggesting that <i>The Cantos</i> may be an unstable amalgam of avant-garde and kitsch combined in a single literary monument.  In Pound's case, the totalitarian reserve of kitsch coincides with the cryptic dimension of the modernist image, just as the transparency of kitsch, in the context of <i>The Cantos,</i> may be viewed as the "afterlife" of literary positivism&#x02014;an afterlife shrouded in secrecy, violence, and "racial" memory. The dialectical relation between modernist and collector helps to explain, therefore, the surprising <i>lack</i> of tension or incongruity as the poem moves from the ideogrammic construction of canto 72 to the fascist parable of canto 73. On one level, this parable of death is simply one more "curiosity" in the excessive and nostalgic collection of <i>The Cantos,</i> yet it is also, in its susceptibility to complex ideological diversions, a parable not only of Pound's strange modernist "museum," but of the forms of "possession" on which it is founded and to which it is a monument.

In his 1939 essay, "Avant-Garde and Kitsch," Greenberg writes: "The precondition for kitsch, a condition without which kitsch would be impossible, is the availability close at hand of a fully matured cultural tradition, whose discoveries, acquisitions, and perfected self-consciousness kitsch can take advantage of for its own ends. It borrows from it devices, tricks, stratagems, rules of thumb, themes, converts them into a system, and discards the rest. It draws its life blood, so to speak, from this reservoir."

Broch, once again, lays the groundwork for this position, calling kitsch "a specific product of Romanticism," and claiming that "Romanticism, without therefore being kitsch itself, is the mother of kitsch" ("Notes on the Problem of Kitsch," 61, 62). Greenberg makes a similar statement: "the Romantics can be considered the original sinners whose guilt kitsch inherited. They showed kitsch how" . This position is echoed by more recent theorists of kitsch.

<div class="beginText">





<p class="noIndent">
At the height of T. S. Eliot's prominence, a young Hugh Kenner published "Eliot's Moral Dialectic" .<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  A now surprising note to the essay describes it as "a chapter from a comprehensive study of T. S. Eliot being prepared in collaboration with Herbert Marshall McLuhan" ("EMD,"421). Kenner's second book would not have been about Ezra Pound, but about Eliot, and it would have been co-authored. In 1949 Kenner was moving toward the main current of literary and academic research, after having gotten Chesterton out of his system. Yet the Eliot study was delayed for ten years, and McLuhan disappeared from the project. In the interim, Kenner had stumbled across Ezra Pound. Kenner perceived that Pound, not Eliot, was the master poet of the age. Kenner's considerations of Eliot and Pound indicate that the revaluation turns on his conception of the nature of language as closely allied to Christian theology.
</p>

<p>
In "Eliot's Moral Dialectic," Eliot's career involves an "intense concern with moral states" that has escaped most previous critics, who are ill-equipped to elucidate "spiritual themes" ("EMD,"421, 422). For Kenner, only a critic steeped in Christian belief can successfully approach Eliot, if only because "The still point around which the poetry of Eliot revolves is the point at which theology and poetry meet" ("EMD," 433). Eliot is not concerned with hinting at his personal life, or illustrating his views on contemporary events, or prescribing remedies for an ailing culture. No, this Eliot is centrally preoccupied with dramatizing 

<b></b>

internal, spiritual states. Eliot's career after <i>The Waste Land</i> as the most influential poet and critic of his age proves incidental to this central, spiritual concern. Furthermore, since Kenner finds few critics able to discern the nature of the spiritual states, the acclaim Eliot has received must be founded on what readers <i>want</i> to see in Eliot, not on what is there. "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock," for example, whatever it means to Eliot, is a generic haunted temple that echoes in refined form the yearnings and aversions of individual readers. They perceive merely a specter of their own desires. Although Eliot was not attempting to construct verbal artifacts that would appeal to a large audience and ensure his presence in anthologies, his language had just that effect. Hence Eliot's advantage over Pound in the marketplace.
</p>

<p>
For Kenner, the proper reader of Eliot understands how language and human nature can be understood metaphysically. Only those critics steeped in metaphysics and theology can comprehend the true Eliot. Kenner's conception of metaphysics and theology as they relate to poetry&#x02014;both Eliot's and Pound's&#x02014;helps explain why Kenner was first taken with Eliot, and why he so quickly turned to Pound. In "Eliot's Moral Dialectic," Kenner points to a theologically grounded theory of language. He credits Walter J. Ong's essay, "Wit and Mystery: A Revelation in Mediaeval Latin Hymnody," with providing insight about Eliot's poetry, particularly with regard to Aquinas's claim that poets and Christian theologians both have recourse to metaphor.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Following Ong's lead, Kenner addresses the common "reliance on metaphor" of theology and poetry "for the opposite reasons that the latter deals in materials too much immersed in matter for immediate apprehension (such as the human will), the former in objects too much transcending material realization (such as the Trinity)" ("EMD," 433).
</p>

<p>
In Ong's view, and Kenner's, this understanding of metaphor illuminates mediaeval wit poetry, the Metaphysical poets, and Eliot's poems. Aquinas insists on a profound rift between God and language. Hence the recourse to metaphor, language's inherently lame attempt to deal with the mysteries underlying Christian belief, including the Trinity. For the young Kenner, Eliot's poetry fundamentally attempts to make twentieth-century metaphors that will, in Thomistic fashion, come as close as possible to the central Christian mysteries. As "Eliot's Moral Dialectic" remarks of <i>Little Gidding,</i> "Through the manipulation of parody-reconciliations of varying degrees of imperfection, an illusion, a speculum, of the inapprehensible transcendent reconciliation, the 'still point,' is forged for contemplation" ("EMD," 433). At the bottom of the Eliotic well lies a spiritual radiance.
</p>

<p>
Even in 1949, however, the Thomistic assessment of language's inherent shortcomings made Kenner uneasy. In <i>Paradox in Chesterton,</i> Kenner records Chesterton's allegiance to a Thomistic view of language.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Yet Kenner also apparently yearns after a theory of language that will not leave human beings eternally juggling metaphors and speaking paradoxically. Kenner apologizes for Chesterton's muddled prose, but emphasizes that the perception behind the prose is accurate: "What must be praised in Chesterton is not the writing but the seeing" (<i>PC,</i> 103). At another point he cites Jeremy Taylor on creation as mirroring God (<i>PC,</i> 123). Although Kenner honors Chesterton by taking seriously his allegiance to Thomistic doctrine, he also raises the 

<b></b>

possibility that perception can acquire sound knowledge of ultimate truths. But can clear perceptions be translated into linguistic clarity?
</p>

<p>
A passage halfway through <i>Dublin's Joyce</i>  encapsulates Kenner's view of Western intellectual history, and touches on the question of language's adequacy:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
. . . from Plato's <i>Cratylus</i> till the Cartesian revolution language was seen as simultaneously linking and harmonizing all the intellectual and physical functions of men with the order of the universe. By the Neo-Platonists and Augustine, by Bonaventure and Francis Bacon, the world was viewed as a book, the lost language of which was analogous to human speech.

</blockquote>

</div>

<p>
This tradition expressing confidence in language's intimate, ongoing relation to the whole universe antedates Descartes's interference. As we learn in <i>The Poetry of Ezra Pound</i> , "Descartes' distrust of language . . . has introduced into . . . communication a vehement determination to effect between poet and audience a transfusion of personality rather than perception" (<i>PEP,</i> 72). Once Descartes assigns priority to the individual's mind rather than to the created world which it inhabits, certainty is limited to one's own thoughts. Therefore, what we can communicate with assurance is simply those thoughts and their characteristic arrangement: in a word, our personality. The modernist revolution, however, counters the cult of personality. In 1952, Kenner sees Eliot's and Pound's poetry as offering perceptions, not personality. But what conception of language allows modernism to rectify the Cartesian error?
</p>

<p>
Pre-Cartesian theories of language include a rival to the Thomistic doctrine, a Franciscan tradition, whose chief re is named in the passage from <i>Dublin's Joyce:</i> Saint Bonaventure (born 1221), a contemporary of Aquinas (born ca. 1225). As a Franciscan, Bonaventure approved a view of the world and its constituents&#x02014;including language&#x02014;that denies the Thomistic fundamental rift between the divine and the divinely created. This view stresses the <i>link</i> between God and His creation, like "a ray of light entering through a window . . . colored by different ways according to the different colors of the various parts."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  For the Franciscans, God permeates the universe and permits humanity to see and celebrate His presence. Bonaventure clearly implies a theory of language mediating between the soul and God in his <i>Itinerarium mentis in Deum (The Soul's Journey into God)</i> . In the third chapter, he lists forms of understanding by which intellects can communicate with one another about the Truth, among which are grammar, logic, and rhetoric (the Trivium), all inseparable from language. He affirms that God has bequeathed humanity the gift of language, enabling us to perceive Him without hindrance.
</p>

<p>
In choosing between Eliot and Pound, Kenner turned to an enabling fiction about language that resembles the Franciscan model. Through language the gifted poet reveals "an intrinsic relation between palpable linguistic gestures and human tensions and actions" (<i>PEP,</i> 258). This proposition simply says that Pound's poems are faithful records of human concerns. Kenner makes no claim that something more is revealed, but invites us to consider that it might be. Following his chapter on "Seeing" in <i>The Poetry of Ezra Pound,</i> Kenner mentions "metaphysical implications which we have not space to go into" (<i>PEP,</i> 87). One plausible implication is that Pound's verse, and 

<b></b>

the best modernist writing, is based on a perception that language can reveal truth about the universe, because the universe, language, and humankind evolve from a divine dispensation.
</p>

<p>
His continuing considerations of Eliot indicate that Kenner has a transcendent theological implication in mind. As we have seen in "Eliot's Moral Dialectic," Kenner perceives Eliot as a Christian poet centrally preoccupied with dramatizing spiritual states. By 1954, when Kenner reviewed <i>The Cocktail Party</i> and <i>The Confidential Clerk,</i> the core of Eliot's concern no longer looked so Christian. Kenner noticed that "Mr. Eliot's characteristic poetry" suggests "language autonomously discovering within itself potentialities of suggestion of which it is commonly unaware."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  The "potentialities" may be Christian, or just religious, but Kenner does not insist on this point. By far the most interesting discussion striking a new note about Eliot comes shortly after <i>The Invisible Poet,</i> whenKenner reviews Eliot's last play, <i>The Elder Statesman.</i> Startlingly, Kenner sees the play as reflecting the circumstances of Eliot's life.
</p>

<p>
He identifies the "tension of <i>The Elder Statesman . . .</i> in the very idea of human privacy, . . . a tension between" a privacy "which withholds itself behind a r&#x000F4;le and one day withers into a ghost . . . and the blessed sort which can give itself into communion with another person precisely because it <i>is</i> a privacy, . . . and not an interfering determination to make its existence felt."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  In 1949 the tension informing Eliot's verse for Kenner was a struggle between language and unnamable (except as paradox or metaphor) spiritual truth. Now the struggle is between one mode of the individual and another. Kenner calls the play the "most intimate of his works," pointing to "the lyric dedication . . . to his wife" ("FOV," 40). By implication, Eliot's late marriage has at least partly freed him from the danger of living only in a role, only as a prepared face. Eliot has achieved in the play something wiser and more precious than he had in his poems, which "he conceives in some psychic center where the obscure phatic sensations of his own voice take their origin" ("FOV," 36). Eliot as poet is fundamentally unattached to other people, but Eliot as dramatist eventually liberates himself from the closed world of his poems. He achieves an aesthetic form that frees him from Bradleyan incarceration, "set free from the lyric flame by writing for other voices, not knowing whose voices they will be" ("FOV," 40). Unlocking Eliot's major verse is not consideration of Christian paradox but awareness of incoherent private sensations. The "blessed" communion with another continues the Franciscan tinge to Kenner's thought. To be isolated in one's self is to be removed from others, creation at large, and God. The movement outward from one's self towards others constitutes salvation, or the potential to be saved, with language as a vehicle that can take us outside ourselves. For Kenner, this was a truth Pound knew early, and which Eliot learned late.
</p>

<p>
A quasi-Franciscan conception of language is in keeping with Kenner's critical method. Language as a vehicle that can carry the self away from immurement in privacy can also save ossified forms of thought. The key modernists for Kenner are artists possessing a keen sense of how language&#x02014;prose or verse&#x02014;in the nineteenth century became a self-contained field, a well-regulated, seemingly comprehensive discourse that had drifted away from the real. Hence Kenner celebrates Joyce for focusing "on 

<b></b>

what was actually there" (<i>DJ,</i> 11). Language proves itself by adhering to the larger, more complex mode of being called the "real." Kenner cites Pound's praise of Dante's "precision," which "comes from the attempt to reproduce exactly the thing which has been clearly seen" (<i>PEP,</i> 59). The "thing" may be an object, a person, a value, an idea, or a style. But without a conception of language as an instrument adequate to handle all these "things," the empirical ability to discern them is pointless. The flexibility, breadth, potential, and saving grace Kenner attributes to language point, if not obviously to a divine creator, to something one might just as well call divinity.

My curiosity about the origins and literary uses of this carefully observed, and carefully invented, Africanist presence has become an informal study of what I call American Africanism. It is an investigation into the ways a nonwhite, Africanlike (or Africanist) presence or persona was constructed in the United States, and the imaginative uses this fabricated presence served. I am using the term 'Africanism' . . . as a term for the denotative and connotative blackness that African peoples have come to signify, as well as the entire range of views, assumptions, readings, and misreadings that accompany Eurocentric learning about these people.

&#x02014;Toni Morrison<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
In <i>Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination,</i> Toni Morrison explores the singular role that black characters have played, not only in the American literary canon, but in the nation's very understanding of itself. White authors have historically used dark bodies to articulate and address a multiplicity of anxieties and fantasies, all of them as complex as they are contradictory in nature. What do white American writers say about themselves in their representations of black people? This question, only one among many Morrison addresses in <i>Playing in the Dark,</i> is compelling, and like most fascinating questions, it begs others, among them: in what ways have <i>white</i> characters historically served <i>black</i> authors? Despite rapid developments in whiteness studies, whose very premise is based upon the urgent necessity for interrogations of whiteness, this question appears only infrequently on the scholarly landscape.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  In this essay, I will not attempt to resolve this prodigious quandary conclusively, but 

<b></b>

rather to offer some thoughts on the matter by way of an exploration of white characters in two prominent Harlem Renaissance novels, <i>The Blacker the Berry</i>  by Wallace Thurman and <i>Passing</i>  by Nella Larsen.
</p>

<p>
I use the Harlem Renaissance, or the New Negro Movement, as my focus <i>because</i> of the particular significance of its place in African American literary and cultural history. Today, scholars are given to questioning the disproportionate amount of attention traditionally paid to the Harlem Renaissance by the publishing industry. The fact that it was not an organic movement but a "forced phenomenon," in the words of David Levering Lewis, does not, in my view, undermine its undeniable importance in African American cultural history.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  In fact, as J. Martin Favor suggests in <i>Authentic Blackness,</i> the methods by which African American artists and intellectuals went about rewriting African American identity for public consumption during this period are, in their very self-consciousness, instructive.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Attempts to reconstruct the black self were not invented during the Harlem Renaissance, but became central to African American cultural discourse "almost as soon as blacks could write," Henry Louis Gates, Jr. explains.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  This essay uses the Harlem Renaissance as its locus because it is the first moment in which public discussions about the representation of black people in fiction reach a crisis point. African American artists and intellectuals during this period disagreed passionately about how the Negro should be portrayed in art, to paraphrase the title of the 1926 <i>Crisis</i> symposium. The symposium "The Negro in Art: How Shall He Be Portrayed?" does not include queries about white characters, but white characters in black fiction are charged with tasks as central to the projects of black-authored novels as are black characters. In addition, because of the public controversy over black characterization during the Harlem Renaissance, I would like to argue, it is to white characters that we should look to understand even more fully the complexity of the missions undertaken by black-authored books during this movement.
</p>

<p>
Harlem Renaissance authors used literature as a means of self-creation. The New Negro movement, as a whole, set before itself the formidable task of reconstructing "the very <i>idea</i> of who and what a Negro was or could be" ("T," 148). If literature was such a significant part of this racial reinvention, then why use white characters at all?<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Why were they necessary? White characters had specific functions in black-authored fiction of the Harlem Renaissance. Most practically, they served to authenticate fictional representations of the New Negro movement. Ironically, an accurate, authentic, if you will, representation of Harlem life during the New Negro Renaissance demanded the inclusion of white people. White go-seers were often annoying and sometimes predatory, but Harlem spaces were swarming with them&#x02014;they were everywhere and largely unavoidable. Like speakeasies, race uplift balls, and passionate discussions about the future of "the race," white characters are staple features in narrative portraits of the Harlem Renaissance.
</p>

<p>
The wide spectrum of the white presence in New Negro fiction bears examination. Most Harlem Renaissance fiction contains white characters; many of them tend to be obnoxious, if not outright loathsome, and prominent among these undesirables are whites whose intentions toward Harlem are purely exploitative or otherwise threatening.

<b></b>

However, significantly among these unsavory types are other white characters, who "unlike many others" (as such a character is described in <i>The Blacker the Berry</i>), have something useful to offer the black people he encounters. Harlem Renaissance authors invented white characters that were not only symbols of resented white presence in Harlem, but also <i>counterpoints</i> to unwanted white interlopers who, by the time these books were written, had firmly insinuated themselves into Harlem life&#x02014;particularly Harlem night life. Consequently, literary landscapes were as much a means to punish and control harmful white ways in Harlem, as they were opportunities to construct ideal white intimates, equals across the color line, useful in the New Negro enterprise to re-construct the black self. It is theretofore as striking as it is important that exceptional white characters in Harlem Renaissance fiction exist to serve black characters. These characters do their most important work as mediators in relationships between black characters. Discussions about race and sex that dominate the critical work on both <i>The Blacker the Berry</i> and <i>Passing</i> are only enriched when we examine the roles played by two exceptional white male characters in bringing the major conflicts in both books to a head. In order to assess the significance of interracial dynamics in these novels, however, we must first appreciate the intraracial conflicts that constitute the central themes in both narratives.
</p>

<p>
"Why <i>had</i> her mother married a black man? Surely there had been some eligible brown-skinned men around."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  From the opening pages of <i>The Blacker the Berry,</i> readers are invited to consider the relationship between sex and color&#x02014;not race, at least not initially. Importantly, it is not her race that Emma Lou bemoans, but her color: "Not that she minded being black, being a Negro necessitated having a colored skin, but she did mind being too black" (<i>BB,</i> 21). The darkness of Emma Lou's skin is ironic; it bears an inverse relationship to the degree of her actual race pride. In the early chapters, we see Emma Lou as a victim of the color prejudice in which her environment is steeped: "It was an acquired family characteristic, this moaning and grieving over the color of her skin" (<i>BB,</i> 21). But ultimately, readers are meant to understand that Emma Lou perpetuates the same anti-black prejudice of which she herself has been a victim. Will Emma Lou triumph over the odds she faces as both a victim of racism as well as a perpetrator of it? The resolution of her conflict will turn on, and be measured through, her relationship with two exceptional white male characters.
</p>

<p>
Thurman's intention to expose the ironies of intraracial color prejudice is evident from the opening lines of the book, when Emma Lou's skin color is presented as the root of her family's unhappiness and a target of her community's cruelty. In Emma Lou's world, "it was the custom always of those with whom she came into most frequent contact to ridicule or revile any black person or object" (<i>BB,</i> 24). Since childhood, Emma Lou has been derided by playmates, and her mother, Jane, has been bombarded with remedies purporting to discharge the blackness from her daughter's skin: "'Try some lye, Jane, it may eat it out. She can't look any worse'" (<i>BB,</i> 32). Jane fields these kinds of comments routinely, often within earshot of Emma Lou. Even Emma Lou's one source of comfort, her Uncle Joe, sports a picture on his bedroom wall of a "pickanniny" splayed out "like a fly in a pan of milk and a white expanse of bedclothes"(<i>BB,</i> 22).

To Jane, the problem of Emma Lou's skin color is intimately connected with gender. "'Oh, if you had only been a boy!'" Jane continually laments (<i>BB,</i> 34). The reader is relieved and hopeful when Jane relents to Uncle Joe's entreaties that Emma Lou should be allowed to leave Boise and attend the University of Southern California in Los Angeles where, "he reasoned, she would find a larger and more intelligent social circle" (<i>BB,</i> 34). Like Uncle Joe, the reader imagines that a more cosmopolitan, intellectual environment will at least provide Emma Lou with some reprieve from the seemingly constant assaults on her self-worth that she has been forced to navigate in her hometown.
</p>

<p>
The first white people in <i>The Blacker the Berry</i> are indistinguishable but hardly insignificant. Emma Lou is the lone black student in her high school; the first white characters comprise the mass of her peers. In the opening scenes of Emma Lou's high school graduation, white presence is implied if not actualized: Emma Lou sits in a row of "pale-faced graduates" and feels the stares of white audience members who must not have known that "Emma Lou Morgan was Boise high school's only nigger student" (<i>BB,</i> 23). When Emma Lou arrives in Los Angeles to attend USC, white characters are again present mainly to represent the "white normative gaze," a depersonalized, forbidding, constraining white presence whose sudden force in Emma Lou's consciousness is coincident with the introduction of another black character, Hazel Watson.
</p>

<p>
"'My feet are sure some tired!'" Hazel Watson says by way of an introduction (<i>BB,</i> 39). A native of Prairie Valley, Texas, Hazel owes her opportunity to attend college as well as her new Stutz roadster to the newly discovered oil resources on her father's property. Emma Lou is humiliated by Hazel's presence, and outraged that such a person would address her as an equal. What exactly is wrong with Hazel? She says "is" when the rules of grammar call for "are"; she wears flashy clothes; she is loud; and, perhaps most important to Emma Lou, she "did not seem to know . . . that Negroes could not afford to be funny in front of white people." In fact, Emma Lou believes that "Negroes must always be sober and serious in order to impress white people" (<i>BB,</i> 55). Emma Lou quickly dismisses Hazel Watson as a "typical southern darky" (<i>BB,</i> 42).
</p>

<p>
Until this point in the book, readers are inclined to be sympathetic to Emma Lou's friendless predicament. She has come to USC hungry for black faces, and we root for her to establish connections with other black students. But her attitude toward the first black student she encounters spoils the blameless portrait given us in the opening pages and reveals Emma Lou to be as prejudiced as the folks back home. The fact that Emma Lou's own response to Hazel is mediated through her experience of the depersonalized whiteness around her demonstrates how alienated Emma Lou is from her own sense of blackness. Even as abstractions, white characters are useful here to reveal Emma Lou's own hypocrisies and distorted racial ideals.
</p>

<p>
Emma Lou's self-censoring attitudes around white people are hardly unique within the context of the 1920s' discourse about race and representation. But against the backdrop of the rhetoric of New Negro ideology, Hazel's apparent lack of concern with what white people think is red by Thurman as the only admirable response to white hegemony. When Langston Hughes extols the virtues of "the low-down folks"

<p class="noIndent">
Hazel Watson's hip of gin effectively gets her kicked out of school; just before mid-term, faculty members advise Hazel to take a leave and try college again the following year. Hazel's role in the novel is brief but substantial. But finally, her job is <i>not</i> to represent the folk community lauded by Harlem Renaissance intellectuals, even though she is given to playing the "low-down blues" on the piano in the school gymnasium and is dismissed by dicty USC students who refer to her as "Topsy" (<i>BB,</i> 55&#x02013;6). Rather, Hazel Watson exists mainly to alienate the reader from Emma Lou, and her purpose recalls a commentary made by Thurman in the 1926 journal <i>Fire!!</i> about the "lamentable victims" that, as he saw it, dominated black characters in American fiction.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  With Emma Lou, Thurman has strayed far from pitiable caricature and given us, instead, a character about whom it is difficult to care at all. After her initial encounter with Hazel Watson, when Emma Lou encounters snubs because of her dark skin, the reader is given to wonder if it is her noxious personality, and not her blackness, that others find revolting. This conundrum will not be resolved until much later in the novel, when a white character modeled on Carl Van Vechten enables Emma Lou to find her way out of self-hatred and intraracial strife, and into a self-love that includes an acceptance of her dark skin.
</p>

<p>
But before encountering white characters with messages of self-love, Emma Lou navigates the thicket of ridicule and disgust that seems to confront her nearly every time she encounters other black people. Her most pivotal romantic relationship begins, in fact, as a result of her having been derogated by other blacks because of her dark skin. Emma Lou meets the most commanding object of her desire, Alva, after she has grudgingly agreed to accompany her employer, Arline Strange, and Strange's brother on an outing to the legendary Jazz club Small's Paradise. Strange, a white actress, is currently playing the role of a mulatto in the Broadway show, "Cabaret Gal." Strange's brother, well acquainted with the Negro section of Chicago, is eager to see if his sister's stage antics resemble anything he can find in Harlem. Small's is a let-down: "'Why there ain't nothing here but white people. Is it always like this?'" (<i>BB,</i> 107) Arline's brother's disappointment recalls the 1927 essay, "The Caucasian Storms Harlem," Rudolph Fisher's account of his experiences upon returning to Harlem after his residency in Washington, D.C. where he encountered nothing but white people during his visits to former haunts:

Fisher recounted wandering "in a daze" to different nightclubs&#x02014;including Small's&#x02014;and confronting the same phenomenon. He catalogued various black reactions to this change in the "complexion" of Harlem nightlife. The managers of Harlem cabarets, he reported, "don't hesitate to say that it is upon these predominant white patrons that they depend for their success" ("CSR," 115). The fact of black economic dependence on white patronage left black patrons like Fisher "frequently uncomfortable and out of place," as well as caught in a surreal reversal of traditional interracial interactions in Harlem. "Time was when white people went to Negro cabarets to see how Negroes acted; now Negroes go to these same cabarets to see how white people act," Fisher quipped ("CSR," 115).
</p>

<p>
In <i>The Blacker the Berry,</i> the atmosphere at Small's is exactly what Fisher narrated, and Emma Lou notices "in all that insensate crowd of dancing couples there were only a few Negroes" (<i>BB,</i> 107). Even as the well-lubricated evening wears on, and begins to feel "unrestrained," Emma Lou continues to remain "conscious of a note of artificiality, the same as she felt when she watched Arline and her fellow performers cavorting on the stage in 'Cabaret Gal'" (<i>BB,</i> 109&#x02013;110).
</p>

<p>
Arline Strange and her brother represent the more insidious variety of white people making eager appearances in Harlem in the 1920s. They symbolize the resented white presence that made it difficult for blacks like Fisher to feel at ease in Harlem by 1927. Arline and her brother are in Harlem to gape at black people, to seek "tonic and release," in the words of Nathan Huggins.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  If the siblings Strange are aware of the larger cultural complexities of race relations unfolding around them, they do not let this knowledge interfere with their nighttime pursuits. By day, Arline Strange "cavorts" as a mulatto on stage, when black actresses of all skin tones are having difficulty finding work.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  In her capacity as Arline's maid, Emma Lou is the black Harlem community personified, dependent upon white financial support, and helpless before its clout and caprices.
</p>

<p>
In the middle of this drunken evening, Emma Lou meets Alva, and is immediately impressed by his "smiling oriental-like face, neither brown nor yellow in color, but warm and pleasing beneath the soft lights" (<i>BB,</i> 111). He asks her to dance, and Emma Lou forgets that he has just emerged from a table of young men who were, only moments before, watching her and laughing. They dance, Emma "[glows] inside," and Alva eventually returns to his table. Before she leaves for the evening, Emma glances his way and is greeted by the stares of the young men, including Alva: "One of them said something and made a wry face. They all laughed, uproariously and cruelly" (<i>BB,</i> 112).
</p>

<p>
Emma neither storms out of the place in tears, nor angles over to the table to offer the hecklers a piece of her mind. Instead, she seems to forget the insult, and becomes obsessed with Alva, wandering all over Harlem, hoping to run into him. "He was her ideal," she decides. "He dressed well. His skin was such a warm and different color, and she had been tantalized by the mysterious slant and deepness of his oriental-like eyes" 

<b></b>

(<i>BB,</i> 124). Again, Emma Lou's own preference for light-skin and un-negroid features makes it difficult for readers to sympathize fully with her as much as it reveals how effectively white racism has taught her to hate the blackness in herself and others.
</p>

<p>
Readers are inclined, if not to like, then at least not to despise Alva, even though we learn that the only reason he finally returns her advances is to delude his friends into believing he doesn't actually mind their ribbing about Emma Lou (<i>BB,</i> 132). As their relationship progresses, however, we see how much Alva actually minds Emma Lou's dark skin. He does not take Emma Lou out among his friends because "he knew too well that he would be derided for his unseemly preference for 'dark meat,' and told publicly without regard for her feelings, that 'black cats must go'" (<i>BB,</i> 138). In order to placate Emma Lou's growing suspicions about his reluctance to show her off publicly, Alva invites Emma Lou along to a rent party that he plans to attend as a cicerone for a group of young Harlem writers and artists. As creative types, Alva reasons, this group "would be more or less free from the color prejudice exhibited by his other friends" (<i>BB,</i> 138). True to form, Emma Lou believes the setup; she responds to Alva's invitation with a certainty "that Alva loved her, certain that he was not ashamed or even aware of her dusky complexion" (<i>BB,</i> 139). Still, before the party, she goes through her beauty rituals, which included "applying various creams and cosmetics to her face in order to make her despised darkness less obvious" (<i>BB,</i> 139).
</p>

<p>
The scene that precedes the rent party, a gathering at Alva's house, is pivotal because it introduces an important white character, Ray Jorgenson. At the gathering we meet a group of Harlem writers: Cora Thurston (Zora Neale Hurston), Tony Crews (Langston Hughes), Mr. Paul (Bruce Nugent), and Truman Walter (Wallace Thurman). Perhaps here, among this enlightened bunch, Emma Lou will finally find community and solace, just as Alva has imagined. But as soon as Emma Lou enters the room, we see that she is ignorant of the cultural revolution going on around her (she has neither seen nor read Tony Crews's book) and uptight (she is "shocked to see that Mr. Paul's shirt was open at the neck and he was sadly in need of a haircut and shave" (<i>BB,</i> 141). But Emma Lou reveals the true degree of her philistinism when a white friend of the black writers, Ray Jorgenson, enters the room: "Emma Lou gaped, and was more bewildered than ever. All of this silly talk and drinking, and now&#x02014;here was a white man!" (<i>BB,</i> 142) Unsettled initially by his simple presence, Emma Lou finds even more objectionable the frank conversation&#x02014;peppered with the word "nigger"&#x02014; about intra-racial prejudice that continues between the black artists unabated even after Jorgenson's entrance. "Such extraordinary people&#x02014;saying 'nigger' in front of a white man! Didn't they have any race pride or proper bringing up? Didn't they have any common sense?" (<i>BB,</i> 143) Antonio Gramsci defines the "common sense" Emma Lou advocates as "opposed to novelty and ultimately conservative."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  In the context of New Negro ideology, this kind of "common sense" is decidedly illogical and anti-progressive.
</p>

<p>
If Emma Lou's job in <i>The Blacker the Berry</i> is to symbolize the hypocrisy of traditional beauty standards, then this episode represents an attempt on the part of New Negro intellectuals to liberate black people from these harmful ideologies. Truman Walter takes center stage and delivers an impassioned speech condemning a news

<p>
In her distorted sense of reality, in her lack of "common sense," Emma Lou "couldn't comprehend all of this talk . . . She wasn't sure that they weren't all poking fun at her" (<i>BB,</i> 147). This could have been a moment of Emma Lou's education and liberation, but instead, she can only make sense of this new language through the vocabulary of suspicion and fear. The New Negro intellectuals offer Emma Lou an opportunity, but she interprets it as an insult. She is hopeless, the book seems to suggest.
</p>

<p>
Alva uses the Harlem intellectuals for the impression that he hopes their liberal intellectual attitudes will make on Emma Lou. In turn, the Harlem writers and artists are convinced that Alva's social fluidity at the rent party will grant them a measure of acceptance. They are correct&#x02014;up to a point. At the rent party, Alva easily navigates his way through the undulating bodies emitting "animal ecstasy" while the New Negroes cluster by the window, talking in "hushed, almost reverential tones" (<i>BB,</i> 148,149). There's only so much that Alva can do for them. As much as they want to distinguish themselves from the starchy black intellectuals who avoid these licentious scenes, they wear an alienation from their rent party counterparts that is as conspicuous as Paul's wardrobe. Their failure to integrate themselves into the scene can be read as Thurman's explicit critique of the New Negro Movement's outsized sense of its centrality to the greater Harlem community.
</p>

<p>
If Alva's presence fails to collapse the sociocultural distance between the New Negroes and the rent partiers, then the presence of a white man, Ray Jorgenson, comes much closer to this objective. Paul addresses Ray Jorgenson: "'Look at 'em all watching Ray.'" Truman Walter teases Ray: "'Tonight you're "passing." Here's a new wrinkle, white man "passes" for Negro'" (<i>BB,</i> 149).
</p>

<p>
Ray Jorgenson, who may or may not be modeled on Carl Van Vechten, emerges as central to this scene as a shield onto which these New Negro res deflect their own sense of discomfort in this alien environment. Ray is not just convenient but necessary: it is <i>solely</i> within the context of Ray's presence that these New Negro intellectuals feel at home. Only in relationship to Ray's status as a veritable outsider can they consider themselves insiders.
</p>

<p>
How does Ray Jorgenson feel about being watched? The subjective experience of this white man is unimportant to the story. The rent party scene forms an authentic counterpart to the scene at Small's, where Emma Lou was constantly aware that, even though it was after hours, she was with her white employer, and in Arline's eyes only "a Negro and a hired maid." At Small's, the comfort of whites dominated Emma Lou's consciousness as much as it did that of the black wait staff and the performers. At the 

<b></b>

rent party, however, a "swarm" of "lewd bodies" undulated in "animal ecstasy," liberated, at least temporarily, from the expectancy on white faces. This scene in <i>The Blacker the Berry</i> reverses the typical dynamic between whites and blacks in Harlem, empowering black characters with the normative gaze that is habitually trained on them.
</p>

<p>
In this "authentic" space, Emma Lou experiences something of a spiritual/sexual awakening and becomes "very fluid, very elastic" (<i>BB,</i> 149). Even though the cabaret scene rang false to Emma Lou and her white escorts, she still "forgot herself" and gaped and giggled. At the rent party, however, she has to restrain herself from "flying into an emotional frenzy." Here, we learn that Emma Lou is not only a symbol of the annihilating effects of racism, but a complex subject, with nuanced desires and real capacities for self-expression. All is not lost, we see here. But it will take a final white character to help Emma Lou transform herself into a self-respecting individual.
</p>

<p>
By the end of <i>The Blacker the Berry,</i> Emma Lou has come to believe that she has been the main source of her own unhappiness, although she had been heretofore "too obtuse to accept it." In the last pages she realizes "what a complete fool she has been. It was clear to her that she had exercised the same discrimination against her men and the people she wished for friends that they had exercised against her&#x02014;and with less reason." It takes two white characters to reveal the distance that Emma Lou has traveled. If Emma Lou is the "complete fool" she describes above when she meets Ray Jorgenson, then her interaction with another white man, Campbell Kitchen, both marks and occasions the full extent of her personal transformation. The final white character in <i>The Blacker the Berry</i> is the canvas onto which Emma Lou fashions a new sense of self.
</p>

<p>
Emma Lou comes to know Campbell Kitchen once she begins working for his wife, Clere Sloane. When Emma Lou's employer, Arline Strange, decides to go to Europe, she arranges for Emma Lou to have a job with Sloane, "a former stage beauty who had married a famous American writer and retired from public life," much like Carl Van Vechten's wife, Fania Marinoff (<i>BB,</i> 185). These similarities and others encourage readers to make an association between Kitchen and Carl Van Vechten. Thurman explicitly equates the two men: "Campbell Kitchen, along with Carl Van Vechten, was one of the leading spirits in this 'Explore Harlem: Know the Negro' crusade" (<i>BB,</i> 186). Importantly, Kitchen, "unlike many others," was "sincere," and used his cultural capital to champion spirituals in the mainstream press, to publicize unknown blues singers, and to promote "younger Negro writers," personally carting their work to publishers and editors (ibid). Like Carl Van Vechten, Kitchen has written a book about Harlem that, in Thurman's assessment, "had been a literary failure because the author presumed that its subject matter demanded serious treatment" (<i>BB,</i> 187).
</p>

<p>
Thurman's language here recalls his prose in "Fire Burns: Department of Comment," an essay that appears on the final pages of <i>Fire!!,</i> in which Thurman defends Van Vechten and his 1926 novel, <i>Nigger Heaven,</i> and castigates black critics of both&#x02014;the "Harlem intelligentsia"&#x02014;for their "inherent stupidity" (<i>F,</i> 47). Thurman wanted his readers to understand, not only his position on Van Vechten and <i>Nigger Heaven,</i> but also his attitudes about a multiplicity of issues, including censorship and racial parochialism in 

<b></b>

literature. After <i>Nigger Heaven</i> appeared in 1926, black writers used Van Vechten as a shorthand and articulated their positions on these and other issues by defending or condemning Van Vechten and his infamous Harlem novel.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  In <i>The Blacker the Berry,</i> Campbell Kitchen served essentially the same purpose for Thurman.
</p>

<p>
In addition, Thurman uses Kitchen as a vehicle to underscore Emma Lou's former parochialism which led her to expect, in Kitchen, "a sneering, obscene cynic, intent upon ravaging every Negro woman and insulting every Negro man." Instead, Emma Lou finds him to be "such an ordinary, harmless individual that she was won over to his side almost immediately" (<i>BB,</i> 187). Emma Lou becomes not only a fan but also a disciple of Kitchen's when she discovers that he knew more about Negro life "than she or any other Negro she had ever met." Her talks with Campbell lead her to take stock of herself: "Was she supersensitive about her color?" (ibid) Campbell invites her to use his library and supplies her with tickets to musical concerts and the theater. After some time, and much more drama with Alva, Emma begins to subscribe to Kitchen's belief that "every one must find salvation within one's self" (<i>BB,</i> 216). Kitchen's words mirror those her Uncle Joe used to say to her back in Boise when he, then her only champion, would tell her "as long as one was a Negro, one's specific color had little to do with one's life. Salvation depended upon the individual" (<i>BB,</i> 35). Now that, through Kitchen, she has rediscovered and enlarged upon Uncle Joe's wisdom, Emma Lou might begin to release all of the demons that have long plagued her.
</p>

<p>
Campbell accomplishes much for a character without any speaking parts. Indeed, in the course of the book's narrative, the volubility of white men consistently diminishes. First, it is upon Arline Strange's brother's vocal insistence that we venture to Small's; then, Ray Jorgenson is verbal but hardly outspoken before and during the rent party scene; and finally, Campbell Kitchen is represented, not as a commanding subject, but as a sum of his encouragements, achievements, and aphorisms. Kitchen's single most important vocation in <i>The Blacker the Berry</i> is to serve as a barometer of Emma Lou's internal changes. It is through her relationship with Kitchen that we see the distance Emma Lou has traveled since her first day at USC, when white people only existed for her as an inhibiting, proscriptive, faceless mass.
</p>

<p>
Despite the book's multiple weaknesses, <i>The Blacker the Berry's</i> complex rendering of white characters is instructive, particularly with regard to its historical context in early-twentieth-century Harlem where the relationship between whites and blacks formed such a source of controversy within black intellectual discourse. Traditionally, scholarship on this book has looked elsewhere for the narrative's significance: David Levering Lewis, for example, concludes that "Emma Lou . . . stands for those Afro-Americans in whom the obsession with respectability extinguishes personality and self-respect&#x02014;those for whom the least evidence of white influence is revered" (<i>WHV</i> 237). If Thurman begins <i>The Blacker the Berry</i> with the intention of exposing black people who are obsessed with whiteness, then this intention is, at the very least, confused by the novel's resolution, in which a white man enables Emma Lou to love her blackness. Lewis connects Thurman's novel to his ambitions with <i>Fire!!</i>: "The aesthetics of <i>Fire!!,</i> in which the real resource of Afro-America resides in honest, noisy common 

<b></b>

folk and its unconventional artists, inspires Thurman's novel on every page" (<i>WHV,</i> 237). The aesthetics of <i>Fire!!</i> which actually crackle on the pages of <i>The Blacker the Berry</i> are inextricably intertwined with Thurman's belief in the utility of cultivating beneficial relationships with whiteness. The presumably "honest, noisy common folk," as represented in Hazel Watson and the rent party attendees, are merely backdrops to this larger issue.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, in Larsen's <i>Passing</i> color and sex create conflicts that are articulated and resolved partially through the vehicle of white characters. An important white character, Jack Bellew, Clare Kendry's racist husband, rarely makes an appearance in critical work on the novel, despite the fact that he is responsible&#x02014; either directly or indirectly &#x02013;for his wife's defenestration at the end of the story. Another white character who is, arguably, more significant than Bellew, also receives relatively little scholarly attention&#x02014;Hugh Wentworth. In her critical work on <i>Passing,</i> Deborah E. McDowell has argued that Irene Redfield's delusions result in her failure to see the hypocrisies inherent in her beliefs about race and class.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  McDowell is not alone among Larsen scholars who routinely overlook the role Wentworth plays in exposing these unsettling truths about Irene. Wentworth is a primary lens through which we see aspects of Irene that she is unwilling to recognize in herself. But before I discuss the crucial roles played by Bellew and Wentworth, I would like to begin with the invisible whiteness that hovers over the opening scenes of <i>Passing.</i>
</p>

<p>
The first signs of whiteness in the novel are powerful in their very absence. In the scene of the first encounter between Irene and Clare, Irene moves easily on the crowded streets of Chicago as she shops for her sons, the sweltering heat, not racism or colorism&#x02014;the issues that jump start <i>The Blacker the Berry</i>&#x02014;her only preoccupation. When she starts to faint, a taxi driver conveniently appears and "jumps out and guides her to his car," nearly lifting her inside. "The Drayton, ma'am?" he suggests respectfully. On the roof of the Drayton hotel, Irene has the sensation of "being wafted upward on a magic carpet to another world, pleasant, quiet, and strangely remote from the sizzling one that she had left below."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Privacy, safety, and comfort on demand&#x02014;this is the stuff of white privilege. Irene's happy bubble is nearly burst when she spots a woman's intent gaze upon her. She muses, "Did that woman, could that woman, somehow know that here before her very eyes on the roof of the Drayton sat a Negro?" (<i>QP,</i> 150) Suddenly, Irene is jolted out of her fantasy to confront the reality of racism, and the all too real possibility of being ejected from the Drayton. Her sense of privilege is exposed as a fragile ruse, made possible only because others fail to perceive her racial identity. Irene is powerless before the whiteness all around her whose threatening force has been distracted momentarily by the apparition of racial homogeneity.
</p>

<p>
This scene is crucial because it sets up one of the most important features of this narrative, which is Irene's hypocrisy. As McDowell explains, "Ironically, detail for detail, she manifests the same faults of which she so harshly accuses Clare" ("I," xxv). Irene condemns Clare for passing, yet in this early scene, we see that our unreliable narrator passes for white herself when it is convenient. Not only does Larsen expose Irene's lack of credibility in this scene, she also reminds readers that on the borders of 

<b></b>

the psychological drama in which we are about to be immersed is a larger white world from whose oppressive power light-skinned characters are ultimately not anymore immune than the dark-skinned Emma Lou Morgan. The same proscriptive white presence that determines Emma Lou's initial response to Hazel Watson in <i>The Blacker the Berry</i> lurks at the margins of Irene's fantasy at the Drayton, only to be personified and mobilized pages later through the instrument of Jack Bellew.
</p>

<p>
Jack Bellew's role in <i>Passing</i> is undeniably meaningful. As I have stated, his racist attitudes play a central role in Clare's death. In addition, Larsen uses Jack Bellew to underscore how, again, even in the most privileged and exclusive of environments, black people are never free from the power of the white normative gaze. After all, the entire direction of the novel turns, not upon the kind of catastrophic violence that begets the ending, but on a simple glance from Bellew. Irene happens to be walking with her brown-skinned friend Felise Freeland one day when she encounters Bellew, who has been until this moment ignorant of his wife's actual racial identity. As he regards the women, Irene "was sure, now of the understanding in his face, as he looked at her again and then back at Felise" (<i>QP,</i> 226). Irene appreciates the dangerous implications of his knowing look, and yet she refuses to warn Clare, thus setting in motion the novel's tragic denouement.
</p>

<p>
Bellew is also useful for what he helps illuminate about Irene. In the middle of the scene in which he repeatedly, if unknowingly, verbally assaults his wife's guests by harping on his antipathy for "niggers," Irene "had to concede that under other conditions she might have liked him" (<i>QP,</i> 173). It's hard to imagine any circumstances under which anyone, black or white, could find likable a man who insists that Negroes give him "the creeps," and refers to them as "black scrimy devils" (<i>QP,</i> 172). Does Irene imagine that, if circumstances should transform her into a white woman, she would enjoy his racist diatribe? Here, again, Irene reveals the hollowness at the root of her race consciousness. With alarming ease, Irene puts his racism aside and assesses Bellew on his superficial merits: "A fairly good-looking man of amiable disposition, evidently, and in easy circumstances" (<i>QP,</i> 172&#x02013;3). Jack Bellew may be a toxic force <i>in</i> the novel but he is productive <i>for</i> the novel as another means of exposing the extent of Irene's contradictions.
</p>

<p>
Significantly, in a novel whose atmosphere is permeated with the deadly apprehension created by Jack Bellew, we are given another white male character possessing an altogether different purpose in Irene's world. Nella Larsen wrote to Carl Van Vechten on 7 March 1927: "Heaven forbid that I should ever be bitten by the desire to write another novel! Except, perhaps, one to dedicate to you." When she finished <i>Passing,</i> which she did dedicate to Van Vechten and his wife Fania Marinoff, Larsen announced in a letter to Van Vechten that she had finished "[his] novel."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
At first glance, Hugh Wentworth, like Campbell Kitchen in <i>The Blacker the Berry,</i> seems to serve only as an opportunity for homage. Awestruck, Clare Kendry calls him "<i>the</i> Hugh Wentworth" (<i>QP,</i> 198). An irreverent writer, Hugh is also a certified adventurer, wanderer, a veritable renaissance man. Unlike Hugh Wentworth, Carl Van Vechten never "lived on the edges of nowhere in at least three continents," and

these distinctions constitute the basis of Kathleen Pfeiffer's argument in <i>Passing and American Individualism</i> that Van Vechten is not the model for Wentworth.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  I agree with Pfeiffer that Wentworth is hardly an exact replica of Van Vechten, but I do not believe that specific dissimilarities undermine what may have been Larsen's objective, which was to utilize what Van Vechten symbolized&#x02014;a celebrated, exceptional white man in Harlem&#x02014;to her own literary advantage in the re of Wentworth.
</p>

<p>
Irene's attitude toward Wentworth reveals more important information about her. When Clare asks her if she was just speaking with "<i>the</i> Hugh Wentworth," Irene lets show "a tiny, triumphant smile" (<i>QP,</i> 198). Irene enjoys the fact that her privilege as an educated, well-to-do black woman has enabled her to secure the friendship of this famous white man. She encourages and enables Hugh's fascination with blackness, even though she is well-aware that the curiosity of whites like him will have a negative effect on the black community:

This, Irene told her, was the year 1927 in the city of New York, and hundreds of white people of Hugh Wentworth's type came to affairs in Harlem, more all the time. So many that Brian had said: 'Pretty soon the coloured people won't be allowed in at all, or will have to sit in Jim Crowed sections.'

<p class="noIndent">
Rather than criticize Wentworth for desiring access to black spaces, Irene participates in and encourages his curiosity. She arranges for him to have his seat of choice at the dance for the Negro Welfare League, an event for which she is chairperson of the ticket committee. Irene's role puts her in the position of veritable gatekeeper at this high profile event. Her relationship to this group is another of this book's wonderfully wicked ironies, because, finally, the only Negro whose welfare Irene expresses concern for is herself.
</p>

<p>
Because she values Hugh's celebrity, Irene is uncritical of his tendency to objectify black people. Standing side by side at the dance, they speculate together on the stereotype of white female fascination for dark black men. Irene suggests that its root lies in "the sort of thing you feel in the presence of something strange, and even, perhaps, a bit repugnant to you" (<i>QP,</i> 205). In this scene Irene reveals herself to be every bit as voyeuristic as Hugh. She claims an authority here on race matters because of Hugh's outsider status. Irene encourages Hugh's racial speculations because they allow her to share privileged information about race to an outsider; ultimately, this confirms her own sense of herself as privileged and powerful. It is through Hugh that Irene enjoys her status as an insider in this scene. Hugh's "act of looking," to borrow a phrase from cultural critic Andrew Lakritz, partially constitutes Irene's sense of identity.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  While Irene "found it hard to sympathize with this new tenderness, this avowed yearning of Clare's for 'my own people,'" she encourages Hugh to ogle black faces and bodies at the N.W.L. dance (<i>QP,</i> 182). While Clare has to beg before Irene grudgingly sanctions her attendance at the dance, Wentworth seems to have a standing invitation to important black community events.
</p>

<p>
Further, Hugh Wentworth plays an important role in <i>Passing</i> as a screen onto which Irene projects her mounting anxiety that Brian, her husband, and Clare are having 

<b></b>

an affair. Irene begins to find her husband's behavior mysterious. Suddenly, he seems to her like a "man marking time," although she doesn't know why (<i>QP,</i> 214). Finally, on the day that she has organized a party in honor of Wentworth, Irene intuits the "truth" of his affair with Clare during a private conversation with Brian shortly before the guests arrive. While the party is in motion, it is literally through Hugh's eyes that Irene gathers the proof she needs to confirm her suspicions.
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Across the room was Hugh. He wasn't Irene hoped, being too bored. He seemed as he always did . . . And as usual he was hovering before the book-shelves. But he was not, she noticed, looking at the book he had taken down. Instead, his dull amber eyes were held by something across the room . . . For a minute Irene hesitated, then turned her head, though she knew what it was that held Hugh's gaze. Clare, who had suddenly clouded all her days. Brian, the father of Ted and Junior.

</div>

<p>
Irene sees a "scornful" expression in Hugh's eyes, which does not surprise her, since she believes Hugh "had never cared for Clare Kendry," anyway (ibid). But actually, Hugh never expresses anything like disdain for Clare. In fact, at the N.W.L. dance, he is virtually fixated on her, and pesters Irene about her racial identity. "What I'm trying to find out is the name, status, and race of the blonde beauty out of the fairy tale," Hugh tells Irene (<i>QP,</i> 204&#x02013;5). Instead of telling Hugh the truth about Clare, she teases him with the question, dangling in front of him the fact of her own information about the object of his fascination. As much as Clare frustrates her, Irene finds her useful here as a means of holding the interest of her famous white friend.
</p>

<p>
The scene in which Hugh performs the role of a screen for Irene's anxieties begins with Irene informing Brian that Hugh Wentworth finds Clare unintelligent and boring (<i>QP,</i> 216). What motivates Irene to believe that Hugh harbors negative feelings toward Clare? Hugh's antagonistic feelings exist only in Irene's imagination.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  She freely distorts his actual sentiments because he has little purpose in the novel aside from his role as a projection of Irene's fantasies. Hugh belongs to Irene in the novel; he is a device she uses to construct meaning in her world. It is through Hugh's vision that Irene's "unseeing eyes" finally lose their scales, and she is forced to recognize the "truth" about the relationship between Brian and Clare (<i>QP,</i> 218). Whether the two actually have an affair or Irene invents this ruse to protect herself from her own errant sexual desires, Irene's complex psychological maneuverings in <i>Passing</i> require the mediation of Hugh Wentworth.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Later in this scene, Wentworth is the literal embodiment of Irene's conscience. Watching Clare enchant yet another woman's husband, "rage boiled up in her," and she drops her coffee cup, which shatters to the floor. The room is silent. With all eyes on her, Irene suddenly finds Hugh Wentworth "miraculously at her side" (<i>QP,</i> 221). He begins to take the blame for her broken cup and apologizes for pushing her, an act they both know is a cover-up. Irene refuses Hugh's help&#x02014;coyly, she protests that she broke the cup deliberately&#x02014;but the "power of his discernment" amazes and frustrates her. "Damn Hugh!" Irene thinks. "She couldn't, it seems, help his knowing . . . But she could and would keep him from knowing that she knew." Irene's overwhelming impulse is to 

<b></b>

suppress Hugh's knowledge as she has suppressed her own. "Something would have to be done about him. Now" (<i>QP,</i> 221). Irene views Hugh's awareness as so dangerous to her image that it is frankly amazing that he does not, like Clare, wind up on the pavement by the novel's end. He may not take a fateful plunge from the window, but Hugh is effectively dismissed here. After this scene, he is erased from Irene's life as neatly as if he had never existed except as a ent of her imagination. Hugh's ambiguous status as both outsider and insider lends itself neatly to Irene's manipulation. His dependence serves her purposes&#x02014;and the larger narrative of <i>Passing</i>&#x02014;perfectly.

In this essay I have attempted to illuminate the significance of a largely underdiscussed but eminently curious feature of Harlem Renaissance fiction: exceptional white characters. My discussion has sought to shed some light on two popular Harlem Renaissance novels whose objectives, in part, were to transform the constant, diffuse spectre of whiteness in black lives into a manageable entity that could be manipulated for various purposes in these narratives. I have attempted to carry out a version of Toni Morrison's project in <i>Playing in the Dark</i> which she describes as an effort "to avert the critical gaze from the racial object to the racial subject; from the described and imagined to the describers and imaginers; from the serving to the served" (<i>PD,</i> 90). I have therefore focused on representations of whiteness in both <i>The Blacker the Berry</i> and <i>Passing</i> in order to examine how, in both novels, white bodies serve black stories.
</p>

<p>
If these white characters are so important to Harlem Renaissance novels, why are they so infrequently discussed? A consistent and overwhelming imperative that dominates much of the critical work on the Harlem Renaissance is the recuperation of its blackness, which requires a corresponding denial of its inherent whiteness. George Hutchinson has pointed out the consistent erasure of whiteness in biographical work on Nella Larsen.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  I have argued elsewhere that anxieties about white influence in the Harlem Renaissance have led to a persuasive impulse to erase or diminish Carl Van Vechten's role in the movement. There are multiple historical reasons for such reactions to white influence, but finally, to deny the centrality of whiteness to this black movement is to misapprehend the movement itself.
</p>

<p>
"What is Africa to me?" Countee Cullen asked famously in his 1925 poem "Heritage"; the stanza containing this question serves as the epigraph to <i>Passing.</i><sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Like <i>The Blacker the Berry, Passing</i> is concerned with Africa not as a geographical entity, but as a metaphorical racial landscape whose import and significance African American authors grappled with urgently in creative work produced during the Harlem Renaissance. Cullen's question, in its numerous implications and variations, was not sufficiently answered during the Harlem Renaissance, and its resolution continues to be elusive. Historically, many of the implicit attempts that have been made to answer it have led only to more confusion and despair.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  I have not attempted here to address Cullen's expansive musing, but only to confuse things further by suggesting that another pertinent and equally knotty question lurks in the shadows of Cullen's query, a question 

<b></b>

Harlem Renaissance writers wrestled with continuously in their work but that scholars have consistently ignored, and that is: What is whiteness to me? May simple answers to these rich and enigmatic questions continue to elude us.

There were Harlem Renaissance authors who had no use for white characters.

It would be difficult not to make a connection here between the artistic circumstances of Arline Strange and the real-life opportunities offered white actresses but not black ones well into the 1940s. Ethel Barrymore appeared on Broadway in blackface in Julia Peterikin's <i>Scarlet Sister Mary,</i> for instance. Arnold Rampersad describes Rose McClendon's reaction: "McClendon's quiet revenge was to keep a scrapbook, which she shared with [Langston Hughes], of the many hostile reviews of Barrymore's performance."

Pfeiffer makes the provocative argument that Van Vechten shares more of a connection with Clare Kendry than with Wentworth. She argues that "both Van Vechten and Clare are cast as interlopers." In addition, she notes the parallels between Van Vechten's famous "addiction" to Negroes and Clare's hyperbolic passion for black Harlem. Even more, she writes, "one need only place the names Clare and Carl alongside each other to see their dramatic rhetorical similarity" (<i>RP,</i> 135). However convincing, this argument does not take into account the ambivalence Clare feels about her relationship to blackness. This ambivalence is central to Clare's identity and was never a feature in Van Vechten's own attitudes about African Americans. Even further, Pfeiffer argues, the famously irreverent, hedonistic Carl Van Vechten was "hardly the sort of a person who would appeal to Irene Redfield" (<i>RP,</i> 136). I would like to counter with the suggestion that if Hugh Wentworth's nighttime pursuits actually did resemble Van Vechten's own, Irene Redfield probably wouldn't know or care. As a woman either unable or unwilling to go beyond surfaces, Irene would be satisfied by her association with Hugh's celebrity alone, and simply ignore those aspects of his life that she found difficult to stomach.

The above title may provoke curiosity, perhaps skepticism, even incredulity. At the turn of our own century, we fail to recognize what these three movements&#x02014;persistently culturally defined as separate products of separate groups facing different historical contingencies&#x02014;might have had in common at the turn of the previous one. When our present historical memory includes contact between them at all, it usually stresses conflict rather than cooperation, whether in the Black-Irish tension of the movie "The Gangs of New York"; the poetry of Amiri Baraka libeling Jews as absent from the World Trade Center on September 11; or the tendency of the Irish Republican Army to align itself with the Palestine Liberation Organization. Prevalent historical, cultural, and aesthetic images of the recent past overwhelmingly feature antagonism between these separate groups. Yet as the novelist L. P. Hartley famously remarked in the prologue to his novel <i>The Go-Between</i> , "The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  The past, of course, pertains not only to an actual past, but to a knowable past, which is to say our constructions of the past. And the way we now construct the past of group relations differs so markedly from the way that the groups themselves previously constructed such relations that it calls into question the adequacy of what we think we know as a basis for present understanding and future action. I recognize the very real tensions that have existed among these groups, but maintain here that the antagonistic part of the story has been so stressed and even overstressed recently that it is time to recuperate the network of lost intergroup connections.

<p>
This essay is part of a broader project called <i>The Colors of Zion: Blacks, Jews, and Irish at the Turn of the Century</i> that seeks to recover such lost linkages in a Geertzian "thick description" which allows their members to speak for themselves. In brief, the three groups and their outside supporters regularly associated themselves with each other in a positive sense to a much larger degree than we now suppose, even as their external critics associated the groups with each other in a negative sense. For example, racist pseudo-scientists of the day regularly viewed Blacks, Jews, and Irish as inferior races and would jump from one to the other often on the same page or even in the same paragraph. More sympathetically, Black Nationalist thinkers often invoked the Zionist movement as a positive model for Africans or African Americans, and leading Zionists paid tribute to the leaders and strategists of Irish nationalism. My larger project begins with notions of races and diasporas and then proceeds to issues of nationalisms on the one hand and melting pots on the other before looking in turn at literature and images of the Irish Renaissance, Harlem Renaissance, and Jewish American Renaissance. Here, I focus on the evolution and interaction of various nationalisms, first from the mid-nineteenth century until the first decade of the twentieth, and then more briefly on the period immediately after World War I. After a framing of syncretic sympathies in Frederick Douglass and George Eliot, I invoke particularly W. B. Yeats, Douglas Hyde, and the more ambivalent James Joyce among Irish nationalists; Theodore Herzl and Israel Zangwill among Zionist leaders; and Edward Blyden, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Marcus Garvey among Pan-African advocates.

One road into the forgotten past begins with Douglass's tour of famine Ireland. This episode has been so thoroughly erased from current consciousness that after several years of lectures and discussions I have met almost no one in North America (and only a few more in Ireland) who knew that Douglass made a tour of famine Ireland. It is absent from such now canonical sources as <i>The Norton Anthology of American Literature</i> or <i>The Norton Anthology of Afro-American Literature,</i> the first of which fails to mention Douglass's trip altogether and the second of which misdescribes it as a tour of England. Nor does either reprint Douglass's moving accounts of his experiences there. Yet during late 1845 and early 1846 Douglass did make an anti-slavery lecture tour of what was then Britain, building momentum as he crossed Ireland and in Scotland en route to his culminating smash success in England. Along the way he contributed regular accounts of the tour to William Lloyd Garrison's fiery abolitionist journal <i>The Liberator,</i> which carried on its masthead at the time the motto "Our Country Is The World&#x02014;Our Countrymen All Mankind."
</p>

<p>
What Douglass said and wrote on the tour sounds even more surprising to us now than the fact that he barnstormed through the then British Isles at all. Far from distancing him or eliciting resentment, the degradation of Irish oppression astonished Douglass into a new outlook on the antislavery struggle. He wrote in one article:

Here you have an Irish hut or cabin, such as millions of the people of Ireland live in . . ., in much the same degradation as the American [Negro] slaves. I see much here to remind me of my former condition, and I confess I should be ashamed to lift my voice against American slavery, but that I know the cause of humanity is one the world over. He who really and truly feels for the American slave, cannot steel his heart to the woes of others; and he who thinks himself an abolitionist, yet cannot enter into the wrongs of others, has yet to find a true foundation for his anti-slavery faith.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>

Such a declaration, coming particularly from an African American ex-slave, startles us today, so foreign is it to both our justified view of the evils of American slavery and our less justified ignorance or silence about other oppressions. Yet Douglass's words and other similar pronouncements show how closely Irish and Black causes could resonate with each other in the nineteenth century, just as Douglass's incorporation of Psalm 137 in his searing 1852 speech "The Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro" invoked parallels to Jewish exile and enslavement:

How can we sing the Lord's song in a strange land? If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.

Douglass's linking of Black, Jewish, and Irish suffering and oppression was not exceptional for his age. Those connections form my subject here, particularly as they relate to nationalist and emancipatory projects. I proceed in turn to Irish, Jewish, and Black nationalisms, beginning with their affiliation in George Eliot's last major novel, <i>Daniel Deronda</i> , which foreshadows the themes of the following half-century.

What was the condition of the Jews in George Eliot's England, numbering as they did around forty thousand at the time? We forget that England was the last Western European country except for Spain and Portugal to grant full civil equality to Jews. Historically, there had been considerable progress since the slaughter of the Jews of York in 1190 by crusaders; the execution of eighteen Jews in Lincoln in 1255 on a ritual murder charge deriving from the legend of Little St. Hugh later memorialized by Chaucer; and the expulsion of all five thousand English Jews in 1290. Conditions had improved further since the Jewish readmission in 1660 and the debate about the so-called Jew Bill in the eighteenth century. Nonetheless, during the nineteenth century Jews still could not be elected to Parliament until 1858, graduate from universities until

1871, nor would they achieve full emancipation until 1890. Well aware of this history, Eliot wrote to her friend the American novelist Harriet Beecher Stowe shortly after publication of the novel:

As to the Jewish element in 'Deronda,' I expected from first to last in writing it, that it would create much stronger resistance and even repulsion than it has actually met with. But precisely because I felt that the usual attitude of Christians towards Jews is&#x02014;I hardly know whether to say more impious or more stupid when viewed in the light of their professed principles, I therefore felt urged to treat Jews with such sympathy and understanding as my nature and knowledge could attain to. Moreover, not only towards the Jews, but towards all oriental peoples with whom we English come in contact, a spirit of arrogance and contemptuous dictatorialness is observable which has become a national disgrace to us.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

In the later nineteenth century solutions to the problem of anti-Semitism began to oscillate between the same contrasting extremes of assimilation and a national state apparent today. Both poles appear in Eliot's novel. On one hand stands the proto-Zionism of Deronda and Mordecai, one more civic and liberal, the other more mystical and religious. On the other hand stands the assimilationism of the German-Jewish musician Klesmer, who "has cosmopolitan ideas . . . [and] looks forward to a fusion of races."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Eliot's sympathetic depiction of a range of Jewish characters and customs in the half of the novel centered on the Daniel-Mirah plot made the work's reception more problematic and controversial than the intricate psychologizing of the sections featuring Henleigh Grandcourt and Gwendolyn Harleth. The novel's embrace of a proto-Zionism is well known, but its association of that cause with Black and Irish ones is not.
</p>

<p>
References to African Americans, especially to the slave plantations of the West Indies and to the Civil War in the United States, dot the novel, though as often overlooked by the characters themselves as by readers. Eliot tells us at the start that Gwendolen "had no notion how her maternal grandfather got the fortune inherited by his two daughters" as a white plantation owner in the West Indies; and a few chapters later reiterates that it had never "occurred to her to inquire into the conditions of colonial property and banking, on which, as she had had many opportunities of knowing, the family fortune was dependent" (<i>DD,</i> 16, 53). These references culminate in the dispute between the gentile Grandcourt and the Jewish Deronda about the brutal suppression of the Jamaican slave rebellion by Governor Edward Eyre in 1865 that echoed throughout Victorian England: "Grandcourt held that the Jamaican Negro was a beastly sort of Baptist Caliban; Deronda said he had always felt a little with Caliban, who naturally had his own point of view and could sing a good song" (<i>DD,</i> 295). Deronda's sly inversion of the Caliban issue eerily preres a characteristic move of contemporary postcolonial theory in valorizing the subordinate other; here it tellingly reinforces the Black-Jewish connections of the novel's subtext. As Eliot's friendship with Harriet Beecher Stowe suggests, Eliot also inserted references to the American Civil War into this proto-Zionist novel. They, too, begin early in the novel, with the narrator's invocation of the "universal kinship" inspired by the war. Comparing

<b></b>

American women whose men died in that struggle with Englishmen thrown out of work in the cotton mills, the narrator describes the age as one "when women on the other side of the world would not mourn for the husbands and sons who died bravely in a common cause, and men stinted of bread on our side of the world heard of that willing loss and were patient" (<i>DD,</i>108). The analogies reach a crescendo near the end in Deronda's impassioned speech to Gwendolen on his commitment to "restoring a political existence to my people, making them a nation again, giving them a national center, such as the English have." Eliot interrupts that account to invoke "the dire clash of civil war" in the United States as a time when "submission of the soul to the Highest is tested" (<i>DD,</i> 730).
</p>

<p>
Just as <i>Daniel Deronda</i> calls up Jewish-Black associations of its time, so does it summon Jewish-Irish ones, even if of an occasionally stereotypical sort. When the supreme Jewish musician Klesmer reverts to Germanic intonations, the narrator immediately provides the simile "as Irishmen resume their strongest brogue when they are fervid or quarrelsome" (<i>DD,</i> 39). The links can be sexual as well as political: Grandcourt's early paramour Mrs. Glasher had eloped with him from her marriage to an Irish army officer. And they can be national. When Mordecai brings Daniel to the discussion at his Philosophers' Club, Deronda discovers that most of the members are Jewish, but that "Croope, the dark-eyed shoemaker, was probably more Celtic than he knew" (<i>DD,</i> 474). In that same discussion, Mordecai makes the parallels between Jews and Irish explicit when he takes a dim view of intermarriage: "Thousands on thousands of our race have mixed with the Gentile as Celt with Saxon" (<i>DD,</i> 478). In each case the victimized race intermarries with the conquering one. But the connections could be positive as well as negative. A year after publication of the novel, George Eliot made that clear in a letter. "The analogy you find between the Celt and the Hebrew seems to me also not fanciful but real," she wrote to the Scots woman-of-letters and early feminist Charlotte Carmichael (later Stopes). "Both have a literature which has been a fount of religious feeling and imagination to other races."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
I want to insist here not only on separate couplings of any two members of these three groups, but on the tendency of both their partisans and their detractors to put the three together. The latter occurs in George Eliot's famous essay on anti-Semitism, "The Modern Hep! Hep! Hep!" published shortly after <i>Daniel Deronda</i> in her collection <i>Impressions of Theophrastus Such.</i> On one page she first cites the Black/Jewish analogy: "Edicts issued to protect 'the King's Jews' equally with the King's game from being harassed and hunted by the commonality were only slight mitigations to the deplorable lot of a race held to be under the divine curse, and had little force after the Crusades began." She elaborated,

As the slave-holders in the United States counted the curse on Ham a justification of negro slavery, so the curse on the Jews was counted a justification for hindering them from pursuing agriculture and handicrafts; for marking them out as execrable res by a peculiar dress; for torturing them to make them part with their gains, or for more gratuitously spitting at them and pelting them; for taking it as certain that they killed and ate babies, poisoned the wells, and took pains to spread the plague; . . . finally, for hounding them

<p>
After that fiery passage, Eliot turns her attention to discrimination against Irish Catholics too, again making a parallel to the treatment of the Jews:

All which is mirrored in an analogy, namely, that of the Irish, also a servile race, who have rejected Protestantism though it has been repeatedly urged on them by fire and sword and penal laws, and whose place in the moral scale may be judged by our advertisements, where the clause, 'No Irish need apply,' parallels the sentence which for many polite persons sums up the question of Judaism&#x02014;'I never <i>did</i> like the Jews'.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
Eliot connects the dots astutely here, moving easily among complex topics. She also tends to foreground the religious element, just at the moment when European anti-Semitism began to develop a pseudorespectable scientific racial rationale to augment the traditional religious one. Indeed, the very term "anti-Semitism" was invented by the German journalist Wilhelm Marr only a year later  to describe that racial orientation during his creation of the first Anti-Semitic League, which led to the growth of explicitly anti-Semitic parties throughout Europe. The synchrony of Philo-Semitism and anti-Semitism typifies the ambiguity of the representation of Jews in modern Western culture. Bryan Cheyette, for example, has identified "a semitic discourse which constructed 'the Jew' as both within <i>and</i> without; a stranger <i>and</i> familiar; an object of esteem <i>and</i> odium . . . "<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  But within that duality the religious component of Black, Jewish, and Irish comparisons took primacy for a long time and provides a helpful entrance into future developments.
</p>

<p>
Indeed the story of the Exodus from Egypt became a foundational trope in the growth of Irish, Black, and of course, Jewish nationalisms. For centuries the narrative of Moses leading the enslaved children of Israel out of bondage in Egypt into freedom in Canaan has represented liberation of the spirit from things of this world and a turning of the soul from idolatry towards God. In Dante's <i>Purgatorio,</i> to take one of myriad examples, the saved souls sing the 114<sup>th</sup> Psalm ("In exitu Israel de Aegypto") as their boat reaches the mountain of their salvation. Late-nineteenth century-nationalisms favored instead the political allegory, which had of course also been there all along. Rhetorically, the comparison of leaders to Moses and the ancient Hebrews to modern Irish, Blacks, and Jews electrified adherents and helped to attract more. James Joyce's great novel <i>Ulysses,</i> set in 1904, inscribes one of the most famous speeches of the modern Irish nationalist movement, the orator John F. Taylor's crucial comparison of the modern Irish and ancient Jewish causes. Despite the overt anti-Semitism of some nationalist leaders (chief among them Arthur Griffith and Maud Gonne), Taylor's sympathetic parallel between Jews and Irish struck the more normative note. Ironically, the actual speech was never printed and exists now only in multiple versions, among them those given by Joyce in his novel, by Yeats in his autobiography, and by the newspaper <i>The Freeman's Journal</i> the day after its delivery in 1901. I abridge Joyce's version here:

Taylor's speech touches the key tropes of deliverance from bondage to a mighty enemy, independence for a beleaguered people, and the importance of a charismatic leader that would animate Irish, Black, and Jewish nationalisms and tie them to each other. When the great Irish leader Charles Stewart Parnell died in 1891, the young W. B. Yeats immediately vented his grief in a poem called "Mourn&#x02014;And Then Onward!" which deploys the Mosaic analogy developed more fully by John F. Taylor. The sentiments are impeccable, though not the technique, and Yeats later wisely omitted the lyric from his collected works:
</p>

Yeats's association of Irish and Jewish themes would shortly blossom into an endorsement of the Zionist project, not least due to his indignation at the English historian Toynbee's famous assignment of the Jewish and Irish national movements to the dust heap of history and description of those groups as fossils. <i>That</i> was enough to get Yeats's back up (not that it always took so much). During an American lecture tour in early 1920 near the height of the Irish struggle against the English, he issued the following statement to the Palestine restoration fund committee. Yeats clearly had one eye on the situation in Ireland, and much of his endorsement transfers readily to his hopes for his homeland:

<b></b>

<p>
If John Taylor's speech and Yeats's Parnell poem and Zionist endorsement touch key facets of the Exodus trope, an even more central text by Douglas Hyde blazes a trail that colonial liberatory rhetoric of the twentieth century would follow in Irish, Zionist, and Pan-African movements among others. Hyde's influential and then innovative 1892 discourse "The Necessity for De-Anglicising Ireland" strikes now familiar notes: the decline of the oppressed race, its glorious past, its ambivalent love/hate relationship with the dominant culture, the necessity of rebirth or renaissance, and the key role of a national language in forging political and cultural identity. Hyde himself practiced what he preached, of course, serving as president of the Gaelic League and eventually of the Republic of Ireland. His oration built to its magnificent last sentence, where he once again invoked a Jewish analogy for Irish nationalism: "If all this were done, it should not be very difficult . . . to bring about a tone of thought which would make it disgraceful for an educated Irishman&#x02014;especially of the old Celtic race, MacDermotts, O'Conors, O'Sullivans, MacCarthys, O'Neills&#x02014;to be ignorant of his own language&#x02014;would make it at least as disgraceful as for an educated Jew to be quite ignorant of Hebrew."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Hyde's impassioned plea for replacing a colonial language like English would echo throughout later similar maneuvers, whether to favor Gaelic in Ireland, Hebrew in Palestine, or African languages on that continent. In the event, Zionism proved even more successful in reestablishing Hebrew as the primary national language of an entire country than Irish nationalism did with Gaelic.
</p>

<p>
Two years after Hyde's speech came the anti-Semitic Dreyfuss affair in France, which resulted in the trial and wrongful conviction of a Jewish captain in the French army on charges of treason. The resultant outcry created a national and international scandal, led by Zola's famous indictment "J'accuse." It also spurred the embrace of Zionism by a young Austro-Hungarian journalist covering the trial, Theodore Herzl. Indeed, according to historian Walter Laquer, the term "Zionism" first appeared in the same year as Hyde's speech on De-Anglicising, 1892, and according to the OED only in English in 1896.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Influenced like George Eliot by Harriet Beecher Stowe's <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin,</i> Herzl had been urged by his friend Alphonse Daudet (ironically, an anti-Semite) to write a novel rather than a political tract: "A novel can reach farther. Think of <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin.</i>"<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Herzl thought, too, of the Irish example, resolving in his diary from 1895 that "I shall be the Parnell of the Jews."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Within a few years Herzl produced both a novel and a tract, first the founding pamphlet of Zionism <i>Der Judenstaat (The Jewish State)</i> in 1896 and then the novel <i>Altneuland (Old New Land)</i> in 

<b></b>

1902. <i>The Jewish State</i> moved from a nationalist insistence that "We are a people&#x02014;one people" through a long practical section on organization and logistics to an idealistic but na&#x000EF;ve conclusion that "the Jews, once settled in their own state, would probably have no more enemies."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
But Jews did have enemies, then and now, and Herzl's eloquent <i>The Jewish State</i> finds its dark double in the hate-filled <i>Protocols of the Elders of Zion,</i> forged in 1903 by the Czar's secret police and circulated widely by anti-Semitic hatemongers ever since, despite its long-ago exposure as a fabrication. The forgery provided the basis of the Czarist claim that Jews were Bolsheviks, a charge gleefully adopted by the Nazis. It circulated widely in both Ku Klux Klan and Nation of Islam circles in the United States, and circulates even more pervasively in Arab countries today, which obsessively rebroadcast the forty-one-part Egyptian television series "Horse Without a Horseman" based on it and shown repeatedly since its debut three years ago. Those tempted to sympathize with organizations like Hamas today might go on the world-wide web and read article thirty-two of the Hamas charter: "The Zionist plan is limitless. After Palestine, the Zionists aspire to expand from the Nile to the Euphrates. When they will have digested the region they overtook, they will aspire to further expansion, and so on. Their plan is embodied in the <i>Protocols of the Elders of Zion</i> . . ."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Such sentiments fall far from what Herzl hoped for when he wrote <i>The Jewish State,</i> and even farther from the vision of intergroup cooperation that he envisaged in his novel <i>Altneuland</i> a few years later. There the scientist Professor Steineck calls for ameliorating the lot of the other group besides Irish and Jews in this paper:

The notion of a special sympathy between Blacks and Jews because of their respective suffering was commonplace a century ago and articulated by intellectual leaders and the popular press of both groups.
</p>

<p>
The same affinity with the Exodus story begins before that, of course, in the moving rhythms of African American spirituals sung in the slave South. Part of an ongoing vernacular and oral tradition, these songs first made their way into print at the start of the nineteenth century in a collection by a Black church leader. They focused often on the travails of the children of Israel in Egypt, particularly the story of Moses and the Exodus. In that typology, Egypt often red as the slave South, Heaven as the free northern States, the ancient Jews as modern African Americans, and any liberationist leader as a Moses. Song after song like "Wade in the Water" paralleled the suffering of the two peoples. Here is a verse from perhaps the best-known of all, "Go Down Moses":

<b></b>

</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">

The enormous pathos of such songs eased the pain of bondage and promoted hopes of freedom in a typical maneuver by oppressed peoples where words might mean one thing overtly (here, acquiescent piety) but quite another covertly (here, a call for freedom and escape). They also indelibly inscribed parallels between Black and Jewish experience.
</p>

<p>
Those parallels carried over into print tradition as well. They pervade the Harlem Renaissance, for example, whose landmark anthology of 1925 <i>The New Negro</i> proclaimed that "Harlem has the same role to play for the New Negro as Dublin has had for the New Ireland."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  And towards the end of the same movement Zora Neale Hurston based her novel <i>Moses, Man of the Mountain</i>  on a triple analogy among ancient Hebrews in bondage in Egypt; African Americans in the slave South; and Jews trapped in Nazi Germany. Rather than quote those well-known works, I turn instead to a now almost forgotten member of the Harlem Renaissance who died young, Theodore Henry Shackelford. The grandson of escaped slaves who followed the underground railroad through the northern free states all the way into Canada, Shackelford was born in 1888 in Windsor, Ontario, and produced two books of poetry before his untimely death in 1923. His second collection, <i>My Country and Other Poems,</i> included the poem "The Big Bell in Zion," which became his best-known work when James Weldon Johnson chose it for his landmark anthology <i>The Book of American Negro Poetry</i> .In his Preface to the original edition Johnson argued that "What the colored poet in the United States needs to do is something like what Synge did for the Irish; he needs to find a form that will express the racial spirit by symbols from within rather than by symbols from without<i>."</i><sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> Two stanzas of "Big Bell in Zion" apply the Biblical story of exodus from Egypt even more explicitly to contemporary politics than had the old spirituals and draw a parallel between the land of Canaan and the free state of Ohio:

Affiliation between Black and Jewish liberations did not stop with ancient Israel and nineteenth-century African Americans, nor with songs of freedom and Biblical tropes. They extended as well into practical politics and political philosophy, particularly 

<b></b>

the interweaving of African nationalism and Zionism as twin causes. That conception informs the work of Edward Blyden (1832&#x02013;1912), whom <i>The Oxford Companion to African American Literature</i> describes as "the most important African thinker of the nineteenth century."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Born in Saint Thomas in the Caribbean, Blyden made his way first to America and eventually to Liberia and Sierra Leone, where he led a successful career as journalist, writer, and politician, serving eventually as Liberian secretary of state and then as ambassador to the Court of St. James among other distinguished posts. The Exodus analogy was central to this thought. He wrote, "The Negro leader of the exodus, who will succeed, will be a Negro of Negroes, like Moses was a Hebrew of the Hebrews&#x02014;even if brought up in Pharaoh's palace he will be found . . . "<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Though sketched by rare scholars like Hollis Lynch and Paul Gilroy, the importance of Jews and Zionism to Blyden goes unmentioned in major anthologies and reference books, such as <i>The Oxford Companion.</i> Blyden himself, however, had no doubts of a lifelong affinity and in his pamphlet on <i>The Jewish Question</i> written at the end of the century he extolled "that marvelous movement called Zionism."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Blyden dedicated that work to his Jewish friend Louis Solomon, a Liverpool merchant, expressing the hope that "you and your friends may have the record of the views held by an African of the work and destiny of a people with whom his own race is closely allied, both by Divine declaration and by a history almost identical of sorrow and oppression; and that, if possible, members of the two suffering races&#x02014;Africans and Jews&#x02014;who read these pages, may have a somewhat clearer understanding and a deeper sympathy with each other." That alignment of Jews and Blacks for political purposes would echo throughout the writings of later Black thinkers such as W. E. B. Du Bois, Marcus Garvey, and a host of others.
</p>

<p>
In <i>The Jewish Question</i> Blyden recalled that he was "born in the midst of Jews" on St. Thomas, and that the awe and reverence that he felt at listening to synagogue services followed him all his life. He testified, too, to the support for his endeavors from Jewish acquaintances both on St. Thomas and throughout his career, and of his efforts to study Hebrew in order to read the Old Testament and Talmud in the original. Besides pressing the parallels between Black and Jewish dispersal and suffering, Blyden throughout urged not merely a political but also a spiritual view of Zionism as contributing to human welfare. He closed with a ringing endorsement of brotherhood that Frederick Douglass would have understood as he gazed at that Irish cabin and which Blyden himself borrowed from Rabbi S. Singer of London:

And behold, it was my own brother!<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
That notion of brotherhood, of course, underlies the analogies that this paper has been exploring. The great Black, Jewish, and Irish thinkers of the past extended it beyond their own group to all groups, and if we follow their diminished modern epigones in 

<b></b>

restricting the term only to our own groups, we contradict their teachings and diminish ourselves as well as our world.
</p>

<p>
I should like to extend that notion of championing one's own group but still believing in interracial and interethnic brotherhood through three final examples from the first quarter of the twentieth century&#x02014;a play by the Zionist leader Israel Zangwill, essays and speeches of the Black nationalist thinkers W. E. B. Du Bois and Marcus Garvey, and finally a crucial scene in James Joyce's novel <i>Ulysses.</i>
</p>

<p>
Now largely forgotten, Zangwill was once an important Zionist leader. He was also the author of a now little-performed or read play whose title survives in a phrase that pops up in nearly all interracial and intergroup discussion: <i>The Melting Pot.</i> It is popular today to denounce the play (without reading it) as favoring suppression of individual groups by a dominant culture. But Zangwill intended just the opposite, arguing in the Afterword that "The process of American amalgamation is not assimilation or simple surrender to the dominant type, as is popularly supposed, but an all-round give-and-take by which the final type may be enriched or impoverished."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  He carefully wrote into the play the transformation of initial hostility between the Irish maid Kathleen and the elderly Jewish Frau Quixano into fervent mutual loyalty. He also made sure to associate the anti-Semitic bigots with anti-black sentiments as well and to denounce the practice of lynching. In the Afterword, he presented himself as a Zionist leader and paralleled the Jewish immigrants&#x02014;"the toughest of all the white elements that have been poured into the crucible"&#x02014;to amalgamate with African Americans, for whom he predicted that "even the Negrophobia is not likely to remain eternally at its present barbarous pitch."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Zangwill's views fit well with those of Herzl, who as we saw also associated Zionism with both Irish and Black causes.
</p>

<p>
They also fit well with perhaps the greatest African American intellectual of the early twentieth century, W. E. B. Du Bois, who became aware of the Jewish problem in 1893 while studying in Germany and who saw Zionist and African aspirations as cut from the same cloth. "The African movement means to us what the Zionist movement must mean to the Jews, the centralization of race effort and the recognition of a racial fount," he wrote in his editorial "Not 'Separatism'" for the NAACP journal <i>Crisis.</i><sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Such affinities carried practical as well as theoretical freight. The first Pan-African conference was held in London in 1900, only three years after the first Zionist Congress in Basel, and Zionism helped inspire Du Bois's Pan-African Congresses between 1919 and 1927. Throughout his life Du Bois learned of Zionism from his many close Jewish friends, including Joel Spingarn of the NAACP and Madame Calman-Levy of the French Jewish community. At a board meeting of the NAACP he even distributed copies of a pamphlet by Paul Otlet, popularly called "the father of the League of Nations" because of his writings on the subject, which stressed that "The initiators of the Pan-African movement believe that there is a strong analogy between the situation of blacks and that of the Jews."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Du Bois made a similar point in the essay that he contributed to <i>The New Negro</i> in 1925, "The Negro Mind Reaches Out," where he movingly endorsed analogies between "two international groups&#x02014;the Jews and the Modern Negroes."<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  He intertwined Black and Jewish causes over many decades, including (for example) 

<b></b>

his linkage of Black and Jewish nationalisms in the essay "Africa, Colonialism, and Zionism" of 1919, his bold condemnation of Hitler's policies in "The Present Plight of the German Jew" of 1936, his support for creation of the state of Israel in "The Case for the Jews" of 1948, and his meditation on the Holocaust in "The Negro and the Warsaw Ghetto" of 1952.
</p>

<p>
The Pan-African leader who most emphasized the triangle of Black, Jewish, and Irish causes was Marcus Garvey. Born in Jamaica in 1887, Garvey became the most famous Black Nationalist of his time, especially after setting up his Universal Negro Improvement Association and moving its headquarters to Harlem. Though increasingly given to anti-Semitic outbursts about Jews and economics, he regularly praised both Zionism and Irish Nationalism as political movements and upheld them as ideals for Black liberation movements. Garvey vibrated deeply to the tropes of Exodus and Moses; to this day, one of the best biographies of him is called <i>Black Moses,</i> and his followers often made that comparison. A Garvey supporter in South Africa in 1919 observed that "Africans have the same confidence in Marcus Garvey which the Israelites had in Moses."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  "The Universal Negro Improvement Association is no joke," Garvey wrote that same year, "It is as serious a movement as the movement of the Irish today to have a free Ireland, as the determination of the Jew to recover Palestine."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Garvey would echo those sentiments repeatedly, even obsessively. And when UNIA held its first convention in Madison Square Garden in 1920, Garvey began his rousing remarks by reading first a telegram of congratulations from the Zionist leader Louis Michael that said "As a Jew, a Zionist, and a Socialist I join heartily and unflinchingly in your historical movement for the reclamation of Africa."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Garvey then went on to read a telegram he himself had sent congratulating the Irish revolutionary leader Edmund De Valera on the success of the Irish revolution. Irish nationalism fascinated Garvey perhaps even more than Zionism did. For instance, he named his UNIA headquarters in Harlem "Liberty Hall" because the Irish nationalist and socialist James Connolly had previously named <i>his</i> headquarters in Dublin "Liberty Hall." After Garvey designed the black, red, and green Pan-African flag still often seen at black power or black nationalist rallies, he repeatedly indicated that the green stood for Ireland, which he saw as the first British colony to gain independence in the twentieth century and as a model for African aspirations. Zionist leaders paid homage to the Irish, too. For example, while ting the British in Palestine, Yitzhak Shamir, later prime minister of Israel, adopted the code name "Michael" in tribute to the Irish guerilla leader Michael Collins.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  And, of course, Chaim Herzog, the son of the Chief Rabbi of Ireland, himself fought for Israeli independence and eventually served as the sixth President of the State of Israel.
</p>

<p>
The confluence of Irish, Jewish, and Black nationalisms reaches one high water mark in Joyce's <i>Ulysses,</i> with its continual inscriptions of Zionism, Irish nationalism, and minority liberation of all kinds, right from that first chapter with Stephen and Buck Mulligan in the Martello tower through to the end of Molly's soliloquy. They cluster most thickly in Chapter 12, "Cyclops," where the problematic Irish Jew Leopold Bloom encounters in a pub the even more problematic narrow nationalist known in the novel as the Citizen and based on the historical Michael Cusack, founder of the 

<b></b>

Gaelic Athletic Association. As the scene builds to its violent confrontation, our familiar triangle emerges. I have argued recently in <i>Material Modernism: The Politics of the Page</i> that Joyce expanded the parallels and allusions to Irish, Jewish, and Black causes as he continually revised this scene and others in the process of composition. One epitome of those associations comes in the late invocation of the song now beginning "<i>&#x000ED;f the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew</i>" (<i>U,</i> 280). Originally, Joyce had referred instead to the Irish Nationalist ballad "The Boys of Wexford" before revising that to the current line about Jews, which itself contains a major Joycean intentional error. The chorus to the actual hit song began instead, "If the Man in the moon were a coon, coon, coon." Joyce's successive revisions, then, from "Boys of Wexford" through "coon, coon, coon" to "jew, jew, jew" provide an archaeology of links between Irish, Jewish, and Black liberation.
</p>

<p>
The antagonisms that Joyce seeks to counter rise to a crescendo earlier in the scene, when the Citizen challenges Bloom's claims to be an Irishman rather than a "half and half" by asking insultingly, "What is your nation if I may ask?" (<i>U,</i> 272). Bloom responds with the note of simple humanity that Seamus Heaney in his wonderful poem "Traditions" cited in reference to current troubles in Northern Ireland: "Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland." But the Citizen and his cronies refuse Bloom's claims and provoke him to identify with Jewry:

And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted. Also now. This very instant. . . . Robbed, says he. Plundered. Persecuted. Taking what belongs to us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold by auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.

&#x02014;Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? Says the citizen.

Bloom's outburst reminds us that the Zionism that pervades the novel was a response to Jewish mistreatment not only in Europe (as is often currently supposed) but also to mistreatment in the Arab lands where Jews had existed for over two millennia. Joyce was well aware of that at the time of writing the novel, for newspapers had recently described the custom in Morocco of the Muslim majority subjecting the Jewish population to "compulsory service" for servile tasks, an obligation that could be bought or sold in the marketplace along with slave and cattle. Indeed, the Jewish population res for Morocco and other Arab countries before and after establishment of the State of Israel indicate where so many Israeli Jews came from. Here are a few of them, first for the year of the establishment of the Israeli state and then for the year 2001<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup> :

Yet that account of persecution is not Bloom's final position, nor should it be ours. Bloom goes on to give his final verdict and his final value:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

&#x02014;But it's no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That's not life for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it's the very opposite of that that is really life.

&#x02014;What? Says Alf.

If pressed, I hope that we will all take our stand with Bloom. I have suggested throughout this essay that our constructions of the past are inevitably misconstructions. Our current misconstructions have seized on the elements of Bloom's force, hatred, and persecution that certainly pervade history. But we have scanted Bloom's opposites of hatred&#x02014;love, alliance, and compassion&#x02014;that also appear there. The history of interrelations among Irish nationalism, Zionism, and Pan-Africanism shows us the humane and broad vision that the late-nineteenth-century and early-twentieth-century inventors of those movements displayed at their best. It would be well for us to recover and practice them at our best, too.

Hugh Kenner's intellectual foundations lie in late-seventeenth- and early-eighteenth-century British Enlightenment. Our modern European world was invented there and then, but Kenner's Enlightenment is a self-conscious construction, an intellectual framework that he assembles like an anthropologist; it gives his critical and historical writing its basic concepts and distinctions, method, lucidity, and above all characteristic irony. This Enlightenment is not a postmodern concept, not a terminal or unfinished project of rationalization and disenchantment; it is an Augustan schema whose rationality involves critical observation of particulars rather than the deployment of integrated, self-regulating systems. This is not the Enlightenment of Descartes and Leibniz, who want self-evident truths, but that of Bacon and 

<b></b>

the Royal Society, of Defoe, Swift, and Pope, of Locke and Newton&#x02014;res whom Kenner consulted repeatedly. Descartes appears in Kenner's reading of Beckett, because Beckett's characters parody Cartesian subjectivity. Kenner's is an empirical, rather than rule-governed, rationalist Enlightenment that thinks self-evident truths need to be tested and, often, unmasked. Human reason is not all that philosophy claims for it. The documentation of states of affairs, indistinguishable from the stripping away of appearances, trumps totalities of every sort: encyclopedias and dictionaries, essays and inquiries, notes and epistles, lists and enumerations, satires and parodies&#x02014;these, together with the novel that imitates them, are basic genres of Kenner's Enlightenment, in which distrust of general ideas motivates an irrepressibly corrosive wit aimed at the consequences of unchecked reasoning. The purpose of logic and mathematics in this event is practical rather than theoretical: namely the construction of productive machinery, not the formation of abstract structures. Mathematics is a useful science: it can make things work&#x02014;a Geodesic dome, for example. Automatons are more interesting than ideas. Kenner's is a ground-level Enlightenment that knows the importance of small increments and the fraudulence of every idealism. Collect anecdotes, scorn theories. Each random particle deserves scrutiny. So, lower the threshold of description and follow the method of detail. This is the motto of Kenner's practice.
</p>

<p>
The opening pages of <i>Dublin's Joyce</i> describe Dublin as "an eighteenth-century time capsule" whose citizens are clich&#x000E9;d in thought and speech because they incarnate Augustan ghosts. Kenner does not see this as altogether bad:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Through other countries other rivers flowed, bearing away all the past that floats. . . . Only Dublin had kept its past above the waters; evading the cataclysmic mutation of the Romantic revolt, it had chosen to preserve its form rather than its life. And a man born into that Dublin, exhorted to admire the image of old buildings in the stream, might seek instead to seize the once-living City. . . . such a man&#x02014;James Joyce . . . &#x02014;would find himself simultaneously citizen and exile.

<p class="noIndent">
Dublin's Joyce is an Augustan satirist or, more accurately, a parodist who wants to restore the coherence of words and things by documenting in detail their echoes in his fellow Dubliners' talk. But parody is also a redemptive genre. For Kenner the paralysis of Joyce's Dublin saves it from becoming a nineteenth-century London debauched by industrial and romantic revolutions. Kenner came to maturity in an age that defined itself critically against the romantic period: that is what Kenner's <i>modernism</i> is in its deepest motivation, namely a rejection of subjectivist poetics, tending toward a rejection of any interest in human subjectivity (such as psychoanalysis, which Kenner ridiculed).<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Joyce's Dublin is a utopia: a city of the dead which preserves a human order that romanticism swept away, leaving Eliot's unreal city behind. Simon Dedalus is a ghost, but the ghost of Swift, not of Tennyson: "his wit proceeds from a critical alertness, a flexibility of response to social clich&#x000E9;s," words that could just as well describe Joyce himself (<i>DJ,</i> 22). The "English analogue for Joyce," Kenner writes, "is Pope," "conscious of intellectual traditions running back through St. Augustine to Cicero and 

<b></b>

Homer," who "predicted at the end of the <i>Dunciad</i>" "the universal darkness . . . the Romantic night-world. . . . Ireland had simply undergone some two centuries' arrest on the very brink of the precipice, and Joyce's generation was hailing a suicidal forward stagger as progress" (<i>DJ,</i> 23). In his essay, "In the Wake of the Anarch" , Kenner remarked that fifty years after his death Pope became "all but unintelligible. His editors could not read him; his commentators cannot read him [note the present tense]." We find ourselves, "since the Romantic explosion, on another planet," unable to pursue "a most precise analysis" based on "premises desperately in need of recovery" (<i>GN,</i> 172). Kenner sees Pound struggling to free himself from the nineteenth-century nightworld by rediscovering these premises, including the premise that a poem is made of learning, as a novel is made of facts, rather than merely private perspectives: "Most of Pound's work is worth reading . . . because he doesn't play solitaire with general ideas." His mind works by the incorporation, rumination, and digestion of "facts" (<i>GN,</i> 133). "The allusiveness of modern poetry needn't be a sign of cultural breakdown, but a manifestation of one of poetry's oldest functions"&#x02014;to be encyclopedic: "The teacher of modern poetry finds himself discussing the Grail Legend, Heraclitus, Cuchulain, the <i>Odyssey,</i> Dante's trimmers, Chinese ideograms, the culture of Provence, usury, spirit writings, the <i>Noh.</i> What justifies the use of such materials by the poet is that they are worth learning about anyway" (<i>GN,</i> 140&#x02013;41).
</p>

<p>
And Leopold Bloom? As Kenner says, "when Joyce makes Bloom suddenly ask, 'Do fish ever get seasick?' we are in the presence not of an exercise in nineteenth-century pessimism but of a tribute to the unpredictable creative leaps of the human soul" (<i>DJ,</i> 10). Bloom is the literal-minded eighteenth-century man whom romanticism blurred into extinction, leaving Stephen Dedalus struggling and failing to transmute the mere facts of everydayness into vibrant images of eternal beauty. As Kenner puts it, "Stephen the romantic artist, <i>thanatos,</i> is Joyce without Joyce's sense of fact" (<i>DJ,</i> 24). More precisely: "Joyce was never the Stephen Dedalus of his 1914 <i>Portrait,</i> mirror of nineteenth-century romantic idealism: Byron, Shelley, Axel, Fr&#x000E9;d&#x000E9;ric Moreau" (<i>DJ,</i> 44). What saved Joyce was the writing of <i>Stephen Hero,</i> a process of depersonalization that parallels Yeats's development of an aesthetics of the anti-self, which defines the character of the later "cubist" portrait of Stephen, whom Joyce's "moving point of view" comes to characterize no longer as just himself (a subject) but also as the (objective) product of the naturalistic forces of environment and heredity that produce Dubliners.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Joyce's "imagination" at twenty-three "had arrived at the point Yeats was only to reach at fifty, and passed beyond it while young enough to profit" (<i>DJ,</i> 47). Kenner finds in the "dryness" (<i>DJ,</i> 33) and the Jonsonian irony of <i>Chamber Music</i> lyricism subjugated by a scrupulous empiricism. Pound's hand is in this judgment&#x02014;as Kenner acknowledges when he cites Pound's praise of the "'clean-cut ivory finish'" of Joyce's lyrics (<i>DJ,</i> 32).
</p>

<p>
Kenner's modernism is defined less by formal innovation than by an "objectivist" aesthetic attuned to sheer factuality, the irreducible singularity of the here and now. His link with the British Enlightenment lies in the rejection of subsumptive thinking, emotive expressionism, deduction from generalities, and appeals to imagination. Categories are occasions of comedy, because on close inspection categories are always 

<b></b>

empty, like the minds that use them. Kenner's invisible poet is a constructivist rather than expressionist, like T. S. Eliot, whose <i>Waste Land</i> is an exemplary modernist collage. Eliot was simultaneously "very Augustan" and "post-Symbolist" (<i>TPE,</i> 275). The poem, in short, is an object, a pattern of words the way the novel is a container in which any number of disarticulated objects can be rearticulated into patterns of facts.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Stoic Comedians</i> , whose ideas Kenner was developing in the early sixties when I was his student at the University of Virginia, is the quintessential Kenner text. Three interrelated critical themes stand out from this period:  the stoicism of the Augustans: their essential impersonality, imperviousness to misfortune, restraint of feeling, and deadpan documentation of human folly;  a romantic skepticism which doubts whether the world can exist independently of the mind's operations, whereas Augustan skepticism doubts reason's capacity to surmount the mind's obstacles to knowing what exists; so satire undoes the egotistical sublime; and  the concept of the closed field, which unfolds the idea that facts are finite in number and can be arranged, combined, and recombined in multifarious ways&#x02014;alphabetically, encyclopedically, or novelistically; but however we organize them, facts define human finitude, the absolute limit that inevitably defeats human projects. However, comedy, not tragedy, is their fruit. The straight face (Buster Keaton's face, Pound's <i>personae,</i> and Eliot's possum) defines the decorum of a metaphysics of facts.
</p>

<p>
Kenner adds multiple turns of the screw, for example, his interpretation of Swift's Gulliver as Kenner's self-portrait and self-critique in the fourth chapter of <i>The Counterfeiters</i> . Kenner traces the genealogy of his intellectual heroes, Charles Babbage and Alan Turing, prime movers of the digital age, to <i>Gulliver's Travels.</i> For him Alan Turing's Game&#x02014;where a detached observer tries to determine objectively (without looking at the subjects in question) the difference between a machine's operations and a human being&#x02014;is already fully in place in <i>Gulliver's Travels,</i> where the creatures Gulliver encounters have grave difficulty in concluding on the evidence of Gulliver himself what a human being might be. The comedy is that Swift has created in Gulliver the "Compleat Empiricist," someone who has no capacity for accepting received ideas, whose capacity for experience is confined to what he can hear, see, and compute, and who is confounded by being simultaneously empirically indiscernible from the Houynymns (owing to his exhibition of consecutive discourse) and indistinguishable from the Yahoos (owing to his biped physiology, not to mention his appearance as an object of Yahoovian desire). A classic epistemological crisis. However, "Swift's great irony" involves presenting Gulliver as an observer who is himself "constantly under observation." This makes Swift "the real inventor of Turing's game." In this situation of multiple observation, Gulliver as "<i>our</i> spokesman" shows himself incapable of explaining "what it may mean to be human." Yet "he represents a modern ultimate, carrier and incarnation of the values we really value: notably accuracy, cleanliness, and the power to adjust. Compared with Swift's, Turing's formulation of the game seems almost trivial" (<i>TC,</i> 120&#x02013;21). Gulliver, knowing nothing but facts, is the perfect narrator because he makes Swift's text a novel and not just a diatribe. What Gulliver lacks, as Kenner points out, is a classical education; he has no context, history, or tradition in which to place 

<b></b>

himself. The critic self-reflexively making that point had himself been one of the last recipients of a classical education.
</p>

<p>
Hugh Kenner had a superhuman memory. In the classical age memory served as a library&#x02014;not a personal memory but a commonplace book, an encyclopedic inventory on which to draw. Asked a question about Emerson, not someone in whom Kenner maintained much interest, he would recite from memory whole paragraphs of an Emerson essay. This fabulous memory informs central aspects of Kenner's method. <i>The Pound Era</i> is a book of anecdotes, citations, and factual glosses (not "readings") held together by recurring res of "patterned energy"&#x02014;the Vortex, for example&#x02014;whose prime model is Buckminster Fuller's analysis of knots, a study of how something works. The concept of "patterned energy" is as close to a general idea as Kenner ever comes. He had no use for general ideas&#x02014;hence the gleeful contempt he heaped upon literary theorists and the French philosophers who procreated them. He worked by moving particulars, like Buster Keaton's face, from their native contexts to different, foreign ones where they served as descriptive models, chiefly of how certain kinds of writing like the novel work. That is the call of Kenner's <i>mechanic muse</i> (which was also Newton's muse): How do things work?Kenner was interested in, among other things, the impact of new technologies on writing&#x02014;the printing press, the typewriter, the railroad, and of course the digital computer. With Charles Hartman he is the author, so to speak, of <i>Sentences,</i> a volume of computer-generated poems (recall the objectivist poem that no one seems to have written).<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Kenner's modernism is technological in character. In <i>The Mechanic Muse</i> he writes that "Technology alters our sense of what the mind does" and that "the Modernist enterprise evolved its verbal technologies, its poem- and novel-machines of intricate interacting discrete pieces" drawing "for tacit analogies" on technology that "is largely obsolescent now: as much so as, say, Dante's Earth-centered cosmos": "The Dublin trams . . . and the linotype machine; the typewriter . . . . That world survives now, like Dante's world, in art. Its assumptions survive in the structures of its art: complex artifacts we even sometimes take apart for maintenance" (<i>TMM,</i> 110&#x02013;11).
</p>

<p>
The reconstruction and maintenance of modernism: that's a neat way of thinking of Kenner's intellectual achievement.

In 1990 Barbara Johnson gave a series of lectures at the University of Chicago on psychoanalysis and African American literature. In those days many feminists were exploring the question of whether or how post-structuralist theories could be applied to multicultural literatures. At the time I was an untenured assistant professor heavily influenced by Johnson's style of deconstruction, so you can imagine my discomfort when I learned that the second lecture in that series, entitled "No Passing," was to be a reading of Nella Larsen's <i>Passing,</i> the very novel I was then writing about in an essay that would turn out to be the inception of <i>Passing and Pedagogy: The Dynamics of Responsibility</i> . So at the reception following the first lecture, I cornered Johnson and anxiously spewed out all the ideas I was exploring in that essay, seeking to convince her (and possibly myself) that I hadn't taken my ideas from the lecture that I hadn't yet heard. I talked about the nature of our authority, as white feminist critics trained in a Eurocentric theoretical and literary tradition, in the African American literature classroom where, as Patricia Hill Collins and Diana Fuss remind us, knowledge derived from experience is given more credibility than knowledge acquired through training. How does racial difference inflect the process of transference that you have helped us to see as central to the pedagogical relation, I asked her? What does it mean to learn from the one presumed <i>not</i> to know, from (so to speak) an unreliable narrator? In response to these questions that I found so urgent and complicated, Johnson replied with her characteristic composure: All I know is, she said, I don't want to be another Carl Van Vechten.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Johnson's response came back to me several years later when I was researching and teaching at the Newberry Library in 

<b></b>

Chicago. The seminar, entitled "Mapping Identities," focused on modernist writers, artists, and scholars who traveled to and wrote from locales other than their countries or regions of origin. We looked at the motivations for their travels and at the ways they represented other cultural groups, to better understand that miscegenated history we now call modernism. In our unit on the southwest we read about John Collier, a promoter and defender of American Indian culture who later became the head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs at a time when the official U.S. policy toward native peoples was one of assimilation. I discovered that John Collier had stayed with Mabel Dodge and Tony Luhan in Taos around the time D. H. Lawrence was there. Yet Lawrence, who would write his own idealized vision of Indians in his 1924 novella, "The Woman Who Rode Away," was disgusted by Collier's enthusiasm for Native American culture and allegedly said to a friend, more or less: All I know is I don't want to be John Collier.
</p>

<p>
What does such a statement, a peculiar kind of xenophobia, tell us about modernism and its contemporary critique? What is the common structure in these responses? Of course, the very need to deny similarity, to assert "I'm not that," arises from the fear of resemblance, as Johnson has argued in her essays on Hurston&#x02014;the recognition that in the eyes of others, even in one's own eyes, perhaps, one may be precisely <i>that,</i> or at least that the difference one insists on may be so subtle as to be negligible. While many cultural critics are concerned with what my colleague Chris Castiglia calls "psychic blackface," that is, the phenomenon of whites wanting to be and identifying with blacks or Indians, my concern is with the corollary phenomenon of whites not wanting to be identified with other whites engaged in similar efforts to identify across racial lines, as in "I don't want to be Carl Van Vechten." It is a phenomenon that I have explored in terms of "passing."
</p>

<p>
Passing has once again become a hot topic in contemporary popular culture and a major trope for our critical and professional activity. One thinks of Danzy Senna's <i>Caucasia</i> ; Philip Roth's <i>The Human Stain</i>  and the 2003 film version directed by Robert Benton; and in literary and cultural criticism, Gayle Wald's <i>Crossing the Line: Racial Passing in Twentieth-Century U.S. Literature and Culture</i> , Kathleen Pfeiffer's <i>Race Passing and American Individualism</i> , and Brooke Kroeger's <i>Passing: When People Can't Be Who They Are</i> , to name only a few examples. In <i>Passing and Pedagogy</i> I explore this concept largely in terms of contemporary culture and criticism. Yet the echo of Johnson's words in Lawrence's disavowal&#x02014;I don't want to be John Collier&#x02014;has led me to consider more carefully the emergence of passing, as I have rered it, in modernism. In that Newberry seminar, I was struck by how the difference between the artistic and the touristic use of other cultures was often lost upon students as it was upon many modernists themselves. For example, in the 1920s, artists, writers, art patrons, anthropologists, and entrepreneurs came together in the southwest to promote "a romantic mix of archeology, art, tourism, and politics," as Desley Deacon writes in her biography, <i>Elsie Clews Parsons: Inventing Modern Life.</i><sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  While they sought ways to incorporate native art and culture into Western lives without "patronizing, appropriating, or destroying" it, such a project was necessarily fraught with ambiguity: cultural preservation depended on Western tourism, and spiritual renewal 

<b></b>

meant "going native."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  In the Newberry seminar, we read works by and about Elsie Clews Parsons and D. H. Lawrence in Taos; Sergei Eisenstein and Langston Hughes in Mexico; Claude McKay and Josephine Baker in France; and Zora Neale Hurston and Melville Herskovitz in the Caribbean. We studied the music of John Alden Carpenter, the photography of Edward Weston, the drawings of Miguel Covarrubias, and the dance of Katherine Dunham. And the more we read, the more important and the more difficult it became to distinguish those who were appropriately self-aware in their representations of others from those who were shamelessly appropriative. I came to see passing and the anxieties it arouses, as well as the border crossings (both literal and imaginative) that at once enable and express it, as the peculiar identification at the heart of modernism&#x02014;and not just in the sense that the androgyne and the mulatto served as cultural icons of the modernist generation. Rather, I would argue that the fluidity of identity boundaries that we have come to identify with postmodernity&#x02014;especially a postmodern notion of subjectivity as constructed, discursive, and fluid&#x02014;has as much or more to do with the historical conditions in which modernist art was produced as with the textual theories of post-structuralism. But first I need to explain the various ways the term "passing" has been used and how I have rered that concept.

Let me begin with some illustrated examples.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Passing as white is, of course, how modernists would have understood the term. But even in this, its first cultural sense, passing is far more complicated than the notion of wearing a mask or of assuming a fraudulent identity would suggest. In his <i>New Yorker</i> essay, "White Like Me," on the life and writings of Anatole Broyard, Henry Louis Gates, Jr. reconceives passing as a modernist phenomenon. Gates describes Broyard (<a href="#1"> 1</a>), a well-known book reviewer for the <i>New York Times,</i> who was born a Negro in 1920 and later passed as white, as a man obsessed with modern culture and modernist literature. "The thematic elements of passing," Gates writes, "fragmentation, alienation, liminality, self-fashioning&#x02014;echo the great themes of modernism."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Passing in this sense&#x02014;passing as white&#x02014;is often seen as fraudulence or betrayal, as a sin against authenticity. Yet authenticity, Gates says, is "among the founding lies of the modern age," a Romantic fallacy rejected by modernists.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Extrapolating from Gates's reading, we could argue that it was not so much that Broyard <i>lived</i> a lie as that he <i>refused</i> to live a conventional fiction.
</p>

<p>
Passing in the modernist period was more than a literary theme, and as a social practice, far more complicated than its common definition would suggest. Passing came to signify the dynamics of identity and identification in the modernist period&#x02014;the social, cultural, technological, and psychological processes by which a subject comes to understand his or her identity in relation to others. Passing&#x02014;actual and imaginary, conscious and unconscious&#x02014;at once produced profound shifts in thinking about the boundaries of identity and aroused ambivalence about those shifting, unstable borders.
</p>

<p>
Yet the notion of passing as fraudulence and deception remains dominant today, despite the modernist erosion of such binary thinking. Madeleine Albright (<a href="#2"> 2</a>) was 

<b></b>

exposed, so to speak, in 1997 for passing as a Catholic all her life. The question that preoccupied newspaper editorials and talk shows then was, what did she know of her Jewish ancestry and when did she know it? As if identity were an on-off switch, as if one woke up one day and said, "<i>Today</i> I am a Jew." To appropriate one's Jewish identity in that way would be to act without the cultural memory that would place that identity in a social history, spiritual tradition, and material existence. To say "I am a Jew" in this sense would be, as Alain Finkielkraut says, "an error of grammatical attribution of person."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  In his autobiographical <i>The Imaginary Jew,</i> a work of intellectual history, Finkielkraut offers a scathing critique of his earlier political identification as a leftist, for his politics led him to exploit his Jewish identity without the cultural memory that would root that identity in the concrete daily lives and the social and spiritual traditions of Jews. He was, in essence, passing, not in the usual sense of disguising his Jewishness,

but in the sense of using it, "unveiling" himself to others and "making a spectacle of [his] difference" (<i>IJ,</i> 171, 172). Finkielkraut's term for this kind of fictive identity is "imaginary Jew." Like my use of "passing," the term is an effort to name what has never been considered a category of identity.</p>

In her 1990 lecture at Chicago, "No Passing," Barbara Johnson argued that passing is acting as if one could determine one's subject position, as if one were an autonomous subject without heritage, family, or history. To reject passing in this sense, as Finkeilkraut did, is to confront and to struggle with one's own historically constituted identity. In reclaiming a cultural memory and a historical past in his confrontation with Judaism, however, Finkeilkraut insists that he has not become more authentically Jewish. "The word 'Jew,'" he writes, "is no longer a mirror in which I seek my self-portrait, but where I look for everything I'm not, everything I'll never be able to glimpse by taking myself as a point of reference" (<i>IJ,</i> 179). One can imagine that Albright's struggle with her religious and racial identity was, like Finkeilkraut's, a moral journey that was not 

<b></b>

so much a process of finding one's self ("I am a Jew") but an "undoing of the self" (<i>IJ,</i> 176), an acceptance of the ethical obligation to struggle with identity as a process, not a given, and to accept responsibility for one's particular forms of passing.
</p>

<p>
Two highly publicized trials in the 1920s, one in the U.S., the other in Britain, not only epitomize the public's fascination with passing at that time, but evidence its emerging sense of identity as something one acquires rather than something one is. In 1924 Alice Jones (<a href="#3"> 3</a>), daughter of a working-class couple, married Leonard "Kip" Rhinelander, son of one of New York's leading families. Their different class status was enough to make the marriage headline material, as Earl Lewis and Heidi Ardizzone note in their book on the Rhinelander trial, <i>Love on Trial;</i> however, the disclosure a month after the wedding that Alice was "colored" prompted a media frenzy. The public trial in 1925 over Leonard's annulment suit was covered by newspapers across the country and in England and was the first occasion of the use of photojournalism. An actress was hired and photographed reenacting the partial disrobing of Alice Jones before a sequestered judge and jury in an effort to provide "ocular evidence" of her race to determine what Leonard could have been expected to know and when.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Yet the legal arguments supposedly meant to determine Alice's race ended up exposing the slipperiness of racial categories, even as both sides employed racial as well as gender stereotypes to make their case. The prosecution's star witness, for example, was Al Jolson, the most famous blackface performer of the day. "The image of Al Jolson next to Alice and George Jones [her father]," write Lewis and Ardizzone, "drew into sharper focus the impossibly thin line separating blacks and whites in America, and the anxiety that closeness produced."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  In the end, the trial threw into strong relief popular beliefs about racial distinctions. As an editorial in the <i>Messenger</i> put it, when it comes to race as well as sex, "deception is the rule."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  The cover of the <i>Messenger,</i> with its masthead, "The World's Greatest Negro Journal," for that month (December 1925) illustrates just how ambiguous race may be, and how unreliable "ocular evidence" can be (<a href="#4"> 4</a>).
</p>

<p>
Four years later in Britain, Colonel Victor Barker, alias Valerie Arkell-Smith (<a href="#5"> 5</a>), was tried for perjury in 1929 for passing as man. In this case, the identity of her sex was not in dispute, nor was her sexuality the legal issue, even though she was married to a woman. The perjury trial centered on what we now call gender identity, raising questions about how to classify this anomalous woman. The spectacle of the closely cropped Arkell-Smith, forced to wear a dress throughout the trial, testifying that she had always felt herself to be a man before a male judge wearing a gown and a wig of curls, must have struck witnesses even then as perverse&#x02014;and this at a time when the androgynous fashions of the day and the "New Woman" were arousing anxiety over what were thought to be clear-cut sex differences. As Laura Doan points out in her article on this trial, "Passing Fashions," from which this photo is taken, "The whole point of twenties fashion was that no one knew for sure" one's gender or sexual preference.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  "No age," Virginia Woolf wrote in the same year as the trial, "can ever have been as stridently sex-conscious as our own."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>

called into question the binary system of gender classification that Arkell-Smith's case also challenged. What struck many anthropologists in the 1920s as a sexual perversion, the <i>la'mana</i>&#x02014;called "the Berdache" by colonialists who saw them as homosexual transvestites or male prostitutes and called "two-spirit people" in many American Indian cultures today&#x02014;undergo a ceremony that marks their passage into a new identity and a third gender. That is, they literally pass over. In a later essay, Parsons writes: "This native theory of the institution of the man-woman is a curious commentary, is it not, on that thorough-going belief in the intrinsic difference between the sexes which is so tightly held to in our own culture."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  How tightly is revealed in a 1925 report by the Indian Rights Association that I found at the Newberry. In an effort to discredit the views of anthropologist F.W. Hodge, the report mocks the "gullability . . . of some scientists" for accepting We-Wha (<a href="#6"> 6</a>) as a woman. "'We-Wha' is probably the best joke the American Indian ever played on men and women of trained minds . . . . whose training was such that they would be expected to know the difference between a man and a woman."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Given that a <i>la'mana</i> is buried in women's attire on the male side of the cemetery, that difference may not be so clear-cut.

The trials and the Zuni ritual raise the question of whether identity is ever anything other than a performance. In presenting an image of oneself to others, "there is finally no getting away from the stage," writes Finkeilkraut (<i>IJ,</i> 172). The point is brought home in this famous image of Josephine Baker (<a href="#7"> 7</a>). In this musical production, <i>The Chocolate Dandies</i> , Baker is passing as black insofar as blackface performance brings out the performativity rather than the authenticity of blackness. As Eric Lott writes, blackface performance stages racial categories; it produces blackness and whiteness as racial identities to be assumed, making a spectacle out of racial difference and keeping blackness "on display and up for grabs."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup> </p>

Often racial impersonation is motivated by legal or social strictures. Susan Kohner played Sarah Jane (<a href="#8"> 8</a>) in Douglas Sirk's 1959 <i>Imitation of Life,</i> a remake (or rather, makeover) of John Stahl's 1934 film based on Fanny Hurst's novel. Although Fredi Washington, an African American actress, played the original role of Peola in the 1934 production, in Sirk's version, a white Jewish woman passes as a black woman passing as a white non-Jewish woman, because in 1959, a real black woman could not kiss a white man, as the revised script called for. The shock of the film depended on the viewer's willing suspension of disbelief that Kohner is black.
</p>

<p>
Thirty years later another Jewish woman impersonates a black woman. Although Sandra Bernhard (<a href="#9"> 9</a>) does not don blackface in <i>Without You I'm Nothing</i> , her campy performances create an effect closely related to minstrelsy. Bernhard impersonating Nina Simone is likely to be deemed more culpable than Susan Kohner playing Sarah Jane, if only because Bernhard plays herself playing Nina Simone and flaunts our racialized fantasies of identification. What disturbs many critics of her film, 

<b></b>

I suggest elsewhere, is that Bernhard's self-conscious performance brings to mind our racial fantasies and our own forms of passing, as critics of popular culture, and moreover, that she makes no effort to disavow them; she does not insist, "I'm not Madonna." Bernhard does not fall back on a notion of her "real" subject position (as a lesbian or a Jew) to save herself from exposure or to defend her forays across racial boundaries.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Thus Bernhard refuses to sanction the belief that the desires and motivations fostering crossover performances can be controlled, as if one could engage in border crossing without running the risk of being accused of passing.</p>

Anna Deavere Smith passing as a Jewish man in <i>Fires in the Mirror</i> (<a href="#0"> 10</a>) does not arouse as much anger as Bernhard, perhaps because Smith is impersonating everyday people, not cultural icons, and speaking their words. Still, her act of speaking for and as another implicates her in a common structure of passing, and her theory of American identity as identity in motion, always being negotiated, works against a notion of authenticity as much as does Bernhard's camp. On stage it takes Smith about twenty seconds to pass as someone else: identity in motion is accelerated indeed.

Tourism and travel produce their own forms of passing that are not explicit performances. Sergei Eisenstein in Mexico (<a href="#1"> 11</a>) might well have aroused Lawrence's contempt by dressing native. Donning the attire of the region, like surrounding oneself with the cultural artifacts of native peoples, is often considered a form of passing, rering the self by appropriating the cultural markers of another's identity. One can hear Lawrence's contemputuous voice: "put on a sombrero and knot a red kerchief round your neck . . . that is the New Mexico known to most Americans"&#x02014;or in this case, the Mexico known to a Russian.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Yet in his autobiography, <i>Immoral Memories,</i> Eisenstein expresses what Mexico meant to him in terms very like Lawrence's on New Mexico. Eisenstein writes: "During my encounter with Mexico, it seemed to me to be, in all the variety of its contradictions, a sort of outward projection of all those individual lines and features which I carried and carry within me like a tangle of complexes"<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> </p>

D. H. Lawrence was not one to dress native; his writings express contempt for those who did and for the tourist's superficial interest in native culture. "I cannot cluster at the drum anymore,"<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  he wrote. And yet in his paintings, Lawrence portrays himself 

<b></b>

in a kind of blackface (<a href="#2"> 12</a>), racializing masculinity, as he does in "The Woman Who Rode Away." In this story the Chilchui of Mexico, insistently described as black, represent a primal maleness, and the American woman (who seeks self-transformation among the Indians) personifies the white race that must be sacrificed to restore both spiritual and sexual harmony to the materialist West. Lawrence may not have identified with natives the way Collier and Eisenstein did; indeed, he portrayed himself as an outsider to both whites and natives in New Mexico. But his paintings and fiction tell another story.

Granted, my examples push to the limit the notion of "passing," and may seem to beg the question of the difference between any two instances. Surely, we think, there is a world of difference between Mabel Dodge marrying a Pueblo Indian and promoting Indian art; Elsie Clews Parsons adopting an Indian identity following her hair washing ceremony with the Hopi; and Mary Austin's adoption of an Indian persona in her poetry. Surely Barbara Johnson's essays on African American literature differ markedly from Carl Van Vechten's <i>Nigger Heaven,</i> a novel which struck many, including Lawrence, as cashing in on the fad of the New Negro. In his 1926 review of <i>Nigger Heaven</i> and Walter White's <i>Flight,</i> Lawrence writes that in reading these novels, one is disappointed

to discover that the "Negroid soul &#x02026; is an Edison gramophone &#x02026; which is what the white man's soul is, just the same" ("NM," 362). For Lawrence, such "passing" across racial boundaries risks homogenizing the differences (actual and imagined) necessary to identification. Yet Wallace Thurman, in his <i>Messenger</i> review of <i>Nigger Heaven,</i> found the novel to "pulsate" with the "genuine rhythms peculiar to Harlem." Johnson may ratively position herself as black (an argument Elizabeth Abel has made in "Black Writing, White Reading"), but Van Vechten, says Thurman, may literally be mistaken "in the provinces as another Negro writer."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Miguel Covarrubias's portrait of Van Vechten, entitled "A Prediction" (<a href="#3"> 13</a>), could be seen to bear out the truth of both Thurman's and Lawrence's reviews.

However, despite this anxiety about the conflation of various forms of passing, precisely one point I make in my use of the term is that one cannot always tell the difference, nor, I argue, should we even want to make responsibility&#x02014;whether artistic, moral, or political&#x02014;depend on refining the boundaries between appropriate crossings and appropriative ones. Indeed, it is the belief that we must draw the line between forms of passing that leads even those as smart and self-aware as Barbara Johnson to the anxiety reflected in her remark, "I don't want to be another Carl Van Vechten."
</p>

<p>
Modernist writers, from Lawrence in his review of <i>Nigger Heaven</i> and Walter White's <i>Flight,</i> to Heba Jannath in her essay on passing in Nancy Cunard's <i>Negro Anthology,</i> to Parsons in her essay on the Zuni <i>la'mana,</i> have portrayed passing as betraying conventional markers of racial or sexual difference, undermining the belief in intrinsic differences. Contemporary critics have also reconceived the social practice of passing, presenting it neither as fraudulence nor selling out but as a performative act and a strategic intervention that exposes systems of racial or sexual oppression. For both modernist and contemporary writers, passing undermines the reliability of the binary logic of identity (you are either black or white), thereby exposing, in Harryette Mullen's words, "the actual fluidity of ostensibly rigid racial [or sexual] boundaries."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
When it comes to its metaphoric use, however&#x02014;when passing is applied to a situation in which one impersonates or represents another, speaking as or for a class of people&#x02014;it is still commonly conceived, as it was by Lawrence, in terms of inauthenticity and appropriation. The very disruption of rigid racial, sexual, or ethnic boundaries brought about by passing as a social practice leads to the fear that the notion of fluid boundaries can, if taken too far, suggest that anyone can change one's racial or sexual identification at will, can, in effect, become someone else. As one letter to the editor on Madeleine Albright's case put it, this is a free country and she can be whatever she wants to be.
</p>

<p>
Well, no she can not, but that is the worry: namely, that "category crisis," the term by which Majorie Garber designates "a borderline that becomes permeable, that permits of border crossings from one (apparently distinct) category to another," will lead to what Phillip Brian Harper calls "category collapse."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  That is, destabilizing identity categories risks the loss of all distinctions. The fear that crisis means collapse leads to a search for guarantees of motivation and import: I am not John Collier. Passing, in my conceptualization of the term, requires learning to live and act without such guarantees.
</p>

<p>
Marianna Torgovnick, whose 1990 book, <i>Gone Primitive,</i> exposes forms of passing in modernist culture, makes an argument that has become common in critiques of psychic blackface: "When we say 'caveat nobody' and revel in the postmodern melange of us and them, we are in danger of abjuring responsibilities every bit as grave as those evaded when the early colonists decided that land could be taken from colonized peoples . . . to make way for Western modernization."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  I question two assumptions here: one, that the melange of us and them, the loss of definitional distinctions, is characteristic of <i>post</i>modernism, and two, that the breakdown of identity boundaries is analogous to a raid upon another's territory. This moral argument conceives identities as bounded, like territories, so that it is easy to determine who is guilty and who is victimized in 

<b></b>

border crossing. But the responsibility modernist forms of passing have thrust upon us, the responsibility we abjure through the territorial metaphor, is to understand identity as dynamic, more like a wave, a transfer of energy from point to point, than like the transfer of land. I prefer "passing" to the more common term "performativity" to describe this concept of identity because passing brings out the historical emergence of this concept in actual social practices (not linguistic or philosophical theories) within a specific historical context. That context is late modernity.

<p class="noIndent">
Important as social passing and passing fashions were in upsetting rigid boundaries and making those border res, the androgyne and the mulatto, the cultural icons of a generation, another development in the early twentieth century had a more profound effect on passing: technology. Through the swift dissemination of cultural products (e.g., music, literature, fashion) worldwide by means of new technologies and the forces of mass culture, the borders separating nations and geographic regions, like those separating races and genders, became permeable and insecure. The "masthead" of British <i>Vogue</i> in the 1920s&#x02014;"VOGUE KNOWS NO FRONTIERS"&#x02014;captures the modernist sensibility of unlimited boundary crossing inspired by new modes of transportation, such as the motor car and the airplane, and new means of communication, such as the gramophone and the radio.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Such border crossing, facilitated by new technologies and fueled by an increasingly touristic and consumer culture in the interwar period, had a profound effect on the imagining of national and personal identity in modernist cultural productions.
</p>

<p>
New technologies enabled border crossing by making travel more accessible and affordable. It may strike us as amusing today that Lawrence wrote in a letter to Mabel Dodge Luhan that he would be arriving in San Francisco on such and such a day and since San Francisco was almost to Taos, he would soon be there. Of course, when one travels to Taos as Lawrence did by way of Ceylon, Australia, and Cuba, San Francisco seems fairly close. Still, the point is that by the early 1920s the world had become a much smaller place.
</p>

<p>
In 1924 Lawrence's access to Taos was facilitated by the increasingly affordable technology of the automobile. Road maps, a relatively new form of cartography in the late 1920s and 1930s, displayed images of women at the wheel (<a href="#4"> 14</a>), symbolizing their liberation by this new technology (though by the 1940s women were safely returned to the passenger seat). In Woolf's 1928 novel, Orlando enters the twentieth century with the magic of modern technology. At the sound of the clock striking the 11th of October 1928, Orlando runs downstairs, jumps into her motor car, presses the self-starter, and is off to Marshall &amp; Snelgrove's, where she is "shot smoothly upwards" in the lift: "The very fabric of life now, she thought as she rose, is magic."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Not only was travel facilitated, but new technologies also produced new sensory experiences (such as those Orlando undergoes while motoring), which in turn led to new concepts of national and personal identity. As Michele Pridmore-Brown puts it in her article 

<b></b>

on Woolf and technology, "Britain's island insularity offers no protection in the air age"&#x02014;that is, the age of airplanes and air waves.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup> </p>

New modes of transportation may have made the world "small and known," as Lawrence says in his essay "New Mexico": "There is no mystery left, we've been there, we've seen it, we know all about it. We've done the globe and the globe is done." But that, Lawrence concedes, is a superficial view. "Underneath," he writes, "is everything we don't know and are afraid of knowing" ("NM,"141). In his travels in Ceylon and the southwest, Lawrence underwent a new sensory or sensual experience, "an experience deep down in the senses," he writes, that is the "ancient race-self" ("NM,"144.) For Lawrence that experience of a primitive identity depends on an <i>unmediated</i> relation to the other; the superficial knowledge of others is for him a celluloid image proffered by the filmmakers. On the other hand, in her 1926 essay, "The Cinema," Woolf locates the primitive experience not <i>against</i> but precisely <i>in</i> the new technology of the cinema: "People say that the savage no longer exists in us, that we are at the fag-end of civilization, that everything has been said already . . . But these philosophers have presumably forgotten the movies. They have never seen the savages of the twentieth-century watching the pictures."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The relation between new technologies, especially new recording devices such as cameras and gramophones, and primitivism is elaborated by Michael Taussig in his fascinating study <i>Mimesis and Alterity.</i> Taussig's important contribution to modernist studies is his argument that recording machines, "whose job it is to reproduce likeness," reveal "the intimate relationship between primitivism and the new theories of the 

<b></b>

senses circulating with the new means of reproduction."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  New technologies induced, in Taussig's words, "a tremor in cultural identity . . . in the security of Being itself" (<i>MAA,</i> 226). The experience of "voice divorced from sight" that Gillian Beer writes was made possible by radio and phonographs, the "unconscious optics" that Walter Benjamin says was introduced by the camera and revealed new structural formations of the subject, contributed to that "tremor in cultural identity," what Theodor Adorno calls the "shudder of mimesis" (<i>MAA,</i> 211).<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In his essay "On the Mimetic Faculty," Benjamin writes that "the gift of seeing resemblances is nothing other than a rudiment of the powerful compulsion in former times to become and behave like something else"&#x02014;that is, to pass.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  That compulsion, which Benjamin associates with the primitive, manifests itself in the modernist period in various and fascinating ways, from tourists dressing in native attire, to new hair products promising the Valentino or Josephine Baker look, to Western writers looking to other cultures for the spiritual values that supposedly eluded their own technological society. The increased mobility and newly permeable borders of the early-twentieth century&#x02014;made possible by new sound and visual technologies as much as by new modes of transportation&#x02014;made people aware (perhaps for the first time, at least on such a large scale) of the production of <i>cultural</i> identity, the way identity is mediated through various cultural forms. And this awareness distinguishes the performativity of modernism from the compulsion Benjamin identifies as mimetic. Technology has been both an incentive to and a medium for passing in this special sense. As Michael North points out in <i>Reading 1922,</i> new forms of mechanical reproduction in the modernist era&#x02014;such as photojournalism, broadcasting, and film&#x02014;differed from earlier forms in that the sound and visual images they produced appeared to be real while at the same time new technologies made the <i>fact</i> of mediation all the more apparent.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  The relation between technology and passing is implied by a line in Bonnie Kime Scott's essay in <i>Virginia Woolf in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.</i> Writing about the jazz records T.S. Eliot brought into Woolf's parlor, Scott remarks: "Victrolas crossed the color line."<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Scott's phrase explicitly invokes the social practice of passing and raised for me the question of how mechanical reproduction fostered passing, that desire to become something else.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The Americanization of popular culture throughout the world, Taussig notes, "owes an enormous amount to the music reproduced by the phonograph" (<i>MAA,</i> 198), and that musical export in the 1920s was predominantly jazz. An essay on jazz in Cunard's <i>Negro,</i> translated from the French by Samuel Beckett, draws an analogy between jazz and the surrealist movement as new modes of sensory experience. For "the intelligent and cultivated youth of Europe," writes Robert Goffin, "hot jazz is almost the only form of music that has any meaning for their disrupted generation."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  In his 1929 novel, <i>Banjo,</i> set in postwar Marseille, Claude McKay signals the importance of the gramophone in the chapter "Everybody Doing It":

<p>
My point is that we might more accurately refer to the <i>Afra</i>mericanization of popular culture by new technologies.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  In his essay, "Jazz at Home," published in Alain Locke's <i>The New Negro,</i> J. A. Rogers remarks that jazz "ranks with the movie and the dollar as the foremost exponent of modern Americanism."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  The New Negro craze fueled by the popularity of jazz was propelled across the Atlantic by the talking machine, the wireless, and the cinema. Jazz, Rogers says, "bears all the marks of a nerve-strung, strident, mechanized civilization,"<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  signifying modernity in what Taussig calls the "technological substance" of its identity, but also in the way it excited passing. Identity in the modernist era, I argue, was not just mechanized, it was <i>racialized</i> by new technologies. That is to say, the age of mechanical reproduction introduced certain cultural shifts that made it increasingly necessary to think about race as a component of identity formation, inspiring new fantasies and new possibilities of identity, whether Locke's New Negro or Toomer's blue man.
</p>

I use passing to name those practices by which we try to refuse the identities that have been historically offered to us, and that continue to structure our responses even as we seek to disavow them (often through that peculiar form of xenophobia I identified earlier). If for modernists, writing was a matter of effacing&#x02014;not expressing&#x02014;the self, today self-disclosure seems far more pressing. Getting personal, breaking silence, coming out&#x02014;these are the moral imperatives of our postmodern age. Yet as Sissela Bok writes in her book on the ethics of concealment, the metaphor of the closet with its language of private space and inside/outside boundaries personalizes interpersonal, dynamic practices.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  If coming out after Eve Sedgwick et al. is no longer an unqualified good, then passing need no longer have a negative presumption against it from the beginning. Moral responsibility, Bok argues, requires being mindful of the processes of (self)-deception and how they are imputed, to whom, on what grounds, and with what power to bring about change.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  In our anxious effort to impute passing in the pejorative sense to others engaged in practices very like our own, we risk foreclosing on the transformative possibilities opened up by modernist border crossings.

<p>
By way of returning to my point about identity as a wave rather than a territory, I end with a quotation from Virginia Woolf's 1931 novel, <i>The Waves.</i>

Nella Larsen dedicated her novel <i>Passing</i> to him in what I would like to think is a bit of sardonic humor on Larson's part but which I believe was a sincere gesture.

Ann Douglas has drawn a connection between modernist art and new technologies (9, 14&#x02013;20), yet in her discussion of modernist performances, she uses concepts such as <i>impersonation, masquerade, artifice,</i> and <i>disguise</i> to describe the phenomena I discuss as forms of passing, implying in her word choice that modernists were simply imitating blacks or appropriating black cultural forms. Clearly Douglas grasps the difficulty of making such distinctions when she concedes that these forms of imitation "were not so easily donned and doffed" as one might think  and refers to this "double mimicry" as an "especially American kind of art" . Yet for Douglas, "terrible honesty" means "the facing of facts, exposing of pretence" , that is, drawing clear-cut distinctions. (I am not unaware of the irony of this note, for all its insistence that I'm not Ann Douglas.)

We are preoccupied with events, even when we do not observe them closely. We have a sense of upheaval. We feel threatened. We look from an uncertain present toward a more uncertain future. One feels the desire to collect oneself against all this in poetry as well as in politics. . . . Resistance is the opposite of escape. The poet who wishes to contemplate the good in the midst of confusion is like the mystic who wishes to contemplate God in the midst of evil. There can be no thought of escape. Both the poet and the mystic may establish themselves on herrings and apples. The painter may establish himself on a guitar, a copy of ro and a dish of melons. These are fortifyings, although irrational ones. The only possible resistance to the pressure of the contemporaneous is a matter of herrings and apples or, to be less definite, the contemporaneous itself. In poetry, to that extent, the subject is not the contemporaneous, because that is only the nominal subject, but the poetry of the contemporaneous. Resistance to the pressure of ominous and destructive circumstance consists of its conversion, so far as possible, into a different, an explicable, an amenable circumstance.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>

Toward the end of his career Wallace Stevens had been thinking of George Santayana, that old philosopher in a hospital in Rome, editing his manuscripts even on his deathbed; and perhaps he recalled his teacher's definition of the poet's art, "the art of intensifying emotions by assembling the scattered objects that naturally arouse [him]."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  That process of assembly, suggesting an analogy with still life, is a labor Stevens describes throughout his work, and at times he would draw explicitly on the art of still life to stimulate and represent his art.
</p>

<p>
Yet Stevens presents a curious case in the story of modernist obsessions with objects. While he proclaims his desire for "the 

<b></b>

thing itself," he offers few metonymies and almost no sensory description.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  In the late poem "Local Objects" we are offered no samples of those things "more precious than the most precious objects of home" (<i>CPP,</i> 473). We know only that the retrospective speaker understood that he "was a spirit without a foyer" and that these objects are of "a world without a foyer." Perhaps this is why he does not describe them; though objects can through metaphor be transported to the room of the spirit, there is no common room in language between authentic spirit and the actual world. Yet these "few things / For which a fresh name always occurred," (never, then, merely denotative objects) are "the objects of insight" and thus, through the ambiguity in "of," issuing from world and from spirit. As such they create an image of "that serene he had always been approaching / As toward an absolute foyer beyond romance," where spirit and world might meet (<i>CPP,</i> 474).
</p>

<p>
The late, retrospective "Local Objects" employs a language of domestic tranquility that we might well associate with the art of still life. As in still life, the objects seem to be there "of their own accord, / Because he desired" (ibid). But in the earlier "Man Carrying Thing" the activity is intense and exposed, far from the environment of still life (<i>CPP,</i> 306). The work obeys its opening dictum that "the poem must resist the intelligence / Almost successfully." The thing is obscure and the effort relentless. Man carrying thing is man making metaphor&#x02014;poetry as transport or at least transportation. (The poem was published in the volume called <i>Transport to Summer.</i>) In carrying something from here to there, in relating the "uncertain" parts of reality, man pursues the revelation of "the obvious whole." But the drama of the poem is in the "snow storm of secondary things" (man-handled, partial, and obscure) we must endure before the dawn of this "bright obvious."
</p>

<p>
That storm of secondary things dominates the volume <i>Parts of a World,</i> which Stevens wrote in the wake of the Depression and the onset of World War II. Then the whole was far from obvious; this was a period "of a storm we must endure all night, . . . a horror of thoughts that suddenly are real" (ibid). I wish to consider Stevens's curious turn in this stormy time to the art of still life, and to suggest that this art is less (as one might expect) a retreat from the storm than a means of contemplating and resisting it. The conspicuous artifice of still life as a local human arrangement allowed Stevens the shelter of an order from which to feel remote disturbances. The objects of still life are not described as things in themselves in part because Stevens refuses their utopian autonomy, reconnecting the res of his private experience to an uncertain, changing ground of actualities.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The study of Stevens's still life poems calls up complex issues of reference. In <i>Wallace Stevens and the Actual World,</i> Alan Filreis discusses Stevens's work and imagination within the context of American culture and politics during the war years and after. Against the image of the enclosed world of the poem, Filreis describes Stevens's attention to historical reality as an instance of the American isolationist tendency, to know facts at a distance and selectively, and with a mixture of disengagement and commitment. Filreis offers a nuanced and particular analysis of Stevens's development in these terms, moving toward a final postwar phase of "rhetorical power . . . that would 

<b></b>

at once reconstruct and contain the world."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Filreis portrays the poet as sometimes informed and sometimes willfully ignorant of, but always engaged with the historical reality in which he lived. Central to his argument is the poet's postwar correspondence with Barbara Church, in which he reveals a will to control and mediate his sense of the European reality, to sustain a "postcard-knowledge" (<i>AC,</i> 227). This same image of the postcard has led Sarah Riggs, on the other hand, to describe Stevens as a poet who practices "materialist-resistant methods" (<i>WS,</i> 6). The verbal reality of the poem constitutes a "blacking out of indexical referents" just as the turning of a postcard to read its message blocks access to its photographic image. Stevens's "evocation of history and the actual world are a ruse, and what he is most after is a highly complex and sublimated poetic critique of the idea of reality <i>tout court</i>" (ibid). An examination of Stevens's still life poems may suggest a stance distinct from either of these readings, materialist or autotelic. The fictional space of the still life is neither a means of protecting an idealized illustration of the actual world, nor a scene of resistance to indices of material reality, but rather a trope for that "foyer" in which imagination and world might meet.
</p>

<p>
A few of Stevens's still life poems of the late 1930s and early 1940s are well known&#x02014;the propositional "Study of Two Pears," which turns on cubist experiments in perspective; and "The Poems of Our Climate," which emphasizes impressionist light and color in its "clear water in a brilliant bowl, / Pink and white carnations," for instance (<i>CPP,</i> 180, 178). In both of these poems the perfect "thing itself" eludes description or fails to satisfy, and the poems become "compounded" with human desire and imperfection. Critics generally treat these poems in ahistorical terms of aesthetics and philosophy. But Stevens wrote a number of other, lesser known poems within this genre during 1938&#x02013;1940. Collectively and individually they capture Stevens's thinking about "the thing" in a public as well as cognitive "climate" of turmoil. I do not mean to suggest that the images of Stevens's still life are indices of the material world or metonymies of the historical landscape. They are aesthetic objects suspended in an artificial space of contemplation, but they provide a starting point from the private "climate" of meditation to the "climate" of the times. The connection is less substantive or referential than relational, as the energies of a disturbed world enter the field of artistic expression. In this way the still life poems reveal Stevens's thinking about the relationship of art to history.
</p>

<p>
Stevens's interest in his Dutch ancestry naturally drew him to the genre of still life; and this interest was further sparked, as Glen MacLeod has shown, by an exhibition in Hartford in 1938, which included a range of achievement in the genre. I agree with MacLeod, who follows art critic Norman Bryson in associating still life with the value of the ordinary and the common&#x02014;growing terms in Stevens's vocabulary as he sought a human scale.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  But "the common" has never functioned on a simple, metonymic plane in Stevens's work. And MacLeod is wrong, I think, to draw a distinction between Stevens's attraction to "the common" and his later concern with the heroic. As the pressure of reality enters the world of domestic arrangement, the imagination participates in the heroic.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
This turn toward still life is a departure from Stevens's earlier work, in which he had continued the Romantic preoccupation with landscape. Indeed, in "Sunday Morning" Stevens is restive among bourgeois objects, within the "complacencies of the peignoir" and the breakfast still life of "late / Coffee and oranges" (<i>CPP,</i> 53). Where still life images do arise in <i>Harmonium,</i> as in "Anecdote of the Jar," they center and define a landscape rather than a domestic space (<i>CPP,</i> 60). Stevens's jar may signify the object as container rather than surface, a thing to put ideas in and also an ideational transparency around which things can be organized. (Stevens's jar in Tennessee is like Heidegger's jug in "Thing," a void constituted by the container, and a gathering of earth and sky.)<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  When the imperial speaker places his jar in Tennessee he makes the planet his table. Toward the end of his career Stevens would reverse this expansive logic, contemplating his <i>Collected Poems</i> as "the planet on the table" (<i>CPP,</i> 450). Late Stevens does not take dominion, but expresses a feeling of intimacy and kinship between his words and "the planet of which they were part." However, in <i>Parts of a World</i> Stevens is still working out the crisis of a fragmented world, the collapse of the sense of ordered reality that sustained such earlier landscape poems as "The Idea of Order at Key West." In <i>Parts of a World</i> the landscape intimidates. He writes "The Dwarf," in which the speaker is diminished by the pressure of the external world. He describes "a weak mind in the mountains" (<i>CPP,</i> 192). So it is not surprising that he should turn to the shallower, smaller, more limited and private space of still life, and to the modest aesthetic arrangement of domestic objects.
</p>

<p>
Stevens's turn toward still life in <i>Parts of a World</i> could easily have been a turn away from the world about him, a retreat into the personal, domestic aesthetic. Still life traditionally stands at the antipode of history painting, fixing an image most often beneath the concerns of history. Its depiction of everyday, household objects, and its removal of these objects from human agency, satisfies a longing for decorative order and plenitude, a utopian image of material culture. As such, still life has always been ranked lowest among the genres of painting. The genre was particularly appealing for modernist experimentation in the first decades of the century, precisely because these objects are empty of historical significance and can be experienced as pure form; when the peripheral <i>parergon</i> (fruit, flowers, and ornamental objects) became the <i>ergon</i> or central subject, formalism prevailed. But Stevens's turn to still life is not, as we shall see, a turn away from the world into the complacencies of the peignoir, into petit bourgeois concerns, or into formalism. The world consistently finds its way into the space of still life, challenging the poet's quietude. These tentative, partial spaces of order and beauty provide a conduit to the world without annihilating the personal. Stevens's still life meditations tell a story less of mastery and appropriation than of imaginative and emotional connection to a world from which they are apart but also a part; a world heterogeneous, dynamic, and perishable.
</p>

<p>
<i>Parts of a World</i> ends with an unusual prose comment by Stevens that directly addresses the experience of scale, and of proximity and distance, in the pressure of a world at war. I quote just a few sentences of this two-paragraph passage:

<b></b>

</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The immense poetry of war and the poetry of a work of the imagination are two different things . . . the poetry of war as a consciousness of the victories and defeats of nations, is a consciousness of fact, but of heroic fact, of fact on such a scale that the mere consciousness of it affects the scale of one's thinking and constitutes a participating in the heroic.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

[<i>CPP,</i> 251]

</div>

<p>
Stevens goes on to acknowledge that "in recent times everything tends to become real, or, rather, that everything moves in the direction of reality." But the work of the imagination in its "struggle with fact" is to come back to fact "not to what it was" but to "what we wanted fact to be." This distinction helps to explain why the poems in the volume to which this is a conclusion resist description or even sensory engagement. But it does <i>not</i> explain why so many of these poems (at least seven) are still lifes&#x02014;meditations on small scale decorative and domestic objects, on what art historians call "rhopography" or "low plane reality." One would expect a volume concerned with heroic fact to choose history or at least portraiture as its genre. What have these pink and white carnations, these bottles and pears and sundries of the table, to do with "the immense poetry of war"? The intimate scale of still life might suggest a poet nourishing himself on the sweets of art for art's sake while the world tears itself to pieces in the quest for bread. But "we are preoccupied with events even when we do not observe them closely" (<i>CPP,</i> 788). These poems do not isolate a purely aesthetic space, a mere poetry of the imagination. Nor, on the other hand, do they approach the common objects of the table as peripheral, irrelevant matter in a world of heroic fact. I wish to show how "the immense poetry of war" and the call to "heroic consciousness" enter into Stevens's art of still life, without reconstituting the gigantic that troubles him. More than landscape or portraiture, still life is a threshold genre, between nature and culture, vital and morbid, private and public worlds. Indeed, in choosing still life Stevens insists on preserving an individual human scale of contemplation, a sense of the personal and the intimate with its accompanying desires; but he presents this effort as a struggle for tentative, partial experiences of order and beauty always involved in a greater reality that gives them vitality and refuses them stability. In this way Stevens's still life brings the splintered planet to the table.
</p>

<p>
That Stevens was never merely a "poet of the mind," but also always a poet of the world, "preoccupied by events," has been powerfully documented and analyzed by Alan Filreis not only in <i>Wallace Stevens and the Actual World,</i> which studies Stevens through World War II and the Cold War, but also in <i>Modernism From Right to Left: Wallace Stevens, the Thirties, and Literary Radicalism,</i> which traces shifts in Stevens's political sentiments through the 1930s up to the onset of war. Filreis describes Stevens "traveling a way outward toward wartime and postwar peripheries from a central, unmoving prewar identity" (<i>AC,</i> xv). I want to suggest that this movement also describes the structure of many of his still life poems as they shift from the "here" of still life contemplation to the "there" of distant events. Stevens read two newspapers every day; and "the day's news" brought conflicts between capital and labor, "Japan brutalizing China; Italy invading Ethiopia, Falangist rebellion strangling Spain."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Stevens's poems 

<b></b>

of the 1930s are meditations, Filreis shows, of the artist's role in a disturbed society, part of a widespread literary and cultural debate in which Stevens participated. The poet's improvisations on still life objects feel, I argue, this pressure of news. As the genre of the table and of the fruits of labor and economic exchange, still life is a site of reflections on hunger and poverty. As the genre of composure and peace, still life is a site of reflections on war and cultural transformation. These reflections do not take on the quality of social realism or any strictly indexical relation to history; politically charged references become associated with philosophically charged themes. But their historical import is not thereby erased. Writing within a still life tradition Stevens confronts contemporary challenges (from both popular and intellectual circles) to the aesthetic and to the personal, and brings the heroic and ethical into relation with these. Given the emotional range of Stevens's writing, it is striking that almost all of the still life poems introduce an element of violence. The violence from without threatens the security of the contemplative order; but by bringing that public violence into the personal, Stevens makes still life a field of action rather than a space of escape. The arrangements of still life are violently achieved and inevitably torn apart. And in <i>Parts of a World</i> this leaves Stevens vexed and uneasy.
</p>

<p>
Susan Stewart, in her book <i>On Longing: Narratives of the Miniature, the Gigantic, the Souvenir, the Collection,</i> has associated still life with "the disease of nostalgia":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Whereas still life speaks to the cultural organization of the material world, it does so by concealing history and temporality; it engages in an illusion of timelessness. The message of the still life is that nothing changes; the instant described will remain as it is in the eye of the beholder, the individual perceiving subject.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Still life collapses distance into proximity and past and future into present. Bryson has made similar remarks about still life's lack of narrative interest. For him, "still life is the world minus its narrative, or better, the world minus its capacity for generating narrative interest."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  But Stevens's lyric poems reinscribe that narrative interest, less in material histories of arranged objects (who grew or picked the pears we are studying?), but in dramas of disruption and assembly that represent the contingencies of form. Stevens is certainly tempted by the seductions of the still moment and its suspension of historical process, and his great subject is desire as it is aroused by the sensuous world he seeks to make personal; but by giving voice to the sensibility that yearns for this plenitude, he exposes the troubled, restless state that surrounds still life's orders.
</p>

<p>
In "A Dish of Peaches in Russia," for instance, Stevens evokes a utopia of sensuous, erotic pleasure, the utopia of still life and its myth of presence (<i>CPP,</i> 206). The imagery seems in the spirit of one of Fantin-Latour's many paintings of peaches. But before we are through the second line of the poem, this spell has been broken, and we enter a story of exile. The speaker who tastes, smells, and sees the peaches does not inhabit the space "where they are." Through the double reference to Russia, the exile of self-consciousness from integral being becomes linked to real exile under Stalinist terror, and the latter is not simply absorbed as metaphor. We might recall the real Russian exile who kept a shack near the Hartford dump, the likely model for the "man on the 

<b></b>

dump" who sifts through the ruins of his past (<i>CPP,</i> 184). The still life image here, the dish of peaches in Russia, evokes nostalgia in the I-as-Russian for a feudal utopia of "the colors of my village / And of fair weather, summer, dew and peace."
</p>

<p>
Like many modern American poets, Stevens believed that imagination was fundamentally nurtured by place and that the best art came from local soil. But he was surrounded by &#x000E9;migr&#x000E9;s, and the news coming out of Europe was all about invasion and displacement. One feels this historical pressure against the other examples of indigenous feeling in the poem. The "black Spaniard plays his guitar" against a background of civil war (and just a few years before, Lorca, poet of the gypsy guitarists, had been murdered by Franco's henchmen); the Angevine absorbs Anjou (recalling "Study of Two Pears") as Germany advances on France. Into the window of reverie come the "ferocities" of modern class and national conflict; these are not just pressures from without, they become pressures from within that "tear one self from another." I am not suggesting that these poems are "about" specific historical phenomena; but neither can we see these historical references as a "ruse," as Riggs suggests, in the game of poetic self-circulation (<i>WS,</i> 16). Rather, the vibrations of history are transported into the meditative space, creating a relational rather than a substantive or referential connection between art and history. Still life evolves, paradoxically, into a scene of profound dynamism and instability for Stevens, in which temporality and history prevail.
</p>

<p>
In "A Dish of Peaches in Russia," then, the speaker yearns for a consummation with solid objects, a being in his "whole body" that consciousness (and, I have argued, historical reality) denies him. "The Glass of Water" defines the opposite move, from a purely transparent thing in metaphysical poise (still life's megalography or spiritual transration) to opaque materiality and waste (still life's rhopography or its detritus) (<i>CPP,</i> 181). Shifting center to periphery, <i>ergon</i> and <i>parergon,</i> the poem moves from the "here" of poetic meditation to the "here" of locality and history, a move always mediated by "ideas." The poem is difficult to follow, and this is deliberate; the language imitates this logic of increasing density and opacity.
</p>

<p>
What could arouse a fuller image of composure, purity, reflection and refreshment than a poem entitled "The Glass of Water"? What could seem less thing-like than this transparence? Yet Stevens is restive in such a place of ideality, a sphere of romance, as he says in "Local Objects," "with so few objects of its own" (<i>CPP,</i> 73). The poem explores violent refraction of the metaphysical and moves toward the formlessness and opacity of being. The center shifts from the metaphysical to the mental and textual, and then to the material. Coming directly after "Study of Two Pears" (in which "the pears are not seen as the observer wills"), "The Glass of Water" again creates a sense of tension between will and world, ideas and objects" (<i>CPP,</i> 180). But from the outset it posits the physical and the metaphysical as indeterminate, metamorphic conditions, not only polar in relation to each other but containing dynamic polarities within themselves. The poem begins in a straightforward, demonstrative language, but one senses the anxiety behind this unstable identity of ideas and things; neither the glass of water nor its metaphysical type is a transparent center, but only a swirl of parts that don't make a whole, a flux of states without equilibrium where the container dissolves into the contained:

<b></b>

</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">

<p>
The opening thought in this poem is stimulated by still life's formal play of surfaces and textures&#x02014;liquid water against solid glass, light coming in and distorting surfaces. Stevens also exploits the genre's iconographic potential. MacLeod reads the poem as an ecphrasis, claiming that the inventive line "Light / Is the lion that comes down to drink" derives from the lion image etched on a Netherlandish goblet Stevens saw reproduced in an art magazine.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Whatever its source, the lion in Stevens is always a metaphor for natural energy that makes objects visible, and for poetic will that transforms objects&#x02014;the light of the mind. Is there a foundational center to all this metamorphosis? "Here in the center stands the glass." "Here"&#x02014;at the opening of stanza two, or in the metaphysical realm, or in a referential space? The imagery and the syntax (in this ten-line sentence) tell us we are not indigenes of any center. Violence breaks out as the metaphysical breaks down. The lion stirs the water: "Ruddy are his eyes and ruddy are his claws / When light comes down to wet his frothy jaws." The contemplative "pool" is obscured by "winding weeds" of reflection and "the refractions, / The <i>metaphysica,</i> the plastic parts of poems / Crash in the mind."
</p>

<p>
Is this violence of <i>Parts of a World</i> a sign of the "heroic consciousness" that brings the imagination and the personal into relation with the "immense poetry of war"? As the weeds get thicker the "here" shifts from the glass to "the center of our lives" (to the imagination of fact), but our lives are not centered in contemporary history; the center is moving. (And the center is also eventually shared, not a private space any longer but a public space, a village.) The end of the poem confirms that the "<i>poles</i>" and "<i>states</i>" of physics and metaphysics referred to at the beginning take shape for the poet within the worldly struggle of <i>pol</i>itics and <i>state</i>hood.
</p>

<p>
The language of the last stanza moves us out of the still life environment and the mind's <i>metaphysica.</i> We enter a realm of contending ideologies and manipulations (or negligence?) of "politicians / Playing cards" on down to a condition of low plane reality: opaque, disorganized, undifferentiated materiality and waste of "dogs / and dung." But for Stevens this new centering is less a change of realms than a shift also from re to ground, where center yields to periphery, here evoking there and there becoming here:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
&nbsp; &nbsp;   &nbsp; &nbsp;  here in the centre, not the glass,
<br />
But in the centre of our lives, this time, this day,
<br />

<br />
Playing cards. In a village of the indigenes,
<br />
One would have still to discover. Among the dogs
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;  and dung,
<br />
One would continue to contend with one's ideas.

</div>

<p>
Rather than a retreat from contention, still life offers an orientation to the crashing parts of the world. While there is nothing "heroic" in the peripheral world of dogs and dung, the last line participates in the heroic by moving toward reality but also toward "what we want fact to be," a relation of center and periphery. Stevens has not chosen the path of modernist still life abstraction that, as Bryson says, "takes mundane reality only as its starting point."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  The still life environment absorbs a struggle that takes meaning from history. And there is a parallel here to Filreis's argument that Stevens, with America, was shifting away from an easy dichotomy. "Here" was no longer a timeless American stability and "there" an historical European conflict.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Filreis's argument builds from a reading of "Martial Cadenza," which Stevens writes in 1939 in explicit response to Poland's invasion. He seeks the "evening star," as a "present realized" against the present struggles of "England . . . France . . . . [or] the German camps" (<i>CPP,</i> 127). That evening star may represent the promise of art within the anguish of history. But Filreis contrasts this with another poem of the same year, "Man and Bottle," which shows Stevens resisting the retreat into "romantic tenements / Of rose and ice," instead describing "the mind" as "a man at the center of men" full of fury against "a grossness of peace," a complacent isolationism or aesthetic escapism (<i>CPP,</i> 218). We may observe here that the juxtaposition (and echo) of "man and bottle" is a familiar trope of modernist still life such as we find in the work of Picasso or Juan Gris. The bottle is a re for art, and it must stand alongside man as a center of tension rather than a spirit of consolation, containment, or evasive abstraction. So too the "glass of water" becomes a paperweight Stevens shakes to meditate on the "snow storm of secondary things," the world of contending ideologies.
</p>

<p>
In "Dry Loaf" we find a corollary to "The Glass of Water." This time the initiating focus is not on re but ground. MacLeod has persuasively associated the poem with a work by Mir&#x000F3; painted during the Spanish civil war, in which a loaf and a shoe loom in a stark, abstracted landscape of wavelike forms. Mir&#x000F3; worked from a Spanish tradition (from Mendez to Picasso), which sets still life in landscape. Mir&#x000F3; gives this juxtaposition a social and historical thrust by suggesting, in the eerie waves of color in the painting, the bloody upheavals of his native land. While Stevens does not live in the midst of these upheavals, his imagination responds to the news everywhere of poverty and war, forces that starve out imagination and hope; and he attempts to work from these horrors toward "what we want reality to be":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Regard now the sloping, mountainous rocks
<br />
And the river that batters its way over stones,
<br />
Regard the hovels of those that live in this land.

<p class="noIndent">
Here, it would seem, still life conforms to "the violent reality of war" and its consequences (<i>CPP,</i> 257). Stevens designs an aesthetic not of Hartford and its middle-class comforts, but of the "tragic time" in which he lives. Regardless of location, he suggests, we all stand before this bleak prospect. (No biblical transmogrifications here; the dry loaf will not feed the hungry.)

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Yet "Dry Loaf" is not a poem in which the imagination, even as a dry loaf, merely succumbs to reality, for the river over the stones becomes, as the poem undulates in clauses, a flock of birds. Imaginations even of "the dry men blown / Brown as the bread" (reduced, perhaps, to material craving) awaken "because it was spring and the birds had to come." The birds suggest escape at first, but as "watery flocks" they also promise transformation (unlike still life). The poet himself has a bird's-eye view. There are then two necessities, of arid rock and fluent river. Soldiers and birds become syntactically entwined here, both working together to move "in the direction of reality" transformed (<i>CPP,</i> 251). The soldier is a constant presence in Stevens's poems and often a challenge to the spirit of still life, but he is an ally to the poet who contends with his ideas. This "still life" is full of uncertain movement; it is "rolling, rolling, rolling." But if the poem takes the still life outdoors and turns our attention to the movement in the landscape, the presentation of a fixed object in the foreground&#x02014;the presentation of still life&#x02014;provides us with an orientation, a sense of arrangement and form, and a local and individual connection to the flux of history.
</p>

<p>
Historical change becomes thematically central in "Cuisine Bourgeoise" (<i>CPP,</i> 209). The historical transition between one order and another is grotesque, and the poem conveys its horror. HereStevens experiments with the <i>vanitas</i> mode of still life: skulls (or at least severed human heads) occupy the space of the table because we have turned in on ourselves; and we have yet to harvest anything new. "These days of disinheritance"
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
We feast on human heads, brought in on leaves,

Crowned with the first, cold buds. On these we live,

<p>
War is a time of negations rather than beliefs, and a time of cultural self-consumption, when the "table [is] a mirror" (another <i>vanitas</i> image) and not yet a setting of completely new objects; the "first cold buds" at this point simply add to the grotesquerie of this anti-pastoral. The cultural harvest has no fresh taste of reality. But to consume the "bitter meat" of failure is a preparation for the heroic, as the shift to third person plural at the end of the poem suggests. "Who, then, are they, seated here? / Is the table a mirror in which they sit and look? / Are they men eating reflections of themselves?" The implication is that man cannot live on reflections alone; he needs a new knowledge of reality to nurture his soul.
</p>

<p>
Biblical story echoes in this poem not just as a lost coherence but also for its analogies to modern times. The "ancient cake of seed" suggests the loss of ancestral (Judeo-Christian?) tradition. The poem was most likely inspired by Lucas Cranach's painting <i>The Feast of Herod,</i> which Chic Austin had recently acquired for the Hartford Atheneum in 1936 (<a href="#1"> 1</a>). Courtiers gather around a table set with plates and knives, ready to consume the head of John the Baptist, as servants bring in a plate full of grapes and other fruits and nuts. The line "The words are written, though not yet said," suggests

the writing on the wall at Belshazzar's Feast. These allusions hint that this modern crisis is a reverberation of earlier cultural transformations.</p>

<p>
Who, then, are "they" seated at the table, in a poem that began with "we"? What is the proper voice of a still life poem? In each of the works we have considered, the isolated "I" of lyric and the private space of still life have opened a foyer to the public; whether "the hungry that cried," "the soldiers that marched," the politicians who played cards, or all of us individually, "at the center of our lives," weave subject to the changes of history and cultural order. But this "we" at the end of "Cuisine Bourgeoise" must not solidify, must keep shedding into the "they" of past arrangements.
</p>

<p>
Fragmentation and disturbance are the conditions of the world when Stevens writes these poems in <i>Parts of a World.</i> They offer neither comprehensive ideas of order, nor contact with things in themselves. Stevens is Marxist only in this notion that ideology is a scrim between us and reality. We are "conceived in our conceits" and remain in a "prelude to objects." As Eleanor Cook has shown, Stevens here casts synecdoche in doubt. Part/whole relations are unresolved; the personal seems broken from, or crushed by, external events. Still life's rhopography, imagery of the trivia of everyday living, is not so easily transred to megalography, the numinous essence or the play of the spirit. Indeed, this volume also contains "The Man on the Dump," which subjects still life's personal arrangements and vain displays (the "bouquet," "the box / From Esthonia: the tiger chest, for tea") to the law of entropy and the will to destruction (<i>CPP,</i> 184). But if this is still life's destiny, it is not still life's only function. Stevens responds to a world torn in pieces, and he struggles within the still life aesthetic to achieve heroic 

<b></b>

consciousness that responds to fact but can imagine and therefore bring fact toward "what we want it to be."
</p>

<p>
As we have seen, the movement of most of these poems is negative; violence and uncertainty enter the tranquil space of still life. Dry loaves and skulls displace the abundant table. But <i>Parts of a World</i> also affirms that "after the final no there comes a yes and on that yes the future world depends" (<i>CPP,</i> 223). "Woman Looking at a Vase of Flowers," despite the title's invitation to indolent pleasure, starts with the violence and thunder of a gigantic reality shattering into particulars. While the poem makes no overt reference to contemporary history, one feels the ominous circumstance: "The crude / And jealous grandeurs of sun and sky / Scattered themselves" into the palpable forms of low plane reality (<i>CPP,</i> 223). But parts of the world do not leave winding weeds or dirty water this time. The "storm of secondary things" is a summer storm. And as things "escape" their "large abstraction" and enter material definition, they can be gathered into still life's "human conciliations." Here, for the woman looking, things "fell into place beside her" (<i>CPP,</i> 244). Stevens as a pragmatist offers an image of momentary conciliation in a time of worldly conflict and stress. The bouquet does not inspire a clairvoyance of original grandeurs (a transparent metaphysical center), but it does invite "a profounder reconciling" of "the crude and jealous formlessness" with the human need for intimate arrangement. In this way "Woman Looking at a Vase of Flowers" takes the floral still life as an emblem for the role and nature of lyric poetry with its "flowers of speech." Here I allude to the broader analogy that Stevens points to between still life and lyric&#x02014;both arranging objects in sensuous and semantic orders, both celebrating the everyday. The woman looking has none of that Sunday morning complacency; her human arrangement of the flowers has the force of epiphany.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Stevens largely abandons still life after <i>Parts of a World,</i> more focused as he is on the expansion of the human imagination, the "gigantomachia" of human arrangement in relation to sky (<i>CPP,</i> 258). This enlarged scale continues through "Auroras of Autumn," which MacLeod has associated with still life's opposite, action painting (specifically with the work of Jackson Pollock). But the volume <i>The Auroras of Autumn</i> in fact closes with "Angel Surrounded by Paysans," a poem inspired by the Pierre Tal Coat still life Stevens purchased from Paule Vidal. (<a href="#2"> 2</a>) The poem gives no hint of its source (letters to Paule Vidal tell the story); the Venetian glass bowl and humbler surrounding vessels appear as a "necessary angel" and human community (<i>CPP,</i> 423). But the still life stimulus for the poem suggests again for Stevens the planet on the table.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  As a low genre, still life evokes the common spirit of the "paysan"; indeed a "paysan" could have made the terrines and bottles or sat at the table Tal Coat represents and Stevens carries over. The scene of hospitality and threshold experience suggested in the "welcome at the door" retain the mood, if not the substance, of still life. The necessary angel, the <i>numen</i> of Tal Coat's simple pots and bowls, is surrounded by paysans and at the same time hovers at the welcoming door. She is a re both of the center and of the periphery, the heroic and the common, megalography and rhopography.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In <i>Parts of a World</i> we saw still life's "here" dispersing into "there" and often tearing one self from another in the process. But in the late work still life brings a buzzing 

<b></b>

reality swarming and gathering to local objects. Instead of dissolving object into world, that is, he brings the world, contemplated as an object&#x02014;pineapple, bouquet, book of poems&#x02014;to the table. He finds ways to experience provisional order and plenitude under the pressure of reality. Poems such as "Someone Puts a Pineapple Together" (explicitly still life in its constant reference to "an object on the table") acknowledge "the wholly artificial nature" of human arrangement (<i>CPP,</i> 693).<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The object is not seen as a thing in itself, but as an individual human assemblage (variously metamorphosed into urn, owl, volcano, coconut and cockerel in one, a table Alp, and numerous other objects). The object is inseparable from the erratic, metaphor-making will. Stevens likes the pineapple as an American symbol of hospitality, a local version of still life's <i>xenia</i> or sign of social gathering. The poem invites the world (in fact "three planets: the sun / the moon and the imagination") into the domestic space, "concourse of planetary originals, / Yet, as it seems, of human residence" (<i>CPP,</i> 694). The pineapple stands for a faceted, layered, and prismatic reality&#x02014;the many in the one, "an object the sum of its complications, seen / And unseen" (<i>CPP,</i> 696). It is precisely not the fascist bundle in which the individual, the particular, disappears into a totality. The poem returns, as Charles Altieri has said, to argue with the earlier poem "Study of Two Pears" with its longing for the thing itself.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Reality must include all the perceptions of reality. But while Altieri reads this poem within the context of philosophical aesthetics and modernist abstraction, as a struggle within the faceted mind of the poet, we might also recall the historical struggle among parts of the world that had lately pressured Stevens's meditations. The object-as-earth is not just a simple thing of green nature but must admit "enlargings and pale

arrondissements, / . . . the furious roar of his capital" (<i>CPP,</i> 695). Stevens speaks here of the "scholar" or rational being whose thoughts divide and administrate an intuitive reality; but the language of the <i>polis</i> is not merely metaphoric.
</p>

<p>
In the early poem "Anecdote of the Jar" Stevens lamented that the still life object "does not give bird or bush" (<i>CPP,</i> 60). But the pineapple, by contrast, is a "fund." The perceptual order is performative rather than constative, and the performer is anonymous. Who is the "someone" who puts this assemblage together? Not just the artist but any beholder, or all beholders, each retaining his unique experience. The pineapple comes to symbolize the world both as an object beheld and as a community of individual beholders. The "ephemeras of the tangent swarm" in the still moment and give off the sense that "the truth was not the respect of one, / But always of many things" (<i>CPP,</i> 695). If the pineapple is the planet on the table, Stevens reminds himself nevertheless that "this is everybody's world" not an imperial possession. In this sense still life and its "wholly artificial nature" can bespeak a "total reality."
</p>

<p>
The "swarm" as a solution to the fragmentation of "parts" or the reduction of many to one emerges often in Stevens's late poems. The local gatherings of still life become models of human conciliation with "total reality," and with human imagination. Just as this long poem "Someone Puts a Pineapple Together" rewrites the brief "Study of Two Pears," so we can read the thirty-five-stanza poem "The Bouquet" as a sequel to the shorter "Woman Looking at a Vase of Flowers." The later poem flaunts its transring powers; "things" become "para-things" and men become "meta-men" (<i>CPP,</i> 384). The bouquet is not one of these "choses of Provence growing / In glue," a static, nostalgic object, but a drama of perception akin to the work of a C&#x000E9;zanne or Van Gogh. The "eccentric twistings of the rapt (yet unwrapped) bouquet" are held in place by the red and white checkered cloth, symbol for the poetic structure of this improvised meditation, and the structural objecthood underlying this "fund" of metaphor. As the poem pursues the enticing reds and blues of imagination and reality we are finally transfixed by a "whole appearance that stands and is" (<i>CPP,</i> 387). But the final canto marks the end of the performance and reminds us that the world of meditation can never contain the historical world, even as a swarm. The violence within, the "lightning in an inner world," corresponds to an outer violence that has yet to subside. The "soldiers" of the poems of the 1930s who were "Marching and marching in a tragic time" are apparently still on the move (<i>CPP,</i> 183). In brutally matter-of-fact, clipped syntax, utterly unlike the delightful tangents of meta-men and para-things that precede it, Stevens abandons the bouquet:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
A car drives up. A soldier, an officer,
<br />
Steps out. He rings and knocks. The door is not locked.
<br />
He enters the room and calls. No one is there.
<br />
He bumps the table. The bouquet falls on its side.
<br />
He walks through the house, looks round him and then leaves.
<br />
The bouquet has slopped over the edge and lies on the floor.

From the beginning of the poem Stevens has reminded his reader that this space of still life has a door and is part of a larger world. The space is entered ("one enters, entering home, / The place of meta-men and para-things"), is looked out from ("Through the door one sees on the lake that the white duck swims"), and is implicitly exited (<i>CPP,</i> 384, 365). At the end of the poem the human perceiver, the being through whom things become para-things and funds of metaphor, vanishes. "No one is there" (<i>CPP,</i> 387). The performance is over. By leaving the door of this meditation unlocked, by displacing the poet with the soldier at the end, Stevens relinquishes still life's myth of eternal present and disperses its swarm. But he will return repeatedly to gather "local objects," not "objects of home" ("complacencies of the peignoir," totems of origin and indigenous being, or fetishes of the past), but things taken from their habitation in the changing world and made "objects of insight, the integrations / Of feeling" (<i>CPP,</i> 474). The space of still life is not the "absolute foyer beyond romance," but it may stand for it, stand for a meeting place of spirit and world, and thus stand for the poem.

(Stevens, <i>CPP,</i> 451) The modern object or "thing" has been a subject of perennial interest but has most recently been the focus of three critical studies by Bill Brown (who discusses the sense of things in America at the turn of the century in <i>The Sense of Things)</i>, John Erikson [who offers a theoretical analysis of object aesthetics from modernism to postmodernism in <i>The Fate of the Object: From Modern Object to Postmodern Sign in Performance, Art, and Poetry</i> (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1995)], and Douglas Mao (who examines anxieties of production and treats Stevens along with Woolf, Lewis, and other major modernists in <i>Solid Objects: Modernism and the Test of Production</i> (Princeton, N. J.: Princeton University Press, 1998). On the subject of Stevens and visualization, see Sarah Riggs's suggestive study of reality effects and their blockage in Stevens, Bishop, and O'Hara in <i>Word Sightings: Poetry and Visual Media in Stevens, Biship, and O'Hara</i> (New York: Routledge, 2002); hereafter abbreviated <i>WS.</i>
</p>

<p class="noIndent">
<a name="FOOT4" href="#REF4">4</a>.
John Erikson's analysis concerning the modernist relation of re and ground is suggestive for this discussion of Stevens and still life: "The concentration on the object in early modernism was a way of trying to fix the re spatially against the ravages of time. But the object that proceeds from expressive labor out of the personal immediacy of perception newly emergent from the subjective depth of romanticism, finds only a tenuous existence as a thing-in-itself before it must encounter its ground in the social and in history" (<i>Fate of the Object,</i> 9).

In these reflections on the notion of ideas in things, and for the reference to Heidegger, I am indebted to Bill Brown's suggestive study, <i>The Sense of Things.</i> Though his focus is on an earlier period in American literature, his introductory chapter has important implications for the study of the modernist object.

Stevens's subjects are often generic and I have not located a particular painting in connection with this poem; women with flowers was a favorite subject of impressionism. Two such paintings, Degas's "A Woman Seated Beside a Vase of Flowers" and Courbet's "Woman with Flowers (The Trellis)," were both included in the Hartford Atheneum's exhibition of still life in 1938.
</p>

<p class="noIndent">
<a name="FOOT15" href="#REF15">15</a>.
For a thorough history of Stevens's acquisition and a persuasive analysis of his transposition from painting to poem, see Alan Filreis's "Still Life without Substance: Wallace Stevens and the Language of Agency," <i>Poetics Today</i> 10 (summer 1989): 370&#x02013;1. Filreis argues that Stevens works between the arts with an interest in relational structure rather than in substances. While I agree with this reading, I believe the genre of still life, with its emphasis on the movement between rhopography (common, trivial matter) and megalography (transration to spiritual matter), remains generically if not substantively relevant to the poem.
</p>

<p class="noIndent">
<a name="FOOT16" href="#REF16">16</a>.
For Filreis, the late images of "poverty," often familiar motifs of still life, are part of the idealized version of Europe that his isolationist tendencies could cultivate:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The list of images of poverty in the poem ["An Ordinary Evening in New Haven"]&#x02014;"the tin plate, the loaf of bread in it, / The long-bladed knife, the little to drink"&#x02014;is hardly persuasive in denoting . . . a background of reality. These stock images of the common life actually conform more to the conventions of the front of the postcard (ideal view) than to the reverse (descriptions of or pointings to things seen in the world).
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<div class="attribution">

</div>

<p class="noIndent">
But Stevens's claim is not toward denotative reality for "it is not in the premise that reality / is a solid, (<i>CPP,</i> 417). These simple images become, as still life, part of a fictional space rather than a mimetic space, where, to follow Sarah Riggs, "word-objects are felt to be suspended and arranged in imaginary space" (<i>WS,</i> 22). The objects of still life are not, that is, indices of the historical world; but from this imaginary domestic space the poet will launch himself back into the distances of the real.

(<i>CPP,</i> 693) Filreis identifies the visual source: "Yet again the evidence suggests that the modernist pineapple likenesses are based on a painting of pineapples dismantled by another modernist imagination, namely, one of the Cuban <i>origenistas,</i> Mariano Rodriguez, whose watercolor Stevens had received as a gift and hung in his private bedroom ("Still Life," 370&#x02013;1).

Unlike many speakers at memorial panels this past year, I did not know Hugh Kenner personally or work with him as a student. But I knew him. When <i>The Pound Era</i> appeared in paperback in 1973, I invested in it on my starveling student budget and read it, riveted, transported, from the stunning Gaudier-Brzeska panther crouched on the cover to the very last page. Of all the intellectual experiences that shaped my decision to center my scholarly work on modernist art and thought, <i>The Pound Era</i> was one of the most immediate. It helped impel me toward my early work on the manuscripts and texts of Ezra Pound's <i>Cantos,</i> and it played a role in my first academic appointment. During my MLA interview with a large half-circle of English department faculty from the University of Alabama, their chair asked what I thought of <i>The Pound Era.</i> "Oh," I said, "it's full of amazing moments," and gave for example the song from <i>Cymbeline,</i> "Fear no more the heat o' the sun"&#x02014;its last lines, "Golden lads and girls all must, / Like chimney sweepers, come to dust," lit up as if by an illuminator's brush by Kenner's anecdote (via William Arrowsmith and Guy Davenport) about the twentieth-century Warwickshire denizen who blew the head off a dandelion saying, "We call these golden boys chimneysweepers when they go to seed." My interviewers seemed to share my delight in the critical sensibility that could so deftly weave this trouvaille of Elizabethan local knowledge into a modernist cultural history&#x02014;at least, nobody asked me what it had to do with Pound or modernism, and I got the job.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
I could have called up any number of such moments in <i>The Pound Era:</i> the photograph of San Zeno's column in Verona, its carved words "Adaminus . . . me fecit" glossing a line in <i>The Cantos</i>; the tracing of poetic affinities from Li Po and other Chinese poets through French Jesuit missionaries to Thoreau, Emerson, Ernest Fenollosa with Japanese scholars Mori and Ariga, and, through the chance gift of Fenollosa's papers, Pound; the dazzling exposition of Pound's and Aldington's translations of Sappho's broken papyri; the red-weskited Henry James inquiring of Pound whether his bride, Dorothy Shakespear, was "a compatriot?" and more. Parlaying Pound's poetics of the luminous detail into a critical method that sets the significant detail in its historical surround, Kenner inaugurated a new historicism <i>avant la lettre</i> for an international, multidisciplinary modernism that, like Gaudier's crouched panther, now seemed to leap from its New Critical cage into history, its own and ours. At the same time, one could resist Kenner's grand literary historical claim, instead seeing in <i>The Pound Era</i> a provocative illustration of Paul de Man's theoretical point that "what we usually call literary history has little or nothing to do with literature" while "what we call literary interpretation&#x02014;provided only it is good interpretation&#x02014;is in fact literary history."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
That was not all I knew about Hugh Kenner as I sat talking with my MLA interviewers. Through my research in the Ezra Pound Archive at Yale's Beinecke Library on <i>The Cantos'</i> text&#x02014;one of the most complex editorial challenges in twentieth-century English literature, not excluding <i>Finnegans Wake</i>&#x02014;I had learned that Kenner and the German scholar Eva Hesse had formed an ad hoc editorial committee to recommend changes for the New Directions text. Many of these changes had actually been made, notwithstanding that Pound was too old and ill to approve them; that the editorial committee had no clear policy or principles, no systematic method or procedures; and that their working assumption that <i>The Cantos</i> ought to be "correct" with respect to its sources did not comport with Pound's own stance toward error in his poem.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  In <i>The Pound Era</i> Kenner fondly evokes these impressionist editorial endeavors: "Fantastic and great men loom in time's mists. As we edit and annotate them (for the Early English Texts Society perhaps) we funnel time's romance through the very printing houses whence newspapers issue" (<i>TPE,</i> 24). In funneling time's romance through the New Directions presses, Kenner and Hesse introduced a new dimension of substantive error into Pound's text. Yet in doing so they contributed to a contemporary rethinking of bibliographical studies that shook that seemingly staid and rock-solid discipline's foundations. As my adviser Jerome McGann (then Kenner's colleague at Hopkins) and I soon understood, Kenner and Hesse's editorial interference in <i>The Cantos'</i> text foregrounded not just local problems of editorial method but deeper questions about conceptions of textual authority that helped to revitalize editorial theory in its complex relation to historical and social conditions, conceptions of authorship, and pedagogic, critical, and readerly practices.
</p>

<p>
Alarming as it was, as a young graduate student facing a job market no more promising then than today, to find oneself possessed of the awful knowledge that Hugh Kenner had made a big, a really big, mistake, Kenner's editorial romancing of the fantastic great man who was our common subject had given my countless hours of drudgery 

<b></b>

in the Beinecke a tremendous payoff. For (wondering how to put it) I slowly came to see that Kenner's guiding epistemological assumption that Pound's text <i>ought</i> to be correct with respect to its (presumed) sources, <i>ought</i> to be a locus of curricular and historical authority for its readers, entailed an unexamined, perhaps even unconscious moral assumption about the nature of the poet's authority&#x02014;<i>one that Pound himself did not share,</i> that the conditions of modernist aesthetic creation contradict, and that <i>The Cantos</i> itself silently discredits. As I pondered the gaps between Pound's and his editors' stances toward error in his "poem including history"&#x02014;a history inseparable from error as from epic wandering (<i>errare</i>)&#x02014;I came to see that error, chance, fallibility, divagation are inwoven in Pound's epic "record of struggle" in ways that illuminate the historical conditions of modern art and thought; and that to embrace modernity is to relinquish illusions of certainty, to make one's wandering way in the world unguided by any "Aquinas-map." Kenner's errors, in short, proved no less illuminating than the myriad things great and small that he got inimitably right. When I reflect now on the accidental gift of his editorial forays, I see that no small consequence of that gift was having to think for myself&#x02014;being forced to do so by the facts of the case. If great scholars often inspire a certain transferential awe, for me Hugh Kenner was a great teacher not only because of his brilliant exposition of <i>The Cantos</i> and its era but because his own work freed me to understand its limits.
</p>

<p>
To take an example near to hand: in her talk in Vancouver, Marjorie Perloff reported that her early appreciation of Woolf was derailed by Kenner's derisive treatment of Bloomsbury in <i>A Sinking Island.</i> Whether inoculated by Kenner's editorial misadventures, too deep in my own reading of Bloomsbury to be much interested in the clever-schoolboy mockeries of that astonishingly bad essay, or just lacking in the gene for hero-worship, I am so far immune to the influence Marjorie describes as (in the interest of full disclosure) to have just published a book titled <i>Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Avant-Garde: War, Civilization, Modernity.</i> Was Kenner avenging himself on Oxbridge, as Marjorie suggested? fending off a challenger to the Pound era? Certainly his attack recalls the red-faced professor in <i>A Room of One's Own</i> whose monumental <i>The Mental, Moral, and Physical Inferiority of the Female Sex</i> reads "as if he were killing some noxious insect," making Woolf wonder why he is so angry. ("Could it be his wife? . . . Was she in love with a cavalry officer?")<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  It betrays more than a little anxiety about the burgeoning reputation of a modernist genius he can contemplate only as mired in "depression and lifelong guilt," whose work, he makes clear, he has not read and need not, since much of it "can't even be read" (<i>ASI,</i> 167, 179). "Save for Maynard Keynes's <i>The Economic Consequences of the Peace,</i>" he writes, "Bloomsbury writing implied little direct awareness that the war had happened" (<i>ASI,</i> 164). That Woolf created war veteran Septimus Warren Smith, that Joyce "cursed" and vivisected "the system which had made [his mother] a victim,"<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  that both were Ibsen's heirs&#x02014;such aspects of modernism were lost on Kenner, who coyly makes <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> out to be an effete afterimage of Dorothy Sayers sans "the vulgarity of a sleuth" ("why did Septimus take that fatal plunge?") (<i>ASI,</i> 178). In prose bristling unnaturally with exclamation points he excludes this "gifted vulnerable woman" from "the great critics," 

<b></b>

marvels that "she lasted fifty-nine years to fuss so tensely over so much paper," and finds in Leonard's collection of her essays, Quentin Bell's indispensable biography, and the (superb) scholarly editions of her diary and letters a dark conspiracy: "It all amounts to an assertion she'd not have made, that she was her time's regnant sensibility" (<i>ASI,</i> 165, 169, 166). Who wouldn't wish that this well-known Canadian mathematician and conjurer of fantastic great men lost in time's mists had quit while he was ahead?
</p>

<p>
Yet if <i>A Sinking Island</i> flaunts the limitations that prevent some of us from ranking Kenner with the greatest twentieth-century critics&#x02014;Eliot, Pound, Woolf, Auerbach&#x02014;even his failures have been salutary for modernist studies. At our Vancouver roundtable, Suzette Henke recalled an early Dublin Joyce conference where Bonnie Kime Scott addressed a question about Molly Bloom to Kenner&#x02014; "and he simply could not hear her." Frustration at being unheard aside, what could be more generative of important work than to find a critic of Kenner's eminence promoting a position with which one utterly disagrees? What better provocation to get the issues on the table, focus the argument, make clear its urgency, think critically where Kenner inclined to intuitive leaps? Our newer readings of Molly Bloom owe something to the self-revealing blindnesses of Kenner and the Thirty Shilling Whore school. So too Kenner's early take on <i>Ulysses</i>&#x02014;incoherent if ingenious, and highly influential&#x02014;conjures a conservative Joyce at the radical Stephen's expense by deriving an ironic distance between author and character from Joyce's presumed religious politics&#x02014;a position as yet only indirectly rebutted, though Kenner himself reportedly repudiated it.
</p>

<p>
As I think what I most wish to honor in Kenner's work, the famous aphorism of that great modernist Mies van der Rohe comes to mind: "God is in the details." At its best&#x02014;as in Kenner's masterpiece, <i>The Pound Era</i>&#x02014;his fine and supple exposition moves between significant details and the great issues they unforgettably illuminate. At its best, so does ours, however different our analytic modes and the understanding of modernism they yield. Kenner mapped an international modernism; we contest and refine those maps of an inexorably shrinking world. In some ways our critical radar is more sophisticated, more worldly, in Said's sense: attuned to a wider frequency range, registering issues of class, gender, ethnicity, race in sharper, subtler detail. Yet both moments in the reception of Anglo-American modernism, Kenner's and ours, resonate with Fenollosa's vision of a twentieth century that "not only turns a new page in the book of the world but opens another and a startling chapter. Vistas of strange futures unfold for man, of world-embracing cultures half-weaned from Europe, of hitherto undreamed responsibilities for nations and races."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  For many of my generation, the Kenner of <i>The Pound Era</i> unveiled a modernism little known and very much untamed: awesome in the beauty and daring of its artifacts, inextricably rooted in its historical moment yet still so new as to seem almost pristine, everything remaining to be understood. If this impresario-magician could no more keep from projecting his shadow upon the objects of our common fascination than we can ours, we can only wish that our own errors and prejudices might prove half as fruitful as his.

Most of these companions, anthologies, or guides to criticism are aimed at undergraduate as well as more specialist readers, and it could be argued that their focus on single, well-established periods or authors does not generally demand much innovative research or writing from those that produce them. Inevitably, the vast amount of criticism devoted to the works of James Joyce (only Shakespeare has inspired more essays and books) has become a prime target for such treatment. Joyce is unquestionably canonical as well as formidably obscure, and was at the forefront of debates about "theory" in Britain and France; historicist approaches to his work, focusing on topics such as censorship, popular culture, and colonialism have proliferated more recently. However, Joseph Brooker's <i>Joyce's Critics: Transitions in Reading and Culture</i>, a handsome volume in a new series on Irish Studies and Culture from the University of Wisconsin Press, demonstrates that work which modestly proposes to survey earlier criticism can on occasion be more insightful and useful than many a supposedly original monograph. Brooker's is not the first full-length account of Joyce criticism (Geert Lernout has already written on <i>The French Joyce</i>, and 

<b></b>

Joseph Kelly's <i>Our Joyce: From Outcast to Icon</i> is concerned with the American Joyce industry), but it is the most comprehensive and judicious. In particular, it will be genuinely indispensable for any graduate student who is contemplating working on Joyce (or modernism in general).
</p>

<p>
Jean-Michel Rabat&#x000E9; is already a distinguished Joycean, and a pioneer of the so-called "genetic" reading of Joyce, which is based as much on the author's "avant-textes" (notebooks, drafts, and proofs) as on the printed versions of the books. He has an alternative take on the current near-saturation of the market for introductions to Joyce in this edited volume, <i>Palgrave Advances in James Joyce Studies</i>. Avoiding essays devoted to individual works or to the more familiar themes of Joyce criticism, Rabat&#x000E9; asserts that his contributors will stress "the organic and quasi-systematic nature of a work grasped as globally as possible. Joyce's works and life obey an organic logic, and  . . .  this logic opens up on a general problematic hinged around the discovery of a new type of writing" . While what could fairly be described as Rabat&#x000E9;'s Derridean emphasis is apparent here, the essayists in fact take rather divergent approaches to questions of gender, genre, science, politics, and geography (among others) in the collection. Some do summarize the state of research in a given area, but most offer complex new arguments as well. Many offer a view of Joyce that is postmodernist in a recognizably American style (ten of the twelve writers are based in North American universities). This is somewhat at odds with the much more explicitly political recent work on Joyce in Britain and Ireland that Brooker addresses in the final chapter of his study.
</p>

<p>
Brooker begins <i>Joyce's Critics</i> by stating that the "excessive" quantity of writing on Joyce has become one of "the definitive facts about the writer" . It is therefore a considerable achievement for Brooker to have found a meta-narrative, largely based on how "the reading of Joyce has invoked and involved place and nation" , which enables him to engage in a detailed analysis of such key res as T. S. Eliot, Harry Levine, and Richard Ellmann without losing the forward momentum of a coherent and compelling argument. While he occasionally indulges in a little irony at the expense of the critics he writes about, he is invariably closely engaged with the evolving opinions and the long careers of some of these commentators (in this regard, Rabat&#x000E9;'s rather Olympian essay on "Classics of Joyce Criticism" in his own volume suffers by comparison). Brooker recounts the (relatively familiar) story of how Ezra Pound attempted to "internationalize" Joyce while T. S. Eliot strove to assimilate him to a classicist aesthetic, but he also devotes attention to less well-known responses to Joyce by H. G. Wells and Wyndham Lewis. In many cases, hostile treatments of <i>Portrait of the Artist</i> and <i>Ulysses</i> disclose much that Pound and Eliot sought to repress, but which would return in later criticism&#x02014;including the questions of historical particularity, national identity, and of what Brooker describes as the somatic and kinetic effects of <i>Ulysses</i> on the unsuspecting novice reader. And certainly one misses in contemporary criticism the sense that negative assessments of Joyce might even be contemplated; as Derek Attridge puts it, almost all work on this author now presupposes a prior approval, based on "the unquestioned assumption that Joyce's writing is to be enjoyed, admired, and learned from rather than weighed in evaluative scales and pronounced good, bad or a mixture of the two" (quoted in Brooker, 172).
</p>

<p>
Brooker informs us that his book was written in London. While he appears to be as comfortable discussing (say) the Parisian Eugene Jolas as the American critic Margot Norris, Brooker's own location has nevertheless clearly had an influence on the shape of his argument. We might expect to find here a long account of the quarrel between the two most important American Joyceans, Richard Ellmann, author of the 1959 biography, and the Poundian Hugh Kenner, but the prominence of critics from Cambridge, England in his story is possibly more surprising. Brooker gives an extended explanation of F. R. Leavis's rejection of Joyce in favor of D. H. Lawrence as the "great creative genius of our age" (quoted in Brooker, 82), and outlines in some detail the later Cambridge careers of such res as Stephen Heath, Colin MacCabe, and Derek Attridge, for whom the name of Joyce helped to lend status to post-structuralist theory . One of the strengths of Brooker's volume is his serious attention to the Irish reception of Joyce in independent Ireland, offering nuanced considerations of the topics of class, sectarian affiliation and "cosmopolitanism" in writers including W. B.Yeats, John Eglinton and Patrick Kavanagh, as well as in the work of contemporary cultural critics such as Seamus Deane and Declan Kiberd. He also makes some acute observations about the exploitation of Joyce by the heritage 

<b></b>

and tourist industries in present-day Dublin. Nevertheless, the fact that Brooker concludes the book with an account of the work of his own London-based colleagues does rather tend to give the impression that he thinks that the writings of his own friends represent the culmination of Joyce criticism so far. But any arrangement of such a large amount of diverse material is bound to result in distortions of one kind or another. One misses, for example, the possibility of tracing the history of Marxist interpretations of Joyce, which is not facilitated by the trajectory Brooker traces from Paris to the United States and back again to Britain and Ireland. There is not enough acknowledgment of significant readings of Joyce by critics who are not themselves "Joyceans," such as Fredric Jameson or Franco Moretti, or of responses to Joyce from beyond the Anglophone world. Brooker perhaps underestimates the effect of partition and the Northern Irish conflict on perceptions of Joyce in Ireland, although he does usefully point out that the question of religion (specifically Catholicism) is the only major theme in Joyce that has been relatively neglected in contemporary criticism.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, the Irish or "postcolonial" turn in Joyce studies is generally passed over by the contributors to <i>Palgrave Advances in James Joyce Studies</i>. In an essay entitled "Joyce's politics: race, nation and transnationalism," Joseph Valente argues for the necessity of going beyond what he characterizes as recent attempts to connect Joyce to "the romantic nationalist tradition of asserting the properly organic relationship between the ethnicity of a people and their language, culture and/or political framework"; this project can now be superceded by a more general "re-evaluation of his geopolitical vision" . In a similar way, Margot Norris states in her essay, "Joyce, history and the philosophy of history," that "Irish history is the nightmare from which Joyce scholars have awoken, but only to find themselves facing the even more loaded issue of Joyce's philosophy of history" . Valente denies that Joyce belonged to an "unequivocally colonial society" (whatever that might be), and contends that his fiction presents Dublin as a "metro-colonial space" , in which all "the dialogized voices of Irish culture" can be heard . The piece makes good use of Joyce's non-fictional early writing, and ends with a fascinating re-reading of the end of the story "The Dead" from <i>Dubliners</i>, arguing that Gabriel Conroy's final vision invokes "the universalizing rhetoric of Christendom"  rather than the imagery of the Irish nation. By way of conclusion, Valente comments on the "exquisite difficulty of Joyce's aesthetic project" in its heroic attempt to

transcend the ideological limits of so-called national culture or art, unfolding the hybrid and contradictory elements of Irish life in every more capacious designs, but to contrive against losing the local, and yes, the national particularity of those elements in elevating them to the dignity of the universal.

Such a formulation might lead us to question whether Joyce is really so much at odds with the many other twentieth-century postcolonial theorists and writers to whom he has latterly been compared, in grappling with the ironies of nationalism, modernization, and decolonization. And while Norris's essay is a superb account of the "revisionary, dispersed, non-progressive, non-teleological, cyclical, and deconstructed"  theories of history to which Joyce was attracted (including those associated with Vico, Quinet and Nietzsche), she does not consider whether Ireland's colonial experience might have influenced his preferences in this regard.
</p>

<p>
Ronald Bush's essay on "Joyce's Modernisms" argues that living in a country where industrial modernization had not yet taken hold, "Joyce felt the strong need of both the discourses of scientific and post-scientific modernity" . Bush offers a subtle and intricate account of Joyce's philosophy of modernity, mediated through such key res as Ibsen and Flaubert. But in case we are in danger of regarding Joyce as altogether too clever, Sam Slote, in his contribution on "Joyce and science," describes some of the things that Joyce knew about (like how a television works) and some that he did not understand (Einsteinian relativity). Several of the contributors to this volume, including Slote, pay a good deal of attention to <i>Finnegans Wake</i>. This material is likely to be of interest only to the most "advanced" students of Joyce. Nevertheless, Michael Groden provides a lucid and necessary introduction to the somewhat arcane controversies of textual scholarship in relation both to <i>Ulysses</i> and the <i>Wake</i> in his "Genetic Joyce: textual 

<b></b>

studies and the reader." As Rabat&#x000E9; comments, the debate that followed Hans Walter Gabler's 1984 revised edition of <i>Ulysses</i> in effect forced all Joyce scholars to take a position on editorial issues . But Laurent Milesi's essay on "Joyce, language and languages" is definitely one for specialists rather than a general readership; as Brooker implies, Attridge's <i>Peculiar Language</i>  remains the most accessible attempt to vindicate the claims of <i>Wake</i> scholars that the text represents "not an aberration of the literary but an unusually thoroughgoing <i>exemplification</i> of the literary" (quoted in Brooker, 171).
</p>

<p>
Garry Leonard and Vicki Mahaffey, on the other hand, tackle two of the most fashionable topics in contemporary Joyce studies&#x02014;popular culture and gender, respectively. Neither of these contributors offers any overview of their fields. Instead, they both argue that Joyce shows us how ordinary people manage their everyday lives in modern conditions, mainly through constant consumption, and occasionally by attempting to escape from the constrictions of their environments through sexual and other fantasies. Leonard and Mahaffey link the realms of commodity culture and private fantasy to the infinite (but lost) possibilities of history that Stephen dwells on in the "Nestor" episode of <i>Ulysses</i>. Leonard asserts that
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
For Joyce, the momentary is momentous; the "everyday" is not where we make history, but where we live despite it, and "low" art chronicles this disorder. If we seek the full splendor of Joyce's accomplishment, examples of "low" art are what we must read and read doubly, instead of our Roman history.

<p class="noIndent">
The imperial narratives of official history occlude the experience of lived history. However, according to Leonard, those that are banished from history are condemned instead to the inadequate satisfactions of the marketplace. He does not seek to celebrate what he describes as the "embarrassed" consumerism  of Dubliners such as Maria in "Clay," but yet for Leonard there is no real <i>critique</i> of capitalist society in Joyce, nor any basis for an analysis of its historical origins or its future tendencies. Despite what would appear to be Leonard's radically democratic perspective, he regards Dublin's citizens as effectively imprisoned by the dominant economic and political system. He does not consider the view, for example, that elements of a truly <i>popular</i> culture (one with its roots in the history of the people) might survive even into an era of <i>mass</i> culture.
</p>

<p>
Mahaffey also appears to uncover a zone in which the existing order of things might be challenged. She carefully traces how the "vague and hackneyed dreams marketed by popular culture" in <i>Dubliners</i> give way to the "idiosyncratic, artificial, impossible"  fantasies of the three key protagonists in <i>Ulysses</i>. But she makes it clear that she is outlining only a "psychological, artistic response to the social divisions of gender, class and age, not a political one" , as real politics is governed by the tyranny of material possibility. At one level, this appears to be a valuable insight into the imaginative capacity of at least Joyce's main characters to understand the limitations of their social worlds. However, it is reductive to limit dreams of transcendence to a mere protest against "the insufficiency of choices available to individuals" . It may be that&#x02014;contrary to Mahaffey's suggestion&#x02014;contemporary capitalism can quite easily accommodate an individual's fantasies about transgressing the "bounds of gender, age, religion, or nationality" . But this does not mean that these are the most urgent desires of the citizens of Dublin in <i>Ulysses</i>&#x02014;or indeed of most of the less privileged inhabitants of the world today.
</p>

<p>
Virginia Woolf, rather than James Joyce, is the key modernist writer in Lois Cucullu's <i>Expert Modernists, Matricide, and Modern Culture</i>. Cucullu devotes two chapters of her book to Woolf's revision of the re of the domestic woman in her novels, and one chapter each to E. M. Forster and Joyce (although one might have expected D. H. Lawrence to re more prominently in her study). This book began life as a doctoral dissertation, and could have been more extensively revised. The dense critical style is at times bewildering; most of the footnotes consist of quite lengthy paragraphs, many citing several critical sources at once. Nor is the reader helped by the preference of the publisher, Palgrave Macmillan, for cramming as many words as possible onto every page. This is a pity, because the author does have a bold and original argument to advance. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Cucullu attempts to take up where Nancy Armstrong's seminal <i>Desire and Domestic Fiction</i>  left off, with an analysis of how the sexual politics of English fiction evolved in the early twentieth century. Whereas Armstrong described the domestic woman as wielding considerable power over her husband and children in the private sphere, Cucullu suggests that in modernism we witness the demise of this authoritative maternal re. But modernism was not simply about a reassertion of patriarchal privilege (although the author appears to be unsure about whether or not it was fundamentally a positive development). Cucullu argues that women modernists such as Woolf achieved new forms of authority for themselves in the wake of this symbolic matricide. Thus Woolf is "not the modernist with a difference but the exemplary modernist" . In particular, Cucullu dwells on the moment in 1917 when Woolf installed her own printing press in the drawing room of her house, as she prepared to publish "domestic novels that aestheticize and commodify the very space she confiscated" . The elegized matriarchs of <i>To the Lighthouse</i> or <i>Mrs Dalloway</i> represent Woolf's appropriation of domestic culture, which she sought to replace with an educated female elite and a cult of refined artistic sensibility.
</p>

<p>
Thus modernist artists sought to join the "expert class," a new group of professional specialists who claimed authority over the "private domains of self, affect and consciousness" . Only they could teach how the "secular, consumerist, desiring, and sexual" life-styles  of the modern individual could be managed and enjoyed. But while it is true that the twentieth-century discipline of literature is "inconceivable without the expertise and cult of the literary modernists" , it is harder to understand the precise nature of the specialist knowledge that literary modernists supposedly brought to bear on the bourgeois home. Certainly, they did not inaugurate a social revolution of the kind that happened in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Britain. Nancy Armstrong has claimed that these enormous changes were prered and even shaped by the realist novel. Did modernist fiction really have a comparable historical importance? For while other "experts" in the fields of law, medicine, or psychology are still very much with us, the era of the modernists was short-lived and Cucullu does not attempt to tell us if anything changed with its passing.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, towards the end of her book, Cucullu appears to revise her view of the woman modernist as "exemplary":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Woolf mythifies the domestic woman by turning her into art, that is, by making her over into culture, and thus makes culture accessible to her educated daughters. By contrast, Joyce, Lawrence, and Forster bar the domestic woman from culture by turning her into nature.

<p class="noIndent">
Given the reputations of D. H. Lawrence and Joyce in twentieth-century literary studies, it is hard to see how Woolf remains the dominant or most influential re here. Cucullu's reading of Joyce in particular does not allow that there is much that is progressive in his representations of mothers or of anything else (although she does not consider the rather different historical situation of a Mrs Dedalus compared to a Mrs Ramsay). Rather, the "expert status" to which Joyce and other modernists aspired contributed to their subsequent institutionalization and to the creation of "a monopoly on cultural competence that is fundamentally at odds with any liberatory politics" . We might, after all, have been better off with realism and its angels of the hearth.

<p class="noIndent">
The first article I ever read by Hugh Kenner on Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i> was "Homer's Sticks and Stones," published in the <i>James Joyce Quarterly</i> . In this essay Kenner subjects what T. S. Eliot called Joyce's "mythical method" to a meditation that we might now consider a quasi-deconstructive maneuver. As we know, Joyce learned Latin but not Greek in his Jesuit university, and Hugh Kenner asks how Joyce would have acquired his Homer. The answer, of course, is through translation, and given that there were numerous translations available, and given the late nineteenth-century controversy about Homer's identity, Kenner suggests that Joyce's Homer would have been multiple Homers. In <i>Joyce's Voices</i> he names them, the "fairly business-like translations" of Cowper and Butler, Parry and Lord's "'oral-formulaic' improviser," and "the stained-glass Homer of Butcher and Lang" (<i>JV,</i> 65&#x02013;6). Kenner's 1969 essay was virtually contemporaneous with Roland Barthes's "The Death of the Author," and yet it illustrates one of Hugh Kenner's salient gifts&#x02014;to think theoretically without explicit resort to the discourse of theory. Kenner's principled rigor as a critic reflected a sensibility that allowed multiplicities and indeterminacies continually to complicate his respect for the empirical and his commitment to objectivity. In his early essay on Joyce's Homer, Kenner illustrates the constructed nature of the author, and in <i>The Pound Era,</i> he suggests that there is not one Joyce but several. Without benefit of narratological apparatus, Kenner also illustrates subtle concepts in theories of 

<b></b>

narrative. In his work on <i>Ulysses</i> especially, Kenner treats Joyce's novel as a writerly text by filling in its gaps and void spaces with such powerful, convincing supplements that many of our <i>Ulysses</i> (plural) are dialogical texts in which the voices of Joyce and Kenner converse and blend.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  These strategies of the early Kenner, produced in his Joyce criticism of the 1970s, have become for many of us a kind of critical unconscious.
</p>

<p>
The bridge between Kenner's commitment to objectivity and evidence, on the one hand, and his allowance of multiplicities, on the other, is his ability to hear literary language against the background of silence. For Kenner, as for Sherlock Holmes, the most significant sounds were sometimes the ones that were not audible, and the most interesting scenes in fiction, especially Joyce's, were lodged in a seeming void or gap. Kenner's empirical bent initially required him, however, to take issue with one of modernism's sacred texts. He wrote in <i>Joyce's Voices,</i> "The handy word 'myth,' as in Eliot's '<i>Ulysses,</i> Order and Myth,' is simply wrong, an uninspected legacy from the age of Matthew Arnold and Max M&#x000FC;ller" (<i>JV,</i> 64). For the Homer Kenner liked best as Joyce's inspiration was the one whose Troy had a historical existence, like Heinrich Schliemann's and Samuel Butler's. "[T]he Homer of Joyce's time was the archaeologist's," he wrote in "Homer's Stick's and Stones"&#x02014;that is, not a myth-making idealist or a romancer but an empirical observer.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Kenner also claimed that Joyce, like Butler, took "the archeologist's Homer seriously," by considering "what it might mean to believe that the <i>Odyssey</i> was composed by a real person in touch with the living details of real cities, real harbors, real bowls and cups and pins and spoons, real kings, real warriors, real houses" ("HSS," 293). Kenner here adumbrates a modernist methodological bent he elaborates more fully in <i>Joyce's Voices</i> where he calls it "Objectivity," the "attention to the evidential" (<i>JV,</i> xi). Kenner traces "Objectivity" to the early nineteenth century, when new disciplines dictated that "men should learn to merely look and listen, that attention to what was and was not evidence might deliver the methodiz'd mind from self-deception" (ibid).
</p>

<p>
Kenner adheres to this discipline almost literally&#x02014;particularly and (ironically, given his early hearing loss) to its caveat to <i>listen.</i> What he heard were multiplicities, the pluralized voices of Homer from all those different translations become audible in <i>Ulysses,</i> and the often pluralized voices in the Joycean text. Sometimes this multiplicity was audible to Kenner in a single line, and sometimes he heard it in a present or even an absent punctuation mark. Reading Joyce's story "Eveline," he heard something in two commas: "'He had fallen on his feet in Buenos Ayres [comma] he said [comma] and had come over to the old country just for a holiday'".<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Kenner goes on: "Great issues may be said to hang on those commas, which stipulate not only that Eveline is quoting Frank, but that Frank has been quoting also: quoting from the kind of fiction Eveline will believe, the fiction in which ready lads 'fall on their feet'" (ibid). To a narratologist, the commas signify merely a tag clause or an inquit formula&#x02014;the "he said" of tagged indirect discourse as Seymour Chatman might call it.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  But when Kenner heard invisible quotation marks in Joyce, they signaled that multiple voices were speaking in a single line&#x02014;that fiction was speaking through fictional discourse. To Kenner great issues attached to the narratological quirks, because one of them, free indirect 

<b></b>

discourse, allowed him to rescue Joyce from the brutal disparagement of Wyndham Lewis. Lewis generally heard in Joyce's written diction the phony accents of the parvenu and the poseur. But he finds that Joyce slipped up in <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.</i> Citing the sentence, "Every morning, therefore, Uncle Charles <i>repaired</i> to his outhouse," Lewis sniffed that people only "<i>repair</i> to places in works of fiction of the humblest order".<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  But Kenner, listening to Lewis listening, heard something else, namely that "repaired" wore invisible quotation marks. "It would be Uncle Charles's own word should he chance to say what he was doing," Kenner writes, and he honors Uncle Charles's unspoken style of speaking by giving his name to Joyce's innovation, "the normally neutral narrative vocabulary pervaded by a little cloud of idioms which a character might use if he were managing the narrative" (<i>JV,</i> 17). We could argue over whether Joyce invented free indirect discourse, or whether Hugh Kenner merely discovered its use in Joyce's writing.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Kenner's Uncle Charles Principle made this unobtrusive narrative practice audible: "So let us designate the Uncle Charles Principle: <i>the narrative idiom need not be the narrator's"</i> (<i>JV,</i> 18).
</p>

<p>
Hearing poorly, Kenner heard acutely in a variety of registers simultaneously. He heard unspoken sounds that had no substance, that were there but not there, and he heard sounds as material and solid as a hard substance. To convey what he heard, Kenner composed his own poetic language, a singular style of critical writing that lodges with particular grace in our ears. He res the "little cloud of idioms" surrounding a narrator's words in free indirect discourse as specks of tiny insects&#x02014;seemingly insignificant and yet as insistent as gnats: "A word he need not even utter is there like a gnat in the air beside him, for us to perceive in the same field of attention in which we note how 'scrupulously' he brushes his hat" (<i>JV,</i> 17). At other times, the sounds have the solidity of metal, as in the opening of the story "Grace": "Joyce has a way of ringing an opening sentence like a coin on a counter; we respond to the ring; our senses lock in" (<i>JV,</i> 14). When the sound turns leaden, as it does for Kenner in the opening of "The Dead," his antennae quiver: "The first sentence of 'The Dead' has also a leaden ring, very perceptible to the translingual ear" (<i>JV,</i> 15). The sentence is "Lily, the caretaker's daughter, was literally run off her feet." The translingual ear is Joyce's, whose "household language," Kenner reminds us, "was Italian, his public language during the <i>Ulysses</i> period successively Triestino, Schweizerdeutsch and French. He was normally poised between some other language and English" (<i>JV,</i> 15). The translingual ear's advantage transmuted it into a transliterary ear attuned to the invisible idioms of novelistic writing that turn its language into "unobtrusive novelese" (<i>JV,</i> 68). Writers with a translingual ear could hear and thereby avoid or exploit the invisible idiom of "the rattling good stories" of Edwardian fiction. Kenner writes, "To the inhabitant of a period, the characterizing idiom of that period, whether in painting, in sculpture or in literature, is absolutely invisible. It took Conrad&#x02014;a Pole&#x02014;Joyce&#x02014;a Dubliner&#x02014;and Hueffer&#x02014;who would rather have been writing in French&#x02014;to detect Edwardian novelese accurately enough to avoid it, or (in Joyce's case) to use it deliberately before avoiding it deliberately" (ibid). This novelese has another sound that rings like a coin on a counter, and Kenner hears it in the diction of the stage-Irishman, the stage-Englishman,

<b></b>

and the stage-poet in the opening of <i>Ulysses</i>: "So the style of 'Telemachus,' called in the famous schema 'Narrative (young),' today gives off here and there an unmistakable ring of Edwardian novelese" (<i>JV,</i> 69).
</p>

<p>
Behind this acute ear trained on the sounds of literary history, the Objectivist was always active and ready to pounce. As a critic of Joyce, Kenner loved to sleuth for what was not there but there, untold and inaudible yet capable of being inferred, invisible yet visualizable. These were textual moments caught between presence and absence that he named "The Rhetoric of Silence," the title of his 1979 <i>James Joyce Quarterly</i> article. But unlike a true deconstructionist captivated by undecidability itself&#x02014;Kenner could not resist "Sherlockholmesing" the text, as the narrator of "Eumeaus" might call it, turning innocuous bits of matter into evidence, and training on them his formidable deductive powers.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  This was his procedure in "Molly's Masterstroke" , which many of us consider "Kenner's Masterstroke." The essay was triggered by a question: if Bloom banged his cranium on the door of his front room because the furniture has been moved, who moved it and why? In this gap in the narration Kenner inscribes the bedroom farce that he calls Molly's failed masterstroke: "We shall see Molly attempting a counterstroke of her own; or rather, we shan't see her attempt. We'll have to deduce it, though from ample evidence" ("MM," 22). Kenner then concludes that Blazes Boylan moved the furniture at Molly's request, presumably to mitigate his threatening sexual prowess. For Kenner, fictional women&#x02014;like Flaubert's fictional women&#x02014;are kinetic rather than static readers, as Stephen Dedalus might call them, and Molly Bloom here acts under the presumed influence of her favorite pornographer, Paul De Kock. But the power of Kenner's argument&#x02014;the marshalling of evidence, the logical reconstruction of events and their presumed motives&#x02014;is so powerful that we forget that he has performed a purely speculative exercise. He has hypothesized a scene missing from <i>Ulysses</i> yet made it so palpably vivid and convincing by his argument that we feel it is <i>there</i>&#x02014;that we have read it in Joyce's text. Hugh Kenner turned <i>Ulysses,</i> already a dialogical work in the Bakhtinian sense, into a text whose voids have been filled by Kenner's voice.

<p class="noIndent">
"Art," quips Hugh Kenner in <i>A Homemade World</i>  "lifts the saying out of the zone of things said" (<i>HW,</i> 60). The reference is to William Carlos Williams's poems, such as "The Red Wheelbarrow," that do not seem to "say" anything profound and yet are brilliantly articulated. It is a notion close to Wittgenstein's adage "that a poem, although it is composed in the language of information, is not used in the language-game of giving information."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Kenner's emphasis on the <i>how</i> rather than the <i>what</i> has sometimes led critics to confuse him with the New Critics. But Kenner, who studied at Yale under Cleanth Brooks, had little truck with New Critical doctrine, which was, for his taste, excessively thematic and ral. The New Critic tracked a given poem's unifying metaphor or paradox&#x02014;for example, the comparison of lovers to saints in Donne's "Canonization." Kenner, by contrast, never focused on what Reuben Brower called the "key design" or "the aura around a bright clear centre";<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  he looked, not for centeredness but for difference. What makes Beckett's syntax unique and different from Joyce's? How did Pound's annotation of Eliot's <i>Waste Land</i> transform that particular poem? How did the language of the turn of the century popular magazine <i>Tit-Bits</i> differ from the representation of Gerty McDowell's seemingly similar maudlin kitsch language in <i>Ulysses</i>?
</p>

<p>
The ethos that animates such questions is hard to characterize. You will not find Kenner's name in the endless handbooks of literary theory and criticism that have sections on formalism, 

<b></b>

post-structuralism, feminism, postcolonialism, and so on. To be included, a given critic must be <i>representative</i> and must provide a model that students can follow. But one cannot, I think, perform a Kennerian reading of anything, for Kenner is himself a kind of poet-critic, whose books and essays place him among <i>writers</i> rather than among academic commentators. Indeed, his eclectic methodology and firm emphasis on values places him closer to Samuel Johnson or Coleridge or T. S. Eliot than to such systematic theorists as Adorno or Foucault. Hence the unusual status of <i>The Pound Era,</i> which, despite its immense learning and esoteric subject matter, has remained popular with general readers for over thirty years.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Pound Era,</i> along with Kenner's studies of Joyce and Eliot, Williams and Beckett, represents what has often been called "the invention of modernism." Not everyone's modernism: highly selective in his enthusiasms, Kenner slighted women poets (especially Gertrude Stein) and minority writers. Eclectic as is his methodology&#x02014;a mix of philology, etymology, and close attention to syntax, coupled with literary history, cultural study, and biographical information&#x02014;his value system is as firm as Pound's or Johnson's, and often just as irritating. But it is a good question for our time whether criticism can be as tolerant and value-free as we now want it to be. In the age of cultural studies, when the literary text is regarded as primarily a symptom of its culture rather than as an individual success or failure, critics are reluctant to pronounce one work or group of works "better" than another. Kenner's, on the other hand, is advocacy criticism: as the author of "firsts"&#x02014;the first important book on Pound, on Wyndham Lewis, on Joyce, on Beckett, and for that matter on Buckminster Fuller&#x02014;his aim was to bring the reader round to his understanding of and appreciation for the author in question.
</p>

<p>
What, then, are the values that govern Kenner's choices? His detractors stress what they take to be his conservative politics and accuse him of possibly sharing the fascist values of Pound and Lewis. But Joyce was hardly a fascist, and Beckett, as an implacable enemy of the Nazis, actually risked his life in the Resistance. And what about Louis Zukofsky and George Oppen, poets both Jewish and on the far Left, whom Kenner promoted, almost single-handedly, when they were barely known, just as he was a great supporter of their mentor William Carlos Williams and of Marianne Moore?
</p>

<p>
What do these modernist poets have in common? Kenner never spelled it out, but he demanded two things from modernist literature. One was accuracy of presentation&#x02014;what Pound called "constatation of fact"&#x02014;which was by no means mere facticity. The other was a conjunction of literary innovation with that of the other arts, sciences, and technologies. No Modernist writer, Kenner felt, could be impervious to Einsteinian physics or to such technological inventions as the X-Ray, the Marconi wireless, the airplane, and the typewriter. In <i>The Mechanic Muse</i> , Kenner studies the role the typewriter played in the invention of a new poetry with regard to lineation, stanza form, and page design. Thus Yeats, Kenner shows, was still a poet of the handwritten page, Pound of the typed one. And it was Kenner who established the chronology of the separate <i>Waste Land</i> manuscripts by studying the typewriters on which they were composed.
</p>

<p>
But perhaps the most important demand Kenner placed on the twentieth-century text&#x02014;and this has not always been understood&#x02014;is that it be international. To write 

<b></b>

only for or about one's countrymen was no longer enough. Here the key Kenner text is <i>A Sinking Island</i> , a book whose dismissive treatment of twentieth-century British writing caused consternation, especially in London but also in New York, where Bruce Bawer responded with "Hugh Kenner: A Sinking Oeuvre."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  <i>A Sinking Island</i> argues that, unlike Continental Europe or the United States, Britain never underwent an avant-garde phase, and hence its post-World War II writing was largely tame and regressive. One can refute this argument readily; indeed, in recent years, British poetry and fiction have often been more adventurous than our own. Still, Kenner is onto something important: that the rigid class structure of England, which lasted well into the 1960s, was inimical to avant-garde innovation.
</p>

<p>
One key to understanding Kenner the critic is that he considered himself an outsider. A Canadian of Scottish-Irish descent who lost most of his hearing in childhood as a result of influenza, a Catholic convert among Protestant Anglo-Canadians, Kenner was never at home at Yale, where his Toronto mentor Marshall McLuhan sent him for his Ph.D, and even less at home in England, whose residual Imperialism and Oxbridge snobbery he found irritatingly oppressive. Not surprisingly, then, Kenner early on determined that the "real" British modernists were, with rare exceptions like D. H. Lawrence, who was working class, not English, but foreigners: James, Pound, and Eliot (American), Conrad (Polish), Ford (German), and especially the Irish: Yeats (when not engaged in theosophical mumbo jumbo), Joyce, and Beckett.
</p>

<p>
Those who know their Pound, will recognize that Kenner's modernism was essentially Pound's own: "Poetry is news that STAYS news," "Make it New!", "Go in fear of abstractions," "Do not retell in mediocre verse what has already been done in good prose," "Use no superfluous word, no adjective which does not reveal something . . ."&#x02014;these Poundian axioms were absorbed into Kenner's vocabulary. Like Pound, Kenner had an almost allergic reaction to what Wordsworth called Poetic Diction&#x02014;to vagueness, muzziness, circumlocution, and stock phraseology. Even more than Pound, he related modernist writing to new developments in the visual arts, especially cubism, futurism, and the technologies that gave us the readymades of Duchamp or the abstract corner-reliefs of Tatlin.
</p>

<p>
In this scheme of things, Kenner's <i>b&#x000EA;te noire</i> was, not surprisingly, Bloomsbury. For him, the Bloomsburies were not modernists but late or post-Victorians whose innovations&#x02014;including the rejection of conventional plot and characterization&#x02014;masked perfectly traditional English values. Bloomsbury, Kenner quips, was once defined as "a congeries of men and women all of whom were in love with Duncan Grant" (<i>ASI,</i> 161). Theirs was the ultimate in-group, a state of affairs that irritated their Cambridge contemporary Wittgenstein, himself homosexual, as much as it did Kenner; the point being that, from the outsider's perspective, the Bloomsburies were defined by their "acute class-consciousness" (<i>ASI,</i> 163). Privilege was all, and, as Woolf's journals, letters, and even novels make clear, one did not consort with those who were not "one of us." Joyce is referred to in Woolf's <i>Diaries</i> as "illiterate" and "underbred," and when Harriet Weaver brought Joyce's typescript to the Woolfs' Hogarth Press, Virginia wondered, "Why does [Joyce's] filth seek exit from [Weaver's] mouth?" (<i>ASI,</i> 170). Weaver, moreover, was said to have the table manners of "a well bred hen" (ibid).

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Kenner has something more serious than gossip in mind. Himself a materialist, if not a dialectical materalist critic, he wonders if the Arnold Bennett of <i>Hilda Lessways,</i> an Edwardian whom Woolf mocks for his emphasis on material goods and property as defining a given character's consciousness, isn't perhaps closer to modernism than is Woolf herself, with her emphasis on fine shades of individual consciousness. Kenner takes exception to Woolf's remarks in both "Modern Fiction"  and "Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown" .<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  In the class-conscious England of 1924, the important thing was that the educated, well-bred, and "clever" reader should have something to say over which fellow readers could chuckle as they read the anonymous (but stylistically identifiable) reviews in their <i>TLS.</i> "To an Arnold Bennett," remarks Kenner, "[Woolf] could condescend from her safe perch in the upper middle class, but innovation tormented her with jealousy" (<i>ASI,</i> 176). Indeed, in a 1922 <i>Diary</i> entry, Joyce is dismissed as "a queasy undergraduate scratching his pimples," and <i>Ulysses</i> is "an illiterate, underbred book, . . . the book of a self-taught working man, &amp; we all know how distressing they are, how egotistic, insistent, raw, striking, and ultimately nauseating" (ibid).
</p>

<p>
What does being a working man have to do with it, not that Joyce, educated at a private Jesuit boarding school and then University College, Dublin, was one? Here again, snobbery is coupled with inaccuracy, prompted, most likely, by the displacement onto class of Joyce's status as Irish (and hence inherently d&#x000E9;class&#x000E9;) Catholic. Modernism, in Kenner's scheme of things, was precisely a revolt against these values of class, nationality, and ethnicity. From Stein and Eliot, to the futurist and Dada manifestos, to Pound and Williams, Kafka and Brecht, Mayakovsky and Khlebnikov, and beyond them to the Sam Beckett whom Kenner wrote about so brilliantly, the genteel English liberal agnosticism of Woolf and her circle was no match for the purposely ungainly, untidy writing in <i>The Waste Land</i> or <i>The Cantos.</i> Whatever else modernism was about, Kenner argues, revolution, or at least the myth of revolution&#x02014;was at its center.
</p>

<p>
In what he calls Woolf's best novel, <i>To the Lighthouse</i> , a novel that elegizes the "idyllic" world before WWI, Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay (versions of Woolf's father and mother) retain the clich&#x000E9; characteristics of Victorian males and females: he is rational, she is intuitive; he compartmentalizes, she regards matter as fluid. Thus Mrs. Ramsay recalls something her husband said at dinner, "about the square root of one thousand two hundred and fifty-three. That was the number, it seemed, on his watch." "What did it all mean?" Mrs. Ramsay wonders. "To this day she had no notion. A square root? What was that?" (qtd. in <i>ASI,</i> 181). To assume that such "thought" is a sign of "masculine intelligence," as does Mrs. Ramsay (and perhaps her creator as well), that women do not think about such cold mathematical trivia as square roots (and, to be accurate, does anyone really think about specific square roots?) is, Kenner argues, "a radical defect of imagination," an "unwillingness to conjure real plausibility" (<i>ASI,</i> 182). It is a harsh judgment. But my point here is not whether Kenner is "right" or "wrong," or whether his pantheon is excessively narrow and prejudicial. Rather, I want to suggest that Kenner's ostensibly quirky, eccentric criticism has a self-consistency we find only in the great critics&#x02014;in, for example, Walter Benjamin or Roland Barthes.
</p>

<p>
The issue is not, as Kenner's critics sometimes claim, merely aesthetic. For Kenner, as for Wittgenstein, ethics and aesthetics are one. This means that the persistent 

<b></b>

differentiation between "Left" and "Right" modernism needs to be rethought. Take the case of Ezra Pound. The late great Brazilian Concrete poet Haroldo de Campos, himself active in Left politics, once told me that he thought Pound was a very "ethical" person. De Campos meant that, despite Pound's reprehensible politics and offensive anti-Semitism, his poetry is "ethical" in its fidelity to its own principles. It does not have a "palpable design" on the reader, as does, perhaps, <i>To the Lighthouse,</i> which purports not to make value judgments about its characters, but then sets up Mr. Ramsay as representative of "masculine" traits at odds with his wife's "feminine" sensibility. The solution, Hugh Kenner, like de Campos, would have argued, is not to substitute "better" values but to make sure that, as Beckett says of <i>Finnegans Wake,</i> form is inseparable from content. Value cannot be detached from language itself.
</p>

<p>
Thus, even as Kenner belonged to no "school" of criticism and adopted, in his writing, whatever methodology&#x02014;whether biography, etymology, or digression about a particular cultural feature&#x02014;might elucidate a particular textual conundrum,&#x02014;his insistence that there is no "content" separable from a poet's language itself is as applicable today as it was fifty years ago when Kenner published <i>The Poetry of Ezra Pound.</i> Louis Zukofsky comes to mind as an example in the wake of the recent Centenary conference.
</p>

<p>
Kenner greatly admired Zukofsky, but the current rather facile consensus that Zukofsky's ethics are ipso facto more admirable than Pound's would no doubt have given him pause. A Lower East Side Jew, Zukofsky was a man of the Left who stood overtly for social change. But Pound may have been the more ethical of the two. For Pound's absorption of the troubadours, of Dante and Cavalcanti, as of Confucius, the Noh theatre, or Propertius, was all of a piece with his sense of himself as a poet. He <i>became,</i> in other words, his precursors. We cannot say the same for Zukofsky, whose writing is littered with references to Courtly love codes, Chaucer and Spenser, to Bach and the early fugue, and yet places these allusions within the frame of a bourgeois family romance, wherein the poet and his wife Celia, his helpmeet and amanuensis, are dedicated to the ostensible genius of their only son, Paul. What does it <i>mean</i> to juxtapose, as does <i>"A"</i>-12, this fixation on family with a set of allusions and esoteric images based on the <i>Vita Nuova?</i> Where does the extreme artifice of <i>Eighty Flowers</i> stand vis-&#x000E0;-vis the more robust modernism of Zukofsky's other master, James Joyce? When these questions are finally asked, it will be understood that Hugh Kenner, far from being the "conservative" formalist he is now often taken to be, was the great radical among modernist critics.

T. S. Eliot: The Performativity of Gender in <i>The Waste Land</i>
<!--_/title-->

<div class="beginText">





<p class="noIndent">
One of the most influential ideas developed as American feminist theory and women's studies grew into disciplines is the assertion that gender is socially constructed. Conceived in part as a means of political resistance to the disempowerment of women, this theoretical position may be located in a context of post-structuralist theory that sees meaning as constructed and deferred in language, and the speaking subject itself as constructed in discourse&#x02014;positions variously elaborated by Lacan, Derrida, Foucault, and Kristeva. At the beginning of the last decade this idea received a powerful re-interpretation in the work of Judith Butler, who argued that gender is performative, asserting that "the performativity of gender revolves around . . . the way in which the anticipation of a gendered essence produces that which it posits as outside itself" and that "performativity is not a singular act, but a repetition and a ritual, which achieves its effects through its naturalization in the context of a body. . . ."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
A close reading of <i>The Waste Land</i> will show, I believe, that T. S. Eliot profoundly anticipates a fundamental cluster of concepts taken, for much of the latter part of the twentieth century, to be <b>post</b>-modern. That Eliot's work contains a play of dramatic voices has long been well-understood, but critics have not fully recognized that a founding part of the drama is the performance of gender.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Indeed, this poet, sometimes flagrantly positioned as the epitome of male poetic/sexual hierarchy,<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  is one of the first twentieth century res to depict what Judith Butler later called "the ways in which the very thinking of what is possible in gendered life is foreclosed by certain habitual and violent presumptions" (<i>GT,</i> viii). To illustrate the way Eliot uncovers 

<b></b>

these structures of the self, as performances and as socially constructed in discourse, I will reexamine three crucial emotional scenes from <i>The Waste Land</i> comprising the Hyacinth girl episode (35&#x02013;42); the first conversation in "A Game of Chess" (111&#x02013;38); and the silent confession to the friend in "What the Thunder Said" (402&#x02013;23). Each of these scenes reflects, I believe, memories of searingly intense moments from Eliot's private life, involving three different persons with whom his relationship was deeply personal. Though such attributions may never fully escape from the speculative, recently published documentary evidence makes somewhat less arbitrary the association of the first of these scenes with the college friend he considered marrying, Emily Hale, the second with first wife Vivienne Eliot (<i>TSE,</i> 169), and the third (though a more contested one) with the young medical student Jean Verdenal.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  It is not insignificant that each of these scenes involves markedly different performances of gender and social situations in which expectations of performance are clearly, sometimes traumatically, imposed. The biographical allusion is enriching to our understanding of the full ramifications of these scenes; in the language of Butler's later book, the protagonists possess <i>bodies that matter.</i>
</p>

<p>
Recognizing the performative elements of Eliot's understanding of gender can help us get past some disputes in Eliot criticism; more fully understand the foundations of the modern; and perhaps help us make sense&#x02014;possibly for our own satisfaction&#x02014;of some of Eliot's more abrupt decisions in his personal life. Both the first and the last of the three examples are contested sites for those who wish to claim Eliot exclusively for worlds either heterosexual or queer.
</p>

<p>
Significantly, each scene contains textual qualities which foster gender ambiguity&#x02014;the first because the female re of the lines is connected by name with the homoerotic re of Hyacinthus and the third because the lines exploit the gender indifference of the English "I" and "you." (Even the second exemplified scene withholds all explicit forms of gender assignment, save for the assumption that one quoted speaker is the same as the "she" who sits on a "Chair . . . like a burnished throne" (<i>CPP,</i> 39). Such indetermination forces a construction of gender in discourse about the poem.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, recognizing Eliot's understanding of gender as performative highlights the extent to which competing critical claims to assign Eliot's own sex/gender identity, through these scenes, are themselves ultimately a refusal of the very portrait Eliot himself offers of the self as a performance which actualizes some among the self's many fluid possibilities. The loss of a stable subject is one of the formative elements of the modern, and that instability is most fundamentally realized in the conception that gender is itself a performance. This is an issue which united rather than divided male and female modernists, although they inevitably approached the issue from a different place within social discourse.
</p>

<p>
And, perhaps, Eliot's implied belief that gender <i>is</i> what one <i>does</i> can help illuminate the personal decisions that often resist interpretation. Eliot's decision not to marry Emily Hale, whom he met in 1912, before leaving for Europe  came not very long after his profoundly significant friendship with Jean Verdenal . The abrupt marriage to Vivienne in 1915, occurring shortly after that, offered a public resolution 

<b></b>

to any personal gender ambiguities. Finally, his surprising legal pursuit of John Peter for a homoerotic reading of <i>The Waste Land</i> in 1952 gains intelligibility if the essay is understood as undoing a lifetime of gender performance to which the poet consciously subscribed.
</p>

<p>
One should not&#x02014;as a result of this brief overview&#x02014;conflate the concept of gender performativity with "play-acting." As Butler observes, notwithstanding the fact that gender is produced in the concrete acts of human beings, those acts are projected outward <i>as if</i> they had origin and essential being elsewhere; and they become "identity categories that are in fact the <i>effects</i> of institutions, practices, and discourses with multiple and diffuse points of origin" (<i>GT,</i> xxix). In this guise gender becomes, Butler argues, even violently coercive as it is practiced and experienced in concrete social settings. Indeed, long before Butler, Eliot teases language to reveal the painful dialectic between production and reproduction of gender categories, between gender performed and gender experienced as imposed from without.
</p>

<p>
At an overarching level, <i>The Waste Land</i> is about failure to achieve union&#x02014;with an Absolute, an Other, the Self, an object for knowledge, and with culture and tradition&#x02014;and fragmentation is its ultimate condition. The failure of union and coincidence of all sorts is most prominently red in <i>The Waste Land</i> by the breakdown of a wide variety of kinds of human relationships, and a failure of love.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  The first dramatic presentation of failed love in <i>The Waste Land</i> is the vignette with the "Hyacinth girl" in "The Burial of the Dead," framed by two quotations from the account of the tragic love of Tristan and Isolde.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  In the first lines of the episode, a speaker is quoted wistfully recalling what seems to be the beginning of a romantic and erotic relationship:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
"You gave me hyacinths first a year ago;
<br />
"They called me the hyacinth girl."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The narrator, who is by turns observer and actor, and whose avatars include both the sexually chameleon Tiresias and the impotent Fisher King, silently responds to the Hyacinth girl in language redolent of failure, impotence, and consequent self-loathing:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
&#x02014;Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,
<br />
Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not
<br />
Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither
<br />
Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,
<br />
looking into the heart of light, the silence.

Much of the power of this scene&#x02014;indeed its very reading&#x02014;depends upon the invocation by the reader of a script of masculine gender performance which is at once normative and coercive, and which incorporates subsidiary expectations about performance of the feminine. This is a scene in which the male is the initiator: "you gave me hyacinths first a year ago." What the narrator/lover has given is erotic both in the 

<b></b>

overtly phallic shape of the hyacinth and in the culturally conventional sense of the male wooing his beloved with gifts of flowers.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  The word "first" stipulates that this was a continuing interaction (a <i>courtship,</i> in the terms of this narration). Moreover, it was recognized by a community of observers; indeed, in a fulfillment of the gender script of femininity, the female speaker has derived identity from it: "They called me the hyacinth girl." The time of its recollection is another marked in the cultural narrative of romantic love, for this is the anniversary of something which began "a year ago." In yet another manifestation of the power relations implicit in performances of gender, her subordinate role in the exchange is stipulated by the noun "girl."
</p>

<p>
But the wistful tone and the past tense signal that the episode did not achieve the promise of its inception. The narrative is taken up by the male speaker, whose internal monologue offers an interpretation of the reasons for the girl's wistfulness and her use of past tense. He conjures a scene of great sensuality: they returned "late, from the Hyacinth garden" and he remembers the girl with "Your arms full, and your hair wet."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  In this context the reader is encouraged to interpret the passage as signifying that her arms were full of the flowers he has given her. But the imagery of fertility associated with the woman is overmatched by the imagery of stasis and impotence assigned to her would-be lover. In the agonizing light of the expectation of masculine dominance in literal physical and erotic connection, the speaker cannot connect in any abstract way: he can't speak, he can't see, and his consciousness cannot even seize an object:

The attitude of self-flagellation here has led some critics and biographers to see these lines as a commentary on Eliot's early relationship with Emily Hale.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  The account of the relationship with Hale which Eliot left with his second wife, Valerie, in "a private paper, written in the sixties" (and quoted by her in the introduction to Eliot's <i>Letters</i>) is congruent with the memory of a personal love left unresolved (<i>LTS,</i> xvii). Eliot knew Hale in amateur dramatic performances at his cousin's home in Boston, probably in 1912, and he tells us he declared his love to her in 1914, shortly before he left for study in England (<i>LTS,</i> xvii). The following year, 1915, he very abruptly married Vivienne, a marriage which speedily proved disastrous. In the private paper left with his wife, Eliot continued, "I was still, as I came to believe a year later, in love with Miss Hale." Though he acknowledged that any explanation of those decisions about two crucial love relationships were likely to remain "unintelligible," he argued that "I think that all I wanted of Vivienne was a flirtation or a mild affair: I was too shy and unpractised to achieve either with anybody. I believe that I came to persuade myself that I was in love with her simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England" (<i>LTS,</i> xvii). Of Vivienne, he confessed, "To her the marriage brought no happiness . . . to me, it brought the state of mind out of which came <i>The Waste Land</i>" (<i>LTS,</i> xvii; ellipses in the original).

<p>
Careful attention to tense and sequence suggests that the utter impotence and failure described in the Hyacinth girl scene is a symbolic negation of the speaker's self, of his anticipated "gendered essence." This calamity has <i>already</i> happened when the couple returns from the garden. Like Yeats's white heron in <i>Calvary</i> (1920; published 1921) the narrator's encounter with a metonymic Absolute&#x02014;the "heart of light"&#x02014;has proved all but fatal.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  The parallels with Dante's <i>Paradiso</i> XXXIII, when the narrator looks upon the white rose (XXXI), are explicit: sight is consumed, the mind's gaze is suspended, and the narrator has no more speech than the babe at breast.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  But unlike Dante's text, the scene here is framed by the tragedy of another tale of love lost. The beloved speaks in the past tense, and emphasis falls squarely on the experience of <i>dis</i>empowerment. Because we are not told what happened in the garden, the text maintains simultaneously connotations both erotic and metaphysical. It becomes a founding site of one of the controlling conceits of the poem, the wastage of human erotic love, simultaneously ring the absence of connection with a Divine Love; the interruption of desire in language; deferral of union of signifier with signified; and the failure of consciousness to be coterminous with its object. The very withholding of a description of the events in the garden which has led some commentators to argue (incorrectly, I believe) that the relationship was consummated (if later lost), helps to produce the dissolution of certainty in knowledge and interpretation (<i>MW,</i> 165).
</p>

<p>
But information about what happened in the garden is not the only information that is withheld, and it is worth revisiting the scene. The entire foregoing interpretation rests upon a normative and coercive concept of the performance of the masculine, and to use Judith Butler's words, the very "anticipation of gendered essence <i>produces</i> that which it posits as outside itself" (<i>GT,</i> xv; emphasis added)."[T]he performativity of gender revolves around this metalepsis" (<i>GT,</i> xiv). Look again; not once does Eliot use the masculine pronoun to refer to the narrator. And only once, almost <i>exactly</i> in the middle of the poem (line 219 of 434), is the sex of the narrator stipulated&#x02014;notably during the scene in "The Fire Sermon" in which the narrator seems to blend with his avatar Tiresias, expressly described as having lived as both male and female. Further, although his body bears the marks of his past, Tiresias is not androgynous, but alternatively male and female. Although it may have been a convention in earlier narrative poems for the narrator simply to speak in the unmarked gender of first person, in a poem of such length with so many shifting voices, avoiding pronoun reference to the narrator must have required a good deal of care. This narrative produces what it presupposes; we presume the narrator in this poem is male because he "<i>acts</i> male." Thus with the collaboration of the reader the narrator performs a failed masculinity. Within the poem we know next to nothing about the narrator's body&#x02014;save for the ascription of trans-sexuality to Tiresias and impotence to the Fisher King. What we do know thus does nothing to reassure us about gender roles as essential.
</p>

<p>
Nor is the withholding of explicit gender reference the only way in which the being of gender is destabilized in this scene. The scene of erotic heterosexual love, with its echoes of Grail legend, fertility ritual, and the Garden of Adonis, is shadowed by another scene, that of the love of Apollo for the beautiful youth Hyacinthus. The Hyacinth tale is one of agony too&#x02014;for Zephyrus, who also loved Hyacinthus, caused 

<b></b>

the quoit of Apollo at play to strike the youth in the head and kill him. From the blood of Hyacinthus grew the hyacinth flower, and its leaves are said to bear the initials of the youth, which became the sounds of woe&#x02014;ai, ai. It forms another narrative of the terrible failure of the lover, for reasons beyond his control. The homoerotic implications of the Hyacinth myth have produced unusually sharp exchanges from several critical camps, from Marianne Thorm&#x000E4;hlen's treatment of homosocial desire as "absurd conjecture, the flowers being given to a girl" (<i>MW,</i>165), to James Miller's comparably pointed insistence that the entire <i>Waste Land</i> is an elegy for the dead male friend.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Such sharp disputes depend, I suspect, upon essentialist readings of gender, which the poem itself does not confirm. Thorm&#x000E4;hlen's dismissal is too swift, for, after all, designation of Hyacinthus as "girl" is precisely the way one manifestation of a normative construction of masculine gender would position the male object of hierarchically superior male affection.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  And Miller's insistence that Eliot's "real" sexual orientation was homosocial flies in the face of a lifetime of behavior much more complicated and ambiguous than such an ascription of gendered essence suggests.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Significantly, both are present; the dominant heterosexual performance of masculine gender failure framed by the background echoes of alternative performances of gender, construct both a different object and a different subject.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Indeed the doubleness of the scene, the simultaneous presence of alternate, almost opposite possibilities, may at one level even account for its stasis and silence.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  From another perspective, the effect is similar to the oscillation between the framing story of Tristan and Isolde and the central image of the Hyacinth girl, identified by Jewel Spears Brooker and Joseph Bentley. "In fact," they write, "<i>parergon</i> and <i>ergon,</i> frame and picture, must of necessity mutually exclude each other and mutually define each other. But though Eliot's mode of presentation leads to a stabilization of the picture of the hyacinth girl and her lover, the fact that the frame is more powerful than the picture has a destabilizing effect" (<i>RWL,</i> 70). In an analogous way, what is overpowering in this picture is not the re of Hyacinthus standing behind the Hyacinth girl, but the erosion of confidence in an essential self. If gender is a performance (as, we might recall, it is also flagrantly displayed to be in Eliot's "Portrait of a Lady"), the poem seems to ask, what is there essential in the self even to aspire to union with a universal Absolute? Indeed, as Butler points out, "the fear of losing one's place in gender . . . constitutes a certain crisis in ontology experienced at the level of both sexuality and language."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Accordingly, a fundamental part of the fragmentation and instability evinced by <i>The Waste Land</i> stems from the loss of a stable subject, and that instability is most flagrantly projected in the alternative possibilities for the performance of gender which <i>The Waste Land</i> displays. Such a redefinition of the subject unites metaphysics with cultural practice, and is common to both male and female poets of modernism, notwithstanding their often divergent reactions to the perception of gender as performative. It is, I think, a founding and pervasive element of the modern that has not yet, I believe, been sufficiently appraised.
</p>

<p>
Peter Nicholls, for example, in his outstanding assessment of <i>Modernisms,</i> asserts that "the hegemonic form" of modernism represented by Pound, Eliot, Lewis, and Joyce, 

<b></b>

was "concerned with developing models of psychic order which reinstate the divide between art and life, frequently in terms of a parallel re-fixing of sexual difference."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  He proceeds to argue that "Eliot's suspicion of forms of writing which make the word somehow self-sufficient&#x02014;"feminine" or narcissistic forms, because language has not there become a register of the differentiation of self from other&#x02014;are shared in various ways by Pound and Lewis" (<i>MLG,</i> 195). "The literary values of this type of modernism are founded, then, on an attempt to dissociate desire from any form of identification, and on the appeal to the visual and objective which affirms distance and difference" (<i>MLG,</i> 197). Against this "modernism" he defines the work of H.D., Stein, Williams, Moore, and Loy as a kind of "anti-modernism" or "polemic disturbance within the canonical version" (ibid). However, I would argue, the attempt to determine the meaning of the instability of sexual difference and gender performance was a common thread among both male <i>and</i> female modernists; and the <i>failure</i> of modern man to accomplish the association of desire with identification is the profound tragedy and loss of connection that made <i>The Waste Land</i> waste.
</p>

<p>
Although pivotal to this argument, the Hyacinth girl episode alone remains insufficient to ground an argument that Eliot, <i>avant la lettre,</i> perceived and represented gender as dramatic performance. We now turn, more briefly, to two of many other representative scenes within the poem. Probably drawn from Eliot's own life, another such scene is exemplified in the merciless exchange between the upper-middle-class woman in "A Game of Chess" and her husband or partner. As in the Hyacinth girl narrative, the woman is directly quoted, while the narrator responds only in an interior monologue set off by dashes. Indeed, it is the absence of response which constitutes the real passive-aggressive violence of this scene. Here too the female speaker is identified as female; the narrator's sex is unspecified. Once again the narrator is constructed as male (this time in the role of husband) by what he refuses or fails to perform of the gender expectations his own actions summon into the poem from its surrounding community of discourse.
</p>

<p>
The woman makes demands on the narrator which we may presume appropriate coming from a wife, but hardly from a casual acquaintance. She demands that he "stay with" her, because she is unwell this night:

Because the location is her boudoir, where she has been dressing (perfume vials are unstoppered, her hair is being brushed), we presume a male visitor to be a sexual familiar. This impression is imagistically buttressed by the description of her hair (as in the previous scene a bodily focal point of erotic signification): "under the brush, her hair / Spread out in fiery points / Glowed into words, then would be savagely still" (<i>CPP,</i> 40). Equated with "fiery" hair, her words become a covert sexual demand, made in the oblique way permitted a middle-class woman of insistent libido, raised in the Edwardian era. Thus when she demands, "Speak to me. Why do you never speak. Speak" we 

<b></b>

recognize that the woman pleads for a connection that is at once emotional and erotic (ibid). The extent of the brokenness of this connection is quickly clear. Words fail; the mind of this man is completely opaque to her, and identification of the perceiving subject with desired object is literally non-existent:

With the utterance of the word "never" we recognize the repetitiveness by which modes of gender, of being men and women in the world, appear. To use Butler's language, "performativity is not a singular act, but a repetition and a ritual, which achieves its effects through its naturalization in the context of a body, understood, in part, as a culturally sustained temporal duration" (<i>GT,</i> xv).
</p>

<p>
The ritual quality of this relationship, endlessly recurring and never progressing, is shockingly clear in the parataxsis of the narrator's silent response:

This scene continues with pseudo-responses that could be viewed as exchanges of threat or injury. On the one hand the silent narrator substitutes two different kinds of evasion of emotional contact for the direct response which his partner demands. The first meditation, with its reference to "rats'alley / Where the dead men lost their bones," Sandra Gilbert has linked to Gallipoli, the site of the death of Jean Verdenal.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  As she points out, "rats' alley" is one of the names given to the labyrinth of trenches on Gallipoli, where Verdenal died on 2 May 1915. We recall that Eliot dedicated <i>Prufrock and Other Observations</i>  to "Jean Verdenal, 1889&#x02013;1915 / mort aux Dardanelles." Here elements of Eliot's own biography may prove illuminating about the emotional complexity of this text. To the extent that one may imagine personal emotions projected upon the re of the metamorphic narrator in <i>The Waste Land,</i> it becomes significant that the woman in "A Game of Chess" can be associated with Eliot's first wife Vivienne and the friend of "What the Thunder Said" with Jean Verdenal. If one makes such an association, the speaker's despairing reference to "rats' alley" substitutes reflection on a relationship permanently lost for response to the demands of a present one. In <i>Waste Land Facsimile</i> drafts the next response also seems to refer these lines to the very ambiguities established in the earlier Hyacinth girl episode. Although the bracketed material (below) was removed, the ur-text read:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

<p class="noIndent">
As in the previous scene, such allusions destabilize the performance of gender and shadow the text with a relationship which constructs a subject with quite different gender possibilities, homoerotic rather than heterosexual. One thinks of a shadow as a replica of the "original," but here again is a shadow with a difference, and the subtle effect is to emphasize the fluidity of gender performance.
</p>

<p>
The other emotional evasion by the silent narrator is performative in its aspect as parody. Responding to the frenzied demand "Are you alive, or not? Is there nothing in your head" the narrator performs a few bars from a contemporary jazz song that vulgarizes Shakespeare (whom he had himself quoted in the immediately preceding meditation). This gesture offers a kind of simulation of a simulacra which has its greatest force in reflexively demonstrating the emptiness of the center. It is as if the narrator literally acts out the emptiness of his response to the question of his partner: <i>Nothing</i> is precisely what is in his head. But to offer no response to the emotional and erotic demands of another&#x02014;who is perceived in cultural gender scripts as "entitled" to make such demands&#x02014;risks serious injury to the other. The extent of that injury can be measured by the fury of the woman's response:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
"What shall I do now? What shall I do?"
<br />
"I shall rush out as I am, and walk the street

Perceiving a kind of abandonment which would deny her the very identity as the wife or partner of this man, she first cries "What shall I do now?" She then proposes an action, which, under the guise of a distraught hysteria threatens a retributive betrayal suggestive of public emasculation: "I shall rush out as I am, and walk the street." Bearing in mind the purposes of streetwalkers in Central London, the fact that she has been dressing in her boudoir, and that her hair is down, we are alerted to the significance of her threat to "rush out <i>as I am</i>" (emphasis added). It is therefore no accident that following this almost unbearable scene of union unachieved, the woman utters what is really the cry of the whole poem: "What shall we do tomorrow? / What shall we ever do?" The question is both ethical and ontological, and it is driven by the perception of the self as too unstable to make commitment or union possible. A fundamental feature of that instability is the instability of gender itself.
</p>

<p>
I will complete this portrait of gender performativity in <i>The Waste Land</i> with an examination both of the crucial address to the friend in "What the Thunder Said" and several stanzas in Part V of the poem which lead up to and help to situate it.
</p>

<p>
In the fourth stanza, following the liturgical rhythms of the lament at the absence of water, the narrator expressly notes his inability to recognize the sex of a "third who walks always beside you":

This passage contains dual and opposing allusions. In his notes, Eliot himself linked the passage to the explorer Shackleton's account of his Antarctic expedition, in which the party "at the extremity of their strength, had the constant delusion that there was <i>one more member</i> than could actually be counted" (<i>CPP,</i> 54). But in his opening note to section V, Eliot cites the journey to Emmaus as one of the themes of the section , and most subsequent critics have treated the lines as an allusion to the disciples on the road to Emmaus, unable to recognize a risen Christ.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  It is important to retain the collision of the two images Eliot himself suggested: is the re one of salvation or a delusion brought on by life in extremis?
</p>

<p>
Uncertainty about the answer to this question inhabits the agonized agnosticism of the poem. However, there are also other nuances of meaning in which uncertainty about the sexual identity of the re becomes importantly suggestive. The two allusions&#x02014;to an explorer and to Christ on the road to Emmaus&#x02014;do not in themselves mandate a perception of gender uncertainty. That is explicitly added by the narrator. Throughout the poem, Eliot, like Dante, has used desire for a human being as a metonym for desire for union with a divine Absolute&#x02014;and failure at that quest as well.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  The tragedy of <i>The Waste Land</i> is that the narrator fails at both quests. The passage suggests that the narrator, unlike Dante, is uncertain about the sex of the desired love object, an uncertainty made palpable in the poem by the introduction of the episode with the friend three stanzas later. The performance of the "one walking beside you . . . wrapt in a brown mantle" is insufficient in dress or action to inscribe gender in the narrator's understanding. Unprompted, he calls attention to his uncertainty, and thus adds one more link to the discourse of gender insecurity which is a central element in the ontological, spiritual, and erotic crises of the waste land. (Moreover, the speaker's inability to determine the gender of the re also reinforces our perception of the speaker's uncertainty about the nature of the deity whose salvation he seeks.)
</p>

<p>
The narrator's seemingly tangential profession of uncertainty as to the gender identity of a companion on a journey of exploration is thus tellingly separated by only three stanzas from the crucial next-to-last stanza in which the speaker remembers the possibility and loss of a moment of genuine response between self and other, the speaker and his friend. Those three stanzas suggest the repetitive proceeding of civilization after civilization to their violent dooms, coming in the third to the site to which the journey of the poem seems to have led: an "empty chapel, only the wind's home" (<i>CPP,</i> 49). That stanza ends with a cock crow and a "gust bringing rain." Just as the narrative of the hooded third re contains paired and opposing readings of delusion or salvation unrecognized, so too the cock crow compresses the alternative readings of renunciation of a beloved friend who offers the salvation of human connection, on one hand, and temporary escape from a ghost, on the other. These paired readings of 

<b></b>

the cock crow so importantly frame the stanza which follows that their background must be brought forward.
</p>

<p>
The "co co rico co co rico" can recall for us the warning to Peter, "Verily I say unto thee, That this day, <i>even</i> in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice." Luke explicitly asserts "thou shalt thrice deny <i>that thou knowest me</i>" (emphasis added; Mark 14:30; see also <i>Matt.</i> 26:34; Luke 22:34). Peter, who has pledged to die with Jesus, now will not even acknowledge he knows him. This by itself greatly heightens the narrative which follows. But there is also a probable reference here to <i>Hamlet</i> and this reference confers still further layers of complexity on the succeeding narrative (<i>EPP,</i> 95, 328). This allusion reminds us of the crowing cock in <i>Hamlet</i> (I, 2, 209&#x02013;19), whose cry causes the ghost of Hamlet's lost father to vanish with the day. Hamlet's love for his father makes him loathe to tolerate his mother's swift remarriage, and the event torments him almost to witlessness. Eliot was at great pains to argue that this loss and what Hamlet sees as his mother's guilt were insufficient to justify Hamlet's anguish. The "'madness' of Hamlet" over these feelings is "For Shakespeare . . . less than madness and more than feigned," Eliot argues.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Eliot calls it "an emotion which can find no outlet in action" and asserts that it is for the artist,
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
an emotion which he cannot express in art. The intense feeling, ecstatic or terrible, without an object or exceeding its object, is something which every person of sensibility has known; it is doubtless a study to pathologists. It often occurs in adolescence: the ordinary person puts these feelings to sleep, or trims down his feeling to fit the business world; the artist keeps it alive by his ability to intensify the world to his emotions.

These are of course among the famous lines explaining the objective correlative.

We need a great many facts of his biography . . .

The crucial next to last stanza, for which the crowing cock&#x02014;and "a damp gust bringing rain"&#x02014;are introduction, offers the scene in "What the Thunder Said" in which the speaker addresses his "friend," and we may well wonder if Eliot's comments about Shakespeare do not apply to himself as well. Here he speaks, in some of the most contested lines of the poem, of "the awful daring of a moment's surrender" and concludes that such surrender is literally constituent of the self: "By this, and this only, we have existed" (<i>CPP,</i> 49).

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
In the critical passage in the second to last stanza, the narrator responds to what the thunder said. As Eliot himself tells us, the passage is framed by a fable drawn from the <i>Brihadaranyaka&#x02013;Upanishad,</i> 5, 1. And he supplies the meanings "Give, sympathize, control" for the Sanskrit transliterations "Datta, dayadhvam, damyata" (<i>CPP,</i> 54). This passage has prompted some remarkably divergent interpretations. In a thoughtful and detailed reading that stresses that the sound of the thunder is after all, just sound&#x02014;da," an incomplete phrase&#x02014;and emphasizes the act of interpretation involved in the passage, Brooker and Bentley suggest that there may be three different interpreters here (<i>RWL,</i> 190). Grover Smith argues that there is one interpreter, a re who is unable to respond affirmatively to the thunder and thus fails, again, the initiation required in the Legend of the Fisher King (<i>EPP,</i> 95). Both readings see the narrator as having succumbed to lust while failing to achieve love or union (<i>RWL,</i> 191; <i>EPP,</i> 96). Martin Scofield, however, notes "a moment of exceptional tenderness" here (<i>ETP,</i> 124). Scofield, I think, is right, and it is the sense of a healing, even redemptive, union&#x02014;lost&#x02014;that fuels the equivocation between despair and hope with which the poem draws to an end.
</p>

<p>
This passage, like the narratives in the Hyacinth girl episode and "The Game of Chess," is at one important level a narration of the performance of gender possibilities. It is made by a single narrator, the same re who appeared in the heterosexual courtship and marriage scenes we have previously discussed. This narrator listens to the thunder and interprets it to say that only by a genuine and profound encounter with the Other can one actually exist rather than succumb to the death in life of the wasted land.We may note at the outset that this passage, like that of the Hyacinth girl before, tolerates readings which re gender in very different terms. Indeed one reading&#x02014;not totally strained&#x02014;could construe the assertion "By this, and this only, we have existed" to mean that human beings survive over time only through the fertility implicit in a man and woman's erotic union (<i>CPP,</i> 49). But the passage oscillates, as the Tiresian speaker himself does, between two very different readings, or performances, of gender, and it is important, I think, to see as dominant the assertion of the meaning of a friendship between men. To begin with, the literal text invites such a reading. It begins:
</p>

The address to "my friend"&#x02014;<i>mon cher ami,</i> in the French salutation of Jean Verdenal's letters to Eliot (<i>LTS,</i> 20&#x02013;36)&#x02014;exists within connotative conventions that make this the address of equals, in which the power relationship is unskewed by the expectations of male-female relationships that prevailed at the time, and in some circles to the present. (James Miller has argued that the canceled lines of the <i>Facsimile</i> stipulate the sex of the friend clearly: the line is, "we brother, what have we given?"<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  But this line in the 

<b></b>

holograph has been heavily canceled and arguably remains impossible to read (<i>WFL,</i> 76). An equally compelling case exists, I believe, in the connotations of the mode of address: "my friend.") The language, which is retrospective, suggests that the intensity of the moment was such that the very heart was hammering. This giving was a surrender of self, but paradoxically one which initiates actual existence. Not actual birth, it holds out the possibility of rebirth from death in life. It is "daring" and imprudent, we may interpret, precisely because it violates normative gender expectations. And it generates the possibility of a certain way of being in the world which cannot be canceled from history&#x02014;even if unrepeated. It will, however, inhabit a place of silence. This act of momentary surrender will not be noted by others at our death, nor will it be woven among the memories we cast over our long ago past, and it cannot be left among our material possessions for others

Key language in the passage resembles&#x02014;for whatever reason or accident&#x02014;that in the last of the seven letters written to Eliot by Jean Verdenal in 1911&#x02013;12, after the year in which they had lived in the same pension on the rue St. Jacques while Eliot attended lectures by Bergson and studied French language and literature with Alain-Fournier. As early as a letter of 5 February 1912, Verdenal had expressed fear that their separation had begun to attenuate the intensity of their friendship,<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  and in the final letter we have from him, he bids his friend goodbye in a passage that seems to regret the prudence which is in some unspecified way linked with the separation:

Eliot recalled this friendship several times in writing during the time both shortly before and after the composition of <i>The Waste Land.</i> The collection <i>Prufrock and Other Observations</i> in 1917 was dedicated to Verdenal, and for the 1925 edition of the poems the dedication "For Jean Verdenal, 1889&#x02013;1915 / mort aux Dardanelles," was brought together with an epigraph from Dante immediately below it which read, in Italian: "Now you are able to comprehend the quantity of love that warms me toward you, / When I forget our emptiness / Treating shades as if they were solid."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Christopher Ricks notes that Eliot had written a similar dedication in his "Notebook," "probably when he sold it to Quinn in 1922."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

Whatever the personal memories that may have attended the poet, the narrator he constructs in <i>The Waste Land</i> goes on to recount another case of an opportunity for human meeting that remained unrealized or unsustained:

<p class="noIndent">
This is a relationship of mutuality. If the first interpretation of the thunder, "give," spoke of "surrender," this passage speaks of "control." This is a control, however, which accommodates the force of the other. Eliot was himself an expert sailor and knew well that the skilled helmsman controls a sail boat, not by directly opposing the force of the wind, but by accommodating to it, by tacking on a course which is a marriage of the direction the wind is blowing with the direction the sailor wishes to go. The narrator speaks with a wistfulness fully comparable to that in the Hyacinth garden: "your heart would have responded / Gaily, when invited, beating obedient / To controlling hands" (<i>CPP,</i> 49&#x02013;50). The verb is subjunctive: <i>would.</i> The possibility of the heart's response existed, but it remained unfulfilled, perhaps broken off or abandoned, constituting one more lost glimpse of the possibility of union.
</p>

<p>
Unlike Miller, I do not believe that the entire poem can be read as a lament for the loss of the homosocial beloved; to read it so is to do violence to some of the most electrifying&#x02014;and heterosexual&#x02014;scenes in the text. But it is revealing and important, I think, to read this passage within the context of Eliot's friendship with Jean Verdenal, just as the earlier passages have been associated with Emily Hale and Vivienne. I believe this to be true not because narrator and poet can be conflated&#x02014;they are not&#x02014;but because such a context sustains a contention that Eliot recognized gender as performative and illuminates a source of his portrayal of the modern person as unmoored from founding narratives. Butler herself has discussed the role of non-normative sexuality as part of her own history of articulating a theory of gender as performative:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The idea that sexual practice has the power to destablilize gender emerged from my reading of Gayle Rubin's "The Traffic in Women" and sought to establish that normative sexuality fortifies normative gender. Briefly, one is a woman [for Eliot read "man"], according to this framework, to the extent that one functions as one within the dominant heterosexual frame and to call the frame into question is perhaps to lose something of one's sense of place in gender. . . . I sought to understand some of the terror and anxiety that some people suffer in "becoming gay," the fear of losing one's place in gender. . . . This constitutes a certain crisis in ontology experienced at the level of both sexuality and language.

<p>
Eliot and his contemporaries recognized the performativity of gender as a source of ontological instability of the self long before it became a touchstone of post-structuralist 

<b></b>

theorizing. In the first quarter of the twentieth century this insight posed a profound challenge to a stable order in social experience, an order which human cultures have sought to achieve through centuries of essential constructions of the self. It also introduced an impediment to stability in one of the most consistent symbolic means of ring ontological certainty, or a union with an Absolute&#x02014;that of erotic love for a human person. This processual self, constructed in performance (even if projected outward upon the world as if it were given) thus has its important parallels in much of the philosophy of the early twentieth century. Heidegger, for example, noted that "Man's being is grounded in language; but this actually occurs in <i>conversation</i>" and again:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The presence of the gods and the appearance of the world are not merely a consequence of the occurrence of language; rather they are simultaneous with it. And this to the extent that it is precisely in the naming of the gods and in the world becoming word, that authentic conversation, which we ourselves are, consists.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Many have recognized that the instability of the self shaped the practices of modernism and is a constitutive element of it. Fewer have noted the centrality of gender performativity to that instability. Recognizing the presence of this portrait of the gendered self in Eliot provides additional evidence of the far-ranging scope of Lyotard's assertion that "A work can become modern only if it is first postmodern. Postmodernism thus understood is not modernism at its end but in the nascent state. . . ."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Simultaneously, identifying the performative elements of Eliot's conception of gender may help us get past certain disputes in Eliot criticism concerning his personal life&#x02014;if only for our own satisfaction&#x02014;and competing critical claims regarding Eliot's sex/gender identity. Ever the creator in words, Eliot understood life itself as performance.

Tony Pinkney's suggestion in <i>Women in the Poetry of T. S.

Miller's "T. S.

Such an alteration would suggest that Eliot was quite literally "of two minds" about the gender ascription and hence of the basic tale told .

(<i>AIL,</i> 81&#x02013;5; <i>RWL,</i> 73&#x02013;6) Gordon makes a persuasive case for connection between the Hyacinth girl scene and the scene in the garden of <i>Burnt Norton,</i> for which there is the precedence of Eliot and Hale's visit a few years before the poem's composition (<i>AIL,</i> 265&#x02013;9). Her efforts to extend that connection to the view of the girl in "La ia che Piange" is less convincing, however, because the date of composition of that poem is either 1911 or 1912 placing it clearly before Eliot's declaration of love for Hale in 1914 and almost immediate separation from her (<i>LTS,</i> xvi&#x02013;vii). The source supporting 1911 as the date of composition is the volume, <i>T. S. Eliot: Poemes 1910&#x02013;1930,</i> trans. Pierre Leyris (Paris: du Seuil, 1947). In his edition, <i>Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909&#x02013;1917</i> (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1996), Christopher Ricks cites this date noting that "the poems were dated (and given notes by John Hayward) (xxxvii). Ricks also cites another source, a letter from Eliot to Eudo C. Mason of 21 February 1936, held in the Humanities Research Center, in which the date is asserted to be 1912 (xv). Other scholars follow one of the two sources. In citing John Hayward as the source of the 1911 date, Gordon draws on Helen Gardner in <i>The Art of T. S. Eliot</i> (New York: Dutton, 1959)  (<i>AIL,</i> 572). The date of Eliot's meeting of Emily Hale is also uncertain. Gordon judges it to be "certainly by 1912" and cites both Valerie Eliot and a Hale letter to M. Moore (24 September 1959) as sources (<i>AIL,</i> 81). Valerie Eliot asserts the date to be 1912 (<i>LTS,</i> xvii, xxi). These probable dates, in combination, suggest that it is questionable to view Emily Hale as the re represented in "La ia che Piange." Such a chronology would lead us to see an earlier friendship red in the repeated images of unconsummated love in Eliot's poetry. The composition of the poem does, however, follow Eliot's year in Paris between 1910&#x02013;1911, in which he experienced a deep friendship with Jean Verdenal. Thus the scene may actually re an inner struggle over gender performance. Notably, I propose this view of the scene but do not subscribe to Miller's reading of it as a straightforward displacement of a male re by a female "cover."
</p>

<p class="noIndent">
<a name="FOOT16" href="#REF16">16</a>.
If some of the poignant res of <i>The Waste Land</i> are rooted in Eliot's own memories, there are several aspects of Jean Verdenal's letters to Eliot which could be adduced to support an argument that this passage contains an allusion to both male and female friends. One of Verdenal's letters to Eliot describes a trip to "the woods" around St. Cloud he has taken that day. This letter too is on the approximate "anniversary" of a similar trip he took with Eliot the year before (Letter to Eliot, 22 April 1912; <i>LTS,</i> 22&#x02013;4).

Lyndall Gordon argues unequivocally that Eliot saw "divine love as utterly different in kind" (<i>AIL,</i> 207). To this I would offer the qualified agreement, "yes&#x02014;to Eliot as different as time and eternity." But that does not mean that the possible momentary intuitions of union with another could not offer, for Eliot, the closest apprehension in time of what divine love might be. Indeed, Eliot's very failures at love offer a synecdoche for human aspiration for unobtainable union with the Divine in time. Eliot thus joins those creating modern art as Lyotard defines it : "the art which devotes its "'little technical expertise' . . . to present the fact that the unrepresentable exists" (Jean-Fran&#x000E7;ois Lyotard, <i>The Post Modern Condition: A Report on Knowledge,</i> trans.

Hugh Kenner, who died in November, 2003, was the most influential interpreter of Anglo-American literary modernism in the decades after WWII, the period during which the modernists themselves changed from contemporary writers to dead authors of an earlier era. With his death Kenner has definitively become part of the past, part of the history of how attitudes toward <i>modernism</i> emerged in critical thinking about literature between 1950 and 1990, the four decades in which Kenner published over a dozen books focusing on modernist writers. But that past is <i>our</i> past, and the term that stands in the names of both the Modernist Studies Association and this journal is <i>our</i> term, one that will be of continuing, living significance only as long as it remains in revisionary flux. As Eliot memorably remarks in "Tradition and the Individual Talent" concerning the claim that "'dead writers are remote from us because we <i>know</i> so much more than they did'," "they are that which we know."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>

The seven brief essays that follow concerning modernism after Kenner contribute to our recognizing the lineaments of literary modernism: as it came to us from an earlier generation of critics, as we have reconceived it, and as we could come to understand it in the future. They are versions (in most cases abridged) of papers delivered at the two Kenner roundtables at MSA6 in Vancouver and at the panel on "Hugh Kenner's Portraits of Modernism in Perspective" at MLA 2004 in Philadelphia.

already published responses to Kenner and his work after his death indicate Kenner's continuing importance to contemporary critics of modernism, whether they primarily admire his views or resist them.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  As the ambiguity of "After Kenner" suggests, our directions post-Kenner may in some regards be in the mode of Kenner, though they are necessarily different because subsequent, and they may be actively opposed to what preceded them, which some would like to leave behind. We are in the midst of accepting and extending, modifying, and sometimes discarding the insights of a previous generation in a mixed response to them and to new evidence and new thinking. Ignoring those insights is not an option.
</p>

<p>
Various issues and recognitions emerge in these essays concerning Kenner's strategies and attitudes and their implications for modernism as he understood it and as we have redescribed it. The subjects include Kenner's relation to formalism, and the place and adequacy of formalist descriptions in modernist studies; more broadly, the character of the work of art as variously understood by Kenner, by post-structuralist thinkers, and by us; the differences between intellectual influences that shaped Kenner's thinking and those encountered by later critics, including critics who draw on recent humanistic theories; the ethical implications of attitudes toward hierarchies of various kinds, including hierarchies of race, gender, and class, in responses to modernism; differing conceptions of the modernist canon; and the character and efficacy of Kenner's distinctive style of writing and argumentation as a response to modernism. Kenner's wide-ranging, highly influential, plentiful writings about modernism provide a basis for reflecting on the kinds of works and authors we as interpreters of modernism praise or depreciate, the styles we adopt in writing about modernism, the ethical positions we take, the intellectual resources we draw on, the theoretical assumptions we make about the work of art, and the anthropological implications of our views.
</p>

<p>
The sharpest disagreements emerge concerning Kenner's judgments about Bloomsbury and his mapping of an international modernism. Although Christine Froula admires Kenner's ability to produce insights based on details, she faults him for what she regards as mistakes and wrongheaded judgments that limit his greatness. Marjorie Perloff, on the other hand, recognizes the harshness of some of Kenner's judgments but considers him a great, radical critic, a kind of poet-critic, whose advocacy was sometimes irritating because of its iconoclasm. There is, by contrast, general agreement about Kenner's relation to formalism: that he was at odds with New Criticism but, like the New Critical formalists, he attended closely to details. Gerald Bruns describes Kenner's allegiance to a strain of Enlightenment thinking that led him to scrutinize random particles in detail as part of an anti-Romantic "rejection of subjectivist poetics" (a rejection he shared with New Criticism). In his contribution to the MLA session (not published here), Walter Benn Michaels characterized Kenner as both a historicist and an intentionalist (neither stance compatible with New Criticism) in <i>The Counterfeiters</i> , his meditation on the aesthetic of the counterfeit. Froula calls him the inaugurator of "a new historicism <i>avant la lettre.</i>" Margot Norris finds a "principled rigor" in Kenner's readings that combines an empirical emphasis on details with a sensitivity to multiple voices (as in the Uncle Charles Principle) to produce readings closer to 

<b></b>

post-structuralism than to New Criticism. Jennifer Wicke identifies in Kenner's close attention to language and style an Aquinian element, evident as well in the thinking of his early mentor, Marshall McLuhan, that refuses to occlude the body. She characterizes the formalism of modernism in Kenner's work as "materialist, bodily, and communal, a history-filled knowledge." The poet that he places at the center of modernism is, in Wicke's formulation, a Pound of flesh.
</p>

<p>
Like Wicke's commentary, Barry Ahearn's brings into view intellectual influences that contribute to making Kenner both distinctive and different from most later critics of modernism. Ahearn traces the pre-Cartesian (and anti-Cartesian), Franciscan-like view of language he finds in Kenner to a Catholic intellectual heritage, which Kenner acquired in part through Marshall McLuhan and Walter J. Ong, S. J. Recognizing that influence helps us situate Kenner's early work during a period in which the writings about art and culture by Catholic intellectuals contemporary with modernist writers (including Jacques Maritain, Etienne Gilson, and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, S. J.) were more widely known and discussed in North America than they are today. Gilson, for an extended period, and Maritain, more briefly, were both associated with the University of Toronto, where McLuhan taught and Kenner studied. Kenner's knowledge of the Catholic intellectual tradition puts him in a distinctive and advantageous position for responding to authors, such as Joyce and Eliot, who also knew that tradition. Other writers of Kenner's generation, including Umberto Eco, brought similar knowledge to bear, especially in readings of Joyce.
</p>

<p>
Kenner's intellectual background, including his classical education, did not prevent and may have contributed to his arresting effect on other readers of modernism who were differently equipped. Margot Norris is compellingly emphatic about Kenner's effect on Joyce studies, even suggesting that some of his insights have become part of a "critical unconscious," one that is compatible with post-structural theory. She points specifically to what Kenner called "the rhetoric of silence" as adding a critically dialogical element to our response, after Kenner, to Joyce. By identifying gaps in the narration, Kenner sometimes speculated about possibilities for filling them. In so doing, he created a doubled sense of what the works present directly and what they imply. His views are sometimes so unforgettably suggestive that they have established themselves in dialogue with the texts that are their ostensible objects. Norris's vision of Kenner is close to the claim I made in Dublin about Kenner as a maker of models, as a "literary mathematical Alexander Calder," who built his "models so prolifically and on such a scale that they became indistinguishable from our realities."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  For Norris Kenner brings out the writerly aspects of Joyce's texts without Roland Barthes's theoretical rhetoric.
</p>

<p>
Jennifer Wicke has a related aspect of Kenner's work in view when she mentions his use of montage, adopted from McLuhan, to exhibit "non-linear simultaneities" mosaically in order to produce in <i>The Pound Era</i> "an arcade," in Benjamin's sense of that word, "of modernity on the page." As I understand her point, these are not the simultaneities of Joseph Frank's "spatial form," which are visual and totalizing in character in a panoptical way. Instead, they result from Kenner's playing ear and time against vision. Again Kenner is proceeding theoretically in writing about literature and 

<b></b>

culture without recourse to theory. His implicit challenging of the eye's dominance by emphasizing the ear and time is in keeping with the post-Heideggerian thinking that many call deconstruction, but Kenner, like Kenneth Burke, develops original insights on native ground, in North America, without inspiration from Heidegger or Derrida.
</p>

<p>
The perspective that I develop in my contribution leads me to reconsider what "reading modernism, after Kenner," can mean, because Kenner, like Beckett, who enabled a crucial shift in Kenner's work, was already "after" modernism, as well as engaged and formed by it. We are <i>post-</i> in relation to a critic who had already crossed into that situation with regard to modernism. He moved, as have we, beyond the "transparent" technology that he identified with modernism in <i>The Mechanic Muse.</i> The shift, which involved cybernetics, is evident in a concern with anthropological issues that is most overt not in one of Kenner's books about modernism but in his reflections on Turing's game in <i>The Counterfeiters,</i> which Bruns comments on. There is a cyborg in Kenner, as there is in Beckett, and its implications necessarily give rise to speculations about technology, art, and the human, which Kenner pursued brilliantly. As Walter Benn Michaels asserted at the end of his commentary on "Hugh Kenner's Theory" at the MLA, "When and if someone who actually understands the central problems of modern literary theory writes its history, <i>The Counterfeiters</i> (not now in print) will be at its center."
</p>

<p>
Roland Barthes claims at the end of "The Structuralist Activity" that we experience validity but not truth when we recognize our situation as always historical, as part of a process of rearticulating the world's old languages on the way to having them respoken by some other language that will arise from history to replace ours. At the end of "From Work to Text," he suggests that we are cut off from past writings unless we reinscribe them by an "exceptional critical effort."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Barthes's views are revealing of our modernity. Kenner's exemplary achievement as Gerald Bruns describes it is his reconstructing and maintaining of modernism. He was a knowing mechanic in an implicitly Barthesian enterprise of dismantling and rebuilding the myths we generate to recognize what we can no longer be and also what we might, with continuing effort, become.

<p class="noIndent">
I want to start, and end, with the illustration, or visual model, that accompanies this meditation on "Irrational" "Man" in Kenner, in Beckett (<a href="#1"> 1</a>). During the well-attended clash of those critical titans, J. Hillis Miller and M. H. Abrams, at an MLA convention long ago, Abrams, reflecting on Miller's deconstructive linking of language to the abyss, pointed out that in New Jersey, where he grew up, <i>word</i> was pronounced <i>void.</i> A picture, then, can be worth a thousand <i>voids</i>; at least it may be in this case. The combined image was inspired by the passage in Beckett's <i>Molloy</i> concerning the "joy of crutches" and the "peace" of <i>pi,</i> whose graphic representation in the Greek alphabet, as the illustration makes clear, can resemble crutches.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Molloy has been thinking about a silver object he once possessed and perhaps still does, whose purpose he knows he will never know. He says that when you know "you are beyond knowing anything," "peace enters . . . the soul of the incurious seeker": "It is then the true division begins of twenty-two by seven for example, and the pages fill with the true ciphers at last." But not wanting to "affirm anything on the subject," Molloy shifts attention to the "rapture . . . in the motion crutches give." The ciphers (variously meaning Arabic numerals, representations of zero, and encoded scripts) fill the page because &#x003c0;, which stands for the value of 22/7, is the name of a conundrum, the name of an irrational number, one whose decimal expansion neither terminates nor repeats periodically. 

<b></b>

The silver kniferest, with its supports and crossbar, becomes linked to &#x003c0;, with its vertical lines and horizontal bar, which we can associate visually with the character on his supporting crutches.</p>

<p>
My attempt to translate visually the passage's strange conjunctions is in the mode of Duchamp, as a transforming marking on a re from Leonardo, his Vitruvian man. There is a strangeness in the passage, meant to be reflected in the illustration, that Hugh Kenner recognized and evoked in his writing about modernist literature, especially once he began publishing monographs on Beckett. In one of my first (infrequent) conversations with him, in the late 1970s, Kenner commented about my attempt to turn my dissertation into a book that "writing a book is a strange activity." I do not think that he meant only that writing a critical book is strange. He meant that writing books <i>per se</i> is strange. By confirming that truth, Kenner's writings fold the riddle of our own challenging strangeness into our understanding of modernism, literature, and culture. An expert on mathematical enigmas, Kenner gave the title <i>Mazes</i> to a late collection of essays, and the final words of <i>The Pound Era</i> are "Thought is a labyrinth" (<i>TPE,</i> 561). 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The persistence of enigmas is worth stressing on a panel that bears the title "Where are we now?" When we were first organizing this roundtable, someone suggested that we "historicize" Kenner. I responded that "historicize" rhymes with "apologise," as that word occurs in the verse Stephen Dedalus apparently hears or remembers when he feels threatened in the opening pages of <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>: <i>"Apologise, / Pull out his eyes, / Pull out his eyes, / Apologise.</i>" The inevitable, necessary historicizing of Kenner need not distract us from recognizing his work's arrestingly unusual character. I do not mean that his writing is peculiar in a derogatory sense. It is strange, but no stranger than we are. My own answer to the question "Where are we now?" is the answer as well to a query that Leopold Bloom remembers in the Ithaca episode of <i>Ulysses</i>: "Where was Moses when the candle went out?"<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  That question stands in the response position following one posed by the (as Beckett might say: what is the wrong word?) narrator, a question about an enigma, which the response concerning Moses, itself a question, names. We encounter literally "an answer that questions and a question which answers," as Roland Barthes defines "literature," which he also calls "mantic," in "The Structuralist Activity."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Though no answer is provided in "Ithaca," it must be: "In the dark." Those words render where we are now, and not just with regard to <i>modernism.</i>
</p>

<p>
Kenner's writings become more obviously strange when he begins his sustained critical engagement with Beckett. I have made the case in more detail elsewhere that Kenner's writing about Beckett in the 1960s contributed significantly to his producing two important books. <sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  They are the widely-read, highly influential <i>The Pound Era</i>  and the comparatively neglected meditation on counterfeiting and the ontology of the work of art, <i>The Counterfeiters</i> , because of which <i>The Pound Era</i> became possible after a long period of uncertainty. No one, including Kenner, could have imagined that he would write either <i>The Counterfeiters</i> or <i>The Pound Era,</i> based on the character of his writing before 1961 (books on Chesterton, Pound, Lewis, Joyce, and Eliot, plus <i>Gnomon,</i> containing 19 essays), when his transforming engagement with Beckett began. The catalyst for <i>The Pound Era,</i> where Beckett plays only a small overt part, includedpublication of <i>Samuel Beckett: A Critical Study</i> , <i>The Stoic Comedians</i> , where Beckett arguably plays a defining role, the second edition of <i>Samuel Beckett</i> , and <i>The Counterfeiters</i> , where Buster Keaton stands in for Beckett. Immediately after <i>The Pound Era,</i> Kenner published his second book on Beckett, <i>A Reader's Guide to Samuel Beckett</i> . His work on Beckett over a dozen years frames <i>The Counterfeiters</i> and <i>The Pound Era.</i>
</p>

<p>
The two surprising books take the forms they do not only because Kenner was responding to Beckett but also because he had begun collaborating with the artist and writer Guy Davenport (who died this past January). Davenport illustrated both <i>The Stoic Comedians</i> and <i>The Counterfeiters.</i> At this point in his career, Kenner began to act on a recognition that discursive language alone could not represent adequately the character of his subjects or the implications he was obliged to express. He recognized the limits of language as he had been using it. Visual representation became pervasively part of Kenner's method in <i>The Pound Era,</i> a book that keeps breaking into photographs,

<b></b>

drawings, reproductions of paintings, maps, and the calligraphy of Eastern and Western languages.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Lest anyone miss the point, the arresting drawing of a panther by Gaudier-Brzeska used on the dust jacket (and on the front and back covers of the first paperback edition) appears as well on the title page and then thirty-one times, in each chapter heading. The book's ending is pluralized as the closing chapter title, "Endings," and that chapter reaches nonclosure in two endings, the verbal reference to a labyrinth mentioned earlier and a photograph of Pound. The shift in Kenner's style, argumentation, and sense of page composition produces a text that, in Jennifer Wicke's words, "exhibits its nonlinear simultaneities by montage" (see her contribution above). What Beckett calls in "Three Dialogues" "the obligation to express" despite or because of being in the dark has produced a work warranting the response that "I don't know what it is, having never seen anything like it before."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  "Three Dialogues" suggests that, by contrast with the enigmatically new, most art remains "on the plane of the feasible" ("TD," 103), in the domain of what we think we know already, because it is driven by "a kind of Pythagorean terror, as though the irrationality of pi were an offence against the deity, not to mention his creature" ("TD," 125). Pythagoras was reportedly killed for challenging received wisdom; his companions threw him overboard when he shared his discovery of an irrational number. And that brings us back to the "Irrational" "Man" illustration.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for Beckett's readers, that is, for us, Kenner rejected the existential humanist misreading of Beckett's works as representing modernity to be a situation of tragic alienation and misery. We can call that misreading, for short, the <i>irrational man</i> interpretation, using the title phrase of William Barrett's influential book on existential philosophy . Recognizing that Beckett was projecting something much stranger about what it means to be human under the conditions of modernity (including the Nazi genocide and the possibility of human self-destruction by technological means), Kenner wrote about Beckett from the beginning in ways that drew on two apparently incommensurable elements, the tradition of the clown and mathematics.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  The mathematical vector turns cybernetic in <i>The Mechanic Muse,</i> when Kenner represents Beckett's writing on the page visually in a way that approximates the programming language Pascal and claims that one of Beckett's sentences is "written in a proto-computer-language" (<i>TMM,</i> 94, 96). Kenner has in view in his late readings of Beckett the crossover between the human and the machine that he began writing about in <i>The Counterfeiters.</i> By suggesting with the language of computers that Beckett has moved beyond the world of "transparent technology" inhabited by modernist writers, Kenner as a critic has stepped overtly into a postmodern situation that Beckett himself experienced (<i>TMM,</i> 15).
</p>

<p>
The human has merged with technology to become something different from anything we can formulate with assurance discursively. The <i>irrationality</i> frequently associated with existentialism is more inviting of description than the elusive so-called irrationality we encounter in Beckett, which pertains to the unfathomable human technology of mathematical concepts, such as pi. Those concepts differ from tools for gaining mastery that we think we can possess and control. Rather than knowing and controlling, we merge with an irresolvable enigma that turns the illusion of closure into 

<b></b>

plural endings. Instead of being singular and knowable, "Man" turns out to be, centaur-like, a creature of diverse couplings and compounds. The endings without closure that Beckett comes to represent in Kenner's late work are captured by the title of the final chapter of <i>A Colder Eye</i> , which focuses on Beckett: "The Terminator." For Kenner, Beckett is the end of modernism, the point at which it stops and something else begins (though "end" can also mean goal). But <i>The Terminator</i>  is famously the title of a film and then of an unstoppable film franchise concerning cultural anxieties involving humans and machines, featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger, a contemporary cultural icon of "Man," who plays the role of a machine. It seems improbable that Kenner could have had Arnold's terminator as cyborg in mind in a work published a year before the film was released. He could not have known the book, because the film was not based on a prior work of fiction of that name. Nevertheless, Kenner applied the word to Beckett and simultaneously recognized the postmodern crossover between human and machine in Beckett's response to a world that Kenner shared with him and with us. We see the crossover in Molloy and his bicycle, in Molloy and his crutches, in Molloy and pi as "Man" the "Irrational," and in Beckett as practitioner of computer language and as terminator. There is a cyborg in Beckett, and in Kenner. Thanks to cybernetics and the computer technology that has transformed us, I am obligated, and not unhappy, to express my discursive formulations as a mirror-resembling, machine-generated image of that "Irrational" "Man."

I would like to thank Marie-Anne Verougstraete for producing the illustration, Vitruvian Pi / "Irrational" "Man." Inspired by the writings of Vitruvius (a Roman architect of the first century B.C.), Leonardo drew "Vitruvian Man" (now in the Accademia, Venice) around 1490 in pen, ink, and watercolor over metalpoint. Like Vitruvius, Leonardo took man as the measure of all things, specifically as a model for understanding the universe because of the human body's supposedly rational geometry, its parts all related by specific proportions, which Leonardo, following Vitruvius, describes (see Martin Kemp, ed., <i>Leonardo on Painting,</i> trans. Margaret Walker [New Haven: Yale U Pr, 1989]:120&#x02013;22). In the illustration, following Beckett, I have irrationalized Leonardo's rationalized image of the human by fusing it with the traditional symbol for the irrational number that can also be represented by 22/7.

There is a re concealed behind the curtains of Hugh Kenner's high modernism, or perhaps Hugh Modernism, that no matter how qualified of late has ineluctably become our own. The wizard manqu&#x000E9; hovers over the modernist critical edifice that is Kenner's enviable legacy, hiding in plain sight. This secret sharer holds an unexpected skeleton key to Kenner's modernist project, its gates glimmering before us like the illusory Emerald City. In Oz, the wizard's powers, while demystified as magic, are in essence the same techniques responsible for the magical effects of the film we watch spellbound. A similar Moebius strip effectively loops Kenner's construction of literary modernism's Radiant City with the seemingly humble machinations of the man in the projection booth. The largely unacknowledged animating spirit behind Kenner's modernism is Marshall McLuhan, the technical ghost in the modernist machine.
</p>

<p>
This probe implies no diminution of Kenner's indubitable originality. It does matter, though, that McLuhan's early work provides the template for the variant of modernism that thanks to Kenner we know best. The negative dialectics of McLuhan's modern materialism trace their crop circles across the landscape of Kenner's modernity. There are farms within farms within farms in high modernism's cultural geography, no matter how cosmopolitan its surfaces, and on this imaginary farm Ezra Pound, in the judgment of McLuhan and then Kenner, rules the roost. The Moebius strip on whose planar surface high modernism was produced met in its impossible suture with McLuhan's theory of 

<b></b>

modernity at the embodied edge called "Ezra Pound." If the patient lying etherized on the table was modernity, Pound's material poetry transfused the sleeper, allowing the unconscious patient to awaken. A foreshortened history of how the early McLuhan peaks in Kenner's prime reveals an arc that ends for both in Pound, the double arc or double rainbow responsible for giving Pound's name to modernist making, making Pound the arbiter of <i>The Pound Era,</i> and its epistemological pot of gold.
</p>

<p>
McLuhan came out of Canada's agricultural soil, his cultural origins quite similar to the passionate socialist agrarianism Thomas Frank lauds in the pre-Republican Kansas of yore, a state we are not in anymore. McLuhan read English at Cambridge with I. A. Richards and F. R. Leavis, but a no less profound mentor was G. K. Chesterton; Kenner's first book was <i>Paradox in Chesterton,</i> introduced by McLuhan. McLuhan likened Chesterton's style to a cathedral's stained glass window, "a mosaic of brilliantly clear and simple hues through which, and not upon which, a transring light streams."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  The alembic of Cambridge was powerful for McLuhan's thought, but the mediated encounter with the American South he experienced as a professor in St. Louis, Missouri, a former slave state culturally identified with the defeated Confederacy, proves decisive. No longer populist per se, but still true to his agricultural roots and resistant to the colonial metropole, McLuhan finds in the New Agrarians quixotically reconstructing the historical South a fitting template for his cultural critique, one with farmland at its heart.
</p>

<p>
Giving Enlightenment rationalism a wide berth in its European form, the Sophist tradition's dedication to the originary powers of speech blooms for him anew in the antebellum South, and finds its ideal mouthpiece in Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson is like Pound, McLuhan will write in a late essay, one who puts a trenchant, practical American spin on Europe's effete rationalism, like the plough Jefferson designed, which McLuhan compares to Pound's technical poetics in the <i>Cantos.</i> Both are poetic machines, inventions not attributable, McLuhan argues, to Europe.
</p>

<p>
In the rationalist North, a literary hero, Edgar Allan Poe, arises from the fallen condition of print and mass culture who can navigate these shoals because he is originally Southern. By McLuhan's lights, Poe descends into the savage forces of print culture, modernity, and the North to seize their power for other, sophistic ends. Poe's medium&#x02014;writing that mimics modern media forms to channel those energies into a wake-up call for deluded, print-addled folk&#x02014;is his message; the message has no meaning save for its clarion tintinnabulation.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  From Poe's "purloined letter" it is but a short jump to high modernism's purloined word, where McLuhan's theory of literature waits for us to notice it on the critical mantelpiece.
</p>

<p>
McLuhan credits Pound's <i>Cantos</i> with showing him how to stop making increasingly futile moral judgments of modernity and mass culture, and instead, animated, to enter the fray. Pound enables McLuhan to ride the whirlwind, to channel the beast of print culture gone mad and bad. McLuhan's visit to Pound at St. Elizabeths in 1948, initiating an intense five-year correspondence between them, sparked McLuhan's thought and in its reverberation offered Kenner the fleshly ribbon of Pound needed to tie up the package of Kennerian modernism. McLuhan writes to Pound, echoing in advance the thesis of <i>The Pound Era</i>:

<b></b>

</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Your Cantos, I now judge, to be the first and only serious use of the great technological possibilities of the cinematograph.

<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
McLuhan took Kenner to see Pound for a two-hour visit on June 4<sup>th</sup>, 1948. The rest is modernism.
</p>

<p>
<i>The Mechanical Bride</i>  was McLuhan's dynamic, Pound-inspired machine for living in the rose window-cum-maelstrom of modernity. Kenner deployed McLuhan's insights twenty years later in constructing a high modernism stripped bare of explicit McLuhanism, by adopting the same amanuensis for <i>The Pound Era.</i> Where McLuhan veered off the rails in designating Pound as a prophetic Sophist, answer to modernity's woes, Kenner inserted Pound into a more controlled universe of literary modernism, and found his prophet. Pound becomes in Kenner's narrative that rough beast slouching toward London to be born.
</p>

<p>
Early and middle McLuhan lives on in Kenner's magisterial modernism, powerful as ever because in Kenner there is no pressure to totalize the system beyond its capacity for totalization. Circling back to Kenner's discrepant application of early McLuhan's literary theories to Pound paradoxically liberates the madness in McLuhan's method, and its sense. Pound is modernism's medium incarnate, a spirit open to the faintest signals announcing a new <i>techne</i> on the horizon, and more importantly a medium per se, a latter-day Hermes who brings the message of no message. <i>The Pound Era</i> operates like Kenner's revision of <i>The Mechanical Bride</i> in his own key and cadence. The book is a mosaic of modernist chips given heft and ductility by Pound's body of work and his sheer quiditty, his <i>Dasein</i> as the design of modernism's rose window. Paradoxically, McLuhan's swerve toward Aquinas supplied the epistemological basis both critics needed to apprehend modernity's technological and aesthetic complexity. In their elaborated Thomism, their refusal to occlude the body and its sense organs, Kenner and McLuhan become the most prescient moderns. "Mimesis," McLuhan declared, was "not simply a matter of representation," but rather of "putting on a completely new mode of being, whereby all possibility of objectivity and detachment of re from ground is discarded." <i>The Pound Era</i> obliterates re from ground, critic from artist.
</p>

<p>
The Pound Kenner creates as modernism's material body, under the sign of the machine age, partakes profoundly of McLuhan's ultramodernist anti-modernism. The paradox is that Pound had or was an uncanny dousing-rod, able to locate modernity's wellsprings pooling underground, and then capable of bringing them bursting to the surface&#x02014;yet all this intuitive <i>poesis</i> was finally in the service of the old, not the new. Pound recognizes the command to "make it new" as the means of removing modernity's encrustations the better to awaken its sleepers to face in the opposite direction. Pound, a real person whose very name is a weight or measure, abstract and concrete, a verb and a noun, serves as a bridge of flesh over the roiling waters of individualist modernity,

<b></b>

a sturdy American bridge, well-engineered, resolutely disciplined, colloquially eloquent, mainlining American know-how even as it traverses cultures, centuries, and languages with impunity.
</p>

<p>
Pound epitomizes modernism in that modernism under the erasure of Kenner's variant is even at its inception an allegory of its self-negation. <i>The Pound Era</i> is as outrageous and fresh in its construction as was <i>The Mechanical Bride,</i> because Kenner dares to use McLuhan's principle of montage as collage plus time, the dynamization of space, the spatialization of time (Erwin Panofsky's definition of film). Kenner's mosaic text exhibits its non-linear simultaneities by montage that juxtaposes the written and the lived histories of those who made modernism, creating an acoustic space shot through with dialogized time, within which we hear and see flashes of what Pound was doing at a given time, eating chocolate as he hikes with his wife or traveling to Venice as a twelve-year-old. These events are given material heft by a dynamic sense of time that makes an event rhyme with a deeper dynamic of time unfolding in another space and place. Vision is problematic for McLuhan because he holds that in the economy of the senses an emphasis on the eye (as in print culture's reliance on vision) would ultimately destroy the all-important life-world of the ear (the primacy of oral speech and of the Word made flesh). McLuhan's deep collaboration with Siegfried Giedion spills over to his student Kenner as a horror of linear perspective and its reduction to a singular point of view. The fascinating connection here is with Walter Benjamin, whose close friendship with Giedion, once his roommate, unites Benjamin's <i>Arcades</i> project, with its diffusion of perspectives, its collective rather than individual subjectivity, and its emphasis on the memory palace of human spaces, with McLuhan's earlier theories of technology and space-time, and, above all, with Kenner's <i>Pound Era,</i> an arcade of modernity on the page. Kenner shares this antipathy to singular perspectives and to visual dominance, both confuted in <i>The Pound Era</i> by its montage environment, where its many pictures and photographs are mediated through human spaces and voices, a regime of the ear.
</p>

<p>
The superb "Pound Typing" from <i>The Mechanic Muse</i>  distills early McLuhan as modernism's received wisdom; on its face the essay is about the technological medium of the typewriter in Pound's hands. Pound-cum-typewriter is the synecdoche for an unexpressed debt to McLuhan. The book's introduction offers a recursive valedictory to high modernism by memorializing Otto Mergenthaler's linotype machine of 1885. With the associative logic of McLuhan's non-linear history of technology, Kenner groups the birthdates of the high modernists around the linotype's patenting date to validate modernism's technological genealogy. The essay takes Kenner's own high modernism as a relic of the era of "transparent technology," when technology was yoked to the body as prosthesis, rather than part of the invisible "so-called Post-Modern" technology.
</p>

<p>
Kenner's high modernism is an epistemology, not an aesthetic. Kenner writes that "sheer intellection of self-interfering patterns . . . was the guarantor of all values" (<i>TPE,</i> 312). Its formalism does not derive from a purely aesthetic understanding of art's value, nor does it divorce art from the <i>socius.</i> Kenner through McLuhan reveals a modernism whose formalism is materialist, bodily, and communal, a history-filled knowledge. Kenner

<b></b>

writes, quoting McLuhan without attribution: "It is only the people we call savages who have a simple, a purposive, a unified culture: whose poets are 'technicians of the sacred.' The decision to leave those simplicities behind . . . was entailed in our decision not to be savages" (<i>TMM,</i> 131). Kenner's modernism must subscribe, like McLuhan's spatial montage theory, to the dictum that "art does not progress." McLuhan, first, and then Kenner rejects Eliot's formulation of this insight in "Tradition and the Individual Talent" for slighting the supercharging of space that can admit time into itself. Both credit Pound with this materialist, formalist realization. Yet Pound progresses; like that bull moose Teddy Roosevelt whom Kenner was fond of twinning with him, forever associated with progress and the progressive movement he named, he seizes the wheel of Western modernity's Edsel and drives it back deep into the past. His art pushes forward the energies of the human community and its <i>sensus communis,</i> the veritable medium of mediation acting on a fraught landscape in need of Jefferson's plough. What are the implications of Kenner's Pound of flesh for modernism? They are staggering: modernism was always already a post- and an ante- modernism, always already postcolonial, always already deterritorialized, the non-linear end of the book and the beginning of the writing of the body. And perhaps even more startling: high modernism is a farm in Canada.

Of the many hostile reviews Gertrude Stein received in her lifetime, the award for Most Vitriolic would probably go to one written by Michael Gold. In 1936 Gold labeled Stein "a literary idiot," claiming that her work represents "an example of the most extreme subjectivism of the contemporary artist," and that it is on a par with "the monotonous gibberings of paranoiacs in the private wards of asylums." Stein possesses a "strong, clear, shrewd mind," and "was an excellent medical student, a brilliant psychologist," but her work looks, said Gold&#x02014;fine-tuning the theme of mental derangement&#x02014;"like the literature of padded cells in Matteawan." Only good Marxists, his review concludes, will properly be able to see through the "mystic irrationalities" that Stein's work represents: "They see in the work of Gertrude Stein extreme symptoms of the decay of capitalist culture" and "the same kind of orgy and spiritual abandon that marks the life of the whole leisure class."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Whether or not we agree with Gold about capitalist decadence, he is surely not the only reader to wonder whether Stein's work is an exercise in self-isolation. An association between "extreme subjectivism" and the experiments of early twentieth-century literature has been made by readers of all stripes, 

<b></b>

whether they are sympathetic to the modernist project (e.g., Marcuse, Adorno, Bloch) or more skeptical (e.g., Luk&#x000E1;cs, Daniel Bell). There are certainly reasons for seeing Stein's texts as even more "solipsistic" than those of her contemporaries. One of the characteristics of Stein's work, however, is the regularity with which it has been justified, by both Stein and her readers, as the very opposite of what such commentators imagine. Indeed, far from seeing in her writings "the most extreme subjectivism of the modern artist," Stein and her defenders have in fact frequently singled them out for their deeply <i>objectivist</i>, <i>realistic</i>, and <i>scientific</i> qualities. "Gertrude Stein, in her work, has always been possessed by the intellectual passion for exactitude," writes Stein in <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i>:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
She has produced a simplification by this concentration, and as a result the destruction of associational emotion in poetry and prose. . . . [Poetry and prose] should consist of an exact reproduction of either an outer or an inner reality. . . . . 
<p class="blockquote">
	Juan Gris conceived exactitude but in him exactitude had a mystical basis. As a mystic it was necessary for him to be exact. In Gertrude Stein [by contrast,] the necessity was intellectual, a pure passion for exactitude. It is because of this that her work has often been compared to that of mathematicians and by a certain french critic to the work of Bach.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
To be sure, Stein is not the only early-twentieth-century writer to have seen herself in such terms. But given her background in experimental psychology and medicine, it is perhaps unsurprising that, more than with almost any of her contemporaries, the language of science is seen as an appropriate vocabulary to use in describing her work. What Luc Ferry says about the "hyperclassicism" of the twentieth-century avant-garde generally is especially true of Stein's work: it is "guided by the project of imitating a real," a "real" that, though no longer "defined as <i>order</i>," acts as "the artist's 'objective'," and that grants a "<i>scientistic</i> component" counterbalancing charges of obscurantist narcissism.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>   
</p>

<p>
What are we to make of such claims? In what follows, I want to explore some of these Steinian appeals to science and to ask what kinds of problems and pitfalls they potentially engender. My first two sections are an act of reconstruction, sketching, first, certain claims made by Stein and her admirers about the nature of her "experiments," and second, how these claims manifest themselves in her work. In sections three to five, I shall be casting doubt on many of these critical and authorial descriptions, and suggesting how we might justify Stein's enigmatic writings without dubious appeals to "exactitude" and mathematics. It is not hard to determine why an artist such as Stein would invoke science as a model. Given the prestige of empirical science in our culture, it is not surprising that ontological justifications for experimental art are sometimes associated with the sorts of investigations performed in the laboratory. But if the <i>attraction</i> of such associations is obvious, we as critics would be irresponsible if we did not ask questions about their <i>legitimacy</i>. Such questions have a deflationary dimension to them, but the goal of asking them is not merely negative. For the great interest of Stein's work is the way it forces us&#x02014;if we take her with the seriousness she 

<b></b>

demands&#x02014;to clarify and make explicit our understanding of meaning, interpretation, rationality, science, and the structure of moral personhood. At stake in Stein's work and the history of her reception is nothing less than the nature and possibility of humanistic inquiry.

To grasp the problems at stake, we need a sample text. I choose "If I Told Him: A Completed Portrait of Picasso," written in 1923. To begin at the beginning:

<p class="noIndent">
My opening gambit, crucial to everything that follows, is this: whatever one thinks of Michael Gold's polemical assessment, we can at least understand why he thought such a text does not immediately&#x02014;the scare-quotes are his&#x02014;"make sense." The passage will in all likelihood be tougher to grasp for most readers than a comparably sized selection from a newspaper article, conversation over dinner, radio broadcast, history textbook, book review, or most other language-uses that we might encounter in the course of a given day. But what exactly is the challenge? Can we say, more precisely than Gold, how and why the going gets tough? As the subtitle suggests, the text is ostensibly a description of a human being rather than other entities Stein would have encountered daily&#x02014;her drawing room sofa, her pet dogs, passing clouds, Haussmann boulevards, and so forth. The question of how this initial assumption helps us with the rest of the text, however, is raised as soon as we encounter the first line: "If I told him would he like it. Would he like it if I told him." In light of the title, we probably feel compelled to assume that the "him" refers to Picasso, but what, we might be inclined to ask, is this "it" that he may or may not "like"? And why, if the syntax of the main clause indicates a question (in English), is the sentence completed by a period rather than by a question mark? And why is the sentence&#x02014;this time with the main clause preceding the subordinate clauses&#x02014;repeated immediately in the next sentence? Patient but eager for answers, we try to ignore this syntax and punctuation, and move ahead to line two: "Would he like it would Napoleon would Napoleon would would he like it." Again, we probably assume the pronoun "he" refers to the character identified in the title, since no one else has been offered as a possible antecedent. But then, if 

<b></b>

this is true, what is <i>Napoleon</i> doing here suddenly? Is <i>he</i>, not Picasso, the "he" who may or may not "like it"? Or is there a relevant resemblance, a metaphoric relation, being proposed between Napoleon and the painter? And why, furthermore, are the words so oddly strung together without punctuation, without the commas and other marks usually indicating the structure of a writer's thoughts? Few answers seem to be offered by the third paragraph, which is made up of five sentences asking, through various syntactical combinations, if "he" or "Napoleon" would "like it" "if I told him." By this point we might have started wondering what the speaker's stance is towards this mysterious "he." Is he or she being supplicant? Anxious? Obsessive? Or is the speaker simply being speculative, not seeking approval as much as information about "his" possible reaction to something? But after the third paragraph, the whole issue of Napoleon and his liking "it" seems to be promptly dropped with a single adverb: "Now." What should we do with this indexical? Is it meant as a spontaneous cry, akin to "Go!" shouted at the start of a foot race? Or is it more generalized, meaning something like "today" or "this week" or, more broadly still, "in our time"? Or perhaps it is modifying a verb&#x02014;"if I told him <i>now</i>," or maybe "would he like it <i>now</i>"? Venturing into the next two lines&#x02014;"Not now./And now."&#x02014;only seems to prolong the uncertainty, an uncertainty that is not cleared up in the two lines after that, which seem to introduce a whole new cluster of problems: "Exactly as as kings./Feeling full for it." What do kings have to do with Picasso? Why is "as" repeated? What "exactly" is "as kings," and how? How is the phrase "feeling full for it"&#x02014;whatever it means&#x02014;related to these kings or, for that matter, to anything else in the passage? 
</p>

<p>
With a bit of work and ingenuity, one could of course begin offering answers for all of these questions. But my interest here is ultimately less in any particular interpretation than in how one could begin to offer <i>any</i> interpretation, so it is important to move initially in slow motion, without losing sight prematurely of the genuine confusions into which Stein regularly thrusts her readers. To declare her work "subjectivistic," as Gold does along with many others, is to say that the kinds of interpretive questions I have posed about "If I Told Him" could be answered only by the author who composed the passage. "In a created thing," said Stein near the end of her life, "it means more to the writer than it means to the reader. It can only mean something to one person and that person [is] the one who wrote it."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  There is an irony here insofar as the portrait genre has always been characterized by a wish to describe or "capture" a person other than the one doing the portrait: the name hanging below the picture frame is the intentional object, the thing that it is <i>about</i>. Indeed, it is in this sense that Stein's portraits can particularly illuminate her work as a whole; emerging from a relatively well-defined genre, they allow us to recognize how Stein everywhere reorients the concerns of our ordinary language. Her project, we might say, is less about an intentional object in the world, less about some entity or state of affairs (the kind of entity mentioned in her title, for example), than about an intentional object in Stein's mind. To use a distinction she makes in connection to "Melanctha," her interest is less in "the realism of the characters" than in "the realism of the composition of [her] thoughts" (<i>PGU</i>, 16). 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Another way of putting this would be to say that Stein's work is predicated on methodological solipsism: it assumes that psychological states do not presuppose the existence of individuals other than the one to whom the states are ascribed.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  "Nothing," she goes on to say in a particularly revealing comment, "can be the same to the other person. Nobody can enter into anybody else's mind; so why try? One can only enter into it in a superficial way. You have slight contacts with other people's minds, but you cannot enter into them" (<i>PGU</i>, 30). It is in part this methodological solipsism that led me to quote C&#x000E9;zanne at the head of my discussion&#x02014;C&#x000E9;zanne being the painter who as much as any artist ushered in a new sense of being "modern," whose influence on Stein is well-known, and whom, not coincidentally, she cites in her discussion of "the realism of the composition of [her] thoughts." The modern artist, C&#x000E9;zanne says in a passage Stein would have appreciated, must "see nature as no one has seen it before you," for art is a "personal apperception." But C&#x000E9;zanne's comment is illuminating in the present context because, in it, one can also detect the scientific aspirations that mark Stein's work. This is most audible in terms such as "optic," "logical vision," "sensation," and "apperception." It is not immediately clear what C&#x000E9;zanne means by these terms, but he obviously wants to suggest that such concepts will allow us to introduce a hardness and objectivity befitting our modern age. This slide between what is "personal" and what is "logical" may seem odd. And, as I'll ultimately be suggesting, such a slide <i>is</i> odd. But it is something like C&#x000E9;zanne's pithy description that we need in order to approach the scientific turn that Stein makes in her own writing.
</p>

<p>
Stein's scientific drive manifested itself early in her career in her commitment to a particular form of determinism, whereby the characters of <i>Three Lives</i> or <i>The Making of Americans</i> are portrayed as strict psychological "types." Even after drifting away from these early conceptions of character, however, she continued to maintain that her writing displayed a strongly scientific dimension. This manifests itself in a number of ways, two of which deserve particular attention.
</p>

<p>
The first instance of what Stein regards as significantly "scientific" in her work is what she often refers to as her resistance to both "remembering" and "resembling." The act of remembering and the perception of resemblances are intertwined, in Stein's view, because to place any single given object within a wider class of objects requires that the observer "remember" a range of other objects not necessarily before him or her. To see, for example, a particular <i>that</i> as a "table" or "chair" is to "remember" and to see "resemblances" between this <i>that</i> and other <i>thats</i> (other tables, other chairs) which we have seen elsewhere and at other times. This, for Stein, is to "misperceive" the object which stands before me, to "veil" the way reality in fact appears "immediately" before us. Even if two chairs are apparently identical&#x02014;the same wood, the same style, the same varnish, the same grain patterns&#x02014;they are nevertheless two and not one. They are "unique" things unrelated to each other or any other entities:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
the making of a portrait of any one is as they are existing and as they are existing has nothing to do with remembering any one or anything. . . . You do see that there are two things and not one and if one wants to make one portrait of some one and not two you can see that one can be bothered completely bothered by this thing.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
Stein's friend Donald Sutherland once explained the idea this way: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
when she writes of unique immediacies and suppresses the generic element, one is always or nearly always tempted to puzzle it out, to induce or to restore a generic element which will make the composition "comprehensible." But immediate experience in its real immediacy is not comprehensible, has no meaning, and when you do induce a meaning you falsify the essential immediacy. Gertrude Stein once remarked, "What is strange is this"&#x02014;meaning that this thing as this thing is new and unfamiliar, as this thing it exceeds or comes loose from the class to which it belongs, from identification and identity so to say.

<p class="noIndent">
Sutherland's appeal here to "the real immediacy" of "immediate experience," and his remark about suppressing "the generic element," might be understood as a Steinian version of radical nominalism, casting doubt on "universals" and "abstractions" ("chairs," "tables") in the face of "concrete" empirical observation. Thus when Stein speaks, as she often does, of finding and describing the "essence" of a thing, the essence in question should be understood as something far from what the Aristotelian tradition believed. "Essence" for Stein is not what makes a thing a member of a class, but rather what makes it a particular, a token and not a type: what it is in its "immediate" <i>that</i>ness, without comparisons to&#x02014;thinking about, remembrance of, classification with&#x02014;other entities. Essence for Stein is what makes a thing <i>unlike</i> any generic kind, how it is that "each one is that one" (<i>LA</i>, 119).  
</p>

<p>
The second important way in which Stein thought of her work as "scientific" follows from this resistance to "remembering," and this is her commitment to what she calls the "continuous present," or, as she says opaquely in her <i>Lectures in America</i>, "living as we are now living as we have it and now do live in it" (<i>LA</i>, 104). As I understand her, Stein wants to say that the present moment is more "real" than the past or the future because it is more "concrete," more "alive," prior to the assumptions of past habits and conceptualizations. For Stein, one cannot step in the same river twice, and any description, be it of a person or object, is "falsified" the moment it is written: "Each time that I said the somebody whose portrait I was writing was something that something was just that much different from what I had just said that somebody was and little by little in this way a whole portrait came into being" (<i>LA</i>, 177). It is this conception of a "continuous present" that leads Stein to lose faith in conventional narrative. If what matters most is the "immediate" moment that makes reference neither to the past (previous events, previous classifications, previous meanings, etc.) nor to the future (where present phenomena supposedly run the danger of growing hypostatized), any sort of narrative will be an abstraction away from the way we "actually" exist, which is forever open and without definitive form. Clear teleologies, the kinds that link past to present or present to future, betray a na&#x000EF;ve (and, for Stein, patriarchal) conception of experience.
</p>

<p>
How these interrelated "scientific" aspirations&#x02014;a resistance to "resemblance" or "remembrance" and a commitment to the "continuous present"&#x02014;manifest themselves in a text such as "If I Told Him" should be clear. Certainly the text "resembles" no other 

<b></b>

written description ever given elsewhere of Picasso, including Stein's own "portrait," "Picasso," written fourteen years earlier. And it would certainly be difficult to identify unambiguously anything like an action or event or anything else that may be the seed of an ordinary narrative. Indeed, the text could be seen as an exemplary expression of what has been called Stein's "anti-memorialist stance."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  One sees, says Stein, "what one sees, the rest is a reconstruction from memory," and what is in need of recovery is "things seen without association but simply as things seen."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Only this kind of anti-memorialist <i>seeing</i>, Stein implies, provides us with genuine <i>knowledge</i>; any other kind of knowledge is merely second-hand. Hence the "scientific" significance of modern art, the best of which, as she writes in her study of Picasso, expresses "not things felt, not things remembered, not established in relations but things which are there, really everything a human being can know at each moment of his existence and not an assembling of all his experiences."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
As I noted at the beginning, Stein's background in experimental psychology and medicine has lent her self-explanations more legitimacy than comparable claims made by her contemporaries. Thus it is, for example, that some of the leading Steinians have been led to speak of "the intensely theoretical, 'scientific' approach to phenomena which characterizes all of her work," and the desire in her portraits "to come to know people, and to know them as a scientist," and how her "fabled obscurity" is in fact "an extreme form of <i>literalism</i>," a "function of what might be called her hyperrealism."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
But an emphasis on Stein's "scientific" dimension brings us to an obvious impasse. For how can we possibly reconcile this commitment to scientific "exactitude" with the equally strong nonsensical quality of her writing? Recalling the remarks from C&#x000E9;zanne that I touched upon earlier, how do we harmonize a Steinian longing for both a "logical vision" <i>and</i> a "personal apperception"?
</p>

<p>
The key here lies in Stein's conception of what constitutes "science" and what it means to seek, as she says, "exactitude." This is the topic of a recent book by Steven Meyer which tries to examine, as his subtitle puts it, "the correlations of writing and science" in Stein's work. Stein's writing, claims Meyer, should be seen as part of an enterprise that he calls "Romantic" or "poetic" science, an alternative tradition of scientific "experimentalism" arising chiefly from dissatisfaction with Baconian empiricism. Other practitioners of this "science," he claims, were Emerson, William James, and Alfred North Whitehead, all of whom Stein admired deeply, and all of whom believed that the conventional explanations of empirical science, premised on the "reductive" assumption that nature is an extended physical mechanism, were unable to account for certain central features of human experience. Specifically, in its commitment to a third-person perspective, modern science forgets that our understanding of the non-human world is always shaped by our perceptions of it, that there is always something "more" left out of physicalist accounts of the world, and that "experience" is always "experienced" by "experiencing" subjects. In Meyer's account, "ordinary empiricism" 

<b></b>

requires "that one divorce the pursuit of knowledge from one's emotional investment in the procedures one has come to follow."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  "Poetic science," by contrast, "emerges historically as a corrective to what the poet-scientist perceives as the inadequacies of ordinary science," and is "vigorously nonmechanistic" and "non-Newtonian," focused upon the traces of human experience "already present in scientific knowledge, although scientists have chosen to ignore it" (<i>ID</i>, 21).
</p>

<p>
As with Stein's self-descriptions, Meyer's account of "poetic" and "modern" science raises a number of questions to which we will have to return. But it is worth looking first at his discussion of James and Whitehead, whom he rightly cites as being among Stein's most formative influences. His discussion of James focuses not upon James's pragmatism, but rather upon the late essays in so-called "radical empiricism." Like traditional empiricism, radical empiricism, as James described it, rejected the sort of aprioristic reasoning and "abstractions" characteristic of rationalism, but its conception of "experience" goes well beyond the conventional empiricist's focus on sense-data. For James, such sense-data might be enough for ordinary science, but human experience&#x02014;or "pure experience," as he called it&#x02014;exhibited a range of other phenomena that a reductive empiricist found no place for. Swimming amidst the streaming flow of "consciousness," the "blooming buzz of confusion," are not only the perceptions of colors and sounds and smells, but also the fantasies, wishes, emotional responses, mental associations, inclinations, and other distinctively human phenomena that accompany the raw percepts of the human mind. Whereas Humean empiricists, says James in a passage Meyer cites, had emphasized that objects perceived by the mind are actually "'loose and separate' as if they had 'no manner of connection,'" a genuinely radical empiricism, one that takes full heed of how we understand the world, "<i>does full justice to conjunctive relations</i>" (though not, of course, in the "peptonizing" manner of traditional rationalism). What Meyer refers to as the "composition of experience" (<i>ID</i>, 13) is revealed to us through what James called "knowledge by acquaintance." Unlike scientific and conceptual kinds of "knowledge-about," this is knowledge that we gain "immediately," by sheer perception of an object&#x02014;be that object observed "in the world" or introspected somewhere "in the mind."
</p>

<p>
Meyer's discussion of Whitehead focuses on a similar set of distinctions between two kinds of knowledge. In this case the contrast is between what Whitehead called "materialist mechanism" and "organic mechanism," a distinction that had begun to develop around the time of Stein's unexpectedly prolonged visit at the start of World War I (<i>ID</i>, ch. 4). "Materialist mechanism," in this picture, is the basis of modern science, and is uncompromisingly reductive. The world and all its entities, including human beings, are composed of molecules; and since molecules run blindly, human beings must also run blindly, without individual responsibility for the actions of their minds and bodies. "Organic mechanism," by contrast, admits the existence of molecules, but sees them as differing&#x02014;in Whitehead's words&#x02014;"according to the general organic plans of the situations in which they find themselves."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  The principles of nature cannot be reduced to mere causality, as they also include "the concepts of life, organism, function, instantaneous reality, interaction," and the "order of nature." Much as James said of 

<b></b>

"knowledge by acquaintance," Whitehead suggested that such concepts are noticeable in "the things which lie around us," the simple immediate facts "that are the topic of interest" of ethics and poetry and not reducible to scientific kinds of cognition. Like James, he was looking for a way to keep mental life sounding legitimate, to preserve some space that causal description could not fully account for, and thus could not soil.
</p>

<p>
It is via this Jamesian notion of "pure experience" and this Whiteheadian idea of "organic mechanism" that we can begin to see how Stein could have understood her work as "scientific." She did not, it should be clear, have much interest for science as it is taught in laboratories; "naturally science is not interesting," she announces bluntly in <i>Everybody's Autobiography</i>.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  What <i>was</i> "interesting" for Stein was an account of the special way in which human beings "experience" the world. "Experience" is a notoriously knotty&#x02014;some would say confused&#x02014;term. On the one hand, it usually refers to something immediate or incorrigible (&#x000E0; la James's "knowledge by acquaintance"), rather than "second-hand" or "reported" (&#x000E0; la James's "knowledge-about"). In this respect it is akin to "the given" sought by sense-data empiricists. On the other hand, it also implies something meaningful, information-bearing, with semantic content. It does not refer to the mere stimuli hitting one's "sensory receptors" (the flashing of light on a retina, the vibrations against an eardrum, etc.), but stands out as a rounded whole, an intentional unity that persists in the memory as a significance-bearing moment.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  To the degree that we all occupy different slices of space-time, to the degree that our individual mental associations do not always perfectly overlap, and to the degree that we occupy slightly different bodily structures with different phenotypes (nineteenth-century developments in biology were crucial to this way of thinking)&#x02014;to these varying degrees, we shall inevitably all "experience" (intuit, perceive, comprehend, grasp, etc.) the world in somewhat different ways. From here it is a short leap to saying that the "extreme subjectivism" denounced by Michael Gold and others is in fact as "objective" as any knowledge sought by traditional empiricism.
</p>

<p>
One immediate consequence of this search for a "science of the inner world," as we might call it, is that the first-person perspective comes to occupy the same privileged place that science ordinarily accords the third-person perspective. For it is here, the claim goes, that one is able to observe the buzzing mixture of concepts and percepts and emotions that, in James's words, makes up the "much-at-once," the "innumerable aspects and characters" of experience.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  It is not for nothing that James himself remained a resolutely introspective psychologist even as the behaviorist revolution loomed.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  In Stein this privileging of the first-person perspective over the third-person emerges vividly in a passage from <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i>, where she describes the reception of "Composition as Explanation," the lecture she delivered at Cambridge in the mid-1920s:

There is, in this brief passage, little indication that the dean was himself some kind of scientistic ideologue. Indeed, far from dismissing Stein as a fool, he is even said to have admitted afterwards that her lecture "had been his greatest experience since he had read Kant's Critique of Pure Reason" (<i>ABT</i>, 222). But the dean does raise crucial questions about verification&#x02014;what role, if any, the concept of intersubjectivity plays in Stein's thinking, and how we should deal with novel ontological claims of the kind she routinely makes. Is there a difference between what there <i>is</i> and what there <i>seems</i> to be? Does the <i>appearance</i>, to me, of a ring around the moon, entail the <i>existence</i> and motion of such a ring? In responding to these questions, Stein explicitly asserts the reality of mental objects, be they accurate memories or misperceptions or drug-induced hallucinations or wayward fantasies. Among other things, this emphasis on the first-person perspective immediately casts doubt upon distinctions between <i>seems</i>-talk and <i>is</i>-talk: a ring can truthfully be said to "follow the moon," for that is how it appears to me as I reflect upon the nighttime sky. Faced with the sorts of questions the dean asks&#x02014;what we can say about a shared world, about things we might all be able to observe, and around which we might coordinate activities&#x02014;James himself could always fall back on his pragmatism: his perspectivism is tempered somewhat by a practical and post-Darwinian emphasis on adaptive behavior within an environment, on the utility of coordinating activities with others.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  But in radicalizing James's psychology, Stein makes it clear that the dean's problems are not the kind that interest her. Rings moving around the moon may not be the kinds of objects that conventional science&#x02014;"ordinary empiricism," as Meyer calls it&#x02014;will deem worthy of investigation. Their reality becomes apparent, however, when we recognize the validity of something like "pure experience" and "organic mechanism," which justify our positing of phenomena falling outside conventionally empirical boundaries. Moreover, literary texts, from this perspective, constitute a kind of new ontological record, documenting introspective reports and building them into the fabric of the world. Whether or not a Marxist reader such as Michael Gold would find such arguments persuasive is open to debate, but evidently Stein convinced not only herself of the cogency of her views. Even by the relatively conventional stylistic standards of the <i>Autobiography</i>, the final sentence of the passage quoted has a bluntness that suggests the extent to which the Cambridge dean, for one, found Stein's position unassailable: "he sat down."

<p class="noIndent">
I have already indicated at various points that Stein's claims are vulnerable to criticism, and it is time to take up some of the questions that up to now I have raised only in passing. As Coleridge said, we should not wish for an act of uniformity against the poets, and as thought experiments, Stein's work is undoubtedly illuminating. Rarely, 

<b></b>

however, does Stein ever rest content with thought experiments, and the statements she makes about her writing typically extend into claims about ontology, epistemology, and the course of history. As her commitment to "scientific exactitude" indicates, she is in the business of making truth-claims, of constructing theories and giving pictures that we are asked not merely to entertain but to endorse. We should not be afraid, therefore, to subject her views to scrutiny, nor to ask, in turn, whether the peculiarities of her writing arise from certain debatable philosophical assumptions.
</p>

<p>
By way of explaining my skepticism, I want to return to Meyer's description of Stein's literary projects, and particularly his claim that "poetic" science concentrates on parts of human experience that are "already present in scientific knowledge, although scientists have chosen to ignore it." The problem with this statement is its shortsightedness. Meyer writes as if scientific practices after Bacon and Galileo were founded upon a more or less arbitrary decision to neglect large parts of the universe, and as if scientific "reductions" were pursued merely for the cheap thrill of counting molecules and building fancy instruments. It is in some sense correct to say, as Meyer does, that modern scientists typically "divorce the pursuit of knowledge from one's emotional investment in the procedures one has come to follow" (<i>ID</i>, 11). But problems quickly arise. Not only does he say little about these "emotional investments" (are they like being in love? watching an exciting film? ting for one's country?), but he also says nothing about <i>why</i> scientists adopt the particular "procedures" they do.
</p>

<p>
These oversights become conspicuous when we consider how little interest "Romantic" science seems to have in what is one of modern (i.e., non-"poetic") science's most important tasks, namely prediction. From Meyer's perspective, "poetic science" is primarily a descriptive enterprise: the poet-scientist seeks to show how "scientific description becomes poetic and poetic description scientific" (<i>ID</i>, 48), and makes use "of the resources of poetic description in order to extend the domain of science" (<i>ID</i>, 22). In this, he can be said to be following Stein's own conception of science, which she claims to have garnered from her Harvard mentor: "When I was working with William James I completely learned one thing, that science is continuously busy with the complete description of something, with ultimately the complete description of anything, with ultimately the complete description of everything" (<i>LA</i>, 156). But whatever the origin of the idea, it is important to understand how impoverished a conception of scientific inquiry it actually is. After all, one hardly needs a scientific vocabulary simply to "describe" something. Every ancient Mesopotamian could give a description of the stars, the planets, the weather, light, anatomy, persons, animals, and so on; and, as I'll be suggesting, we continue to find a non-scientific idiom indispensable in our descriptions of many important phenomena, especially the behavior of human beings. One of the distinguishing features of modern science, however, is that, more regularly and precisely than our ordinary observations, its descriptions allow us to identify certain effects with certain efficient causes, and hence anticipate future phenomena. What makes science "scientific" is its nomological character: where there is causality, there is causal law, i.e., a hypothetically assumed general statement under which individual cases can be subsumed. And, despite the astonishing complexity revealed by post-Darwinian 

<b></b>

science (a complexity that James and Whitehead, among others, were eager to adapt), this interest in nomological patterns encompasses the whole of the natural sciences, even beyond the paradigmatic case of physics.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  As Bjorn Ramberg has written in a discussion of intentional versus non-intentional explanations, the special sciences are all characterized by "a certain homogeneity of interest," a "purely predictive aspect": "There is a sense in which we are not changing the subject by substituting one set of predicates for another in a science, . . . even if there's no reduction or prospect of reduction, as long as the switch is motivated by an attempt to better serve prediction in some domain, even a very loosely and tentatively characterized domain, where we change even our conception of the phenomena to be explained."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  The Laplacian aspirations occasionally voiced among modern scientists, in other words, arise not merely from the powers of "description" that empirical science gives us, but rather from the future events these descriptions allow us to foresee.
</p>

<p>
A first question to ask, then, when encountering claims about the scientific status of Stein's work, is whether texts such as "If I Told Him" could actually be used in the formation of general predictive hypotheses. And, put in these stark terms, one would be hard pressed to find a way to say that it could. In comparison to a sentence such as "This water just began to boil at one hundred degrees Celsius," it is not clear what Stein's line "Would he like it would Napoleon would Napoleon would would he like it" is <i>about</i> (a point I noted at the beginning of my discussion and to which I'll return presently), let alone whether it could count either as evidence for or against a hypothetical general statement. If we understood Stein's text as an "experiment," could we ever <i>repeat</i> it to see if we could achieve the same outcome? And what would ever count as an identical&#x02014;or, just as important, a different&#x02014;result?
</p>

<p>
This is by no means intended as a criticism of Stein per se; to question the idea that "If I Told Him" embarks on some importantly "scientific" procedure is not, in itself, to say that we should reject Stein's writing altogether. No literature is "scientific" in the sense I have just described, since the behavior of human beings&#x02014;the overriding concern for the vast majority of texts we call literary&#x02014;is in significant ways unlike that of planetary bodies, hydrogen molecules, and other entities whose behavior is very well predicted by nomological vocabularies. We should not expect portraits of persons to be as sharply predictive as scientific accounts of other phenomena, nor be disappointed when they fail to live up to such demands.
</p>

<p>
This of course only raises a new set of questions. Which aspects of human behavior make nomological accounts appear so inadequate? Why exactly are we entitled to this assumption about persons? And, if Stein's texts cannot, in Meyer's terms, make use "of the resources of poetic description in order to extend the domain of science," what might they be doing instead? What might literary texts be <i>about</i>, in light of what I've said here?
</p>

<p>
Needless to say, these are enormous questions, and we can only offer a sketch of a sketch here. But a starting point lies in our recognizing that the understanding of a person's behavior typically invokes a range of mental states&#x02014;belief, desire, motivation, intention, hope, hatred, and so on&#x02014;that are without any exact parallel in the natural 

<b></b>

sciences. Another way of putting this is to say that understanding persons is typically interested in the investigation of <i>reasons</i> or <i>justifications</i> while explanation of non-persons is typically interested in the investigation of <i>causes</i>. Both reasons and causes can be invoked in response to the question of "Why?," but they answer why-questions through vastly different means. A good account of, say, why an earthquake occurs or why a pill dissolves in water requires no reference to what the tectonic plates "want" or what the capsule "thinks." Though the capsule and the tectonic plates are, in Ramberg's phrase, in practically different domains (examined by different kinds of scientists looking at quite different kinds of phenomena), their behaviors are equally well-captured by nomological explanations. But a good explanation of&#x02014;to take a mundane activity that Stein doesn't (or doesn't seem to) discuss in "If I Told Him"&#x02014;why Stein opens the refrigerator door does invoke mental terms: she "wants" some orange juice and "thinks" there is still some left in the container. Unlike a physical explanation, this account of Stein's actions requires that we ascribe motivations and understand how these motivations and purposes cohere with the rest of her beliefs and desires. If she is being rational&#x02014;"rationality" here being a generalized term for non-randomness, the minimal coherence of one's beliefs and desires&#x02014;then Stein opens the refrigerator when thirsty because she believes that doing so will allow her access to the juice container; because she believes the juice will slake her thirst; because she believes the juice is there on one of the shelves rather than, say, under her bed; because she believes the juice will do no greater damage to her (it isn't poisoned); and so on.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  We might even go on to give psychoanalytic accounts of Stein's action: "because opening the fridge allows her, unconsciously, to repress traumatic childhood experiences." This would of course be to stretch the range of possible rationalizations, but nevertheless would still be reason-giving explanations, in the sense of providing justification rather than identifying causation. (A point Freud himself often obscured.)<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

Such accounts resemble scientific accounts in that they help us explain and predict&#x02014;they help us say why Stein did what she did and anticipate what she will do next&#x02014;but unlike scientific accounts, they are concerned as much with final causes as with efficient causes. They predict events not nomologically, but relative to evidence pertaining to prior action. There would be no efficient way to reduce even the simple state of wanting to open a fridge to a formula under which one could subsume other individual actions. "Wanting" to open a fridge is not a discrete "mental state": there are innumerable ways such "wanting" can be expressed. (This is even more true in the case of "wanting to visit a friend" or "wanting world peace.") In practice, thousands of years of wondrously complicated evolution mean that such step-by-step rationalizations are routine for us. Indeed, the shock we experience when rationalization <i>is</i> a struggle&#x02014;the Monty Python tobacconist trying to cope with an unwittingly lewd Hungarian visitor, the spouse struggling to understand a mumbling partner drifting into Alzheimer's, or, indeed, the reader encountering "If I Told Him" for the first time&#x02014;is testimony to the efficiency and power of our ordinary interpretive strategies.
</p>

<p>
The consequences of the interpretive position I am sketching here will emerge more fully in the course of our discussion. But we are now at least prepared to take an 

<b></b>

initial step towards answering the general question, raised a moment ago, about what literature might be said to do once any scientific pretensions&#x02014;Steinian or non-Steinian&#x02014;have been exposed as misguided. Literary texts may lack the kind of predictive power that nomological accounts have, but they are exceptionally good at providing thick descriptions of the particularly human phenomena I have been describing here: the ascription of beliefs, desires, thoughts, hopes, hates, and other capacities of mindedness that are necessary for understanding persons within a given environment. The opening of a refrigerator door is ultimately a rather mundane action. But texts we call literary are notable for their ability to display scenarios which, for sheer complexity and realism and drama, far outpace even the most imaginative and carefully crafted philosophical thought experiment. It is this kind of descriptive endeavor that Iris Murdoch describes when she calls literature an indispensable "education in how to picture and understand human situations."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  I assume most serious readers would agree with Murdoch's remark. Wherever one's theoretical or political sympathies may lie, one presumably wouldn't bother with literary texts in the first place if one didn't think that, in one sense or another, they might help us better grasp how persons act within and respond to particular human situations. "Human": it is difficult to see how (e.g.) a novel could be written about (e.g.) a plant's photosynthesis&#x02014;unless, of course, the plant's cells were thoroughly personified and its mechanical processes metaphorically redescribed as moral dramas.

<p class="noIndent">
If, then, we take Murdoch's term "human" to designate the capacity to give reasons and justify actions, and if, as I've been saying, our concern with Stein's texts cannot be first and foremost in its explanation of causes, what <i>are</i> we doing when we read a text as intransigent as "If I Told Him"?
</p>

<p>
One way to begin addressing this question is to make explicit a feature of so-called "Romantic" or non-mechanistic "science." What characteristically motivates this line of thought is a belief in special sorts of inner processes, processes that themselves evince a teleological character. Whatever the differences between James's "pure experience" and Whitehead's "organic mechanism" (and here one might also think of <i>&#x000E9;lan vital</i>, <i>der Wille</i>, <i>Erlebnis</i>, and other similar locutions from the turn of the last century), they can each be said to rely upon what are sometimes referred to as "sub-personal systems." A sub-personal system refers to a theory which proceeds by breaking down a person into an organization of subsystems (organs, routines, nerves, faculties, components, atoms, ids, egos, etc.) and attempting to explain the behavior of the whole person as the outcome of the interaction of these subsystems.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  In contemporary debate the term is used to describe cognitive theories of consciousness, which typically see the mind as a computer-like engine propelling a person as a whole into thought and action. But as the examples of organs and atoms suggest, sub-personal descriptions can come in many different varieties, depending on where we turn our spotlight. And what I am suggesting here is that a version of such sub-personal descriptions characterizes an important 

<b></b>

segment of early twentieth-century thought. James and Whitehead would of course have been horrified by the idea that minds could be modeled on something as lifeless as a computer program. But if their own conceptions of mindedness emphasize fluidity and <i>dur&#x000E9;e</i> rather than the "mechanical" mental processing favored by contemporary cognitivists, they deserve to be called sub-personal systems in the sense that they locate the meaning of a person's "outer" behavior (speech, action) in something "inside." What matters most for our understanding of an individual person is not his or her ("mere") behavior, which occurs in a public setting and which can be interpreted accordingly by any third-person observer, but rather our ability to gain access to what goes on "inside," the mental arena of which actions are only the "outer" manifestation.
</p>

<p>
It should be relatively clear how the concept of a sub-personal system is pertinent to Stein. Indeed, the entire discussion of her so-called "subjectivism," with which I began, could be understood as a sketch of her obsession with the sub-personal level; it was this obsession that allowed us to identify her with methodological solipsism. Stein lacks a technical-sounding term for this sub-personal quasi-entity, but some words that come close are the simple terms "inner" or "inside," which are evident not only in her interview remarks about the impossibility of "entering into" and having "contact with" someone's "mind," but also throughout her descriptions of her work. "I had to find out what was inside any one," she says of her portraits, "and by any one I mean every one I had to find out inside every one what was in them that was intrinsically exciting" (<i>LA</i>, 183). <i>Three Lives</i>, she says, was "concerned with seriousness and the inside of things," a description of "the inside as seen from the outside" (<i>ABT</i>, 147). Faced, then, with a text as abstruse and enigmatic as "If I Told Him," we are encouraged to trace its words back to Stein's "inner" mental processes, be they the aural associations or memories or fantasies or something else "inside" caused by interaction with the text's ostensible subject (e.g., Picasso).
</p>

<p>
It was this quest for the "inside" that led Kenneth Burke, a critic who anticipates many of the questions I have raised here, to caricature the Steinian formula this way: "You will talk much about getting 'inside' things . . . . And since you, as an <i>outsider</i>, are busied with the literary task of describing things until you get <i>inside</i> them, there will necessarily hover about your theories some hint of mystic communion."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Implicit in Burke's remark is a recognition of the complex ways in which the sub-personal level of description actually presupposes the <i>personal</i> level&#x02014;presupposes, that is, the domain of publicly observable human bodies and behavior where we originally learn to apply the concepts that allow us to say things about ourselves, ascribe content to our utterances, and posit "inner" entities such as "thoughts" and "souls."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  To see sub-personal systems as the "ground" of meaning for a person's language and behavior is to endorse an essentially <i>internalist</i> conception of meaning. In claiming, that is, that "Nobody can enter into anybody else's mind," Stein is describing beliefs&#x02014;her belief, for example, that a ring follows the moon&#x02014;as something utterly private, something that she but nobody else can "have" or "possess." But how, we should ask, does Stein know that her mental image is specifically that of a <i>ring following the moon</i> rather than that of, say, a <i>snake leading the sun</i>? To appeal to inner ideas, representations, 

<b></b>

images, words, etc. is only to beg the question of where <i>those</i> ideas, representations, etc. got <i>their</i> meanings. Images and pictures "in the head" are no more intrinsically meaningful than images and pictures in the physical world. Stein's belief that a ring follows the moon may be incorrigible; she could not be mistaken about her having the belief in a way that I, as an onlooker, could. But the <i>content</i> of her belief cannot be "private" in the sense that nobody else could ever grasp it. Thinking depends upon the kinds of fine-grained, normatively sustained distinctions&#x02014;distinctions between <i>rings</i> and <i>snakes</i>, <i>following</i> and <i>leading</i>, <i>moon</i> and <i>sun</i>, and so forth&#x02014;that only language can provide. And the habits and norms and grammars of language are publicly endowed. They are learned within a particular social setting, and are thus open to the scrutiny of third-person observers.
</p>

<p>
To say that sub-personal "insides" do not mean anything on their own is to say that purposes are evinced not by some inner process or "experience," but by the behavior of the person as a whole within a given environment, and it is this behavior that is the starting point for the discrimination of meanings. Such a criticism of Steinian-style private worlds does not entail radical behaviorism.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  But it does mean that the ontological status of our mentalistic terms is less definite than it is for Stein and her philosophical counterparts. These items become, so to speak, less easily locatable, less something <i>in</i> the person than something <i>between</i> persons. Thoughts and beliefs and desires, that is, are things we ascribe to entities&#x02014;e.g., to each other&#x02014;whose behavior is so complex that nomological descriptions are incapable of picking out many salient patterns. If, to return to our familiar example, we see an entity moving near the refrigerator, we might be tempted to begin with some physical descriptions: "it's the broom pushed along by the wind," or "it's the kitchen table moved by the gravitational pull of the moon." But because these accounts will probably seem far-fetched in light of our other beliefs (brooms don't usually open refrigerators, etc.), and because the entity's behavior is relatively complex (with what seem to be "facial expressions," etc.), we will soon resort to descriptions invoking mental states. Stein's opening the refrigerator door is more efficiently explained when we introduce a vocabulary of intentions; and in the event of more complicated activities, such a vocabulary would quickly be recognized as indispensable. To rationalize the behavior in this way does not require that we access her "inner world," but rather that we see the bodily motions in a certain light, as part of an arc of action directed to some goal.
</p>

<p>
Given, then, that the explanatory power of appealing to sub-personal systems is constrained by the accounts we give at the level of the person, the level of publicly learned norms of meaning and grammar and intentional ascription, an important point about Stein's work is worth making. Whatever else she is doing, and whatever else she may say about herself, her failure to make obvious sense does not arise because she is "actually" describing something "basic," "fundamental," and "immediate" to which our conventional syntax and semantics ordinarily block access. If meanings are fixed by an ideal interpreter rather than something uniquely in the head, then <i>there is no "basic" level "underneath" for us to get to</i>. There are, that is, no sub-personal events "in" Stein that <i>mean</i> independently of what she would have learned at the level of the 

<b></b>

person, and no sub-personal processes that she herself could pick out without presupposing the distinctions present in the shared practices of our public language. And as Burke suggests in the same review I cited a moment ago, the very operability of such distinctions means that "remembrance and resemblance are inevitable"&#x02014;i.e., thinking without norms, without grammar, without reliable distinctions between certain types of entities and actions and events, would be not be thought, but empty noise.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  To be sure, we often encounter things or events that induce us to ask, "What's <i>that</i>?" But that which is unfamiliar can only be picked out against a vast backdrop of what <i>is</i> familiar, what we <i>already</i> can classify according to "resemblances" and with the help of "remembrance." In their quest for "the given," sense-data empiricists sometimes used to suggest that grunt-like perceptual reports along the lines of "Red square there now" were somehow more "basic" than grammatical sentences, as if one could pick out different colors (<i>red</i> rather than <i>blue</i>, <i>green</i>, etc.), shapes (<i>square</i> rather than <i>circle</i>, <i>amorphous blotch</i>, etc.), places (<i>there</i> rather than <i>here</i>, <i>on Jupiter</i>, etc.), and times (<i>now</i> rather than <i>next week</i>, <i>in the Renaissance</i>, etc.) without a language. Stein, we might say, gives a vitalistic version of this empiricist effort, a version that readers such as Steven Meyer treat all too uncritically. The "given" she seeks to describe may include, as Meyer vaguely puts it, "emotions" as well as objects in the world, but the syntactical breakdown in her work suggests the same kind of misguided search for something perceptually "basic" or "primitive" lying beneath the classifications of a fully developed, more or less coherent language.

<p class="noIndent">
Keeping these considerations about sub-personal systems in mind, then, the final question we need to face is whether or not "If I Told Him" is therefore merely babble. Can we discern <i>no</i> thinking that must have gone into it and other Steinian portraits? Are Stein's portraits no better than a linguistic random-number generator? Stein of course spent a long time in crafting her texts, sometimes months. What, then, could she have been doing all that time if her texts are simply akin to an infant's rambling mutterings? And what reason is there for us, in turn, to continue reading her texts at all?
</p>

<p>
Earlier in my discussion I described the kinds of confusion into which a reader of "If I Told Him" is led: pronouns without clear antecedents ("he," "it"), ill-defined indexicals ("Now"), unexplained references that may or may not be metaphors ("Napoleon"), ragged syntax and odd punctuation ("Would he like it if Napoleon if Napoleon if I told him"), obscure pseudo-similes ("Exactly as as kings"), eccentric repetition ("If Napoleon if I told him if I told him if Napoleon. Would he like it if I told him if I told him if Napoleon . . . "), and so forth. An important point needs to be made here. Given what I have said already about the situational nature of interpretation, about the ascription of meaning within a particular socio-linguistic environment, it should be clear that terms such as "odd" and "eccentric" are meant to be relative&#x02014;relative, that is, to us and to our ordinary ways of understanding speakers of modern English. When confronted with novel stimuli, whether of speech or behavior, our starting point 

<b></b>

is always our own previous experiences in making sense of persons, our own previous intentional ascriptions. To someone who finds this idea hopelessly ethnocentric, one can only ask: What other starting point <i>could</i> we take up? And besides, beginning with one's own beliefs does not mean <i>remaining</i> with one's beliefs, or that one's set of beliefs are a self-enclosed set of entities. With a modicum of effort, one can always adjust one's beliefs to accommodate a new situation, and often our very survival demands that we do just that. If our initial impulse is to seek salient patterns in the places we usually find them, our experiences in dealing with the varieties of human behavior usually allows us to cultivate the wit and wisdom that, as Donald Davidson describes in a well-known discussion of Miss Malaprop, let us cope with strange talk and odd behavior.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  To say that "If I Told Him" is eccentric and odd is not, then, to invoke some metaphysical standard of sense, or even to deny that such language-use could become, with some changes in the syntax and vocabulary of modern English, as ordinary as chit-chat about the weather. It is, rather, to say that the text breaks <i>our</i> normal expectations, the expectations <i>we</i> have accrued in our experience as language-users. Indeed, in this respect Stein goes well beyond Miss Malaprop, whose mistakes are at least regular enough that we can learn to translate them into more familiar expressions, ask how they contribute to the truth-conditions of a sentence, and place these sentences in a logical relation to other sentences as we always do. We could learn to replace "derangement" with "arrangement" and "epitaphs" with "epigraphs," and draw the appropriate inferences from there. But with Stein it is not always easy to see how we could translate her idiosyncratic speech into something more familiar.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Stein's diction is almost always comprehensible, as critics often note when praising her supposedly "American" attention to the ordinary things of the world.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  But at first glance&#x02014;that is, doing what we normally do, seeking the kinds of sentential patterns that we are accustomed to seeking in language-like marks and noises&#x02014;the way these simple words are combined into sentences is deeply obscure.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, even if we know already that the intentional object of "If I Told Him" is primarily Stein's thoughts rather than Picasso's person, Stein's expressions are so resistant to being organized into easily intelligible sentential patterns that it is difficult to know even what is being stated about her response to the famous painter. The contrast between "If I Told Him" and my simple description of Stein opening the refrigerator in search of orange juice could not be starker. Identifying the content of my description ("Imagine someone opening a refrigerator . . . ") is as unproblematic as my own ascription of content to Stein's action ("She wants something in the refrigerator"). But with Stein's text, the case is obviously much different. Beyond its title, in fact, it is not even clear that Picasso, rather than another of Stein's famous friends, or for that matter anything else, has initiated this catalogue of words. It is not immediately self-evident what would change if the title of the text referred not to Picasso but to, say, Matisse&#x02014;or to her pet dogs, or to passing clouds, or to Haussmann boulevards.
</p>

<p>
But to point out these various confusions is not to say that one could <i>never</i> make <i>some</i> sense of Stein's work, or that one could never find <i>any</i> patterns in her sentences. Indeed, many people have. Again, knowing that Stein is not herself as childish as her 

<b></b>

work sometimes appears&#x02014;even Michael Gold confessed that she has a "strong, clear, shrewd mind," "was an excellent medical student, a brilliant psychologist"&#x02014;we can safely assume that she is up to something special in what seems an otherwise nonsensical text. We should assume that the speaker shares most of our beliefs about the world, and then begin looking for other kinds of patterns that might suggest something.
</p>

<p>
This practice of looking for alternative patterns beyond those of ordinary language is familiar to readers of early twentieth-century literature, who are accustomed to facing texts that, at first glance, often show little sign of having been shaped by a conscious artist. For some early readers, a good interpretive strategy seemed to lie in identifying what was called "spatial form," which pictured a text as a montage of repeated "images," recurrent descriptions of objects and states of affairs from which we can infer some kind of larger meaning.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  In the case of Stein's portraits, however, the search for "spatial form" at the level of imagery is bound to be disappointing, for the confusion initiated by her texts arises at a different, and more basic, level than in the texts of her contemporaries. Pound's <i>Cantos</i> and Eliot's <i>The Waste Land</i>, for example, are famously "fragmented." But unlike with Stein, the fragments that constitute these texts are line- and stanza-sized, and the challenge for the reader is to find out whether, and how, these lines and stanzas are interconnected. It is relatively clear, for example, what state of affairs is being described in the lines, "I sat on the Dogana's steps/For the gondolas cost too much, that year" (<i>Canto</i> III, ll. 1&#x02013;2) or "Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee" (<i>The Waste Land</i> l. 8). And similar things could be&#x02014;and have been&#x02014;said about narrative texts: the patterning of imagery in, say, <i>Nightwood</i> or <i>As I Lay Dying</i>. But, again, it is considerably less clear what is being described in the line, "If Napoleon if I told him if I told him if Napoleon." Whereas an Eliot or Pound text typically loses sense <i>between</i> descriptions, sense in Stein's portraits is lost, as it were, <i>within</i> descriptions, so that the aboutness of the quasi-sentences is never allowed to materialize. This presents a much different set of problems for the reader. Coming away from Pound and Eliot, we can recall vivid, if brief, scenes: the Browningesque speaker looking over Venetian canals, the German countess recalling her youth. It may be unclear how these scenes relate to others in the text, but in themselves the descriptions are more or less coherent, are intelligibly <i>about</i> something. But in the case of Stein, no intentional object emerges. There are no "images" for us to link "spatially."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
With conventional images and descriptions of scenes or characters not immediately available, many readers have accordingly sought other means of finding patterns in Stein's language. One strategy has been to locate what is sometimes referred to as Steinian "sound patterning." This is the strategy, for example, of Marjorie Perloff, one of Stein's most sympathetic readers, when she tries to link Stein's work to that of Wittgenstein. For Perloff, the patterns of sound in a phrase from <i>Tender Buttons</i> such as "Roast potatoes for"&#x02014;the repetition and inversion of "o-r," the assonance of the repeated "a"s and "o"s&#x02014;show how Stein breaks up our conventional syntax "not out of a refusal to 'make sense' or a predilection for pure nonsense, but because she wants to draw out specific semantic implications not normally present" in ordinary discourse about food. Thus in the sixteen-letter phrase "Roast potatoes for," Stein uses only seven 

<b></b>

phonemes, and the "simplicity" of this might be said to suggest the "simplicity" of the roast potatoes themselves, which, as Perloff points out, is "everybody's food." Stein's experiments, in other words, are not a means of being eccentric, but, more profoundly, "a way of testing the limits of language." Perloff does not discuss "If I Told Him," but if she did, she could similarly point to the music of the text's repeated groups of sounds and words, and probably identify "semantic implications" not otherwise self-evident. The chiasmatic structure of line one, the near-rhyme of "if I told him" and "Napoleon," the short round "o" of "would" and "told" and "Napoleon," the conclusive "d" echoing in "would" and "told": read in Perloff's resourceful way, these and other features might be said to evoke the geometrical idiom of Picasso's Cubist phase, with its interlocking planes pieced together into portraits of friends and lovers. If we think of Stein as taking part in what Perloff calls, following Wittgenstein, a "poetry game," then we could even say with her that the curious locutions of "If I Told Him" make "rather good sense."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
From one point of view, then, it does seem eminently possible to beat back nay-saying critics: if by "make sense" one means "exhibiting salient patterns rather than mere randomness," Stein's texts can indeed be said to fit the bill. Three important points need to be made here, however. The first is that, despite Perloff's remarks about the "semantic implications" of Stein's work, making sense of it by pointing to "music" in fact does little to add any particular semantic content to it. Perloff's description of the aural effects of "Roast potatoes for" are sharp&#x02014;the "o-r" is indeed repeated and inverted, and there is indeed assonance in the places she claims. But when a critic tries to move from this kind of observation to some more general claim about what such a pattern means, he or she begins to sound suspiciously like an astrologist interpreting the alignment of the stars. Why should the acoustics of "Roast potatoes for" evoke <i>the simplicity of roast potatoes, which is everybody's food</i> rather than anything else&#x02014;say, <i>the unhealthiness of a starch-heavy diet</i> or <i>the monotony of eighteenth-century Irish peasant life</i>? If we are appealing to associations rather than norms, then my preference for these and any other way of reading "Roast potato for" would be no more impermeable to doubt and criticism than my preference for chocolate ice cream over vanilla. Drawing a connection between the sounds of "Roast potatoes for" and the supposed universality of potato-eating strains credulity in large part because identifying what a text suggests is not the same as identifying what it means. To talk about sound patterning, in other words, is not in itself the same as identifying semantic patterning. Again, as with my references to ordinary and non-ordinary language, drawing distinctions between "meaning" and "suggestion" is not equivalent to making metaphysical appeals: "meaning" here can refer simply to our habitual, normative ways of ascribing content to marks and noises. But even when we demythologize meanings in this way, it is important to keep in mind how little semantic stability music and other sound patterns have in and of themselves. The uses of words are so regular that we can easily teach them to our children, laugh at puns, play crossword puzzles, and compile dictionaries. But it is hard to imagine how we could ever stabilize, to the same extent, the effects of a melody whistled in the shower or heard at the symphony. Such melodies may carry associations&#x02014;a piece 

<b></b>

may remind one of something from childhood or may be associated with a particular political regime&#x02014;but these associations in and of themselves are not inter-subjectively stable enough to act as norms on a par with linguistic ones. Pace critics who read all human artifacts as "texts," patterns such as those heard in music are content-poor in comparison to those of sentences. Once again we recall a remark by Kenneth Burke, himself both a music and a literary critic, who in a 1923 review of Stein's <i>Geography and Plays</i> remarked that Stein is blind to the very medium in which she works: "if the musician plays G-sharp he has prescribed no definitions; but if the literary man writes 'boy' he has already laid down certain demarcations."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Whatever Perloff might assert, "specific" is precisely what the effects of Stein's "sound patterning" is not. The fact that music is not sheer noise does not mean it is therefore a language.
</p>

<p>
The second problem with Perloff's description is the way this difficulty of determining the semantics of "Roast potatoes for" drastically weakens any connection between Stein and Wittgenstein. To emphasize the priority of music over conventional semantics in Stein, Perloff invokes a passage from the <i>Investigations</i> where Wittgenstein compares the phrases "Bring me sugar" and "Milk me sugar," and she rightly notes that the nonsense of the latter phrase, just as in Stein's texts, is not metaphysical but practical: it has been "withdrawn from circulation" for specific reasons, and can still manage (like the musician playing G-sharp) to have an "effect." But in discussing Wittgenstein's examples of nonsense&#x02014;examples that indeed seem to evoke Stein&#x02014;Perloff overlooks one of Wittgenstein's reasons for bringing them up in the first place: namely, to shed light on the various ways in which we often <i>are</i> able to make sense and discriminate semantic patterns, in the most everyday cases. Wittgenstein was indeed concerned to guard against "subliming" our logic and language, and was indeed anxious to point out the historical character of our sense-making practices. But he was just as concerned to emphasize the normative role that these practices continue to play for us, despite their not having any transhistorical metaphysical status. As I observed above, Stein tends to see her work as somehow a transcription of her actual "inner experience." The nonsense of her text is designed to be a truer picture of our "underlying" mental life than anything provided by well-formed sentences. It is supposed to form an alternative quasi-language, one based upon her own moment-to-moment trains of perception, association, and thought. Wittgenstein, however, spent much of his adult life questioning this idea of language as a veil covering our "immediate" mental life, against the deeply Cartesian idea that, in Stein's formulation, "Nobody can enter into anybody else's mind." For Wittgenstein, nonsense is not somehow "closer" to our "real" thought process. Indeed, given the difficulty we would have in placing the phrase "Roast potatoes for" within our inferentially related web of beliefs (what would <i>entail</i> that "Roast potatoes for"? what would <i>follow</i> from it?), it would probably not deserve to be called a "thought" at all. Wittgenstein would probably see Stein's words as a collection of private associations, the effects of various yet-to-be-determined (or simply unrecoverable) causes&#x02014;interesting perhaps to a clinical psychologist but certainly not anything like a language. All of which is to say that what interests Wittgenstein about nonsense is not the self-enclosed "games" we can play with it, but what it says about 

<b></b>

our ways of making sense elsewhere, about the shape of our linguistic life as a whole. His interest is less in "poetry games" per se than in the <i>Lebensform</i> made manifest through and within such phenomena.
</p>

<p>
And this leads us to my third and final point about critical discussions of things like "sound patterning." Recall the crucial assumption made above when I began to describe how, despite appearances, Stein's texts could be said to make sense. The crucial move that allowed us to start looking for the "sound patterning" of Stein's work was my assumption of rationality in the speaker, which in this case meant assuming that <i>Stein is not herself as childish as her work sometimes appears</i>.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  But how, we should ask, do we know this is true of Stein? After all, Gold is probably not the only one to have thought that her work resembles "the monotonous gibberings of paranoiacs in the private wards of asylums." To know that Gold was wrong, and to know that our own assumption of rationality is warranted, we can only do one thing: namely, appeal to Stein's biography and set her individual texts within the context of her intellectual development generally, a context that would include not only the author's individual psychology but also the culture in which she learned the linguistic norms against which her work so often reacted.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  To see Stein's texts against the background of Stein's biography hardly shows any original critical insight, of course. Indeed, however many journal articles have been written about Eliot's conversion or Woolf's sexuality or Pound's politics, critics probably find refuge in biography more habitually when discussing Stein than with any other prominent twentieth-century writer. The early studies with William James, the emigration to Paris, the glamorously bohemian friends, the relationship with Alice, the salon, the gregarious personality, the volunteer work in the war: these and other details are not merely the provenance of eager biographers, but are an indispensable component of all Steinian criticism. This is true even of Stein's most sensitive and devoted readers: Donald Sutherland, whose anecdotal explication of Stein's "continuous present" I noted above; Richard Bridgman, who says in the introduction to his classic study of Stein that the ground of her texts' allusions "lay in Gertrude Stein's head"; Wendy Steiner, who, much like Steven Meyer and others, describes Stein's portraits as a radicalization of James's psychology; William Gass, who admits when explicating the "etymological narrative" of <i>Tender Buttons</i> that knowledge of "Gertrude Stein's daily life and obsessive concerns is essential"; Richard Poirier, whose explication of Steinian puns is buttressed by extensive reference to her sexual life with Alice; Lisa Ruddick, who grafts the "drama" of Stein's "private emotional crises" onto the "drama of Stein's self-situation within twentieth-century thought"; and of course Perloff, whose descriptions of sound patterns in Stein is reinforced by quiet forays into biography whenever some detail (the identity of Ren&#x000E9; Crevel, Stein's dislike of Marinetti, etc.) seems relevant.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
This is by no means meant as a criticism of these critics. My point, rather, is merely to draw attention to what underlies this persistent critical strategy, what makes reference to Stein's biography&#x02014;not only in the case of other discussions, but in my own as well&#x02014;virtually unavoidable. In the terms I have been laying out here, the continual reference to Stein's biography among her readers is symptomatic of the priority of the 

<b></b>

personal level of description, the level on which our publicly observable norms are first determined, where we first learn how to ascribe beliefs and desires and meanings, and where we turn when seeking reasons in the explanation of behavior. For it is there, in our ordinary habits of sense-making, in our experience as language-users within a particular environment, that we locate the background of rational, intentional action against which non-normative deviations can be discerned. Alternative modes of making sense, whether through "spatial form" or "sound patterning," presuppose the norms of rationality that we learn initially at the public level, in the process of making sense of speakers and agents. Stein's work, I am suggesting, gives us so little obvious content and departs so drastically from our ordinary ways of making sense that, as long as we are unwilling to dismiss her altogether as idiotic (and dismissing her, we should always remember, is an option for which many intelligent readers have opted), we almost necessarily need to look for some supplementary resources.
</p>

<p>
Which, from the point of view I have been sketching here, should come as no surprise. When we encounter difficulties of the sort posed by Stein, the sense-making that comes so effortlessly and swiftly in everyday life abandons us, and we necessarily seek other means of rationalizing what we observe. Often this means seeking out other things that the person has said or done, other statements that would justify the strange physical or verbal actions. And indeed, it is no coincidence that the great flowering of experimental literature in the first half of the twentieth century was accompanied by a great flowering of aesthetic manifestos, documents which sought to clarify the point of what seemed to many readers quite pointless. Making sense of a text through other things a person has said and done, however, is only the initial step towards locating it within a wider domain of normatively recognized activity. This is not to say that recourse to certain biographical and cultural details will absolutely determine the content of Stein's texts. There is always a degree of indeterminacy when we try to correlate content-poor processes or artifacts to our other, more conventional, finer-grained descriptions of behavior. But the continual effort demanded of us in dealing with Stein is ultimately her great interest, and the reason she is so central to any account of modern literature. Her words are so in need of interpretation that we are eventually forced, as I have been here, to make explicit at least some of our ordinary strategies for making sense. Stein's obscurities put our ordinary practices&#x02014;our descriptions of the world, of each other&#x02014;into sharper relief than they are normally allowed. This is not a "scientific" process; there is little that is law-like in the kinds of sense-making activities that Stein's texts demand. But that is not to their detriment. In their cryptic way, Stein's texts do all that any literary text can: they force us to make <i>ourselves</i> explicit, to make explicit that indefinite, ever-shifting <i>Lebensform</i> of which, at most times and with most texts, we remain only dimly aware.

My claim that one must advert to biography to make sense of Stein's utterances needs to be qualified. One could also rationalize them by treating them as if they were spoken or written by oracles, prophets, or some other entity who characteristically speaks in riddles and enigmas. To do so, however, would be to endanger other firmly entrenched beliefs. In particular, it would not cohere with our belief that Stein is a human being; we would be treating her as something more than, or at least other than, a person. That this step is rarely taken by critics says something important about the moral framework in which we read Stein and live our lives.

<p class="noIndent">
When that Byronic gay blade of Bloomsbury Clive Bell proposed in his 1923 pamphlet <i>On British Freedom</i> that "Great Britain is one of the least free countries in the world," he had in mind not Britain's great political freedom, admired by all Europe, but the everyday personal, social, and public freedoms that ordinary Frenchmen take for granted.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  In France, Bell observed, art, literature, and theater flourish without a censor's interference; bars and restaurants may be open at all hours yet do sometimes close without a curfew; people pursue their amatory affairs without state supervision; and a working man can raise a point of Biblical textual criticism without fear of prosecution by the state. An "ordinary Englishman" enjoys none of these freedoms, Bell pointed out, and indeed "is, on the whole, less free than a Roman slave in the time of Hadrian" (<i>OBF</i>, 4). From the Puritan revolution to the 1737 Licensing Act that put the playwrights of Shakespeare's land into shackles through the nineteenth-century "reign of the Puritan middle-classes," the ordinary Englishman's everyday freedoms have been so far curtailed that such writers as Shaw and Wells, "when they sit down to work for humanity," must "wonder whether what they want to say will be sanctioned by some shop-keeping alderman, or illiterate fox-hunter, or by a committee of dyspeptic and time-worn virgins" (<i>OBF</i>, 13, 10).
</p>

<p>
Although Bloomsbury's significance as a modern movement is often dismissed on grounds of class privilege, Bell writes here on behalf of "ordinary" Englishmen. The English aristocracy after all suffered few practical restrictions on their personal and social freedoms, and Bell's Bloomsbury compeers had long 

<b></b>

ago seceded from the upper-middle-class milieu of their youth to what seemed, after Roger Fry's 1910 "Manet and the Post-Impressionists" exhibition, almost a faubourg of Paris, a province of France&#x02014;not exactly a bohemia but a safely upper-middle-class colony of artists and intellectuals who practiced privately the personal and social freedoms Bell advocates for ordinary Englishmen. What bends Bell's screed on freedom out of true is less class than gender, for his ordinary English subject is as masculine as his ordinary Frenchman&#x02014;and his (rather idealized) Roman slave, who "had never heard of <i>Magna Charta</i> or the <i>Bill of Rights</i>" yet, when at leisure, could (at least in theory) "read, or hear read, what he liked; no committee of old maids claimed the right to deprive him of the superb indecencies of Juvenal or the malicious indecencies of Petronius or the mellifluous indecencies of Ovid, or even of the latest . . . <i>simplicitas romana</i> (frank smut)" (<i>OBF</i>, 6, 5). Whereas Bell's Roman slave "might enjoy a play by Aristophanes," "can you fancy an unexpurgated . . . <i>Lysistrata</i> being given in Miss Horniman's house?" (<i>OBF</i>, 5). He "might eat and drink whatever he could pay for at whatever hour he chose; without let or hindrance . . . gratify his sexual tastes"; and bet on "a cock-t unmolested by the police"; but the "free Manchester wave-ruler is shot out of the bar at ten, haled before the magistrate if he winks at ('annoys') a wench on his way home, and fined if to console himself he indulges in a quiet game of put-and-take" (<i>OBF</i>, 5, 6).
</p>

<p>
Likewise, "our fortunate friend" the Frenchman can laugh on a Saturday evening at "some <i>Palais-Royal</i> farce of which the censor here would have made the shortest work"; then, over a drink in his local caf&#x000E9;, play cards, amuse himself with "a comic paper, full of pictures and anecdotes which in this land of the free would have led . . . to police intervention," read a novel by Balzac or Zola "the like of which no modern British author dares publish in his own free country"; or "regale himself all night long with as much female society, bad music, dancing even and sweet champagne, as his heart desires" (<i>OBF</i>, 6&#x02013;7). No "Norman rake-hell" but "the father of a family and a pillar of the State," Bell's ordinary Frenchman "would be astonished to learn that, were he resident on the other side of the Channel, in this one night he would have committed crimes enough to have cost the tax-payer a small fortune in policemen, courts and magistrates, and himself a quarter's salary in fines: the purveyors of his pleasures would, of course, have been ruined" (<i>OBF</i>, 7).
</p>

<p>
Surely Virginia Woolf applauded this salvo in the cause of freedom by that "sprightly journalist," her friend Clive?<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Didn't she herself have to navigate the wandering rocks of British censorship as both writer and publisher? Wasn't the Woolfs' fledgling Hogarth Press legally constrained from publishing <i>Ulysses</i> even had it possessed the resources to do so? Wouldn't Woolf later attend the <i>Well of Loneliness</i> obscenity trial, ready to testify to the book's right to exist?<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Yet her diaries and letters are all but silent about <i>On British Freedom</i>. Around May 1923, shortly before it appeared from Chatto and Windus, Woolf importuned Clive to send "your pamphlet" for Hogarth.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Evidently he did send a pre-publication copy, for on 29 May she wrote him that she had composed "the most brilliant charming, and flattering letter that I have ever written, or you received," but stuffed it in a rose catalogue by mistake; and recounts remarking to 

<b></b>

Leonard and Tom Eliot that Clive, unlike Raymond Mortimer and F. L. Lucas, is not "afraid to have an idea," so that "besides perking it with the best of them; something solid remains."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Might the fact that Bell so strongly marks the subject of the freedoms he advocates as masculine have anything to do with the vagueness of Woolf's praise for his "idea," his "something solid"? Put another way: how do her own life and work, and Vanessa Bell's, reflect on the "French" and "British" freedoms Clive describes, in themselves and in implicit dialogue with Clive's "solid" "idea"? In the Bloomsbury milieu, that London extension of Cambridge that young Vanessa and Virginia Stephen entered by way of their brother Thoby, these sister adventurers and revolutionaries actively forged their modern freedom in critical and creative dialogue with freedoms both "French" and "British." As they did so, early Bloomsbury emerged dialectically not just from the differences between French and British freedoms but from the gender differences within them. In this light, Bloomsbury seems no longer the English afterlife of modern French art in the wake of the 1910 post-impressionist exhibition, as it is often made to appear&#x02014;a late-blooming poor cousin of France, belatedly imitating such freedoms as fostered the tremendous explosion of creativity that made the country across the Channel the capital of modern art. Bloomsbury appears, rather, an experiment in vivo in the new freedoms modernity could afford not just to ordinary Frenchmen, ordinary Englishmen, and Parisian artists but to English women artists.
</p>

<p>
To take by the horns the matter of Bell's Frenchman who could gratify his sexual tastes without let or hindrance, let us consider Robert Scholes's article "In the Brothel of Modernism: Picasso and Joyce." For Scholes, Paris is the center of a modernism he characterizes as "a masculist activity that positioned women voyeuristically and turned would-be agents into patients to an astonishing extent"; "a gendered movement, driven by the anxieties and ambivalences of male artists and writers," that brought "the re of the prostitute to the center of the modernist stage" along with the artist himself.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Following T. J. Clarke, Charles Bernheimer, and others, Scholes observes that prostitution played an "extraordinary role . . . in the development as modernists of those two giants of the movement, Joyce and Picasso" ("IBM," 1:2). From Baudelaire, Manet, and Degas to Picasso and Joyce, the brothel as "subject matter" constituted modernism even as it "excluded women who were not . . . prostitutes" ("IBM," 3:5). Thus "if we . . . try to imagine one of Joyce's sisters becoming a modernist writer," Scholes writes, "we can readily see how a certain crucial experience of prostitutes and brothels was simply impossible for her, while it was almost inevitable for her brother" ("IBM," 3:5).<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  For this reason, he says, Virginia Woolf "never quite becomes a modernist" but "remains an impressionist or post-impressionist throughout her career"&#x02014;a judgment he frames as "purely descriptive" not "evaluative" ("IBM," 1:2).
</p>

<p>
Now, when Scholes highlights brothers' and sisters' different sexual experiences to prove Woolf's exclusion from modernism, he knocks over the very can of worms that his idea of modernism peels open. For when it comes to the brothels of modernism, the documents of early Bloomsbury unfold a different tale, no less arresting than Picasso's or Joyce's&#x02014;one that foregrounds the presumptive masculinity of Bell's 

<b></b>

exemplary free citizen, challenges Scholes's confidence in a modernism limited to the privileged male gaze, and casts a different light upon the popular image of a French provincial Bloomsbury.
</p>

<p>
In fact Fry's "Manet and the Post-Impressionists" exhibition offers a useful approach to the gender, class, and national contexts and limits of modernist artistic freedom, for it brought home&#x02014;and, in the controversy it provoked, brought to life&#x02014;such differences between French and British freedoms as Bell's pamphlet remarks. As everyone knows, the art that caused such a sensation in 1910 London was already history in Paris. Desmond MacCarthy, who accompanied Roger Fry to the continent in September 1910 to select art for the exhibition, wrote his wife Molly from France that he "enjoyed choosing the pictures (which will by the bye give you the most tremendous shocks)"; he predicted that the British public would raise "a howl of fury and derision" on encountering, say, Van Gogh's 1889 postman (<a href="#1"> 1</a>)&#x02014;"wonderfully hideous, alive, and as disconcerting as a face put suddenly three inches from one's own."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  As MacCarthy later put it, the pictures amounted to an artists' "imaginative declaration of rights": to be "independent of literal representation," "to handle nature with more imaginative freedom; and above all . . . to experiment" (<i>CH</i>, 111).
</p>

<p>
Yet the art on display was not uncensored. Expecting "a huge campaign of outraged British Philistinism," Fry took care to emphasize the modern French artists' embrace of primitivism&#x02014;their revolt against "the tempered realism of the last four hundred years"&#x02014;rather than their indifference to the British Public's moral sensibilities, the care of which Fry placed in MacCarthy's hands.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  "At these interviews with dealers I used to pose as M. le Publique," MacCarthy recounted, "and on one point my verdict was final: Was there, or was there not, anything in some nude which might create an outcry in London?" (<i>CH</i>, 108; cited in <i>EBIW</i>, 177). By this criterion Gauguin's 1892 <i>L'Esprit veille/Manao Tupapau&#x02014;The Spirit of the Dead Keeps Watch</i> (<a href="#2"> 2</a>) and Picasso's 1905 <i>Nude Girl with a Basket of Flowers</i> (<a href="#3"> 3</a>) passed muster before M. le Publique and were hung in the Grafton's Large Gallery.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Fry's effort to focus the spectators' attention on the artists' rejection of photographic realism succeeded to a considerable degree.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Even so, exhibition secretary MacCarthy remembered, "I kept overhearing such remarks as 'Pure pornography.' 'Admirably indecent.' Not a word of truth, of course. . . . As M. le Publique, I had been careful to exclude too frankly physiological nudes and, indeed at the last moment, instead of hanging two of the pictures, I told Roger they had better be kept, for a time, in my sanctum downstairs."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
That the British Public found much to deplore in the French paintings even after their censorship by M. le Publique casts a telling light not only on the gap between its sense of decency and Bloomsbury's but also on the gender and class of decency. The anti-imperialist aristocrat-poet-statesman Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, who (Lucy McDiarmid tells us) "had thirty-eight lovers in forty-eight years (1862&#x02013;1910) and would be considered a serious amorist by most standards," was shocked&#x02014;shocked&#x02014;by Fry's "pornographic show."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  The Duchess of Rutland, a talented if assiduously literal amateur draughtsman in her own right, confessed herself "very very much upset," indeed "so <i>horrified</i> at having my name associated with such an <i>awful</i> exhibition of horrors"

Virginia Stephen, on the other hand, remarked that she thought the pictures less good than books, "but why all the duchesses are insulted by the post-impressionists, a modest sample set of painters, innocent even of indecency, I cant conceive" (<i>LVW</i>, 1:440, 27 November 1910). Six years resident in Bloomsbury by 1910, the Stephen sisters had long since parted ways with philandering poet-statesmen and offended duchesses, not just in appreciation of modern French primitivism but in fine moral discrimination. When, some weeks later, Vanessa and Virginia fleshed out their aesthetic judgments by dressing as living Gauguins at the Chelsea Art Club ball for the Slade students' parody exhibition, "Septule and the Racinistes," the duchesses and their ilk were not amused.

Ninety-five years later, amused by Woolf's parody of Bloomsbury's affront to gossiping dowagers, we perhaps take for granted that the Bloomsbury group began when the Stephen siblings forsook irreproachable Kensington for that disreputable British Museum neighborhood after their father's death in 1904. But, with respect to the brothels of modernism, was it not the other way round? In this same memoir, "Old Bloomsbury," Woolf recalls the hypocrisy and repression of a specimen Kensington evening at the theater with George Duckworth and Countess Carnavon around 1900, in the course of which George kissed Lady Carnavon behind a pillar, bundled them all out onto the pavement when French actors made as if to copulate onstage, and, safe home at 22 Hyde Park Gate, burst into Virginia's room and flung himself on her bed&#x02014;having given her to understand, Quentin Bell informs us, that "Vanessa's unkindness" in refusing to accompany George on such evenings threatened to "drive him from home" to seek "consolation in the arms of whores. It was for Virginia to rescue him from this awful fate" ("OB," 181).<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Bell echoes Woolf's 1920 memoir, "22 Hyde Park Gate," in which she depicts her young self pondering the "dark and extremely lurid" intelligence "that the chaste, the immaculate George Duckworth would be forced into the arms of whores": "Needless to say he did not put it like that; and I could only conjure up in my virgin consciousness, dimly irradiated by having read the 'Symposium' with Miss Case, horrible visions of the vices to which young men were driven whose sisters did not make them happy at home."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In juxtaposing this Kensington sexual farce with the comparatively chaste Bloomsbury evening when the company celebrated their new free speech in pronouncing the word "semen" aloud for the first time, Woolf makes a deadly serious point. It was not in Bloomsbury but at 22 Hyde Park Gate that Vanessa and Virginia endured seven "Greek slave years," pressed into service to preserve their "incestuous brother" from "the arms of whores" ("OB," 195).<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  It was not a Bloomsbury denizen but one of the "old ladies of Kensington and Belgravia" who fled the French actors like nymphs from a satyr, whisking Virginia away with her; who took leave of her by saying "she did hope I wasn't tired, which meant, I felt, she hoped I wouldn't lose my virginity or something like that"; yet who "never knew that George Duckworth was not only father and mother, brother and sister to those poor Stephen girls; he was their lover also" ("HPG," 177; "OB," 181). It was her Bloomsbury companions who could occasion and receive Virginia's memoirs, not the Kensington ladies, who surely would have been scandalized to learn of Virginia's late evenings with George&#x02014;his "tap at the door," extinguishing of the light, and "cuddling and kissing and otherwise embracing me in order, as he told Dr Savage later, to comfort me for the fatal illness of my father, who was dying three or four storeys lower down of cancer"&#x02014;except that (like Clarissa Dalloway, who refuses to hear a word against Hugh Whitbread, accused of accosting Sally Seton in the smoking room) few, it seems, would have consented to hear a word against George ("OB," 182).<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In any case, just here in "Old Bloomsbury" Woolf observes that "46 Gordon Square could never have meant what it did had not 22 Hyde Park Gate preceded it" ("OB," 182). At 46 Gordon Square, Virginia Stephen had her first "room with a lock on the door," 

<b></b>

one that ensured the bodily autonomy and security that <i>A Room of One's Own</i> makes the first condition of a woman's freedom of mind.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  And it is her old room at 22 Hyde Park Gate&#x02014;a room with no lock on the door&#x02014;that she cannot force herself to reenter in memory as she struggles to write her late memoir of "the seven unhappy years" ("SP," 136). In short, it was in "respectable" Kensington that the motherless Stephen sisters found themselves immured in a house that in certain respects resembled a brothel, and in d&#x000E9;class&#x000E9; Bloomsbury that they first tasted autonomy and freedom, as modern young women and as artists aspiring to represent the modern world. If, for Scholes, the brothel served as a screen on which Picasso and Joyce projected anxieties about the commodification of their art, the documents of early Bloomsbury bring to light a quasi-brothel within "respectable" Kensington&#x02014;one that must surely have outraged the puritanical British Public had not actual censorship, internalized censorship, and a little-remarked public complicity impeded its public representation.
</p>

<p>
How then does the Stephen sisters' "Greek slave" experience in this hidden brothel&#x02014;its manifestations repressed or denied by "respectable" old ladies and disclosed only to such intimates as the Bloomsbury Memoir Club&#x02014;qualify Scholes's claim that modernism is inherently bound to the brothel, hence "masculist"? Modernist artists "were fascinated by prostitutes because they saw in them an image of themselves," Scholes writes. Thus, as Picasso's landmark 1907 <i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</i> evolves from sketch (<a href="#4"> 4</a>) to painting (<a href="#5"> 5</a>), the prostitute at left "absorbs" the male gaze "and turns it back upon us, the spectators, in the role of a client of sex or art" ("IBM," 2:10). Extending Scholes's reading of the way this demoiselle refracts the client's specifically male gaze, we further note the way the intense dark gaze of Picasso's self-portrait of 1907 (<a href="#6"> 6</a>) seems to migrate to the (at first eyeless, in the sketch) demoiselles. (Lest the idea of Picasso's demoiselle as self-portraiture seem farfetched, consider Barbara Bagenal's 1959 photograph of Clive Bell with Picasso in tart masquerade: corduroy trousers below, blonde wig and seductive mask above, his hands sculpting his jersey into pointy gunslinger breasts [<a href="#7"> 7</a>].) If the fierce gaze of Picasso's demoiselles compounds the prostitute's, the client's, and the artist's, the fierce gaze in the documents of early Bloomsbury is a woman's. Just as the mature Joyce conjures Dublin's Nighttown of 1904 through a temporally laminated remembering gaze that recovers and analyzes his early experience, Virginia Stephen Woolf's analytic gaze at the brothels of modernism spans time lived, recorded, represented, and remembered in diaries, letters, fiction, and memoirs. The analytic gazes of Joyce and Woolf, moreover, foreground what Scholes overlooks in limiting modernism to the male gaze: the modern sex/gender system that makes prostitution continuous with the bourgeois marriage system.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  In doing so they excavate the socioeconomic links between pornography (from Greek <i>porne</i>, harlot or female slave, thus: the writing about or drawing of whores) and sex slavery and open the question of their relation to modernism.
</p>

<p>
As daughters of Leslie and Julia Duckworth Stephen, the young Virginia and Vanessa were, of course, poised to be molded by that system or "social machine" into "respectable" married ladies&#x02014;and might have been had their mother Julia (d. 1895) and/or half-sister Stella Duckworth (d. 1897) lived ("SP," 153).<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  In that case, Woolf might

Making the case for a "masculist" modernism inextricable from the brothel, Scholes notes that Ovid's Cretan tale of Queen Pasipha&#x000EB; and King Minos is the common source of Picasso's minotaur and Joyce's modern Daedalus in these artists' mythic self-portraiture. In Picasso's 1935 etching <i>Minotauromachy</i> or minotaur battle (<a href="#9"> 9</a>), for example, the artist portrays himself as the minotaur, half-man, half-beast, the monstrous offspring of King Minos's wife Pasipha&#x000EB; and a bull, who was imprisoned in a labyrinth created by Daedalus and there each year devoured an Athenian tribute of seven maidens and seven boys until Theseus killed him. The minotaur, Kirk Varnedoe notes, entered Picasso's work in 1928 as "a hybrid monster of virile power and unbridled appetite"; this "cruel beast of ancient legend bore the body of a man, but his head, the seat of reason, had been displaced by that of a bull," so that he was "incapable of being civilized."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  In Picasso's etchings the minotaur is "sometimes a hearty <i>convive</i> at the studio revels," later "an ultimately tragic re" as the artist came

Miss Willett was reminded of the Hermes; but if you looked at him closely you noticed that one of his ears was pointed; and the other round; you also noticed that though he had the curls of a God and the ears of a faun he had unmistakably the eyes of a pig. So strange a compound can seldom have existed. And in the days I speak of, God, faun and pig were all in all alive, all in opposition, and in their conflicts producing the most astonishing eruptions.

Summoned from the rigors of Greek grammar to bare-armed, low-necked display on the upper-middle-class marriage market, the aspiring young artist who suffered George's "sullen look" "like a horse in a show ring" while feeling "condemned from more points of view than I could then analyse" looks back two decades later at this privileged male subject of the sex/gender system and renders Greek god, faun, and pig in cubist simultaneity. As Picasso imagined "the horned intruder" of his 1936 etching <i>Faun Unveiling a Sleeping Girl</i> (<a href="#2"> 12</a>) "wondering whether the girl 'loves him <i>because</i> he is a monster,'" Woolf's minotauromachy depicts George from the split and doubled vantages of two sacrificial virgins ("PSP," 153).

Meanwhile, "I"&#x02014;the memoirist&#x02014;qualifies Miss Willett's enraptured gaze by recalling the closer vantage of her youth, from which "you" (even "Miss Willett," presumably) could distinctly observe George's faun's ears and pig's eyes. As Picasso dreams a faun uncovering a sleeping girl who loves his very monstrosity, Woolf's ambivalent maidens unveil a monster, a spectacle compounded of god, faun and pig, alarmingly "alive" and (in a deft abstract stroke that leaves much to the imagination) "producing the most astonishing eruptions."

"Miss Willett" has most of her name in common with another of Virginia's early castoff selves, the fictional Victorian novelist "Miss Willatt," subject of the fictional review, "Memoirs of a Novelist" of 1909. As Joyce, from the safe distance of Rome,

projected in Gabriel Conroy a life and self that might have been his had he not flown Dublin's labyrinth, Virginia imprisons Miss Willatt in a psychic labyrinth from which Virginia herself is already devising an escape. Miss Willatt's life is marked by an excessive and reticent propriety, which her devoted biographer, Miss Linsett, does not pierce through but only reinforces. To the alert but disappointed reviewer, Miss Willatt's life and letters seem an elaborate tissue of evasion: Miss Willatt "thought it indecent to describe what she had seen, so that instead of a portrait of her brothers (and one had led a very queer life) or a memory of her father (for which we should have been grateful) she invented Arabian lovers and set them on the banks of the Orinoco . . . in an ideal community, for she enjoyed framing laws."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Her talent diverted from realism to escapist utopias, Miss Willatt dies with her "indecent" stories untold, her witness to her brother's extraordinary life unuttered: "Once she raised her left hand, 'upon which she wore her mother's wedding ring,' and let it fall again; they expected something more but . . . <i>they did nothing</i>, and half an hour later the counterpane was still."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Sifting the tedious remains of Miss Willatt's life and letters, which less document than displace "what she had seen," the fictional reviewer subtly probes the social repression that silences women's testimony, relegates it to the obscene. As the novelist Miss Willatt foreshadows the poet Miss Willett whose sentimental ode to George reposed in his (and Virginia's) mother's "writing drawer," "Memoirs of a Novelist" subtly challenges Bloomsbury's aspiring New-Woman novelist&#x02014;its author, Virginia Stephen&#x02014;to soar over the concealing walls of the private house into public speech.</p>

<p>
When her friend and former housemate John Maynard Keynes pronounced her 1920 sketch of George her "best thing" to date, Woolf scoffed at the idea that "George" was her "climax."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  But documents of her own minotauromachy&#x02014;resonant in the unspeakable life of Miss Willatt's brother&#x02014;lie scattered throughout her writings. In 1903, even as George was exerting himself to groom his half-sisters for the "show ring" and tame them to the genteel servility to which women of their class were destined, Virginia was posting comic vignettes of her half-brothers to her confidante Violet Dickinson, promising that "If ever I write a novel, those two shall go in large as life" (<i>LVW</i>, 1:101, 11? October). In 1911 she recounted to Vanessa that talking about "copulation" with her old Greek tutor, Janet Case, "led us to the revelation of all Georges malefactions." Case had already glimpsed them, for she used to express disgust "when he came in 

<b></b>

and began fondling me over my Greek"; still, "When I got to the bedroom scenes, she . . . gasped like a benevolent gudgeon" (<i>LVW</i>, 1:472, 25? July). In 1922 Virginia tells Vanessa that she confided "the story of George" to that "gigantic mass of purity" Elena Rathbone Richmond, wife of <i>TLS</i> editor Bruce Richmond, who traveled in George's social circles. Elena, who had "never liked him," was "shocked at first; but very soon reflected that much more goes on than one realises"&#x02014;perhaps, Woolf speculates, "alluding to her father and Miss L&#x000FC;lling."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Imagining that Elena would tell Bruce, who as a "perfect gentleman" would then have no choice but "to spit in Georges face in the Club," Virginia asks her sister, "Dont you think this is a noble work for our old age&#x02014;to let the light in upon the Duckworths&#x02014;and I daresay George will be driven to shoot himself one day when he's shooting rabbits" (<i>LVW</i>, 2:505, 20 February). That Elena's possible allusion to whatever went on between her father and Miss L&#x000FC;lling needed no gloss for Vanessa suggests both the sub rosa circulation of such knowledge and the force of social repression that anyone proposing "to let the light in" would face. Only "at first" was Elena shocked, and not for long, as if quickly assimilating George into a capacious social category already made familiar by occupants such as Lord Rathbone, whose social status it silently preserved. No wonder George, far from executing Woolf's fantasy of a remorseful suicide, could play the social machine "so assiduously that he emerged at the age of sixty with a Lady Margaret for wife . . . a knighthood . . . a sinecure . . . three sons, and a country house" ("SP," 153). Here Woolf's "noble work" of illuminating Kensington's darker precincts runs aground on the gender of free speech, both private and public.
</p>

<p>
Not every privileged "masculist" subject was as oblivious as George to the analytic gaze young Virginia trained on him. After their father died in February 1904, Vanessa, Virginia, Thoby, and Violet Dickinson toured Italy and stopped in Paris on their way home in early May; Virginia and Vanessa stayed on a few days after Thoby and Violet left for London. There they saw Thoby's Cambridge friend Clive Bell, whom they had met once before at a Trinity College Ball and who was sojourning there on a Trinity research grant.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Clive was an habitu&#x000E9; of the Montparnasse restaurant Chat Blanc where, in an upstairs lair "reserved for . . . artists, their friends, models and mistresses," he kept company with expatriate painters such as Gerald Kelly, J. W. Morrice, and the saturnine Irishman Roderick O'Conor, who had studied with Gauguin at Pont-Aven and in 1905 would exhibit work influenced by C&#x000E9;zanne at the Salon d'automne and the Salon des Ind&#x000E9;pendants.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  "Only once," wrote Clive, "did I see [O'Conor] impressed by a human being, and that was by . . . Virginia Stephen. . . . In 1904 she was very young and quite unknown, having published nothing: but O'Conor confessed after their first and, I think, only meeting&#x02014;'she put the fear of God into me.'"<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Just how Virginia incurred this distinction Clive, if he knew, does not divulge. But O'Conor's unwonted awe lends force to Clive's later declaration that, of all his wide acquaintance&#x02014;from John Maynard Keynes ("the cleverest man I ever met"), Lytton Strachey, T. S. Eliot, and Roger Fry to Auguste Rodin and Jean Cocteau&#x02014;the only two "from whom emanated simply and unmistakably a sense of genius" were Picasso and Woolf.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  He would have felt it, he says, had he never seen a Picasso or read a Woolf

novel. Meanwhile, writing from Paris in 1904, Virginia teased Violet Dickinson that she had found in her pocket an unposted letter that "should have been sending shocks and thrills through [Violet's] maiden bosom" and regales her with caricatures of their Parisian adventures. They took "the valiant old Heathen" Beatrice Thynne "to dine with Bell last night," she reports, "a real Bohemian party" where everyone smoked "half a dozen cigarettes a piece" and Thynne and Kelly engaged in impassioned argument about painting: "He actually shook his fist at her across the table, and at one moment I held her down&#x02014;a stormy scene." Beatrice "originally meant to stay 6 weeks with us," Virginia deadpans, but "left early this morning." The Stephens planned a "last expedition" to "Rodins studio"; and if, on their return, Violet could find her "a great solid bit of work to do" so that she could "forget my own stupidity," Virginia would be "so grateful. I <i>must</i> work," she adds; she would sell her brains "cheap at this moment" (<i>LVW</i>, 1:139&#x02013;40, 6? May 1904).
</p>

<p>
On 9 May 1904, Vanessa and Virginia returned from Paris to 22 Hyde Park Gate, "escorted by George Duckworth," who had come over the day before to fetch them (<i>VW</i>, 1:193). The very next day Virginia "suffered a severe mental breakdown," lending support to Scholes's observation that the brothels of modernism did much to turn would-be agents into patients (<i>LVW</i>, 1:141, editors' note). While Virginia lay ill&#x02014;at first attended by three nurses, later staying for almost three months with Violet, once flinging herself from a window (a low one, as if to say she wanted to live but could not see how)&#x02014;Vanessa dismantled 22 Hyde Park Gate and organized the move to 46 Gordon Square. In August and September Virginia was well enough to rejoin her family on holiday at the Manor House in Teversal, Nottinghamshire, with a nurse in attendance. Virginia did not travel to George's wedding to Lady Margaret Herbert on 10 September at Dulverton Hall in Devon but remained in Nottinghamshire, where Violet Dickinson came to stay with her. After the first night of wedding festivities, the stoic Vanessa, a bridesmaid, wrote her sister that "George embraced me and fondled me in front of the company&#x02014;but that was only to be expected."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  For Vanessa's biographer Frances Spalding and others, "The fact that this fondling occurred in front of polite society raises the question as to its precise nature. As Virginia is our chief source on this matter it is possible that her accounts of George's behaviour were exaggerated" (<i>VB</i>, 19). Although Spalding assumes that this company of earls, countesses, bishops, Eton housemasters and the like would not have countenanced improper fondling, Virginia's later accounts of talks with Janet Case and Elena Richmond suggest quite the opposite: the very great extent to which upper-class society was habituated to overlook improper behavior in one of their own, as long as that one was a man. Woolf later stages this phenomenon in fictional scenarios in the disagreement over Richard's kiss between Helen Ambrose (the Vanessa re) and Rachel Vinrace (the Virginia re) in <i>The Voyage Out</i> and in the Sally Seton/Hugh Whitbread affair in <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it is no coincidence, then, that hardly were George's nuptials concluded than Virginia's health dramatically improved. Only a week after the wedding she wrote Violet that her visit had "set us on our legs again," and praised her "beneficent powers" (<i>LVW</i>, 1:141&#x02013;2, 17 September 1904). A few days later she pronounced herself "a 

<b></b>

recovered bird. . . . It is the oddest feeling, as though a dead part of me were coming to life. I cant tell you how delightful it is. . . . All the voices I used to hear telling me to do all kinds of wild things have gone"&#x02014;voices she would translate into those urging Septimus Warren Smith to "kill yourself, for our sakes."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  She added, "I really think [Vanessa] is happy with me now" (<i>LVW</i>, 1:142&#x02013;3, 22? September). On 26 September, sixteen days after the wedding, she rejoiced, "Oh my Violet, if there were a God I should bless him for having delivered me safe and sound from the miseries of the last six months! You cant think what an exquisite joy every minute of my life is to me now, and my only prayer is that I may live to be 70" (<i>LVW</i>, 1:143). That autumn Virginia plunged into "solid" work at last, publishing her first pieces in the <i>Guardian</i>. In early 1905 Dr. Savage pronounced her well, and on 10 March&#x02014;six months to the day after the wedding&#x02014;her first <i>TLS</i> piece appeared.
</p>

<p>
The year 1904, then, marked a critical turning point in young Virginia's minotauromachy, a battle against that "sportive and demonstrative" God-faun-pig George that came close to doing her in ("HPG," 167). Here is Quentin Bell's take on it: The young Stephens' plan that Bloomsbury would be an "escape from the past and all its horrors," he writes, had "one fatal, one appalling drawback": "George, always affectionate and kind, could not bear the idea of leaving his sisters with nobody but Thoby and Adrian, who from a social point of view were worse than useless . . . go with them he ought and must." The dismayed Stephens "hardly knew how to oppose so much well-intentioned fraternal feeling," Bell continues, hence "were weak to the point of pusillanimity: for the long story of George's attentions had . . . been made so far public that he could surely have been called to account" (<i>VW</i>, 1:95&#x02013;6). How far was "so far"? From Woolf's remark in "Old Bloomsbury" that George, when confronted by Dr. Savage, excused his behavior as meant merely "to comfort me for the fatal illness of my father," Bell infers that George <i>was</i> called to account that summer: Vanessa, he speculates, told Dr. Savage, who "taxed George with his conduct" ("OB," 182; <i>VW</i>, 96 and n). But this interview, if it occurred, can scarcely be called <i>public</i>. In any case, no such rebuke as Dr. Savage may or may not have offered could deter George from his purpose: "Gone then were all their hopes of flying from the past: the past was coming to live with them" (<i>VW,</i> 1:96). If George announced his intention to live with his half-sisters in Bloomsbury on their return from Paris that May&#x02014;if nothing and no one could prevent him from making himself at home in 46 Gordon Square&#x02014;the suicidal madness into which twenty-one-year-old Virginia then fled might have seemed the only possible escape from the emotional labyrinth that threatened to entrap and destroy her. That she survived to create <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>&#x02014;which, "by the madness which interrupts it, . . . opens a void, a moment of silence," wherein "the world finds itself arraigned . . . and responsible before it for what it is"&#x02014;gives Woolf the stature of a Picasso and makes <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> a work to set beside Picasso's <i>Minotauromachy</i>.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
But in May 1904, when Virginia broke down after being escorted home from Paris by George, thirty-six-year-old George had for some time been trying to settle his own future. And if George had sex, age, wealth, and convention on his side in their minotauromachy, his eventual good fortune was also hers, for once he did so his solicitude for 

<b></b>

his sisters ebbed. When George was refused by Wilfrid Blunt's daughter Judith, Woolf recalled, "he sat at the head of the table sobbing loudly, but continuing to eat" ("HPG," 167). Next, Lady Flora Russell briefly accepted him, and an enthusiastic Virginia wired, "She is an angel," signing her family nickname "Goat"; that the telegram delivered read "'She is an aged Goat' . . . had something to do, George said, with Flora's reluctance to ally herself with the Stephen family" after all ("HPG," 167). Woolf hangs this comic anecdote on an error of transmission, and anyone who has worked with Woolf's elegant but elliptical handwriting knows the telegraph operator's predicament.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Still, since the assumption of conjugal duties by the elder fianc&#x000E9;e, or "aged Goat," would have relieved the hapless young Goat of her duty to preserve George from the arms of whores, we can't rule out a Freudian slip. No matter. Suddenly that summer, Bell writes, "like a Goddess from a Machine, came Lady Margaret Herbert. George proposed; she accepted . . . they were married. . . . The Bloomsbury m&#x000E9;nage was saved from disaster," and Virginia emerged from suicidal madness to embark on a new life, "full of experiments and reforms," at 46 Gordon Square (<i>VW</i>, 1:96; "OB," 185).
</p>

<p>
With their immediate experience of modernism's unacknowledged brothels behind them at last, Vanessa and Virginia embraced Bloomsbury's new freedoms by degrees. Years before she met Roger Fry, Vanessa had read Camille Mauclair's 1903 <i>The French Impressionists</i> and learned that "living painters might be as alive as the dead, and that there was something besides the lovely quality of old paint to be aimed at, something fundamental and permanent and as discoverable now as in any other age."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  At first it seemed to her that Charles Furse and the New English Art Club (NEAC) had "the secret of the art universe within their grasp, a secret one was not worthy to learn, especially if one was that terrible low creature, a female painter"; but by 1905 she decided, after viewing an NEAC exhibition, that Steer, Tonks and Furse had already done their best work, so that "one could take no interest in their development."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Although Vanessa had seen works by Van Gogh, C&#x000E9;zanne, and Degas before 1910, when the post-impressionist show opened she found in the French paintings "a sudden liberation &amp; encouragement to feel for oneself which were absolutely overwhelming . . . as if at last one might say things one had always felt instead of trying to say things that other people told one to feel. Freedom was given one to be oneself &amp; that to the young is the most exciting thing that can happen"&#x02014;as the evolution of her style from <i>Iceland Poppies</i> (<a href="#3"> 13</a>), exhibited at the NEAC in 1909, to <i>Nude with Poppies</i> of 1916 (<a href="#4"> 14</a>) suggests.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
As for private freedoms, both sisters "in effect entered the smoking-room and joined in the all-male chat."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Possibly Virginia's delicately sardonic 1906 review of <i>Euphrosyne</i> , a privately printed book of mostly insipid poems by Thoby's Cambridge friends&#x02014;among them a male speaker's lament of having earlier ruined a young woman he has encountered again by chance in a brothel&#x02014;owed something to the hyper-alertness to obscenity, hypocrisy, and indecency that her minotauromachy had thrust upon her.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Certainly 1906 marked a watershed between the sisters' thralldom to repressive Kensington hypocrisy and Bloomsbury freedom. "Margaret [Duckworth] sends a post card," Virginia wrote Violet, "to say 'I quite understand. Shant expect you 

<b></b>

at Devonshire House or Osterley or anywhere' is that a snub? I think so&#x02014;but we had to bring it upon us, and the sooner the better. And now we are free women! Any form of slavery is Degrading&#x02014;and the damage done to the mind is worse than that done to the body!!" (<i>LVW</i>, 1:228, 29 June).
</p>

<p>
A few days before Virginia issued this elated emancipation proclamation, she wrote her first extant short story. Unpublished and untitled by its author&#x02014;"Wed. June 20&#x02013;23rd. 1906." appears at the top of the first page&#x02014;it bears the title "Phyllis and Rosamond" assigned it by Quentin Bell.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Its [eponymous] characters&#x02014;two sisters of marriageable, indeed urgently marriageable, age&#x02014;follow a Kensington evening like those the Stephen sisters had by now forever escaped with a late-night visit to the beautiful Miss Tristram and her novelist sister, Sylvia, in a Bloomsbury square. This scenario doubles, mirrors, and contrasts the Stephen sisters' successive lives in two London neighborhoods as each pair of sisters regards the other across an almost unbridgeable social divide.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Phyllis and Rosamond are the women Vanessa and Virginia might have had to struggle even harder not to become had their parents and Stella lived, while the orphaned (a condition perhaps registered in their surname) Tristram sisters dwell in a freedom Phyllis and Rosamond only glimpse from their own position of "slavery."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Whereas these latter two cannot escape the marriage market&#x02014;portal to the only future either can imagine&#x02014;Miss Tristram and the autobiographical Sylvia (whose name, from Latin <i>silvanus</i>, makes her the first of many autobiographical artist-res associated with trees) inhabit a periphery of the socioeconomic sex/gender system.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  They have money enough for rooms of their own, discuss sex and marriage freely in mixed-sex conversation, can choose to marry or not, and meanwhile flourish unchaperoned in stimulating company.
</p>

<p>
Was this the story Virginia sent her friend Madge Vaughan, who replied that Virginia had "no heart&#x02014;at least in my writing"? "[R]eally I begin to get alarmed," Virginia mused, foreshadowing <i>Orlando</i>. "If marriage is necessary to one's style, I shall have to think about it. There is some truth in it, isn't there?&#x02014;but not the whole truth. And there is something indecent, to my virgin mind, in a maiden having that kind of heart. 'The air is full of it' says Madge: but I breathe something else" (<i>LVW</i>, 1:228, June? 1906). Far from Kensington's unacknowledged brothels, Virginia breathes freedom in a Bloomsbury home that "could never have meant what it did had not 22 Hyde Park Gate preceded it"&#x02014;and, rather than enter the socioeconomic marriage system, vivisects it ("OB," 182).
</p>

<p>
For Vanessa and Virginia, modern women artists who wrested control of their destiny from the marriage market, not only thought and speech but love and mating partook of a new freedom, floated on comfortable inheritances that were stretched by communal living and supplemented by paid work.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  At 46 Gordon Square the four Stephens were ontological if not economic and political equals: the leveling effects of siblinghood and birth order counterweighed their differential sex privilege.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Having disengaged themselves from George and Lady Margaret as well as other connections who expressed alarm at the intoxicating air the sisters now breathed, Vanessa and Virginia seized freedom each in her own way.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  The adorably bawdy Vanessa&#x02014;to

If Vanessa parlayed French bohemia into Bloomsbury's mixed-sex artists' milieu and French expressionism into an emancipatory modernism that, a century later, still eludes some cultural historians, Virginia Woolf's life and work are shaped by a different confluence of "French" personal, social, and public freedoms with "British" political freedoms.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  She married Leonard Woolf, a "penniless" but brilliantly gifted and Cambridge-educated "Jew"; had a passionate affair with Vita Sackville-West; and produced an oeuvre that stands with Picasso's and Joyce's in conceptual and analytic power, stylistic range, invention, and virtuosity, and sheer imaginative genius (<i>LVW</i>, 1:500, 4 June 1912). Whereas Vanessa brought the fruits of her private freedom to the public eye through painting, Virginia created literary masterworks even as she publicly claimed for women not only the private, personal, social, and expressive freedoms Clive associates with France but the collective political freedom he attributes to England. Thus in 1910, while enjoying the French paintings Fry and MacCarthy had brought to London, Virginia was also stuffing envelopes and attending suffrage meetings. Although Leonard, who revered Pericles's funeral oration on civilization's unwritten laws, sang Virginia's praises as "Aspasia" (after Pericles' learned and eloquent mistress), it was not lost on Virginia that Aspasia was neither Pericles' wife nor (like other Greek women) a citizen of his great democracy. When the name "Aspasia" surfaces briefly in the 1920&#x02013;1921 manuscript of <i>Jacob's Room</i>, Jacob Flanders is thinking of the London prostitute who sits on his knee as "did all good women in the days of the Greeks"&#x02014;her name "bestowed . . . by a painter who had wished it to signify that the flower of her maidenhood was still unplucked": Florinda, who, if she "had had a mind, . . . might have read" the contradictions of her position "with clearer eyes than we can."<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
By the time she wrote those words, Woolf was a modern Aspasia with a vote, a pen, and a press&#x02014;a genius on the order of Picasso whose portrayal of the "horribly brainless" Florinda pursues the "noble work" of letting light in on London's brothels in a way that refrains from driving the horribly brainless George to shoot himself.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  For Woolf as for Joyce and Picasso, the brothels of modernism are nothing so simple as an "aesthetic space" ("IBM," 1:1). Taken together, these artists make visible the socioeconomic link between the brothels of Dublin and Barcelona and the unacknowledged spaces of enslavement in "respectable" houses in Kensington and beyond. In doing so, they bring

to light a realist underworld that exceeds the bounded nighttowns Scholes imagines impenetrable to all but men and prostitutes. As for the young "Goat" conscripted into "Greek slavery" and a minotauromachy that almost vanquished her, Woolf survived to embrace freedom of body and mind, founded on a room of her own with a lock on the door and sustained by her inheritance, paid journalism, aunt's legacy, novels, and Press. Both the art she created out of her "French" personal, social, and public freedom and her eloquent calls for women to claim "British" political freedom resonate far beyond Bloomsbury's borders of time and space. From her first extant short story, "Phyllis and Rosamond [and the Tristram Sisters]," to <i>A Room of One's Own</i> and <i>Three Guineas</i>,

her work speaks ever more widely to women and men around the world. And if the gender of freedom is any less a problem in our day than when Woolf pondered it in her late essay "Professions for Women," that is in part because her work unchains modernism from sentimental voyeurism and trains an analytic gaze on the project of freedom that engendered many of modernism's experiments and reforms. Finally, what makes Woolf an author "at least as interesting as Joyce" ("IBM," 1:2)&#x02014;and a painter of modern life that no deep understanding of modernism, no real recognition of its analytic power and its emancipatory project, can ignore&#x02014;is not that she wrote from within modernism's brothels but that she survived her minotauromachy, wounded yet with her genius unscathed, to see with clear eyes far beyond them.

In her book <i>All the Colors of the Sun and the Night</i>, the Czech writer Lenka Reinerov&#x000E1; describes her fifteen-month incarceration, most of it in solitary confinement, in Prague's infamous Ruzyn&#x00115;  prison, from where she was released without any further explanation when Stalin died in 1953. To keep herself occupied, she would pull out single strands of her hair and knot them into delicate chains. The guard, watching her from outside through the peephole in the door, would only discern the movement of her hands. Whenever he entered to find out what she had been doing, she would drop her miniature chains to the floor and her frustrated observer would storm out as dumbfounded as before. Similarly, her stories seem to be knotted from fine, elusive threads of memories, pulled from her head and quickly rendered invisible to the reader who wants to probe deeper, beyond the threshold of uncharted pain. Later, she picks them up again to weave them into yet another story. Together, they yield an intricate patchwork of dreamlike, sometimes ghostly images and patterns that map the movements of memory across time and space.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
I first met the eighty-nine-year-old writer on 15 October 2003 at Amherst College, where she was reading from her book. Though the blazing colors of the sun-drenched mid-October day and the crisp harvest-moon night seemed a perfect reflection of all the colors suggested in the title, the author's tumultuous biography couldn't have been further removed from the autumnal tranquility of the small New England campus. Born in Prague in 1916, Reinerov&#x000E1; survived some of the nightmares mapped out in Franz Kafka's prescient scenarios. As a Jewish communist journalist, she was hunted first by the Gestapo, and 

<b></b>

after her return home from Mexican exile, by the newly empowered Stalinist regime in Czechoslovakia. Her family was wiped out by the Nazis while she was a political prisoner in Paris.
</p>

<p>
Reinerov&#x000E1; writes in German. Treasured today as the last Czech German-language writer, she concludes the legacy of Prague's distinguished German-language writers including Max Brod, Franz Werfel, Franz Carl Weiskopf, Egon Erwin Kisch (the "raging reporter"), and, most prominently, Franz Kafka. Most of them were Jewish; quite a few were communists; many were murdered and forgotten, among them her mentors, colleagues and lifelong friends.
</p>

<p>
As one of the last living <i>Zeitzeugen</i>&#x02014;an eloquent witness to the utopias and cataclysms that shaped the last century&#x02014;she has become a much sought-after public speaker, whose most recent engagements have taken her from the University of Dakar to Amherst and Mount Holyoke College to Luxemburg, Salzburg and Paris. There a French translation of <i>Journey to Swan Lake</i>, a collection of her stories, had just come out (it was followed by a Swedish publication). In between there have been countless readings and public appearances across Germany and, at long last, her books have also been translated into Czech. (Though she is bilingual, she doesn't translate her German originals into Czech.) The recent Czech and German publications of her latest work, <i>N&#x000E4;rrisches Prag </i>(Crazy Prague<i>) </i>were published back to back in Prague and Berlin.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> She has also been the subject of several documentaries. Her readings in Prague, where she has been declared an honorary citizen, are always packed. She is bemused by the turnout. Her publisher tells her, "They come to <i>you</i>, Lenka, not just for the book," she told me, shaking her head. "Why do you think that is?" I asked her. "My optimism," she replied dryly, adding after a beat, "it's pleasant." Reinerov&#x000E1; grew up bilingual in a comfortably lived-in middle-class neighborhood, Karolinenstadt, which is now the industrialized district of Karl&#x000ED;n. She was the middle child of three sisters in a family struggling to hold on to its <i>b&#x000FC;rgerliche</i> tradition through the economic crisis after World War I. Her west Bohemian mother's language was German, her father&#x02014;a native of Prague&#x02014;spoke Czech. She attended German schools, andfirst became attracted to communism at the age of sixteen, when she had to leave the prestigious <i>Stephansgymnasium</i> after the family's hardware store was forced out of business and she had to earn her own living. While working as a secretary for a paper company run by a classmate's father, she joined a communist-sponsored youth program that provided help to the children of impoverished peasants and unemployed workers. Through participating volunteers, many of them young artists and intellectuals, she quickly established contacts to the German-language circle of left-wing writers, which by then included the first refugees from Hitler's Germany.
</p>

<p>
At eighteen, Reinerov&#x000E1; was offered her first newspaper job by F. C. Weiskopf, the Prague-born German-language writer, translator of Czech poets, and editor of the communist <i>Arbeiter Illustrierte Zeitung</i> (Workers' Illustrated News), which had been transferred from Berlin to Prague. Weiskopf appears frequently in Reinerov&#x000E1;'s writing as a guiding spirit and life-long friend, despite their separate routes of emigration. During his exile in New York via Paris, Weiskopf was instrumental, together with the 

<b></b>

League of American Writers, in raising money and organizing exit and transfer visas for colleagues in Hitler-occupied countries. Reinerov&#x000E1; was on assignment in Rumania when the Germans occupied Czechoslovakia in 1939. Her mother and sister urged her not to return. She joined the Czech anti-Fascist/communist &#x000E9;migr&#x000E9; community in Paris. The loss of the family she left behind, particularly of her "little sister" Alice, threads through all her stories, not always visibly, but always present. In Paris, she shared a house with Czech artists and intellectuals. All of them were imprisoned when the Germans invaded Paris. After half a year in solitary confinement in the historic and now defunct prison La Petite Roquette (from where legendary glamour-spy Mata Hari had been led to her execution), Reinerov&#x000E1; was transferred to Rieucros, the largest internment camp for women in central France. With the help of Weiskopf and other Czech &#x000E9;migr&#x000E9;s she was released after a year to move on to Marseilles, where she waited among countless other refugees from Nazi occupied countries for the necessary papers and a ship that would have room for her. The French vessel she boarded discontinued its route in Casablanca a few days after British forces, concerned that Hitler might use the collaborating Vichy government for an attack on England, confiscated another French refugee ship. The passengers were brought to Oud Zem, a desolate desert camp, once occupied by the foreign legion. Reinerov&#x000E1; managed to slip out to Casablanca, where she was stranded for another half year. Alone, but excited nevertheless about the exotic adventure, she mastered hardships, including a bout of jaundice, with the energy and curiosity of the young woman she was. She finally made it to Mexico in 1941 on board the <i>Serpa Pinto</i> with some of the Jewish and communist refugees who would become part of the vibrant, though ideologically divided refugee community in Mexico City. Reunited with friends from Prague, among them the writers Anna Seghers, Bodo Uhse, Ludwig Renn and Egon Erwin Kisch, Reinerov&#x000E1; found work at the Czech Embassy in Exile and married Theodor Balk, a Yugoslavian physician turned journalist, who had participated in the Spanish Civil War as a doctor in the French Brigade, and who had subsequently been interned in La Vernet, the infamous French camp for men. The couple was active in the &#x000E9;migr&#x000E9; community, which organized German and Czech newspapers, started the important German-language publishing company El Libro Libre and produced German-language theatrical events with the exiled actors, novelists and journalists at the now legendary Heinrich Heine Club. They socialized with Frieda Kahlo, Diego Rivera and other Mexican artists who were supportive of the communists' t against Hitler.
</p>

<p>
In 1945 Balk and Reinerov&#x000E1;, pregnant with their only daughter, were among the first to leave Mexico for Belgrade, where his medical experience was much needed and where she worked for a Czech radio station.
</p>

<p>
They moved to Prague in 1948, the year the communists gained control of Czechoslovakia. At that time, during the reorganization of eastern Europe under the leadership of the Soviet Union, the deteriorating relationship between Stalin and Yugoslavia's radically independent socialist leader Josip Tito deeply divided communists across the region. Tito's secession threatened to undermine Stalin's global realpolitik, which was laying the ground for the infamous show trials of the 1950s. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
As a reporter, Reinerov&#x000E1; was eager to contribute to the realization of her unshaken vision of a truly socialist society in her country. Her husband continued as a physician. Still recovering from the first of several complicated cancer operations, she was one of the many targets of the anti-Semitic Stalinist purges from 1951 to 1953, which became known as the Sl&#x000E1;nsky affair. Rudolf Sl&#x000E1;nsky, one of the leading politicians in the communist takeover of Czechoslovakia in 1948, was among the eleven executed, along with Reinerov&#x000E1;'s friend and fellow Mexican &#x000E9;migr&#x000E9; Otto Katz, alias Andr&#x000E9; Simon. Many more were kept at Ruzyn&#x00115;  prison under phony charges of "Zionism," "Titoism," espionage, and other interactions with Western imperialists. Returned "Mexicans" were targeted as Trotzkyist conspirators, even if, like Reinerov&#x000E1;, they arrived in Mexico long after Trotzky's assassination by a Stalinist in Mexico City in 1940.
</p>

<p>
During her fifteen-month imprisonment from 1952 to 1953, her husband was demoted to a lab position. After her release from jail she was assigned to selling pottery and plants. When the political situation relaxed in the late 1950s, she became the editor-in-chief of the German-language magazine <i>Im Herzen Europas</i> (In the Heart of Europe), but was officially rehabilitated only in 1964. After the crushing of the Prague Spring by Soviet tanks, she was expelled from the Communist Party in 1969 and forbidden to write until 1989. To earn some money, she translated foreign texts under the name of a friend who accepted the assignments for her. The stories she had continued to write nevertheless, all based on her own experiences, were picked up in the early 1980s by the East German publisher Aufbau Verlag. Since the texts had evidently passed the censorship of another communist country, the Czech authorities couldn't argue that they were ideologically suspect. But it was not until Reinerov&#x000E1; was in her eighties that she became a widely recognized literary re.
</p>

<p>
To her audience at Amherst she pointed out the irony that she spoke to them in English, read in German from a book written in German by a Czech&#x02014;well, actually, an Austrian, given the year of her birth, a professor pointed out; "Austro-Hungarian to be exact" she corrected him. On her odyssey she had also learned to speak fluent French, which she had taught herself by reading the books that were available to her at Rieucros prison, as well as Spanish, which she had mastered in exile, and Serbian, which she had learned from her husband. Her perfectly idiomatic English is the result of frequent trips to London, where her daughter Anna and her Czech husband have been living since 1968. Their twenty-six-year old daughter, a Cambridge University graduate in cultural anthropology, worked as an Action Aid volunteer in Ghana.
</p>

<p>
The Amherst students were visibly awed by so much history contained in the petite, stunningly ageless woman, who told them at the start: "I am thinking, or rather, I am absolutely sure that even in the saddest moments of life, which are the black moments, one has to have the will to see a way out, a reason for being." Her darkest moments were in the 1950s, in Prague. "I had gone through all those difficulties, and some were rather bad, but that was during the war, and in war things happen that shouldn't happen and one knows it shouldn't be like that," she explained in a soft, evenly paced voice, "But to be home in Prague, after all what happened, after I lost all my family in the Holocaust, and now&#x02014;how should I say this&#x02014;by my own people&#x02014;that was really 

<b></b>

very, very bitter." Nevertheless, in the late 1950s, after leaving prison, she started to write "this little book." It became the first version of <i>All the Colors of the Sun and the Night</i>. She wrote it in Czech then, because these things happened at home, so "you have to talk about it in the family," she explained to the students, quite sternly all of a sudden, like a mother at the dinner table. In the preface to the recent, revised German version, she wrote:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
This time it took me a long time, not weeks or months, but many years, before I had worked myself through to the decision to open up once again one of the worst chapters of my life. . . . In the year immediately following World War II, people in martyred Europe needed hope, the promise of a future worth living for. That was when the movement for a lasting world peace almost became concrete. Picasso designed his famous dove for it (. . . .) It was cut short by the frost of the Cold War between opposing claims to power. In America it was in the form of a witch-hunt primarily against progressive artists in the name of one senator McCarthy, on our continent in the name of Stalin with his murderous trials of people who dared to object to the given regime. I too was caught in the amorphous wave of unfounded suspicion. 
<p class="blockquote">
	Pretty soon after it was over, I dealt with this experience, at the scene of the crime, as it were, in Czech; I wanted to put down in writing the inexcusable that had been committed, I wanted to expose this shame at home. A lot more had to happen before I could get to the point where I could tell about it beyond the borders of my own country. At the end of the 1950s and the beginning of the 1960s of what is now the past century, I wanted to denounce the unfathomable abomination, disturbed as I still was and caught up in what had been until then my ideology, I tried to prove to my persecutors, but also to myself that I was absolutely "innocent." But was I really? 
<p class="blockquote">
	Wasn't I also accountable, even if just for an infinitesimal fraction, of the unforgivable event? To be sure, outraged and uncomprehending, I could only refuse to acknowledge the absurd crimes they made up about me, their absolutely crazy accusations: too many human contacts, exile in the West, Jewish origins, Yugoslavian husband. They came from another world, which never even existed for me. 
<p class="blockquote">
	When I first worked on this subject which was finally accepted in its original version by a Czech publisher in 1968, during the so-called Prague Spring, I still believed that the promise of a just society, free of racist fury and delusions of Aryan supremacy, could be realized in a thoroughly renewed socialist order that would be enriched and energized by new discoveries. In the meantime, the frantically accelerating course of events has taught me a hard lesson. 
<p class="blockquote">
	For a long time&#x02014;all too long&#x02014;I thought I was serving a good cause which, despite all condemnable aberrations, was to secure the oppressed a place in the sun. Maybe that was because I always reacted instinctively rather than rationally. 
<p class="blockquote">
	The dictatorship of the proletariat, of those "wretched of the earth," seemed to me a justifiable demand. In the meantime I have learned that an absolute claim to power, which takes it upon itself&#x02014;regardless under what banner&#x02014;political, moral or religious&#x02014;to justify crimes, must not be tolerated. Accordingly, what I wrote five decades earlier doesn't hold up the way it was originally conceived, not even to myself. 
<p class="blockquote">
	If now, after so many diverse experiences, bitter disappointments and insights, both difficult and enriching, I let this material pass through my heart and head once again in an abbreviated but also quite expanded form, I do so because in the manifold accounts of the turbulent events in my life I cannot, nor do I want to, bypass those fateful years. Even in this context, I can talk not only about the worst, but also about the good in people and their actions."

The book is a distillation of memories introduced in her earlier works. Her interrogator's cynical questions trigger interior scenarios featuring the people she knew. Their imaginary company sustains Reinerov&#x000E1; throughout her ordeal. Their integrity and sacrifices do not fit the fabricated accusations of their persecutors that they are spies and traitors.
</p>

<p>
The human center of the story is the growing friendship with a temporary cellmate Dana, a young woman with whom she has very little in common, who might be a dissident. On meeting her, Reinerov&#x000E1; is surprised that "they even lock up your kind now." She was jailed, Dana says, because she worked for a magazine and was seen with an American journalist. As she has many more privileges than Reinerov&#x000E1;&#x02014;that's because she's been in there for much longer, she tells her&#x02014;it is possible she is an informer. But then, of course, from Dana's perspective, the same could be true of Reinerov&#x000E1;. As Reinerov&#x000E1; told me later, it was "Dana" who found her when they were both out of prison. She would have never known how to find "Dana." And "Dana" also got a job as a journalist right away, although she wasn't a journalist. As it turned out, Dana wasn't even her real name. It didn't matter. What mattered was the human community that begins with two people and could be imaginatively expanded.
</p>

<p>
Reinerov&#x000E1; read from her book with gentle dignity. Mourning, a constant presence in her life, has inscribed itself in the angular contours of her wide face and narrow body that evoke the women etched by the German expressionist artist K&#x000E4;the Kollwitz. The pain that's wrapped in the lyrical simplicity of her words, sealed with irony and carried by her measured voice, is delicate cargo, to be handled with care. It is counterbalanced by the focused ease with which it is dealt with, both in print and in performance.
</p>

<p>
One passage describes her friend, Jarmila, who ran a leftist bookstore with her husband before it was closed down by the Gestapo. Her husband was arrested and murdered. In her hallway were two coat pegs at a much lower height than those for adult clothing. One was for her son Pavel, the other for a little girl, the daughter of a Jewish communist journalist who had also been killed by the Gestapo. When the mother ran into problems, Jarmila took the child in. For a while there was a third low peg&#x02014;her three "souvenirs of the occupation." In May 1945 the people of Prague had risen up against the occupying Germans. The tenants of the building in which she lived had all managed&#x02014;some better than others&#x02014;to survive the occupation. In the tumult a neighbor came to Jarmila's door to tell her about their German neighbors who had been driven out. Jarmila asked about their child:
</p>

</p>

<p>
Reinerov&#x000E1; read quietly, tenderly, as if she still wanted to make sure no harm would come to her friend. The vignette poignantly illuminates a still festering sore in the relationship between Czechs and Germans, to do with the contested status of Sudeten 

<b></b>

Germans, the former Czechoslovakia's ethnic Germans (including Jews) who were expelled and expropriated by the communists after World War II. The so-called Benes decrees of 1945&#x02013;1947 made their expulsion and dispossession legally valid. As recently as 2003, the Czech parliament voted unanimously to permanently incorporate the decrees into Czech law. The issue continues to be the subject of heated debate in conjunction with the Czech Republic's recent admission to the European Union. Many Sudeten Germans were ruthless Nazis. Others were not. Should they also be compensated, according to European human rights laws, as requested most vociferously by Bavaria's conservatives and by J&#x000F6;rg Haider, the notorious leader of Austria's radical right? Historically, Czech Jews who had been forced to attend German schools during the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, but who had held on to their love for the German language, found themselves persecuted both by the Nazis and by Czech-speaking nationalists, both as Germans and as Jews. The problem was far too complex to delve into in a brief audience discussion. Instead, Reinerov&#x000E1; pointed out, "the story I just read to you about this woman who took in this little German girl&#x02014;those are the things that should be known. Of course innocent descendants should have the right to return. But don't forget," she added, "there were also those Sudeten Germans who sang: Lieber Hitler mach uns frei/von der Tschechoslowakei&#x02014;(approximately: Oh dear Hitler, free us, <i>ja</i> / from Czechoslovakia).
</p>

<p>
The students' questions came slowly, hesitatingly. How does one question someone who dared and survived a world that most of us in the room have never even come near? They gingerly navigated around questions pertaining to her experience of communism&#x02014;a term that had been rarely mentioned&#x02014;and their bearing on her perception of the post-communist world&#x02014;a term she doesn't like. "I am not <i>politisch</i>," she told a young Asian woman who had identified herself as a refugee, and who wanted to know whether Reinerov&#x000E1; was optimistic about the present political situation in the Czech republic. "I am a citizen. And as a citizen I have to be trusting." She said she was of course happy about the changes, but that they had come too quickly, like the separation from Slovakia. There are five million people in the Slovak Republic. "In a big city that would be just a part of that one city." She had very much liked the first post-communist president of Czechoslovakia, V&#x000E1;clav Havel, who hadn't wanted the separation either. Considering that Havel was a writer, and that the founder of Czechoslovakia after World War I, T. G. Mazaryk, was a professor of philosophy, she said there seems to be an intellectual trend in this little republic that she hopes will continue. As to V&#x000E1;clav Klaus, the current president: "He is not a philosopher. He is an economist. And I don't understand anything about economics." She drew a firm line as to what questions could be asked. Her face, open, vulnerable, with a young girl's impishly seductive smile, instantly locked into the deeply carved furrows of an ancient mask that guards the entrance to tribal territory. It was a reminder that this is a woman who withstood the brutal methods of Stalinist interrogators.
</p>

<br /><br />

<p class="noIndent">
Initially I became interested in Reinerov&#x000E1; because of the artists and intellectuals she knew and repeatedly introduced in her stories in vivid, intimate vignettes. Among them 

<b></b>

is the subject of my own research, the actress Helene Weigel, known around the world for her definitive performance as Bertolt Brecht's <i>Mother Courage</i> in East Berlin. But quickly I was drawn deeply into the writer's own odyssey and its reflection in her writing after 1945, particularly after her release from Ruzyn&#x00115;  prison. Remembering became a second odyssey through the maelstroms of unimaginable, unimagined political changes that keep shaking up the meaning of her biography. Revisiting the past is an ongoing reexamination of history and personal decisions in light of newly available information and insights. Her openness keeps her vulnerable and her work "unfinished." Close to ninety years old, she is still growing. Perhaps this is why she appeals also to younger generations and why her readers come to her; she speaks to them as one of them, in the present, not as an authority on the mastered past.
</p>

<p>
This is also why I have visited her in Prague several times over the past two years. She still lives in the same apartment that was assigned to her by the government a year or so after her release from jail. The atmosphere here in the old working-class district of Sm&#x000ED;chov, on a main thoroughfare leading out of Prague, is quite different from the splendidly restored medieval dreamscapes of the adjacent Little Town leading up to Hradshin castle. Only two metro stops away from the glamorously refurbished center of the city, the Soviet-style shopping mall dominates the gray urbanity of grumbling prewar fa&#x000E7;ades that line the streets fanning out from there. She has no emotional connection to the apartment, Reinerov&#x000E1; wrote somewhere. It contained no trace of her family history, no inherited furniture or family heirlooms, all of which were destroyed in the Holocaust. She has been living alone there since her husband's death in 1974. In the dim light of the narrow hallway, the re approaching me with outstretched arms, dressed in dark slacks and a pastel turtleneck, her face framed by a silvery bob tugged behind the ears, could be that of a young girl. All the light seems to come from her large iridescent eyes. A coffeepot, covered by a pot warmer, and a cake, are already prepared on the table in the small living room filled with plants and books and paintings by her friends. A book jacket with Frieda Kahlo's portrait stands out. "When I saw you at Amherst, you seemed so familiar, I felt I've known you for years," she tells me. I had told her that I was born and raised in Vienna. Both my grandparents, who were not Jewish, came from Czechoslovakia, not far from the villages Helene Weigel's Jewish parents came from. They followed the "textile trail" that led so many Moravians to Vienna. Weigel's father was an accountant in a textile firm. My father was a tailor. Weigel lost her family in the Holocaust. My family survived the war. My Czech relatives, who were farmers, and whom I did not meet until long after my parents' death, lost their land during communism. "You wore a pink blouse," Reinerov&#x000E1; remembered.
</p>

<p>
It is easy to love this remarkable woman, Lenka, and her stories. It is hard to ask the tough questions. Her presence alone is an affirmation of the human spirit in all its beauty, a warrant of its continuity. Who would want to break the spell? What language is there for us who came after? What she tells me she has already told in her stories. She is a lovely storyteller. When she recalls her first love-at-first-sight encounter with the famous actor/director Wolfgang Langhoff and their subsequent romance, she miraculously transforms into that nineteen-year-old girl. Her face still glowing as if it 

<b></b>

had just happened. The moment is also preserved&#x02014;fragile as a pressed flower between the many pages of other memories in an early book, <i>The Premiere</i>.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
She tells me about the performative power of the workers' parades on 1 May. She was so young then, she stresses repeatedly. She often talks about the powerful impact of the <i>Internationale</i>, "that odd feeling of being submerged in the song, when it surged through a huge crowd, when it was sung softly, barely a breath behind barbed wires," or in moments of danger (<i>AF</i>, 123).
</p>

<p>
There is a haunting moment in <i>All the Colors of the Sun and the Night</i>, when the narrator has been reading aloud to her cellmate from a sentimental propagandist book that is available in the prison library. It describes Stalin speaking to a spellbound crowd in Siberia, commemorating the victims of war. She has to pause, shaken by her sudden questions. "Why only Stalin? How about all the others? The soldiers in the hell of the front and my sister facing the Gestapo? And all those who let themselves be tortured and killed for the Soviet Union? Why only Stalin? They interrogate and torture me underneath his portrait?" She suddenly thinks she can hear the communist anthem. She isn't dreaming. It is the prison administration's 1952 anniversary celebration of the October Revolution:

It was not a delusion, nothing puzzling, only an absurd, crazy situation.

Remembering is a summoning of strength, a return to the youthful idealism and courage of her generation, from where to build the bridge to the future across the devastation of World War II.  
</p>

<p>
The first book she wrote after her return to Prague, <i>Grenze geschlossen </i>(Closed Borders), an account of her emigration, is an unequivocal confirmation of the spirit of the <i>Internationale</i>.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  One can still sense the immediacy of her recent homecoming filled with the hope of building a better world in the face of immeasurable losses in Hitler's death camps. Originally written in Czech for the new society she was ready to help develop, it is a passionate tribute to the solidarity among anti-Fascist comrades, most touchingly among the women at Rieucros. In one of those astounding twists that make Czech communist politics the perfect model for the Theater of the Absurd, the book was first published in Czechoslovakia in 1956, surprisingly soon after the author's release from Ruzyn&#x00115;  in 1953, but years before her official rehabilitation in 1964. The timing was fortuitous: 1956 was the year Nikita Khrushchev revealed the full horror of Stalin's crimes and Soviet tanks crushed the uprising in Hungary, while Czechs were still traumatized by the Stalinist show trials in Prague. Under the circumstances, the book was a useful affirmation of communism. Its publication in East Germany two years later served a similar purpose in the aftermath of the 1957 show trials in Berlin that resulted not in executions, but in harsh prison sentences, among them one for Reinerov&#x000E1;'s fellow Mexican exile, the publisher Walter Janka. But dialectically correct, 

<b></b>

the book can also be read as a wrenching reminder of the communist promise and its repeated betrayal.
</p>

<p>
Her imprisonment was a watershed experience. From then on, remembering reflects the conflicting experiences of communist ideals and reality. She goes all the way back to her childhood to trace the source of her beliefs in the wide-eyed innocence of ten-year-old Baborka, her stand-in in a loosely connected sequence of episodes titled <i>Ein f&#x000FC;r Allemal</i> (Once and for All). Written in the warmheartedly instructive tone that was popular in those early days of socialist society-building, they map the coming of age of Baborka and her earnest friends as humanitarian communists. They fall in love for the first time with the same romantic innocence with which they are willing to risk their lives for their convictions. Though Reinerov&#x000E1;'s tendency to wrap their emotional trials in the clich&#x000E9;s of 1950s magazine fictions is irritating at times, the stories might have been of use to her, at that point in her life, as readily available tools with which to handle for the first time some of her deepest, unspeakable pain. The deportation of Lenka's mother to Terez&#x000ED;n and her younger sister's death are introduced indirectly in an episode that honors the dignity of another person. A neighbor, a kindhearted simple woman, receives a card from Barborka's mother, who has been deported to Terez&#x000ED;n and wants to know how her youngest daughter is doing. The neighbor has heard rumors about the girls being "reds" and the Gestapo having caught up with the younger one, while the older one is living on her own. Though it is dangerous to have contact with the victims of the Gestapo, she writes back that the daughter is doing fine. From a young man who was close to the family she learns that the daughter has been murdered by the Nazis. The neighbor nevertheless keeps up the reassuring correspondence until her letters are returned unopened with the label: Addressee unknown. The measured pace of the narrative reflects the weightiness of the issues Reinerov&#x000E1; is tackling, while trying to muster the clarity, honesty and tenderness it takes to make them understood to the generation that was now the age she had been when she made her fateful choices. (That her own daughter was in her early teens at the time of the writing might have affected her approach.)
</p>

<p>
The book takes its assertive title from its first chapter, which ends with ten-year-old Barborka getting swept up in a mass demonstration of communists, a baptism by fire, of sorts, that confirms the child's innocent loyalty to the workers' cause once and for all. The title's defiant ring suggests the kind of magic formula that arms the child adventurer for grave tests of perseverance and loyalty. It challenges the mature woman to test it against her imprisonment by fellow Czech communists. When she wrote the first draft of <i>All the Colors of the Night and the Sun</i> she still needed to observe herself in a third person (unlike in the current version, published forty years later, which is told in the first person). Her prison experience is introduced as the waking nightmare of a character named Vera in a West German hotel in the early 1960s. Time and place suffice as clues to the woman's conflicted state of mind. It is at the height of the Cold War, only a few years after the Berlin Wall was built, shortly after the Cuban missile crisis, between the end of the Korean War and the intensification of the Vietnam conflict. But it is also the period leading up to the Prague Spring, a time of greater 

<b></b>

creative freedom and therefore renewed confidence in the communist project, which in turn encouraged more openly probing self-questioning, and which was soon to be crushed, as we know. The circumstances at the time of remembering are as important as the moments remembered, modified in the process of reflection. The act of writing at different points in time adds yet another layer of critical retrospection. Many of her stories, all of them autobiographical, remained unpublished for years, even decades; the historical context of their publication further confounds the meaning of her biography, which is so intricately linked to the political upheavals of nearly a century. Each subverts the dogmatized value system of the one before.
</p>

<p>
Also in the 1960s, strengthened perhaps by her first attempt to come to terms with her darkest moments in prison, Reinerov&#x000E1; prepared herself to face the murder of her younger sister. A friend had spotted her photograph in a memorial exhibition in Ravensbr&#x000FC;ck, the Nazi's largest concentration camp for women, whose inmates were primarily political prisoners. Nearly twenty years after the end of the war, Reinerov&#x000E1; undertakes the difficult journey to the camp, which she is surprised to find located at a shockingly idyllic lake. But it will be nearly another twenty years before the memory resurfaces by association, and she is able to put it into writing. Enjoying a perfect summer day at Lake Geneva, Reinerov&#x000E1; notices a pair of black swans, which conjure up the disturbing sight of white swans in the waters that hold the ashes of the women killed at Ravensbr&#x000FC;ck. "Excursion to Swan Lake," is a haunting memorial to her younger sister. Having passed through the ghostly rows of cells, in which the photographs of the victims are arranged by nationality, she finally reaches the Czechoslovakian section.

So the picture was here. It had to be here. I suddenly lowered my head and stared at the reddish brown floor. Naturally, I couldn't see it that way. I had to raise my eyes and look at the wall. . . .

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slender neck, the profile of a young woman. A snub nose, strong, curved eyebrows. Melancholic eyes, but they are smiling in this picture. Kerchief over the straight dark hair, tied casually behind the neck. My little sister " . . . participated in all political actions in the camp. In 1942 deported to Auschwitz, from where she did not return."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1942, when she was deported to Auschwitz, from where she did not return, she was not yet 21. But she had already gone through two years in which she had to start at every ringing of the door bell . . . What happened around her was so unfathomable, so inhuman, that she simply had to do something just to be able to breathe and be at peace with herself.

The historic moment captured in the book is 22 November 1964. The shocking news of President Kennedy's assassination reached Prague during the premiere of Jean Paul 

<b></b>

Sartre's <i>Les sequesters d'Altona</i>, which Reinerov&#x000E1; attended. Some of the thematic threads are at first as invisible as the chains of single strands of hair she knotted in her Prague jail cell. Sartre's play about a prominent Hamburg family, the prisoners of their suppressed guilt in World War II, was intended as a parable about the French's accountability in the Algerian war. It yielded an additional meaning to an audience emerging from Stalinism, locked in the stranglehold of the Cold War, to whom the boyish American president represented a glimmer of hope. Reinerov&#x000E1;'s questions have the ring of a swansong, to a utopia on the one side and a frail dream on the other. 
</p>

<p>
The book was published in East Germany in 1989, shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall. In hindsight, Lenka's hair-thin chain of interlocking links of fear and hope keeps reappearing in a new light, as delicate, resilient and intangible as ever.
</p>
<br />
<p class="noIndent">
"Did you hear what happened this morning?" Lenka asked me at the door when I visited her again. I hadn't; I don't understand Czech. It was the day of the suicide attack in a Moscow subway station (6 February 2004). Her granddaughter was on her way from London to Moscow to visit a friend who works at the Czech radio station there. "How can anyone do that? Can you understand that? What's going on in such a person? Someone gets dressed in the morning like all the other mornings. He thinks to himself, I should get going now, at 8 there will be many people, at 8 I'll also get the children." She pauses. Her voice has become very calm. "That way the suffering will continue. The parents, you know, they are left behind." The coffee was set up like the last time. "And in Israel, busses full of children." She looks at me. "In the name of God," I say. "What kind of God is that?" she asks, then adds, "I don't think that their religion is teaching them that." 
</p>

<p>
Usually she calls her daughter just once a week, on Sunday mornings. But tonight she will call. And probably also tomorrow evening. But she doesn't want to worry her daughter with too many calls. Her daughter is 57. She does many things. Maybe too many, Lenka frets. She teaches graphic design, but now she has decided to get another degree, in psychoanalysis. Lenka doesn't think much of psychoanalysis. "They have an answer for everything. Everything explains something. If I move my spoon from here to there now, it would tell them something about me. But there are not answers for everything."
</p>

<p>
Which brings me to my question. How did it happen, her separation from communism, from something she had dedicated her life to? "Well, they did lock me up." But she did not give up her belief. "That's all very complicated," Lenka says. In lieu of a direct answer she tells me that yesterday she had a visit from a woman, the daughter of one of the men executed in the Czech show trials while Lenka was in jail. The man had been one of Lenka's housemates in Paris and had been arrested with her then. His daughter was born in 1945, so she was just a little girl when it all happened. Her mother distanced herself completely from her father. "So the mother might have told her little daughter, 'Your father is guilty, you know.'&#x02014;That's something that doesn't go away. That stays with you. Even though he was rehabilitated [posthumously]. Can you imagine what that meant to this woman, carrying it with her through all the years?" 

<b></b>

There is nothing I can say. I search her face for clues to her own strength. I think of her "little sister," of her mother, of La Petite Roquette and Ravensbr&#x000FC;ck. I drove to Ravensbr&#x000FC;ck a week ago, I tell her. It was a bright, icy winter morning. The lake was frozen and like the deserted grounds blanketed with a thin layer of fresh snow. There were no footprints on the smooth white surface. The emaciated sculptures of the women at the entrance to the camp were the only human res around. Like the landscape of terror, they were frozen in mourning. "Are the cells still the way I described them?" Lenka wanted to know. They weren't. The displays were different, updated, contemporary in design. I couldn't find a picture of her sister. "It was seeing her actual photograph that was so shocking," Lenka says quietly and for a moment the light in her eyes flickers and dims.
</p>

<p>
On Sunday she will talk to a group of high school students from Munich, she remembers. Their teacher had arranged the visit. "She makes them go to Lidice [the village where the Nazis had massacred all men and deported the women and children to death camps in response to the assassination of the <i>Reichsprotector</i> of the Czech lands, Reinhard Heydrich] and Terez&#x000ED;n on one day, can you imagine!" She is irritated that this is the first thing the students will see in this country. They will resist it. They will be bored. The Holocaust has been drilled into them over and over again. The teacher didn't seem interested in Hradshin Castle, all she was going to show her students were sites of horror and crisis: The defenestration that initiated the Hussite wars, the memorial to Jan Palach, the student who burned himself to death on 16 January 1969, in protest against the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. And that will be their first impression of Prague. They will hate it. They are young. That's not the way to make them understand. They should first be engaged in something they will enjoy. We can't always dwell on the past. It's counterproductive, she insists.
</p>

<p>
It was not until 1995 that Reinerov&#x000E1; took the short trip from Prague to Terez&#x000ED;n for the first time after the war. It happened by chance, through a last minute invitation to serve as an interpreter at an international conference, as she recounts in her story "<i>Kein Mensch auf der Strasse</i>" (No One in the Street).<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Her father and several other members of her family perished in Terez&#x000ED;n, while her mother was transported from there to Auschwitz where she was murdered.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to Prague, bustling with the revved-up energy of post-communist consumerism, Theresienstadt remained a ghost town. The disoriented visitor finds the main road lined with bizarre sculptures of grinning dwarfs offered for sale. Outside of town the road is lined with prostitutes all the way to the German border. Despite the mayor's efforts to salvage the town from the curse of its history and restore it as a tourist attraction in the scenic Bohemian hills, the only thing that brings newcomers to the rapidly declining population is the local mental institution. That explains the only person the narrator has encountered outside, a man on a park bench drawing circles in the air. Earlier that day, in downtown Prague, she had noticed a man moving his arms in similar circular patterns. Did these patterns signal that Czechs, now severed from the Slovakian part of their formerly joint republic, still&#x02014;or once again&#x02014;perceived themselves as caught inside a closed circle?

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
While I was overwhelmed by her excruciatingly intimate evocation of Ravensbr&#x000FC;ck, Lenka suggested that her account of Terez&#x000ED;n might resonate more for contemporary readers, because "it's about life in the present." Maybe that's why her favorite story is <i>Mandelduft, Piratentuch und Gr&#x000FC;ne Ringe</i> (Scent of Almonds, A Pirate's Bandana and Green Rings), which has nothing to do with politics or history.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  It's a Checkhovian tale about the narrator's sojourn in the 1970s at a state-run health resort in Slovakia, and the motley assortment of locals she encounters there. On her trip home she shares a train compartment with an old peasant woman traveling with her goose to the amusement and dismay of her fellow travelers.
</p>

<p>
It has grown late and the strain of a long visit begins to show in Lenka's face. I want to return to those early days of social, political engagement that sustained her for so long. Is it possible today to communicate the idealistic activism of the early communists? Lenka bristles at the term "early communists." "That's already what's wrong with it. 'Early communists.'&#x02014;and you want me to tell you in a minute or two? This would take a long conversation." I agree. "These were people&#x02014;something was at stake here. There were Marx and Engels, after all, and they saw what was going on in their time and they said that has to change, and they laid out how that could be done. In their time," she emphasizes, "It's all very complicated."&#x02014;That's what I am trying to re out, I interject. "Well, then you will have to think about it!"&#x02014;"That's why I am talking to you," I insist. "You will have to rack your own brain about that!" she retorts. "Today, they instantly equate communism and Fascism," she adds as an exasperated afterthought on our way out. "Then, how do I talk about you and your contemporaries, if not as communists? We can't talk about communism without mentioning communism!" "It's a jinxed language," she concedes.
</p>

<br /><br />
<p class="noIndent">
I visited Lenka several times during the first half of 2004, which I spent in Berlin. I was investigating Helene Weigel's leadership of the legendary Berliner Ensemble from 1949 to 1971, in relationship to the founding and development of the Soviet-controlled German Democratic Republic. 2004 was the year that marked the fifteenth anniversary of the collapse of the Soviet empire and the remarkable events in its satellite states that set it off, beginning with throngs of East German vacationers pushing across the borders to Austria, followed by East Germans climbing into the yard of the West German embassy in Prague, and culminating in the fall of the Berlin Wall leading to the blitz-unification of Germany within a year. Fifteen years later the relationship between East Germans and West Germans had deteriorated into one between the conquered and their conquerors. Under the auspices of President Reagan, the self-proclaimed victor over the "Evil Empire," the West claimed all the credit for toppling communist regimes, which in fact had been accomplished by the people of eastern Europe. In Germany, with its divided history, victors and losers find themselves the unequal citizens of the same nation.
</p>

<p>
The motto for the peaceful rallies all across East Germany was "We are the people"; it is still inscribed in huge letters across the fa&#x000E7;ade of a building on Berlin's Alexanderplatz, where some of the most decisive rallies took place. "We were the people," 

<b></b>

today's sadly ironic variation, seems all that's left of the groundswell that eventually had swept across the wall. In the dizzying course of events that followed, now deftly managed by the western side, the people's biographies were left behind as debris in a receding tide. If they couldn't be unequivocally separated into victims and perpetrators, they were cleared away together with the wall, the useless industrial plants and the deteriorating Socialist housing projects. Past accomplishments, tied as they were to the vanquished ideological system, were better left unmentioned in the massive onslaught of capitalist reformation.
</p>

<p>
During the rapid reconstruction of East German cities, all reminders of their inhabitants' previous lives were quickly removed. It was not the toppling of the giant monuments of their past leaders that East Germans regretted; it was the sudden loss of all familiar landmarks, denying them any claim to their past. The disappearance of the corner deli, the neighborhood pub, the community center, together with the factories and jobs, left them strangers in their hometowns. If, in retrospect, the forty-year history of the German Democratic Republic seemed just a blink in the overall course of history, for the present it shut out the personal histories of several adult generations and left their children without officially sanctioned values or role models. Reunification turned into a (somewhat hostile) takeover, driven by West Germany's economic superiority, which equals political and cultural superiority, which translates into moral authority, at least in the eyes of West German burghers, disgruntled as they were about having to share their hard-earned privileges with their benighted communist brethren. West Germans sat in judgment over East Germans with a self-righteous frenzy, as if to compensate for their condemnation as Nazi criminals, while East Germans, claiming their communist founding fathers' heroic resistance against Hitler, managed to suppress their accountability.
</p>

<p>
In that climate Reinerov&#x000E1;'s gently probing self-examinations, the soft-voiced accounts of personal tragedies and survival written in Kafka's unsoiled German, as it were, touched a resonant chord in German readers. Here was a woman who stood by her belief in a humanist communism, and who had managed to preserve her personal integrity despite being cruelly betrayed by political realities.
</p>

<p>
The wounds of Stalinist brutalities were outweighed by the tender vignettes of the friends she introduces through a Chekhovian lens&#x02014;ordinary human beings responding to extraordinary challenges, rather than the Dostoyevskyan archetypes of obsessed anarchists or the sinister apparatchiks of Cold-War movies.
</p>

<p>
And finally there was her unshaken love of Prague, its fairy-tale cityscape unscathed by the ravages of war, though haunted by the ghosts of history, yielding a profound sense of place in a continuum of culture and community. It kept her anchored throughout her odyssey and runs as a life-sustaining leitmotif throughout her work. <i>At Home in Prague, Sometimes in Other Places; Dream Caf&#x000E9; of a Prague Woman; It Began in Melanthrichgasse</i> are some of the titles of her stories and anthologies. (Melanthrichgasse refers to the short narrow street in Prague's Old Town, where she rented her first room away from home in the attic of one of its medieval townhouses).

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
In the spring of 2004, Europe was preparing for the admission of ten new states to the European Union, including the Czech Republic. "So, on May 1 we'll become Europeans," Lenka commented. "I wonder what we were before."
</p>

<p>
When I saw Lenka later in May, her building was a mess of opened walls and dangling wires that had to be rewired according to the new EU standards. Workers who had come to count the number of electrical outlets in every room found only two in her small living room and her even smaller bedroom. She'd have to have three outlets in every room, they told her. But two had always been enough, she argued. These were the new requirements from the EU, they insisted. They found no outlets at all in her bathroom. In the old days it was considered dangerous to have them there, she remembered. Now she'll have two. Her daughter thought that was nice. Now they could all use their electric toothbrushes when they visited her.
</p>

<p>
So now her apartment had brand new electrical outlets, many more than she had needed in all the years she had lived there, "because Brussels said so," she quips, the way people used to say, "because Moscow said so."
</p>

<p>
It was the spring of Abu Ghraib and the first televised beheading of an American hostage by Islamist extremists. "How can the mother survive that . . . ?" Lenka asks almost in a whisper. "Earlier, many, many years ago, when something happened to someone, somehow I always thought of that person. Now I notice&#x02014;also with those suicide bombers in Israel&#x02014;I automatically think of the parents. If one kills the children, the suffering stays alive. When I heard of Nicolas Berg, I immediately thought of his mother. How can she survive that."
</p>

<p>
When I saw Lenka that May, it was just a few days before her eighty-eighth birthday. Perhaps this was why her thoughts kept returning to mothers, perhaps to her own, and to children, with her sisters murdered by the Nazis and herself far away when her mother perished in Auschwitz. Not unlike herself, her own daughter was out of the country and did not return when Soviet tanks sealed Czechoslovakia. Perhaps it was her forthcoming birthday that heightened her awareness of living alone.
</p>

<p>
Lenka spoke in a much more animated way about the present than she ever did about her extraordinary past. To her, it was a fate shared with millions. And she simply owes it to nature that she remained a "pathological optimist," as she puts it. "So then nature gets one into a rougher life for a while&#x02014;and as I am saying this, I am already denying it. No, of course, there were difficult things, too many, and too difficult, but now I am fine&#x02014;cross your fingers&#x02014;I had cancer, just a few years ago I had a heart attack&#x02014;but I am still functioning and that's good, isn't it, having had both."
</p>

<p>
In a review of Reinerov&#x000E1;'s writing, Peter Demetz, the Czech-born writer and Yale Professor Emeritus of German and Slavic Literatures, suggested that she now needed to choose between her attraction to a factual, critical prose, and the kind of "beautiful" writing that's been proven popular. As of yet, "[I]t's still completely undecided," Demetz concludes his review.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  I took it as the most remarkable compliment to fully expect a writer her age to further grow and develop. When I told Lenka, she said, only half jokingly: "Yes, I wonder what I will do after death."
</p>

<p>
For now, she keeps writing. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
In early spring 2005 she received an invitation to a reading in Bonn, scheduled for November that year. "And I accepted," she tells me with a chuckle: "I can't be responsible for what might happen before then."

In May 2005 I came to Prague for the presentation of her most recent book <i>N&#x000E4;rrisches Prag </i>(Crazy Prague) on the occasion of her eighty-ninth birthday, which took place in a comfortably bohemian (no pun intended) restaurant cum gallery, tellingly named "Beautiful Losses." An account of recent strolls through Prague, it is a wistful paean to the idiosyncrasies, and ultimately to the survival of her native city. The immediate reason for her excursions across town was the devastating flood in the summer of 2002. Hardest hit, but least noticed by the world (which was stunned by the destruction of invaluable historic treasures in the old part of Prague) was the economically depressed district of Karl&#x000ED;n, where Lenka was born. Again her tours become archeological digs in the landscapes of memory. They take her from collapsed buildings in her childhood neighborhood to the continuous renovations and commercial transformations of the historic buildings in the Old Town, flooded once again, but only by tourists; from the old Jewish district, where she is shocked to find marionettes of rabbis with grotesque stereotypical features for sale around the historic Jewish cemetery, to the large Jewish cemetery where Kafka is buried.
</p>

<p>
Lenka reads from the Czech translation of her book. Her listeners in the packed room are of all ages, from her contemporaries to quite a few young people, from a party of distinguished-looking advanced septuagenarians around one table evoking a Habsburg coffeehouse-scene, to a middle-aged woman in gypsy-style clothing and 1930s bob, holding court like a central European movie queen of that era, to the casual chic of a global set of art and literary managers and the universal garb of college students. The ten-year old boy at my table, a twin of Harry Potter, is the illustrator of the Czech edition.
</p>

<p>
With the German version of her book as my literary companion, I follow Lenka's steps through Prague to the "new" Jewish cemetery. Tall old trees arching over the long, wide rows of graves would create the atmosphere of a serene Elysian grove, were it not for the turned-over stones here and there, the disturbing signs of recent desecration. Many of the family names inscribed on the gravestones are as familiar in contemporary New York as they are in Vienna. They are the names of friends in either city. If they map the geography of an empire, its collapse, and the odysseys on the run from the most deadly <i>Reich</i>, they also point to survival and continuity. Like Lenka herself. Like the names on the graves and the refurbished fa&#x000E7;ades of historic sites, her narratives mark the processes of change without explaining them. If her presence embodies living history, it also offers possibilities for forgiveness and reconciliation&#x02014;which is what she is working on in her writing. No small gift to her contemporary audiences. The fact that she keeps at it might be an indication both of the enormous difficulty of her project, and of her "pathological" optimism.
</p>

<p>
Sitting on a bench facing Kafka's grave, I notice a little Beckettian tree growing right on top of it. The ghosts of Beckett's clowns waiting on Kafka's grave. Crazy Prague indeed.

<p class="noIndent">
The morning was beautiful. Beautiful as if it wanted to herald one of those days that continue to resonate in us for a long time like the chiming of bells. A nearly Italian-blue sky arched over the bridges, and the water in the River Vltava glistened gaily as if it were still flowing through meadows instead of through a metropolis with all its garbage, foul smells, and loud noises.
</p>

<p>
A morning like this is quite exhilarating. I had to "go into the city" as we say in Prague, when we are heading downtown, but otherwise I had an almost free day ahead of me. In the evening I had an interpreting assignment, but since I was very familiar with the subject matter, there wasn't much to prepare. Disturbing and painful as that particular job would be, I tried to keep it off my mind on this bright morning.
</p>

<p>
The trolley I boarded was covered with pictures of lilies of the valley promoting the pleasures of a breath-refreshing chewing gum. Usually, I get annoyed by that sort of transformation of public transportation into advertisement vehicles. I don't appreciate having to squeeze myself through a packed car while its exterior walls feature the slim, freely bopping legs of young women advertising pantyhose, or, worse, having to get into a car picturing desert sand with a camel&#x02014;what else&#x02014;promoting Camel cigarettes. This time I could simply overlook such nonsense.
</p>

<p>
The center of the city presented the usual picture or rather, what has become in recent years the usual picture, albeit always filled with surprises&#x02014;such as a citizen of Prague discovering a new bank where she used to get fish; or the latest models of Jaguars displayed behind the windows of what once was a bakery; 

<b></b>

or instead of the delicious aroma of assorted open sandwiches that wafted from the shelves until quite recently, the blaring sounds of rock music underscoring the display of T-shirts decorated with all sorts of fancy emblems, from the USA, Singapore and China. <i>Tempora mutantur</i>.
</p>

<p>
But none of that could faze me on that particular morning. The moment I woke up I made up my mind to spend the day as carefree as possible, gathering energy for the difficult evening hours. Affectionately I looked at the old buildings, as more and more of them were showing off their make-over. There are now fa&#x000E7;ades in cheerful shades of green, rose, and yellow with bright red roofs smiling at us while stuccos and graceful decorations constantly emerge from the dark gray soot of decades. And above it all shone the Italian-blue sky.
</p>

<p>
On &#x0017D;elezn&#x000E1; [Iron Street], which leads from the Karolinum to Old Town Square, I noticed an older man with his arms dangling in an odd way; he stopped every few steps, turned his sad face from side to side and with trembling hands drew invisible circles in the air while mumbling soundlessly. What was he looking for? Was he looking for someone? His shaky gait and jittery movements suggested a mentally disturbed person. Some people turned to look after him, shaking their heads. A boisterous little boy tried mimicking the man's gait, which earned him a couple of annoyed nudges from his mother. Somehow the poor madman didn't fit into the cheerful street scene.
</p>

<p>
I stopped and also turned to look after him. Had nature wrought havoc with this man or had his fellow human beings treated him so badly that for the rest of his life he would find it necessary to defend himself against invisible threats?
</p>

<p>
Nonsense! The difficult evening hours I anticipated seemed to cast their shadows and force such ideas into my head. The poor man was obviously sick, that was all.
</p>

<p>
A huge crowd had gathered in front of the Old Town Hall on the big square at the lower end of &#x0017D;elezn&#x000E1; waiting for the hourly attraction when the two little windows above the old clock would open and the twelve apostles would pass by, followed by the miser shaking his sack of money, and death wiggling its pale skull. Then the cock would crow above the dial with the nearly indecipherable astronomical signs, and the whole apparition would be gone for another hour.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, I had lost track of the madman.
</p>

<p>
"Adam and Eve"&#x02014;the two towers of Tyn Church, the pointed roof of the house "At the Stone Bell," the elegant Kinsky Palace seemed to be carved into the sky. Even though&#x02014;or maybe because&#x02014;I have been living in Prague&#x02014;albeit with some voluntary as well as involuntary interruptions&#x02014;since my very first scream, I can't get enough of its dreamy, somewhat melancholy and at the same time comforting familiar beauty. And on such a morning to boot!
</p>

<p>
At the corner of Dlouh&#x000E1; [Long Street] at the right lower end of the Old Town Square a young gypsy woman held up her begging hand towards me. She was wearing a flower-print skirt (with large flower print), a red and green scarf around her head, and carried a sleeping child in her arms. A Madonna of the streets? No way! I had met this woman at other corners around town, with different children in her arms, wearing different skirts. As one tried to pass her, she offered to tell the future in a unique 

<b></b>

mix of Czech and German. On that morning in the square bustling with tourists, she looked like a cleverly staged re.
</p>

<p>
Maybe it was the gypsy baby or, in any case, the particular corner of Dlouh&#x000E1;, that suddenly triggered a childhood memory. Before World War II a Jewish welfare organization was located down the street. Named the Israelite Confraternity, it supported the needy members of its faith and organized cultural events to raise money for its charitable activities. My parents were members of the confraternity.
</p>

<p>
For some occasion which I can't remember&#x02014;it was probably a Jewish holiday&#x02014;they produced a children's play in which I played a part. This was quite unusual, because my parents usually restricted their participation to paying their membership fees without getting involved in any organized activities. More than anything, they didn't want to be different from the other tenants in our building and from the people in our street. My mother especially was afraid to stand out among her fellow citizens in the district of Karl&#x000ED;n. To her mind it was enough that she came from the German speaking town of Saaz [now &#x0017D;atec] in western Bohemia while my father hailed from the Czech part of Prague. That alone attracted attention. She was afraid that emphasizing their Jewish origins would harm their business and, above all, burden the children.
</p>

<p>
How futile her motherly considerations would turn out to be later!
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, as mentioned already, I did participate in one theatrical event. It was a fairy tale by Wilhelm Hauff, titled <i>Caliph Stork</i>. I must have been eight or nine years old. Today I barely remember what the play was about. But I have not forgotten that I played a stork and that they dressed me in orange stockings and short white pants, and put paper wings, a long papier m&#x000E2;ch&#x000E9; neck and a long red papier m&#x000E2;ch&#x000E9; beak over my head. In those days, people advertising various products used to run around the streets stuck inside such box-like costumes. (Trolleys back then were painted in red and yellow, the colors of Prague; they were not permitted to display advertisements by anyone, of anything.)
</p>

<p>
My papier m&#x000E2;ch&#x000E9; costume was quite heavy and rather tight with only two small round openings in the neck through which I could peek out. They put a string in one of my hands, which made my long red beak clack whenever I pulled on it. I thought that was neat, much better than the few words I had to squeak through my papier m&#x000E2;ch&#x000E9; neck.
</p>

<p>
"Good day, Dame Longlegs. I have to dance for my father's guests tonight and would like to practice a little right here." Well, try practicing a dance with a heavy papier m&#x000E2;ch&#x000E9; neck on your shoulders!
</p>

<p>
As I said before, I barely remember the fairy tale. I only know that I had a partner, Dame Longlegs. On that beautiful morning I suddenly remembered the magic word that could turn the jinxed caliph and his vizier back into their human shape: <i>Mutabor</i>.
</p>

<p>
I have no idea why the Jewish Confraternity chose to present an Arab fairy tale, of all things. Maybe there was nothing remarkable about it at that time, many years before the founding of the state of Israel. But the sudden memory of it on that early summer day in 1995, in light of the reprehensible events that had occurred in the meantime in and concerning Israel, felt like a warm breeze, a greeting from a distant, supposedly more innocent time. <i>Mutabor</i>.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The man with the swaying movements and the restlessly circulating hand had caught up with me in the meantime and like me, turned his searching gaze towards Dlouh&#x000E1;. I looked at him more closely now. Could it be that I . . . Many years after my clacking beak debut I used to come daily through this street, where my office at the monthly magazine <i>In the Heart of Europe</i> was located. But I certainly had never seen this man before.
</p>

<p>
The house, Dlouh&#x000E1; # 12, was built in the thirteenth century. Orbis Publications had it renovated for a large amount of money. Originally, it was supposed to have been a beer hall or an inn. The gothic vaults in the basement support this assumption.
</p>

<p>
On an August morning in 1968, also under a clear blue sky no one took notice of then, I wasn't squiggling through throngs of curious tourists across the Old Town Square; rather I squeezed between the tanks and other military equipment of uninvited Soviet invaders, in a state of horror, outrage and profound agitation. Wasn't it enough that years ago German fascists had occupied my Prague, did we have to be occupied again, for a change, this time by Soviet Communists? Some heavy artillery had been positioned in Dlouh&#x000E1; under the windows of the editorial offices. We worked hard to ignore this metal giant and did our best under the new dictatorship to keep up our public work (sometimes not so publicly). On the third or fourth day after the invasion a colleague burst into my tiny office, laughing and screaming: "Look out there, quickly!" I ran to the window.
</p>

<p>
Apparently, "our" occupying soldiers were having their laundry day. Underpants, socks, three shirts, full of holes, were dangling from the barrel of the gun. The sky was blue; I wished for rain.
</p>

<p>
That's what happens, or rather, that's what happens to me when I am running through Prague and an Italian-blue sky not only lightens up the gilded crosses atop the church spires and the freshly painted stuccos on the old walls of historic buildings, but also shines through memories&#x02014;of things that happened recently or long ago, of matters closed and wide open, through what one had done and what had been done to oneself.
</p>

<p>
Enough. I turned my back to Dlouh&#x000E1; saturated as it was with memories.
</p>

<p>
What time is it? When would I have to be on my way to get to my interpreter's booth on time? Why was my heart pounding already?
</p>

<p>
I had accepted an assignment scheduled for that day to interpret during a German-Czech colloquium in northern Bohemia. In the rush of preparations the organizers almost forgot that not all participants in this international dialogue would speak both languages. I was asked at the last minute. It wasn't linguistic matters that would be demanding; I was vaguely afraid of the place itself and of what I would hear. It was a place where I needed someone at my side. Therefore I was glad that D., an excellent interpreter and my good friend for many years, had agreed to work and get through the evening with me.
</p>

<p>
We had to go to Theresienstadt. A taxi was to get us there. It picked us up on time in the afternoon. When we left Prague the sky was still Italian-blue. I wanted to enjoy the drive through the early summer landscape and tried to suppress the thought of where we were headed. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Soon we had left the city behind us. Meadows, tilled fields, a small forest. Villages with red tiled roofs, everything very friendly, matching my inner picture of lovely Bohemia. Early summer roses were blooming in the gardens, here and there shrubs of late lilacs. Only the many "Rooms Available" signs on the fences or next to the front doors flooding the landscape didn't quite fit into the rural idyll, they were&#x02014;as far as one could see from a passing car&#x02014;the most noticeable indication of the new era.
</p>

<p>
Spreading in the distance were the rounded bluish silhouettes of central Bohemia's long extinct and overgrown volcanoes. From the top of one of them, the legendary Mount Rip, &#x0010C;ech the founding father is said to have awarded his tribe this land with its fertile soil, its abundance of game in the forest and bounty of fish in rivers and creeks.
</p>

<p>
God knows why I suddenly had to think of the poor madman with the searching eyes in Prague's Old Town. And of the young gypsy woman with the infant in her arms. Can those two feel like I do about Bohemia as their lovely homeland.
</p>

<p>
"Don't think about it now," D. suddenly said. She must have taken my contemplative gaze for nervousness about the evening event. "We'll be hearing enough of it tonight."
</p>

<p>
"That's for sure," I replied, unable to suppress a sigh, "From Eichmann's trains to Theresienstadt the area must have looked quite different. And 'available rooms' wouldn't have been offered, but simply taken over."
</p>

<p>
How absurd, really, taking a taxi to Theresienstadt. The same route as the trains crammed with Jews being deported to the ghetto, and with prisoners transported to the Little Fortress.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the driver slammed on his brakes. He had nearly hit a little boy who was running across the street without looking.
</p>

<p>
"They go crazy when they see that stuff there," the driver grumbled.
</p>

<p>
Pretty shaken, I looked in the direction the boy was headed and at that moment I thought that now it was me who was about to go a little crazy.
</p>

<p>
A regiment of dwarfs was lined up at the side of the road. When and from where did they march in? They stood there motionlessly, with permanently frozen grins on their stupidly friendly faces, threatening only because there were so many of them. White plaster dwarfs on thin little legs with beardless, chubby cheeks and glaring little eyes, they were positioned according to their size from tiny to wildly oversized. Standing spellbound in front of them was the little boy who just a moment ago had been saved from being run over only by our driver's presence of mind. A young man with black curls wearing a T-shirt with grotesque designs was lolling about behind the parade of dwarfs.
</p>

<p>
"I must be dreaming," I exclaimed, "I've never seen those before!"
</p>

<p>
"You'll be seeing plenty more," the driver remarked dryly.
</p>

<p>
Sure enough&#x02014;we were already zooming by the next booth. Here the dwarfs were quite colorful in blue, green or purple jackets and red caps, surrounded by ceramic piglets of various sizes. They would bring good luck, promised a sloppily written sign in glaring colors. Good luck here and in such company?

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
I wondered whether "Dwarf Nose," the character of another Hauff fairy tale with a bad spell and a happy ending, was among those more recent creations. On this route towards a destination where a few years ago thousands of children were not freed from a spell, where the worst ending was in store for them instead.
</p>

<p>
"Could we go a bit slower?" I asked, so I could get a better look at this peaceful but awful invasion.
</p>

<p>
The driver laughed. "You're really seeing those for the first time?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes. And I can't fathom who'd buy such things."
</p>

<p>
"You'd be amazed. After all, these people would only offer things they can get rid off."
</p>

<p>
He certainly had a point. But how could I have imagined that on the road from Prague to Theresienstadt hordes of dwarfs would be lined up for sale and actually be bought to enhance meticulously clipped lawns. (" . . . they cost practically nothing in our German Marks. Have them wrap up a few, dear . . . ") Besides the dwarfs there also was an offering of giant plush Mickey Mice, lovable dinosaurs and similar creatures in sizes to suit all decorative needs.
</p>

<p>
"Right after Theresienstadt, towards the border, it's getting worse," said D. "There are fewer dwarfs, but dozens of young girls lining the road, among them gypsy girls way under age."
</p>

<p>
Madonnas of the street? Lovely landscape, beautiful morning? What have I dreamt up once again? The begging gypsy mother with her child in her arms, which she got who knows how, and her sisters along the highway between Bohemia and Germany&#x02014;they were today's reality, as yesterday's was the ghetto, which was not a magic spell cast on Theresienstadt, but rather its reorganization, where later this evening we would be interpreters at a Czech-German colloquium that fortunately could once again end well. <i>Mutabor</i>.
</p>

<p>
We left the interstate highway.
</p>

<p>
"Where should I drop you off?" the driver wanted to know. "At the museum? That's usually the destination of my passengers to Theresienstadt."
</p>

<p>
"No, take us to the Town Hall, please."
</p>

<p>
We turned into a quiet street. On both sides the portly bourgeois houses of a small old northern Bohemian town. No people. The car turned into another street. The same scene. More or less well preserved or newly painted houses, a few modest stores, one fashionably calling itself a "boutique." No one around.
</p>

<p>
We approached a grassy area. Big old trees, their wide branches arching under the fresh foliage, specks of sun between the empty benches. At the end of the square a low, wide building. An arch of black and white rectangles above the driveway glistened in front of us. A small black square next to a white one, then again the black painted wall, another white square and so on forming an arch which seemed to smile almost benignly in the early evening hour.
</p>

<p>
Was this the driveway to the ghetto barracks or to the prison in the Little Fortress?
</p>

<p>
The car stopped. The Town Hall looked like similar buildings of bygone days in similar towns in this part of the country.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
We got out of the car and looked around. No one in the street. Were there so many dead that the town itself had finally died from so much dying?
</p>

<p>
When my mother had already passed through the entrance gate, framed then in white and ochre, and was assigned to the ironing room for the guards' uniforms, I was jailed in an ancient prison in Paris. The institution had a deceptively pleasant name: La Petite Roquette: Little Wild Tendril. That was the only pleasant thing about the expansive complex with walls so thick they barely let any light through. For over a hundred years the construction served its cheerless purpose, most recently as a jail for women, and there was nothing but brownish, dirty gray or black walls, dark corridors, barren yards for the inmates' dreary rounds, when they were ordered out of their equally dreary cells for their ten-minute "promenades."
</p>

<p>
When I came back to Paris for the first time several years after the end of the war, I went to look at the prison I had known only from the inside. There were no windows in the police cars that brought us from the interrogations to the Palace of Justice and back to the Roquette. So I stood quite surprised in front of the long wall overgrown with ivy, which made it look almost inviting. Only the heavy door with its rows of heavy locks was an indication of what was beyond the ivy-covered walls.
</p>

<p>
That chapter of my life found an altogether surprisingly good ending. Recently, a woman friend who had been jailed there at the same time sent me a newspaper clipping with a photograph that was taken at the moment the Roquette's surrounding wall was torn down and collapsed. A few buildings were still standing to the left and the right, but the middle part was already wrecked, turned to rubble for good.
</p>

<p>
For a long time I had the photograph on my bookshelf; it made me go on whenever I became faint-hearted. You see, it seemed to tell me, the Petite Roquette doesn't exist anymore, even though it appeared to be absolutely indestructible. That's also possible. Darkness, the indestructible, doesn't exist anymore.
</p>

<p>
"Look," D. said suddenly as we stood in front of the town hall not quite knowing what to do. We had expected someone from the colloquium to greet us and show us the way. I looked in the direction she pointed.
</p>

<p>
I started.
</p>

<p>
A man was sitting on a bench under a magnificent chestnut tree. With a blank stare, he was drawing invisible circles in the air. An older man with a finely chiseled and not at all mindless face, with a high forehead and dark, wide open eyes. Sitting there, and starting again and again. Always the same, rather large invisible circles.
</p>

<p>
"The only person we encountered up to now," D. whispered.
</p>

<p>
I nodded, stunned. Naturally I had to think of the madman I saw this morning. But here, in this fortress town which had been transformed into a city of death, the encounter had yet another, quite different effect on me. Where did this lonely man direct his fearful and at the same time empty gaze? What did he and only he see? What vicious circle did he try to trace with his restless hand? What was the meaning of these two encounters on one day, under my Prague's blue sky and now in this shut-down town? Was this coincidence really a coincidence . . .
</p>

<p>
The international dialogue that brought us here was animated by the sincere desire to build new bridges. The light was fading beyond the high windows of the town hall, 

<b></b>

where the meeting took place. There wasn't a sound coming in from outside; no car, no truck, no one calling, no one laughing. All the benches under the old trees would certainly be empty by now. No one in the street.
</p>

<p>
I translated the welcoming words of the mayor, a resolute, simple woman. Then there were lectures, some in Czech, some in German. I interpreted. Mechanically. Naturally the talks were about the terrible years, when the town was forced into a ghetto existence. Its original inhabitants, all of them Czech citizens, were expelled; they had to give up their homes by order of the Nazi administration. What were they told? What reason were they given for their sudden forced relocation? Did they know who would move into their living rooms, bedrooms and kitchens? Did they have any idea what a hell their sweet homes would be turned into? Were they told lies about officers' quarters, or were they told the truth&#x02014;that "sub-humans" would be concentrated inside their former four walls? How did those Czech citizens, the majority of them ethnic Germans, adjust to this unexpected new purpose of their town? Surely they were not asked, they simply were forced out, and yet. What were they thinking? Were they unhappy, outraged, indifferent or agreeable? At the very least they must have been sad to have to leave so suddenly. But what was their sadness measured against the sadness that moved in!
</p>

<p>
Some houses were used as SS headquarters, all the others were changed into prison quarters with quickly cut and stacked plank beds for thousands, no, tens of thousands of Jewish men, women and children. As long as Czechoslovakia was a free nation, eight thousand people had lived in this town. Later thirty to fifty thousand had to be packed in there at times. My father and mother, my grandmother, uncles and aunts were among them.
</p>

<p>
On that early summer evening when I found myself in Theresienstadt, I could translate only mechanically, while I listened for the silence in the street and was suddenly afraid that the earlier, unstoppable clamor from the crowded quarters would erupt in the treetops above the deserted square; calls for help, curses, last sighs.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly an unexpectedly angry voice pierced my earphones; demanding my immediate undivided attention, it quickly dispersed my panicked visions. A young German&#x02014;purple T-shirt, curly shock of hair tied with a green ribbon&#x02014;raged against the continued existence of IG Paints while everyone knows that back in those years . . . <sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Abruptly I was back in the present. The other participants responded to the young man with calming restraint. Shortly afterwards, the conference was over. I was looking for the mayor, I wanted to talk to her briefly, I wanted to find out how many people were still living in that quiet town. About one thousand eight hundred, she said. Once again I looked through the high windows onto the deserted square, and I decided to come back soon, without a colloquium.
</p>

<p>
Late at night, driving back to Prague, there was nothing to see of the landscape on either side of the highway. A pale light here and there, trembling in the bluish-black darkness. One could no longer make out whether "Rooms available," "Sandwiches" or "Eros centers" were offered at the curbs.
</p>

<p>
I stared intensely into the darkness. Where were they now, those squadrons of dwarfs parading past us on both sides of the road? Where did they come from and to 

<b></b>

where did they disappear? Had they been living here all those years, in the houses and barracks of Theresienstadt, between the stones of the Little Fortress, beneath the damp tiles of the barrack floors, in a dark corner of the execution space? Were they helpful as in the fairy tale of Snow White, or were they like their descendants, those funny little guys in the Disney movie? Or did they steal the last bites of stew right off the plates? Did they smudge the writing in secretly kept journals or trick the terrified people with delusory visions?
</p>

<p>
The endless circles made by the two madmen's restless hands . . .
</p>

<p>
Enough, enough, I admonished myself in the dark corner of the car gliding through the night. Despite everything, despite the epidemics, the constant dying, and the deportations without return, there was also life in the town turned ghetto, the present Hitler gave the Jews, as Goebbels's outrageous propaganda was to make the world believe. Not the so-called ordinary life, to be sure, with its small and big worries and joys, once taken for granted, but still&#x02014;
</p>

<p>
As thousands of Jewish children were horded into Theresienstadt, some women and men&#x02014;former teachers, educators, musicians and actors&#x02014;decided to brighten up a bit the limited lives of their youngest members, to penetrate the thick walls of the fortress with a little bit of joy. Even here children should not forget how to laugh.
</p>

<p>
During the thirties, in the early phase of the Czechoslovakian Republic, there was one theater among Prague's many stages that featured two funny wooden puppets as their main characters: Father &#x00160;pejbl and his silly little son Hurv&#x000ED;nek. Both were bald; Hurv&#x000ED;nek sported one single curl above his high forehead. Both looked at the puzzling world through big round eyes, both had ears that stuck out wide. They were the special favorites of all Bohemian children. Thus the artists interned at Theresienstadt decided that they should delight their young audiences even there.
</p>

<p>
After laborious and at the same time feverish preparations the day of the opening finally arrived. The attic of the barrack where the performance was to take place was filled to the last corner. The anticipation was nearly tangible, one could almost hear the impatient pounding of the little hearts. And then the joyous buzz, when father &#x00160;pejbl appeared in his black frock coat, with his little son in his short pants. They started their funny verbal duel, &#x00160;pejbl trying again and again to educate his son who resisted those attempts with his deadpan, precocious remarks.
</p>

<p>
But what was happening? The audience got quieter and quieter. The actors in the makeshift scenery looked at each other, stunned. Why was there hardly any laughter? Why were the children so quiet all of a sudden?
</p>

<p>
"I'll take a look," offered one of the actors and he stepped between the two wooden puppets. "Alright everybody," he called out into the packed auditorium as cheerfully as he could manage, "let's greet our dear Hurv&#x000ED;nek with a loud 'Ahoj!'"
</p>

<p>
Only a few thin little voices followed his suggestion.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter," the man now asked in a factual tone from the stage, "don't you like it?"
</p>

<p>
A little girl, her wild curly hair decorated for the occasion with a shiny pin, lifted her hand like she once used to in school.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
"Hurv&#x000ED;nek," she said haltingly, "is he one of them now?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what you mean," said the man on stage, a bit uncertain now.
</p>

<p>
"Well, like . . . from the headquarters, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Hurv&#x000ED;nek? What on earth would make you think that?"
</p>

<p>
"Because he has no yellow star. But all of us have to have one."
</p>

<p>
Neither the director nor the actor had thought of that. The oversight could quickly be corrected and no one marked with the Star of David had ever been greeted so lovingly and enthusiastically as those two darlings of Prague's children by the prisoners of the ghetto.
</p>

<p>
Why was it garden gnomes, of all things, taking position along the highway that leads to the former ghetto and beyond, to another country, I contemplated on the way home. With their dumb faces they could hardly be the messengers of a hitherto unknown fate, a more bearable one perhaps, especially since they had settled here only very recently. Where were they when hell broke loose in our country? Moreover&#x02014;human visitors arriving at our borders were carefully scrutinized, searched and even x-rayed, if deemed necessary. But those garden gnomes marched in here without any troubles. In the vicinity of Theresienstadt, where the unspeakable still is and might well be forever suspended in the air, this cutefied commercial nonsense seemed nearly unbearable to me.
</p>
<br /><br />

<p class="noIndent">
A few weeks later I am on the way, as I had intended, for my second visit to Theresienstadt. This time a German friend takes me there in her car. Frau H. devotes her intermittent sojourns in Prague to intensive research of the cultural activities in the ghetto. As we chat, I manage to pay only fleeting attention to the awful gaggle of dwarfs along the road. However, looking another way is pretty much impossible, since the mini-regiments of this recent invasion of gnomes have taken position shoulder to shoulder on both sides of highway E55&#x02014;the stretch that has become famous in recent years for its infamous border-crossing sex tourism&#x02014;with dwarfs grinning at travelers from the left and the right.
</p>

<p>
Around 11 <small class="caps">A.M.</small> we reach the first fortress wall and pass by the former Sudeten Barracks, so called by the Nazi occupiers, not by the Czechoslovaks they had forced to leave. Originally it had been built as an arsenal, which was nothing out of the ordinary in a garrison town. But at the end of November 1941, in the close vicinity of the Berlin liaison office, the first transport was housed there, the so-called <i>Aufbaukommando</i> or construction commando, because now the whole town was to be transformed. The disturbed Jewish men, whose absurd task it was to make an international ghetto out of a provincial Bohemian town, found no one in the street whenever and wherever they were sent to do their job, which shook them up further. No one had told them, of course, that everyone had been forced out. They were told nothing. They were called up, packed up, shipped off and unloaded. What would be lurking there in the eerily deserted buildings, which spook would play its dreadful tricks between the old fortress walls? They looked around in fear. No one in the street. What could that mean? What fate was in store for them in that eerie place? Luckily they could envision only the imaginable.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
At that time, by the way, there also was an Aussig barrack in Theresienstadt. It was an assembly point for the processing of transports in the "dead of the night," a sort of clothing depot, which gradually filled up with the possessions of the inmates. If each of the thousands and ten thousands left only one dress, once pair of shoes, if each child left just one toy, there must have been piles of clothes, mountains of shoes, heaps of books and fabulous quantities of dolls and other toys in the central storage room of the Aussig barrack. But there was certainly nothing fabulous about this place.
</p>

<p>
Another barrack&#x02014;named Hohenelber after the village in the Riesengebirge [now Krono&#x00161;e mountains] housed the main hospital, where the interned physicians fought for every single life as if they did not know how short-lived they would all be around here. At that time there also was one Bodenhauser barrack that served as an armory. I don't know, nor do I have an explanation for the reason behind the specific name of each object. Perhaps the gentlemen of the occupation administration wanted to award those towns for their good efforts in realizing the wishful motto: <i>Heim ins Reich</i> ("Home to the Reich")? I really don't know.
</p>

<p>
"Why on earth would they have picked local Sudeten German names for these horror buildings?" Frau H. wondered that same moment as we were passing these complexes. "Is this what the local Nazis wanted?"
</p>

<p>
"Not really," I replied, "even though, at that time, in 1941, they were still deluded by expectations of victory. But they also established 'real' German barracks, as it were, a Dresden barrack for women, a Magdeburg ward for the Council of Jewish Elders under the supervision of the SS, a Hamburg building which was occupied primarily by Jewish people from Holland. That's also where they had the so-called 'lock' for the transports to the East."
</p>

<p>
Frau H. steps on the brake and looks into my face.
</p>

<p>
"You are saying this so matter-of-factly. Without a trace of hatred in your voice."
</p>

<p>
"Hatred? That won't do any good. It just sours life."
</p>

<p>
"And mourning?"
</p>

<p>
"Mourning remains, it fills every corner of the soul. If one knows that, one can deal with it. Mourning doesn't hate and it doesn't forgive, it is quiet and deep down. Touched by it, one can almost live life more fully . . . Here is the town hall."
</p>

<p>
Frau H. parks the car, we get out. We look at the rectangular town green, framed by trees. Deserted. Only one lonely man is sitting on a bench, an older man in a grey suit. Sitting there, looking nowhere in particular and . . .
</p>

<p>
No, it couldn't be. I have met this man before, right here. Does he come to this bench every day? Does he have to come? Why? Does he relax in this friendly spot or is it the mourning deep down in his soul which brings him here again and again? With a strikingly delicate hand not disred by manual labor the man is drawing his invisible circles in the air. One, two circles, followed by a short break and then again, one, two circles. Why? A question without an answer.
</p>

<p>
"We have to go in," Frau H. gently touches my arm, "the mayor must be waiting for us already."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course," I say. "I am glad you are here with me."

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
The mayor, who has known Frau H. from earlier meetings, welcomes us graciously, gives me all the information, talks openly about her concerns. The conversation proceeds calmly, to the point, over cups of coffee.
</p>

<p>
I look at the face of the woman talking to me. She must be in her late forties, too young to remember the war and the horrible fate of this town. Now she carries a large part of the responsibility for it. She regrets that she can't do what's necessary to improve the environment, because the funds provided for this purpose aren't enough. There is more money for the upkeep of the Memorial, she notes, from different sources, of course, and that's perfectly alright. Still, I can hear a touch of bitterness in her voice. She seems to regret that quite a bit is being done for the dead and not enough for the living town. Since the garrison has been vacant&#x02014;its last residents were the soldiers of the "brotherly" Soviet occupation force that invaded in 1968&#x02014;there are hardly any employment opportunities in Theresienstadt.
</p>

<p>
My ears prick up: A town hardly able to scrape by if it isn't filled with soldiers? How strange.
</p>

<p>
"We have a few new job opportunities in the psychiatric clinic," the mayor tells us. Maybe she noticed my astonishment. "It's a Prague institution that moved here."
</p>

<p>
"Out here?" I picture the man on the town green. "Psychiatric patients?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," says the mayor and adds reassuringly: "But only harmless cases, depression and such. They aren't dangerous at all; after all, they bring us a few jobs and they increase our inhabitants by about two hundred and fifty."
</p>

<p>
Two hundred and fifty psychically damaged people. I get up and walk to the window. The man is still sitting on the bench, drawing his circles.
</p>

<p>
"Can Theresienstadt be the right place to cure depression?" I thought out loud.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you know," the mayor shakes her head a bit helplessly, "most of the patients don't even understand where they are. And there are highly educated personalities among them, professors and such. You come across them in town. When it's warm, they are sitting on the benches. Quite possibly one of them is there right now. They are very quiet and don't harm anyone."
</p>

<p>
I thank her for the conversation. Frau H. still needs to discuss with her a few details concerning an upcoming concert of composers from Theresienstadt.
</p>

<p>
The wooden staircase creaks a bit under my feet as I walk down. On the town square I sit down next to the man on the bench.
</p>

<p>
"Good day."
</p>

<p>
He gives me a blank look. Is he one of those highly educated personalities, one of the professors? Is his personal drama connected to the tragedy that still remains locked inside those buildings?
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, the man turns to me. I look in his intelligent, infinitely sad face with its two lifeless eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," he says quietly, "good day. Thank you."
</p>

<p>
That's all. Then he turns back inside himself, drawing his endless circles with his delicate hand. I sit quietly next to him and suddenly I think I see the man in the bustling Prague street. In his restlessness, he too kept drawing the same circles. Why?

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Finally I get up, apparently unnoticed by my companion on the bench, and I look around. No one in the street. Only one mentally disturbed person. Theresienstadt, half a century after its liberation. The town square with its green, overshadowed by trees, was also deserted during the ghetto years. The men and women with the yellow Star of David on their chests, herded together in the various barracks, making their way with great effort through the crowded streets, were not allowed to enter the expansive square until 1944, one year before the inevitable collapse of Hitler's regime. That was when they expected the visit of a commission from the International Red Cross. For the occasion, all of Theresienstadt was "humanized" like a stage set. Only death didn't want to play along. It stuck to its daily activity.
</p>

<p>
For years I had avoided&#x02014;or, to put it more honestly, rejected all commemorative events, reverent cultural presentations or political manifestations in this town. My father died here of scarlet fever shortly after his internment. All I know about my older sister is that she and her eight-year-old son died in the gas chambers somewhere in Poland. I never found out where, and it would not have changed anything about this weighty fact. My younger sister's last journey took her from the Gestapo headquarters in Prague via the concentration camp of Ravensbr&#x000FC;ck to her death in Birkenau. And my mother . . .
</p>

<p>
My mother was a trained dressmaker. She never really practiced her profession until it was put to use in this place. She was ordered to work in the ironing room. After the war I was told by one of my former colleagues, who had been a member of the Jewish self-government (though sickly all the years I knew her, she had survived the dirt, the constant fear, the epidemics):
</p>

<p>
One day she saw the name of my mother on the list of the next transport to Auschwitz. Immediately, she took action. She got the Council of Elders to issue a document that stated that my mother was urgently needed in the ironing room (where the uniforms were pressed). Literally at the last moment she ran with it to the ramp, where the train was ready for the deportation. My mother was taken out of the line and ordered back into the ironing room.
</p>

<p>
But a few weeks later it started all over again. Again the woman found my mother's name on the fateful list. Again she took immediate action, again she rushed to the ramp, where my mother with all the others ordered onto this transport were standing in front of the cattle train, ready to board.
</p>

<p>
"I waved from afar with the life-saving paper, but your mother only shook her head and didn't move. She thanked me," the woman quietly reported after the war, "and then she climbed into the car. She knew that the transport had to be complete. If she had stayed behind, someone else would have had to go."
</p>

<p>
"Did she know what happened to my sisters?"
</p>

<p>
The woman shrugged her shoulders. "We didn't talk about that. But once I saw her almost beaming. That was when she told me that you were safe."
</p>

<p>
I was struck to the core. Not that my safety was all that assured at that time, but still. Having survived all one's loved ones is hard to bear. One often shudders at one's own fate in view of such an undeserved gift. That's when the thought of my mother's face lighting up for a moment brought unexpected consolation.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
But I never ever wanted to go to Theresienstadt. And now I am here. Now I am here and I think I hear the dragging of resigned steps, the whispers of young people still resonating with indefatigable expectations and dreams, the chatter of unsuspecting children, the whispered prayers of the faithful desperately imploring their God who didn't seem to hear them, the hearses creaking under their loads.
</p>

<p>
Behind the row of trees facing the bench with the quiet man rises the Church of the Resurrection of the Lord. Here? In this garrison town turned monster ghetto, originally founded by the Empress Maria Theresia&#x02014;surely, this is not the place where the Jew Jesus Christ could come back to life. Here, his guards would have caught him right away, they would have tortured him again, killing him a thousand times. "<i>Rex Judaearum"</i> reads the gilded inscription underneath Christ's image on Prague's Charles Bridge. The King of the Jews&#x02014;in Theresienstadt?
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, the church on the square, the Theresienstadt Square of the Czechoslovakian Army (that name no longer corresponds with the present either) isn't all that old. Though built only in the nineteenth century, its vaulted ceiling has dangerous cracks. To prevent it from collapsing it would have to be thoroughly supported and renovated. The mayor also mentioned this concern, adding quickly that she is firmly resolved to find the necessary money, no trifle to be sure, since the restored church would also serve as a concert hall. The works of composers imprisoned and for the most part also murdered in Theresienstadt would be performed here.
</p>

<p>
"Everything requires money," sighed the woman in the town hall, "lots of money&#x02014;and also many diligent hands. But as you can see yourself, there are not many people, and there certainly isn't any money."
</p>

<p>
Her words suddenly brought back the roadside dwarfs. Their fairy-tale brothers used to be quite diligent, now they could get to work in the deserted town, and they'd better find a pot of gold. Unfortunately, their commercial copies along Route E55 will hardly come up with such magic deeds.
</p>

<p>
The epoch now gradually fading after the passage of half a century was marked by some minor events, besides the big ones, that, aside from their brutality, were downright absurd. When Joseph II, one of the many children of Empress Maria Theresia, initiated the construction of this fortress at the confluence of the rivers Elbe [now Labe] and Eger [now Ohre], he wanted to protect Bohemia against hostile invasions from the northwest. Was that a reasonable project? No doubt. It certainly made sense to his imperial mother and co-ruler, after whom the town was named. To protect lovely Bohemia.
</p>

<p>
Decades, centuries went by. The fortress of Theresienstadt was no obstacle to modern raids of Bohemia. When the Germans occupied the country and the Nazis, both native and from across the border, converted it to its new function, it became the setting for yet another, most grotesque atrocity.
</p>

<p>
After World War I, the young Czechoslovakian Republic decided to honor the sons who had died for its freedom and independence with a Grave of the Unknown Soldier. The remains of Czech soldiers were deposited in the chapel of Prague's Old Town Hall together with a handful of earth from various battlefields.
</p>

<p>
But they were not yet to find eternal peace. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
A place of honor for the men who fought for the establishment and independence of Czechoslovakia was unacceptable to the occupants of 1939. During the night from 22 to 23 October 1941, eight men under the leadership of one SS man Klein entered the chapel, cut open the zinc tomb and the wooden coffin, and brought what they found there to the Prague Gestapo headquarters in Bredauer Street. It's hard to explain the reasons for this strange undertaking. Did they expect to find weapons or even a treasure in the tomb? Maybe. However, the chapter of unreason was not yet finished with the moving of the bones. In April 1945, when the majority of tormented Europeans found themselves liberated from the terror of oppression, the Gestapo transferred the robbed and desecrated Grave of the Unknown Soldier to the Little Fortress in Theresienstadt. What better place for freedom-loving citizens than this proven prison, which had been degraded as the site of death of an entire human community. This is where the spoils of Prague's Old Town Hall were buried hastily in a secret place shortly before the end of the war. Buried and never found again.
</p>

<p>
That too is part of the heavy historic burden of the small town between the gentle slopes of northwestern Bohemia, the town named after an Austrian empress whose initials grace the municipal code of arms to this day.
</p>

<p>
During my second visit, I again avoid the Ghetto Museum. Two foreign busses are parked in front of its entrance, one from Germany, the other from Poland. I simply can't bear to look at the display of drawings, paintings and photographs of those forcefully interned here, squeezed between groups of tourists. And what if I suddenly were to stand in front of the face of my grandmother or my mother . . .
</p>

<p>
To get to the Little Fortress, one has to cross to the other side of the River Eger. After a few steps on the stone bridge I go to the railing and look upstream. That's the place&#x02014;that is where the ashes of those burnt in the crematorium were dumped into the river. Did they sink to the bottom, are they still there or were they swept away by a merciful wave that carried them through hostile Germany towards their own final solution&#x02014;giving the last remains of those martyred people the unlimited freedom of the open ocean?
</p>

<p>
"The Little Fortress." That doesn't sound so bad, almost friendly. But the massive, reddish wall along Princip Road, squatting there in front of me, cowering in the landscape, as it were, doesn't make a trustworthy impression at all. The glaring, black-and-white masonry around the main gate is not in the least bit inviting, but rather terrifying. Like a shrill scream in the silence all around. Well, one can't expect anything inviting from a fortress, even if it's just a little one. This one has an especially sinister past. During World War I, the Serbian students who assassunated Ferdinand d'Este, the Austrian successor to the throne, and his wife Sophie, were imprisoned there. During the Czechoslovakian Republic the Little Fortress served as a military jail and during World War II as the prison of the Prague Gestapo. A truly terrible fate. And now?
</p>

<p>
No one in the street and no one in the Little Fortress either. But the courtyards, the blocks and the cells are there and with them everything that had been committed and suffered here. Yet only my steps echo across the stone pavement, only my heart pounds in such a fright that I can actually hear it, only my eyes trying to look away still 

<b></b>

have to look into the dark cells, between the thick bars, at the narrow wooden planks. I certainly am not a newcomer to this environment, I can recognize a prison in one breath, I can smell what's no longer there, I can feel the cold, the hunger and the thirst the people in here were exposed to. Also their fear and their desperation.
</p>

<p>
During the past years, to be sure, the permanent exhibit and the gallery in the former SS barracks opened the eyes of many people to the unbelievable events in this place. But I don't have to go in. I don't want to see the former workshops in courtyard II either. (Was this where the ironing room was located?) And I certainly don't want to see the execution site of Czech resistance ters and Jews from half of Europe. I know people who had to die here. Fortunately, I also know some who were liberated.
</p>

<p>
Who knows why on this dreary, trampled down, mercilessly hard floor I worriedly asked myself: Why did the man on the town square of Theresienstadt draw his constant invisible, closed circles in the air? Why did he have to draw them endlessly? And the man I met on that bright carefree early-summer morning in Prague, with the same obsessive compulsion, where did he come from and where did he belong? Had he also been interred here? Or did he have a similar fate in another place? Are both of them ting their inescapable captivity? Could they be drawing their robbed, locked-in freedom? Is the restlessness of the man on the lonely bench in Theresienstadt the same as the other's on the overcrowded street in Prague? Is there consolation for them? Or liberation even from their nightmares?
</p>

<p>
On the entangled roads of memory those unanswerable questions suddenly bring back to my mind the young man in the purple T-shirt, his agitated voice during the colloquium I interpreted at the local town hall. If this young German chose to come here, of all places, if all the other young people with their justified outrage and resolve freely speak up here, in this place, ask their questions and state their demands, then even Theresienstadt can finally begin to breathe and believe in a future. Then maybe even the restless hands can find some peace.
</p>

<p>
No one in the street. Even that will change some day. The fairy-tale dwarfs will have nothing to do with it, only the people, the people.

The second novel in Mary Butts's 1928 <i>Taverner Novels </i>series, <i>The Death of Felicity Taverner,</i> repeatedly returns to the topic of how to correctly possess things, lauding a style of ownership that blends "passion and detachment" . For Butts, one's affective relation to what one possesses defines an ethics and politics, a lifestyle. The Taverners, Butts writes, did "not tire of real things once they  . . .  got them home to play with" . In praising the family, Butts does not simply define their "real things" as authentic objects, instead of spurious imitations or copies. Rather, here Butts understands a "real thing" as an empirical surface, perceptible to touch, sight and smell:

The polish on a horse's coat, the china-red lacquer of Adrian's car, two shots as a half-mirror, were to them surfaces as pleasant as petal or silk. . . . Like others of our age, they had re-discovered also the still-life, that, however it may get itself painted, it is not <i>nature mort</i>, but that each haphazard arrangement can be composed of formal perfections of shape and light&#x02014;plates on a table, a basket of folded linen, a sea-scape off the beach in a glass dish.

<p class="noIndent">
In describing these surfaces, Butts's prose lovingly creates its own still-life, placing each object in reference to a composition of "formal perfections." This formal symmetry occurs in a world 

<b></b>

where the walls of a habitation are "in their place again" when a "shining room" is "charged-up with pain" . For Butts, the affective life of an interior works paradoxically; in the ideal spatial scenario, the fixed, precise, and demarcated arrangement of concrete things encourages a more fluid state of empathic connection.  
</p>

<p>
Butts's concern for the lives of objects broaches a number of important critical and conceptual issues, both theoretically and in terms of modernism more specifically. The purpose of this argument is twofold: to understand Butts's significance to modernism and to determine what her presentation of object life might contribute to critical thought more generally. In what follows, I argue that Butts's fiction counter-intuitively emphasizes the role of a grounded or situated object-life in theorizing empathy as an idealized synthesis of "passion and detachment" . Butts's modernism consistently addresses how to properly place objects in order to develop a form of affective attachment that preserves the discrete integrity of those objects. However severe Butts's real-life affective failures, which ranged from her abandonment of her daughter to the hatefulness she directed towards her mother, her novels and short stories emphasize how humans might affectively attach themselves to the object world, particularly through a form of private possession that avoids reifying its objects.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In focusing on the art of placing objects, Butts's work foregrounds a second area of concern: the relation between empathy, the proper placement of objects, and an appropriate style of ownership. Private possession, it appears, is essential for objects to remain both soluble and intact in their boundaries. In creating a diffuse sense of boundary, Butts's etiquette of placement de-privatizes the world of objects and humans, refusing to uphold a demarcated sense of subject and object. Paradoxically, this solubility develops precisely from the kinds of relations that arise from specific styles of private ownership. Butts's description of Felicity Taverner suggests that objects only become "possessions" when they are the subjects of "choice," through an idealized process that builds, rather than severs, the affective relation between these objects and their collectors. The passage I quoted above directly links Felicity's admired "passion and detachment," or her empathic abilities, to this exercise of choice, to her careful claiming of an object as her own.
</p>

<p>
In suggesting that empathic connections between animate and inanimate worlds only develop from some degree of attached and private ownership of objects, Butts's writing supports a critical idiom that extends beyond the question of who or what consumes these objects. Generally, theoretical studies of objects have operated by building an all-too-resolute relationship between market forces, private ownership, and consumption. Furthermore, such arguments often develop from the assumption that both subjects and objects resist their inevitable reification, and that escape from the pervasive forces of objectification requires that they completely remove themselves from the bonds of private ownership.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  This logic continues to form the basis of a number of arguments that attempt to contest cultural and sexual normativity in particular. That is, the idea that any phenomenologically grounded appearance commodifies the object in question reinforces another commonly held assumption that distance from a "biological basis" correlates with the "potential for doing justice to difference."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Butts's work offers an 

<b></b>

alternative to the frequent contention that the only escape from the inevitable commodification of objects lies in their utter de-privatization&#x02014;or freedom from the bonds of possession. For Butts, an utterly de-privatized object-life&#x02014;which liberates both objects and social relations from structures of private ownership&#x02014;often disables affective and empathic bonds. Instead, Butts's short stories and novels respond to a modernity that, as Rachel Bowlby claims, has erased all reference points for a collective emotional attachment. Ultimately Butts sees the basis for collective forms of empathy in a particular style of private ownership that dissolves the self, rather than solidifies it.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The few critical articles about Butts have generally focused on her exclusion from aesthetic modernism, but her unceasing devotion to things plants her more solidly within a modernism that was obsessed with the dimensions and lives of objects. This modernism includes writers as diverse as Oscar Wilde, Wyndham Lewis, Virginia Woolf, and Elizabeth Bowen. Aside from noting the fact that Butts's innovative, if at times obscure, prose was rejected by more prominent writers such as Virginia Woolf as "indecent," or by Marianne Moore as "out of harmony" with the aims of <i>The Dial</i>, critics have said little in regard to Butts's vociferous fictional and critical commentary on modernism (<i>MB:SL</i>, 188). Fueled by Nathalie Blondel's impressive biography, attention to Butts's work has been largely biographical, focusing on her critical recovery as a rambunctious personality, a writer of obscure and experimental prose, and a hanger-on to rather celebrated groups of gay men, which included such luminaries as Jean Cocteau.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  However, Butts's significance to modernism extends beyond her importance as an object of feminist recovery, or her reputation as a notorious personality&#x02014;a drug addict who traveled "astrally," a bad mother, and according to Wyndham Lewis, a "big carroty anglish intelligentsia  . . .  and buxom heiress" (<i>MB:SL</i>, 188). The dearth of criticism is complicated by Butts's exclusion from, and subsequent <i>resentiment</i> of, prominent modernist circles such as Gertrude Stein's and Virginia Woolf's, particularly because she offered what Bruce Hainley has called a "big Shut Up to much of modernism's nonsense and hush-hush."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Consequently, Butts's work remains difficult to recuperate within any central modernist paradigm. Yet her literary career&#x02014;as characterized by its odd web of affiliations, its financial insecurity and social exclusion&#x02014;provides important commentary on the often conflicting strands of influence and resentment that created what we now term literary modernism. As a woman, Butts most often categorized herself with modernists such as Eliot, Pound, and Lewis, who would later come to signify hygienic masculinity, rather than with her female contemporaries. In particular, Butts's prose tends to rework a set of issues that emerged much earlier in the discourse of imagism, concerning the relationship between the object world, scientific detachment, and aesthetic form.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  In this process, she tends to re-situate this rather imagistic approach to the object-world within the parameters of the domestic sphere, reclaiming a space that, because of its connection to the feminine, had traditionally been repudiated by much of avant-garde cultural practice.
</p>

<p>
Critics of modernism have generally termed imagism's concern for the direct and grounded appearance of objects "empiricism." We are reminded of Ezra Pound's call 

<b></b>

in 1918 for "Direct treatment of the 'thing,' whether subjective or objective," and consequently tend to associate this ideal with detachment and masculinity.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Yet some of modernism's most virulently masculine res, such as Wyndham Lewis, tended to fault this excessive detachment. For example, in <i>Blast I </i>, Lewis opines that "lofty detachment from any utilitarian end or purpose" accounts for the deficiency of Picasso's latest series of sculptures, "[s]mall structures in cardboard, wood, zinc, glass string, etc."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  In seeming contrast to Pound's call for "[d]irect treatment of the 'thing,'" Lewis suggests that little is gained from treating objects "[s]o directly so."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Lewis's essay actually problematizes the fact that these objects stand too intact in their boundaries, exhibiting little solubility in their relation to the human world. Despite the ostensible difference in Lewis's and Pound's opinions, Pound's conception of what constitutes "direct treatment" coincides more with Lewis's than one might expect. That is, his understanding of things does not function by severing the human and object worlds, but rather, by bringing them together.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
My concern here is not with whether Pound was rightly an empiricist, but with why his understanding of the "thing" is necessarily read as a doctrine of hygienic masculinity that separates subject from object. For example, Douglas Mao suggests that Lewis in particular affiliated himself with imagism, "which could look like yet another variety of insufficiently virile empiricism because it appeared to enshrine discerning perception and accurate transcription as the foundations of literary value" (<i>SO:MTP</i>, 81). However, Lewis's understanding of empiricism was more complex than Mao would suggest, particularly in terms of gender. Mao tends to position Lewis within a gendered binary that inadequately characterizes modernism in terms of its treatment and theory of objects, so that a less direct treatment of the "thing" becomes characteristic of a more "feminine" style of perception. I argue here that intellectuals such as Butts further disturb the gendered binary assigned to the direct and indirect treatment of things, since she institutes her own brand of empiricism and "discerning perception" to build empathic relations that both narrow the gap between subjects and objects and preserve the discrete value of each being.
</p>

<p>
This critical politics&#x02014;which both genders empirical detachment and characterizes modernism as conservative and reactionary&#x02014;attends both classic and recent studies of modernism. Perhaps the most basic claim of Peter Nicholls's classic <i>Modernisms: A Literary Guide</i> is thatmodernism promoted detachment and apathy by affirming subject-object distinctions in its need to strengthen an "ironically anti-social position."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Nicholls's version of modernism, which too rigidly demarcates social and aesthetic space, has influenced a number of more recent studies that attempt to salvage modernist writers from accusations of such overt conservatism. In direct response to Nicholls, Mao claims that modernism often concerned itself with ensuring the "extra-subjective integrity" of the object, so that it could "take the part of this radical other without subordinating it to consciousness" (<i>SO:MTP</i>, 10). This kind of ethical engagement with the object reveals anxiety over the "troubling <i>extensiveness</i> of human power" (<i>SO:MTP</i>, 10). Such extensiveness may either invade the discrete territory of objects, as does Wyndham Lewis's command that we actively "substitute ourselves everywhere 

<b></b>

for the animal world," replacing the "tiger and the cormorant with some invention of our mind, so that we can intimately control this new creation," or conversely, it may encourage an overly detached and distanced relation to objects, designed to justify their exploitation. Both positions fail in managing a relationship to the object that is neither overly detached nor too invasive, a necessary aspect of maintaining an empathic relation to things.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Empathy continues to be read by many critics of the term as merely a form of sentimental and affective identification. For example, in analyzing abolitionist sentiment in nineteenth-century America, Saidiya V. Hartman defines empathy negatively as a "projection of oneself into another" that solidifies the self and exploits "the vulnerability of the captive body as a vessel for the uses, thoughts, and feelings of others."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Certainly, Hartman is right to fault this method of identification, but her version of empathy amounts to little more than a sentimentalized version of transference. Psychoanalytical accounts, such as Freud's, also tend to undermine the possibilities of empathy by focusing on acts of identification as castrating, invasive, or debilitating&#x02014;violent acts that cripple the productivity of affective bonds. The modernist version of empathy I employ here can be best understood in relation to questions of space&#x02014;in the sense that empathy diffuses the boundaries that separate objects and stabilize their identities. The work of philosophers such as Merleau-Ponty proves especially useful in illuminating these forms of empathy, particularly because phenomenology addresses how the precise arrangement of objects creates a sense of meaningful space&#x02014;space that coheres at the same time that it preserves the value and integrity of its separate components. In its critique of the Cartesian tradition, which separates the thinking subject from the external world, a phenomenological account of space best illustrates an ideal of empathy that builds upon a carefully managed spatial engagement with the object world. For example, Merleau-Ponty faults our tendency to "disengage from the object" through a movement in space that turns the subject into "nothing more than what it thinks it is."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  For an empathic relation to exist, a subject must be able to extend its own boundaries, but in a way that dissolves the self and identity, allowing both subject and object to become more than what they think they are. Empathy thus functions as a strange intimacy, where subjects and objects demonstrate their attachment to each other while preserving certain distances. Consequently, an empathic relation demands that things occupy definitive placement or grounding in relation to each other, so that feeling can lodge around specific "sticking points" without usurping the particular positioning of the external world.
</p>

<p>
Generally, empathy has been related to humanist sentiments and subjectivity, which explains Hartman's antipathy to the term. However, modernist treatments of empathy, such as Wilhelm Worringer's 1908 treatise "Abstraction and Empathy," which proves especially useful for understanding how empathy might form the basis of an aesthetic practice, move beyond humanism in connecting the term to a de-centered subject. Worringer reads the traditional meaning of empathy as related to a Platonic form of aesthetic subjectivism whereby the subject finds beauty in his ability to live himself out pantheistically in the forms around him. Worringer complicates this manner of apprehending

<b></b>

art by suggesting that each urge to empathy entails a corresponding abstraction of the subject. That is, the subject's desire to expand the self in apprehending the beautiful also coincides with its self-alienation, an abstraction that dissolves the self.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  This process is best illustrated by examples from Bill Brown's <i>A Sense of Things: The Object Matter of American Literature</i>, where Brown describes the development of the "life-group" exhibit in many museums of the early twentieth century. This development "supplemented 'a poetics of detachment' with a poetics of attachment, establishing contact between the singularized material object and a materialized human body. . . ."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  According to Brown, such scenes replaced serial displays with the "recreation of a scene of use&#x02014;a woman holding a single jug to bring water to her child," for example (<i>ST:OMAL</i>, 92). Brown especially emphasizes the welded "physical intimacy" that such a scene fosters (<i>ST:OMAL</i>, 93); however, other aspects of this scene are significant to modernist theories of objecthood. What is also interesting in this scenario is that the jug acts as a prosthetic extension of the human body itself, and to a certain extent, also points out the inadequacy of this body in negotiating the transfer of nourishment from mother to child. The vessel thus serves an empathic, somewhat self-alienating function that accords with Worringer's version of empathy, resisting the Platonic sentimentalization of art.

Modernist texts such as Butts's even more firmly reject sentimentality as a factor in the "physical intimacy" that characterizes an ethical and empathic relation to objects. Particularly as it relates to modernist conceptions of object life, this dual conception of empathy as both affirming and alienating offers a way of re-thinking the relationship between commodification and the ownership of objects. For example, while certain critics would dismiss Ezra Pound's call for "direct treatment of the 'thing' whether subjective or objective" as stringently masculine, and antithetical to the values of intimacy and empathy, Pound's very concern for accuracy in perception and representation of "the thing," as its environment situates it, features prominently in the work of a number of women writing within the modernist period.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Take, for instance, critics and journalists such as Janet Flanner, the famed American expatriate and contributor to magazines such as <i>Harper's </i>and <i>The New Yorker</i>, whose journalism exposes the extent to which the fate of humanity was tied up in the location of the object. In the memoir she published in 1957, <i>Men and Monuments: Profiles of Picasso, Matisse, Braque and Malraux</i>, Flanner opines that the collecting frenzy inspired by the new fashion of private ownership had actually devalued art, as prices were in reality much lower than they had been a generation before. However, Flanner appears hard-pressed to imagine an alternative to a marketplace based on prestige and personal possession. Ultimately, the dystopic alternative she depicts at the end of <i>Men and Monuments</i> completely de-sacralizes the art world by fully divesting it of ownership.
</p>

<p>
For Flanner, art lost its home through the Nazi looting of modern art collections, where the "physical act of carting pillaged beauty off to the homeland" transformed 

<b></b>

art into portable property.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  The question of this "delicate military traffic problem," which entailed the literal displacement of art, trainload by trainload, quickly and literally bleeds into questions about the state of humanity itself in an atmosphere where people are constantly being displaced (<i>MM</i>, 220). The synthesis Flanner identifies, between the traffic of art and that of humans, suggests that humanity is at stake in the possession of objects. As Jews lost their property rights and national belonging, so too did art become "technically ownerless" (<i>MM</i>, 222). In her concern for Jewish property rights, and by extension, for the network of social relations created by the private ownership of art, Flanner suggests that some modicum of a private or personal relation to objects safeguards the value of both humans and objects.
</p>

<p>
Flanner's writing, which provides an idealized historical context for understanding the more abstract concerns about objects that influence the work of modernists such as Mary Butts, does not efface the significance of private possession, but rather transforms it as a stylized activity. The link Flanner observes between art's loss of ownership and the failure of human empathy represents the full culmination of a problem that Butts also understood, particularly in two overlapping ethical and aesthetic concerns that guide her work: England's connection with imperialist pillage, and the privatized exclusivity of intellectual privilege. Butts faults the intellectual circles that frequently excluded her with having circumscribed aesthetic space too tightly&#x02014;making it into a finely knitted web of privatized social relationships. Similarly, her prose tends to understand Britain's imperialist ethos in terms of space&#x02014;as wresting objects from the locations that might afford them more meaningful social and aesthetic relations. Texts such as Butts's 1928 novel <i>Armed with Madness</i> or her 1932 story "In Bloomsbury" underscore the relation that exists between imperialism and intellectual and cultural exclusivity. That is, Butts's work depicts what she sees as the genteel pretense of owning and managing culture and art as a direct outgrowth of imperialism's "grab and raid" mentality, and vice-versa.
</p>

<p>
As an alternative to this closed sense of culture, and as a means of creating a meaningful space for situating avant-garde politics, Butts frequently insists that art, or objects for that matter, require specialized physical and empirical placement as a sign of respect and as a means of promoting empathic relations. She persistently returns to the activity that creates both a peculiar category of ownerless objects and a failure of empathy&#x02014;pillage. For example, the plot of <i>Armed with Madness</i>, if one might call it that, follows a race to discover the questionable source of a jade cup, "a queer glass dish."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  The narrative thus escalates through variously authored acts of inventing and describing the background of the cup, of placing or positioning it within historical space. Picus, the reported headmaster of this game, has supposedly stolen the cup from his acerbic father, a collector by trade. Intent on surrounding the cup with a mystical aura of ritual ceremony, Picus claims that the cup is an early church vessel, a Keltic altar-piece, which might "well have been part of a crusader's loot" . Other interpretations of the cup's origins abound: it may be the "poison-cup of a small rajah" in India , the Sanc-Grail, or nothing more than "an ash-tray in a Cairo club" . Ultimately, Butts suggests that the quest to authenticate such an item is a pointless one.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
In demonstrating the futility of this search, Butts calls attention to the faulty logic of collecting that claims that the cup is inherently less valuable as a copy or replica than when it stirs the human imagination to envision it in differentiated forms. The text critiques the collector's logic of Picus's surly father, whose realist and dry cataloguing of the cup's origin as a "poison-cup" of a "small rajah" in India refuses to show respect for the more fantastic narratives of origin that Picus would dream up for it. Yet the narrative is correct in deeming the cup loot. And while Butts seemingly takes delight in divesting the cup of its sacred status, its protean amenability to numerous visual interpretations lends a nervous edge to her descriptions of the vessel. Firmly connected to no-one and nothing, the cup's detachment signifies a disease suffered both by itself and by the aesthetic community <i>Armed with Madness </i>invites its reader to examine. The characters' irreverent treatment of the cup, evident in its use as a prop in contests for power that consist of hiding it, stealing it from others, and consigning it to a life of immobility, divides their community. In one way or the other, the cup's status as loot, its placelessness, creates spacelessness&#x02014;an absence of community where the meaningful position of objects could be apprehended.

While <i>Armed with Madness</i> attempts to present an ideal aesthetic community that must vigilantly maintain itself against the forces that attempt to disrupt its self-placement, other examples of Butts's fiction mock aesthetic spaces that prove even harsher environments for a healthy object-life. Butts's story "In Bloomsbury"  savagely exposes the facile nature of <i>au currant</i> intellectualism by depicting a wealthy family whose "magnificent collection of jade" connects them to the British Museum.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  The siblings certainly style themselves appropriately: one paints, one practices "elaborate dissipation," one has a "fashionable taste in sex," and all have received "admirable" educations. Likewise, they "talked the current psychology, dressed in the admired disorder of their world . . . had a true and just, if rather <i>faisande</i>, understanding of the arts" . Primarily, the narrative directs its derisive scorn at the family's inability, despite its status and education, to appropriately own the objects of its wealth. As affluent producers and consumers of culture, the family has not acquired the proper skills of ownership.
</p>

<p>
The Curtins are aptly named because their cordoning off or privatization of lived space disables a veritable object-life, despite all their efforts to appropriately acquire one. In the story, the name "Curtin" also functions as a pseudonym for the Bloomsbury intellectualism made famous by Virginia, Lytton, Clive, Leonard, et al. In contrast to the precarious balance between physical stasis and activity that structures the ideally lived space, the <i>dramatis personae </i>of both "Bloomsbury" and "In Bloomsbury" create a strict living environment that shrinks space, to invoke Merleau-Ponty, in a way that "leaves no margin" for determining the "physical and geometrical distance which stands" between the self and "all things" (<i>PP</i>, 186). In this specific setting, Butts appears to fault her much-resented contemporaries for arranging things both too strictly 

<b></b>

and too loosely. Such disregard for spatial management ultimately robs space of its meaning altogether. For Merleau-Ponty, space is only a reality when "the position of things becomes possible" (<i>PP</i>, 243). Space does not exist when things "float" aimlessly and without real attachment to a specified environment, or conversely, when their security is too bounded. "In Bloomsbury" accents the tense irony of a culture that values objects in their apparent detachment, yet fails to register how the ostentation of its spatial etiquette denies those objects proper placement.
</p>

<p>
This diffuse tale centers around the disturbance that transpires when the family's long-lost, racially ambiguous cousins come to visit, sparking the wildest nativist fantasies these London sophisticates can produce. The narrator, who appears as the Curtins' acquaintance, unites the siblings with their cousins while registering the irony of the Curtin museum connection and stellar collection of jade:

The narrator considers the <i>dur&#x000E9;e</i> of this beloved object, jade, and contemplates how the Curtins' obsession with their possession's legacy ironically cripples their roles as ethical owners of this beloved green substance. The truth is that the jade will outlast the Curtins and that their attempt to appropriate its organic immortality is also an attempt to block history. That is, the Curtins' belief in their sole ownership of the jade blindly shelters their own collection from the rape and pillage that has ultimately placed it in their hands. The narrator reads the jade as the quintessential representative of the ambiguities surrounding the modernist object. Jade is "secure" and jade is also "loot." By formulating this paradox at the heart of her critique of imperialism, Butts reveals her extreme fascination with the empirical substance of this material, perceptible both to touch and sight, and with its social status as a work of art. But rather than divorce the art work from its empirical status, Butts tends to see its subversive "objecthood" and its ability to solicit empathy as dependent on the very boundedness of its empirical structure. As a result, jade becomes loot in its ability to evade private ownership, even while the Curtins offer it the respect of their particular attachment. Ultimately, jade's transcendence lies in both its inorganic, or unloving nature, <i>and</i> in the social network through which it is exchanged and valued. 
</p>

<p>
As the quintessential modernist object, the particularly fortified yet vulnerable gem-like substance Butts features in her story solves one of the major modernist quandaries identified by Douglas Mao. As an object, the jade in Butts's story is able to fulfill its function of "intersubjective mediation" without sacrificing the value of the "thing itself or the realm of being."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  As loot, the jade exposes the hypocrisy of the Curtins' refinement and the frailty of the social space they attempt so delicately to cultivate. Because it evades ownership as a "thing itself," the jade's rootlessness disturbs the space the family purports to build around it. Its material security shrinks the social space that the 

<b></b>

Curtins have used it to build. The arrival of the South African cousins precipitates this spatial collapse, as they ratively reclaim the "loot" as their property. As the narrator records the irony of the wolfish cousins' entrance into the British museum, she wonders what it is they are going in to see: "What had they gone in to look at? They had entered like pirates who dare not swagger, who would loot if they could. Loot was their property and they would collect it. . . . Heartened by the thought of a smash and grab raid of the British Museum, I followed them inside" . By visually re-territorializing the loot as their property, the cousins expose the irony of how the Curtins and the museum have acquired their precious objects. The two men visually expand the strictly understood set of rules for placing oneself in the presence of important and sacred things. They redress the code of bodily conduct required of them during a formal visit to a museum and to the Curtins' Ashways estate, exposing how the set's particular style of ownership condemns their property to transient irresolution and aesthetic death.
</p>

<p>
The cousins dominate the Curtins' space because they understand their own status as objects. They present themselves as such, and the text appears both to mock the Curtins' empirically based but speculative judgments of their cousins, and suggest that the "two wolves" are an empirical reality. In keeping with scientific method, the Curtins had "decided to keep notes on anything we observed and report" . But it is the narrator who, by practicing a kind of seeing that "completed itself, image by image," as if "a cinema, an <i>actualit&#x000E9;</i>, infinitely prosaic," appears most interested in the cousins . The two men "lope in like powerful animals," and carry a landscape with them, a Yeatsian "desert with wild beasts" . The next "scene," which occurs on the "steps of the British Museum," is odd because the cousins panoramically carry their own situatedness in a manner that unmasks the fa&#x000E7;ade of the "scenes" of the museum. For the narrator, the primitive panoramic tableaux that occupy the museum both solidify and confuse the cousins' identities:
</p>

The narrator's viewpoint centers the cousins both within and without the spectacle of the museum itself. Her own confused questioning of what the cousins would actually want to see in the museum occurs because she assumes the cousins are viewing replicas of their own brutish selves, enclosed in panoramic tableaux. Their feral presence completes or enlivens the museum by destabilizing its contents. On one level, their displacement occurs because they disturb the relations between spectator and spectacle. Accordingly, the irony of their visit to the museum lies in the sameness that exists between themselves and the stuffed beasts that occupy their gaze.

But as evidenced by the lack of interest that each cousin ultimately shows for the Assyrian room, they never recognize their affiliation with the objects in the museum. The re-composed and re-structured bodies of dead animals do not elicit enough interest 

<b></b>

to achieve the status of objects. In terms of Worringer's construction of aesthetic modernism, the cousins invalidate the museum precisely because they do not empathize with any of its supposed objects. Since Worringer understands interested spectatorship as simultaneously self-affirming and self-alienating, the cousins appear to recognize no relation between their concepts of self and their observation. "To enjoy aesthetically," Worringer argues, "means to enjoy myself in a sensuous object diverse from myself, to empathise myself into it."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Apathetically lacking all interest or pleasure, they fail to project themselves into the scenes they observe.
</p>

<p>
This lack of empathy highlights the peculiar ways in which the powerful cousins, "with their tanned faces and great bones," function as objects while at the same time enlivening the story's critique of Bloomsbury. Within the museum, the cousins' disruption of the subject/object division that typically structures the relation between spectator and spectacle disparages how socio-aesthetic relations construct themselves around the apparently detached state of the object world. For Butts, true objects actually solicit interest. Thus, the cousins' disinterest in the Assyrian Room does more than simply disrupt the division between subject and object, spectator and spectacle. Their apathy condemns the museum exhibit, in its isolation, to the status of a non-object. As the narrator remarks, "inside were the mysterious treasures of the world, separate, almost sterilized but <i>there</i>" (43, emphasis in original). As long as these items remain displaced, uncannily "<i>there,</i>" separate from the social relations that produced them, they remain nothing more than loot. In its valuation of a specifically placed, empathic object, the story scrutinizes a culture that forms its social relations precisely by "seeing" objects that are socially detached.
</p>

<p>
Yet the detached, displaced "treasures" of the museum seem strangely well placed, as the narrator emphasizes, "<i>there</i>." In contrast, the cousins, whose bodies overpower the stylized space of the museum, appear monstrous within its manicured confines. The narrator's faintly erotic obsession with the corporeal aspects of the cousins' placement critiques the codes of spatial etiquette that governs a privileged life of aesthetic pleasure and consumption. The larger-than-life cousins overturn these rules of bodily and spatial conduct, as the question the narrator asks of them discloses her surprise at how their magnificent bodies could respond to a context so completely removed from them: "What had they gone in to look at?" . What could lure or exert its power over beings of this magnitude? In this frequent confusion, the narrator's obsessive cataloguing tends to focus on how actively the cousins move their bodies: they "lope in like powerful animals" , traveling "on the same stride that might side-step at any moment" , frequently "heavy in hand," like "visiting mountains in a delicate landscape, mountains that were even careful where they put their feet" . The cousins literally "impose their weight" on the Curtins' oversized egos, exposing the smirky inclusiveness of a shrunken space so delicate that it cannot withstand the intrusion of strangers.
</p>

<p>
The cousins' challenge to spatial etiquette directly involves their bodies. Butts's prose, abounding with attempts to sabotage the mores of the intellectual elite by aligning their aspirations with those of bourgeois culture, often fastens on the body to disrupt what she considers to be problem space. "In Bloomsbury" points to the problem of a 

<b></b>

spatial etiquette that is too strict, that reinforces only habit. According to the narrator of the story, habit orders an intellectual set in such a way that the sheer boredom it produces creates more dramatic expectations:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

No one had ever seen them enjoying themselves. . . . Not very long ago it was time for something to happen to them.

<p class="noIndent">
In keeping with Curtin hypocrisy, the siblings transform the stasis of habit into a performed action, which further excuses the inaction of literally "marking time." Although the Curtins do not seem to understand exactly what they're waiting for, the cryptic event occurs upon the arrival of their cousins, whose every movement, every facial feature, expresses a hard, almost crystalline sense of action. The cousins show "not a light" in their eyes but a "glint" . Even the reader remains unsure of the precise nature of this event, so that the Curtins actually appear to be expecting something more like a scene, or "atmosphere."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  The cousins physically enable this development. In their fierce exactitude, they are a style, "fine brutes . . . dark, lean creatures," who carry no excess baggage or psychology to weigh down their imagistic immediacy" . The visual counterpart to Ezra Pound's imagism, they reveal a "sense of freedom from time limits and space limits," despite the precision of their demarcation.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Stripped bare, yet alarmingly steeled for invasion, the cousins erotically attract the Curtins', and the narrator's, attention. 
</p>

<p>
The primitive action of the cousins' bodies forces the Curtins into the submission that disrupts habit, and this is the event this family has really been awaiting. For example, Clarissa, the female of the group, muses over the effects of having an affair with one of them. But such an event, the text suggests, would have been too normal to produce the appropriate change to the Curtins' habitual regime. They require a more earth-shaking phenomenon, something that would physically change them, "exercise" their personalities beyond the limits of individual control . The Curtins await the arrival of an active object, which resists their efforts to "hunt" or objectify it, but which is in turn able to "exercise" them, to (quite literally) disrupt and rearrange the physical spaces of their bodies.

For Butts, narrative action depends on the rearrangement of the corporeal schema and of physical space more generally. Along with loot, Butts also links action, as exemplified in movement (be it carting, pillaging, or more positively, placing or loving), to her concern with the seriality of objects. In speaking of seriality, I do not simply refer to serially mass-produced objects, though Butts, like many modernists, was seriously concerned with the copy, and particularly the bad copy. Butts's obsessive interest in series of items appears to stem not only from her distrust of copies, but also from 

<b></b>

her interest in them. In attempting to move beyond individuality in character and occurrence, her work reaffirms seriality as it simultaneously disregards it.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  That is, Butts's fiction explores two related literary and aesthetic quandaries that characterized modernist theories of both detachment and empathy. The first concerns the difficulty of carefully nourishing an empathic life with soluble boundaries without sacrificing the value of the object's discrete and independent being. The second, metacritically broached by Butts's texts, in which objects constitute narrative itself, involves the challenge of constructing narrative around object-life. This problematic addresses the question of how a communicative and empathic object, lacking the boundaries that create individual security, provides the sticking points that maintain narrative development and organization.
</p>

<p>
In its placement of objects, Butts's story, "With and Without Buttons" foregrounds these issues in narrative development. Two sisters attempt to trick their cynical neighbor Trenchard by feigning the presence of a ghost in the old house they share with him. "With every door and every window open" to the world and to the earth, the house is "a female power asleep," waiting for the sisters to stimulate it into action.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  The sisters' revenge against the dismissive cynicism Trenchard aims at their own, less conventional, belief systems, his "faith of disbelief as inaccurate as excess," consists in strategically "placing" the contents of a box of old gloves in Trenchard's part of the cottage, which is separated from theirs by a common wall . The sisters, who speak frequently from the mutual viewpoint of an impersonal "we," relate the success of their ploy to its apparent action and its ability to function as a series.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  When the narrator asks what the trick will be, the other sister answers that it does not matter:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Because before we begin we'll <i>do </i>something. Anything. A last year's leaf for a start, so long as it can go into a series&#x02014;on his blotter or his pillow. We're always in and out.

The sisters imagine the series as a specific placement of objects in the enactment of their "ill-doing" , as they will later describe it. This "doing," to which object-placement is central, will catalyze a series of events that will defy the sisters' original intention in placing the objects. The sisters also relate the series they build specifically to their narrative, or to their ability to produce a story and jointly author it through their "Signatures." That is, their placement of objects becomes a metaphor for narrative itself. The objects catalyze action, guiding the narrative's sequence and timing. The sequence and pacing of this plan is thus important to the sisters, who ascertain that their narrative will collapse if each occurrence in the series of events is exactly identical. Yet the particular force of their deception depends on how well they stage events that are similar enough to be called recurrences.  
</p>

<p>
The objects required to create these ghostly recurrences parallel the sisters themselves, who are slightly altered versions of each other. The gloves that provide the ruse of the tale are by no means artworks, but they copy themselves in such a way as 

<b></b>

to facilitate precision of placement as part of a serial action that organizes space. The content of these particular gloves is the same: "[a]ll one size  . . .  and for one pair of hands" . The exteriors of the gloves, however, supply the story's title: "With and Without Buttons," some gloves "have all the buttons and some have none and some have some" . Each glove is an inaccurate reflection of the next. They are not simply copies of each other, which would make them impossible to place, but designed slightly differently to enable the placement that builds narrative. Butts's narrative strategy maximizes placement as a code of action that energizes domestic life, bringing it into the collective, inter-dimensional and inter-subjective world, while simultaneously providing the kind of boundedness that meaningful space needs in order to exist.
</p>

<p>
To reiterate, I have argued thus far that space is meaningful and ultimately empathic when its structure preserves the forms of attachment that keep it intact. Space coheres when objects can clearly enunciate their locations, but not when these positions completely forbid movement. This kind of spatial resolve produces empathy. Meaningful space, as I have attempted to define it, tends to manage the full transfusion of boundaries that utter de-privatization&#x02014;or loss of exclusively attached object relations&#x02014;entails. For modernism, this particular version of space offers an ethical midpoint between an utterly detached "ironically anti-social subject position" and Wyndham Lewis's authoritative injunction that humans prosthetically replicate themselves in the external world. More generally, by synthesizing fixity and movement, this version of space presents a way of thinking about affective attachment that does not reify the object of attachment. Such attachments are symbiotic in nature, especially because objects mutually act on each other. For example, in "With and Without Buttons," the sisters are correct in viewing the privileged objects of their games as "stimulants" . As stimulants, they actually generate the appearance of other objects. For this reason, after the sisters "feed [Trenchard] a glove," they begin to realize that the "the gloves will feed themselves" . The observation is syntactically ambiguous. It both re-affirms the stereotypical role of women as caregivers and "feeders," distributors of empathy, while exposing the limits of those actions.
</p>

<p>
At the same time that they nourish and feed, the gloves compensate for a lack&#x02014;of sexual power. As the sisters point out, they could "have made [Trenchard] make love, to either or both of us, any day of the week" . Because they "wanted to have power over him, the power women sometimes want to have over men, the pure not erotic power, whose point is that it shall have nothing to do with sex," the sisters cannot accomplish their goal, which is to "suggest him into an experience," with only their bodies . Sex is plainly not an effective lure; what is required is a demonic attachment, a ghostly body that is at once a veritable body, and detached and strangely re-composed. In much of her work, including <i>Armed with Madness, </i>Butts suggests that women should move beyond their own bodies and sexuality to occupy a higher, more empathic and objective ground. The gloves of "With and Without Buttons" prove strange vessels for this type of empathy, particularly since the sisters are less than empathic in the ruse they devise for their captive, Trenchard. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
More accurately, the gloves that literally move Butts's story highlight the conceptual paradox inherent in modernism's conception of the object. However discretely placed, the gloves harbor an extremely diffuse, animate, and expansive power, that, detached from a veritable human hand, remains estranged from a unified self and ego. These items threaten a normative and gendered organization of space, as represented by the wall that separates the sisters' part of the cottage from Trenchard's. In particular, the gloves' strong odor breaks down this artificially erected boundary, working as a solvent that dissolves the tight security of Trenchard's "simple faith," which the text deems "pseudo"-rational and masculine . For Trenchard, the empirical reality of the gloves' smell, which reminds him of something he had smelled once "in Africa  . . . [b]ad skins," forms the most offensive aspect of their appearance . Trenchard repeatedly encounters the odor's potency, and desperately asks one of the sisters if she will retrieve the perfume she wears to mask it: "What's that lovely scent you wear?  . . .  I want to smell it. Get that" . But when the Parisian <i>parfum </i>appears, the stench triumphs&#x02014;the "sweetness, like a lady-like animal, of old kid gloves" . In terms of Trenchard's personal experience, the smell evokes the female body and Africa, what for him must be the most untidy, unhygienic female body of all, fiercely assaulting his European safety of immaculately pressed white linen shirts. While Trenchard's rejection of the gloves forms Butts's subtle critique of how English colonial ideology affects its valuation of the object, Trenchard's response to the smell also highlights his inability to empathize with the objects that surround him. Whereas the sisters' invasive control of the gloves suggests that they over-identify with these objects, Trenchard's willful alienation from them represents a gross detachment that drives him to his own insanity.
</p>

<p>
By focusing on the strange secretions of objects as forces that impinge upon the senses, Butts builds a modernism that emphasizes the permeability of both human and inanimate boundaries. In "With or Without Buttons," this movement across boundaries is depicted in the sisters' forceful attempt to alter Trenchard's acceptable range of imagoes and models for identification. However, the sisters do not fully understand their prank, which has taken on a life of its own that surpasses their intentions. The final blow delivered to Trenchard does not involve a glove, but a piece of "dark green cotton, dirty and torn," which literally attacks him, invading and staining his tongue and his mouth with its strange secretions . After the strange remnant is "dragged off" by the sisters, one is left to surmise that the unsightly fabric is actually a part of an old woman's undergarment, a petticoat. This petticoat, belonging to one dead Miss Blacken, had become a rather ubiquitous feature of village superstition, and the sisters use the story to fuel Trenchard's obsession. Significantly, the violation of space Trenchard experiences when this feminine delicacy wraps itself tightly around his head is not visual claustrophobia. "It was winding itself tight," he says. "But, oh God, it was the smell of it  . . . " . Trenchard responds to a shrinking of lived space where smell creates its own claustrophobia. In the special powers it holds over space, the tattered piece of fabric is elevated by Butts to the status of object <i>par excellence</i>. Not only is this object saturated with political and human meaning, its very objecthood represents a strange paradox for both the reader and the characters of "With and Without Buttons." It is 

<b></b>

important that both must work to identify the scrap of cloth as part of Miss Blacken's petticoat. The object is difficult to place but everything suggests that it is perfectly placed, with exceeding care, in its placelessness.

The power Butts confers on forgotten objects dignifies the unlovable or scrapped object, the Bachelardian refuse in the corner.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Throughout her work, Butts maps the distinction between the polish of the Parisian salon and the junkyard onto questions of gender and literary culture. Her critique of expatriate Paris is especially evident in <i>Armed with Madness</i>, for, according to the narrator's analogy, "If Paris is a lovely salon displayed for conversation, London is a lumber room to be foraged for junk, rubbish, white elephants, treasure" . Butts's irritation with the Parisian salon set coincides with Pound's, whose acidic poem denigrating salon life titles this section. Butts's embrace of the kitsch sensibility of junkiness she attributes to London "treasure" disparages Parisian salon culture as improperly owned and pretentiously "displayed," rather than ideally "placed."
</p>

<p>
Butts's 1932 story "From Alter to Chimney Piece" contains her most emblazoned attack on Parisian salon culture. According to Janet Lyon, the salon was "private" and "class-marked," a "pre-cursor to the public coffee house"; it "provided a forum for the enactment of ideal speech situations" at the same time that it "firmly controlled the directions speech might take."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  In the case of Butts's story, the author's criticism targets not the "enactment of ideal speech situations," but the controlled enactment of "ideal" spatial situations. The text indicts what it sees as a modernist establishment based on inherited financial security and social prestige, whose unfeeling authoritarian control of both lived and literary space renders that space meaningless. The story, which Butts originally began as the "Gertrude Stein Song," describes Stein's salon and the webs of sociability it both supported and spawned (<i>MB:SL</i>, 304). A nexus for the various affiliations that characterized expatriate modernist culture, it attracted such renowned friends as Hemingway and Picasso, while demanding a fierce loyalty and reverence for its legendary proprietor.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  The narrative itself follows a middle-aged English war-veteran whose obsession with a young American girl of questionable origin leads him to Stein, fictionally disguised as Miss Van Norden. Vincent, a bourgeois hanger-on with a lingering nostalgia for "high European life" follows his young American Cherry to Miss Van Norden's salon with some uneasiness, conscious that the girl will evaluate the success of his performance there in determining whether she will marry him.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  On one level, Vincent, like the other characters in the story, is the target of Butts's derisive pen. However, Butts privileges him through his ability to observe and reflect upon the 

<b></b>

odd formality of Miss Van Norden's "tea." After entering the salon, Vincent notices the visitors in "circulation" at an immaculately governed pace:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Exceedingly slowly they went, a flowing stream, turning their heads from left to right to look up at the celebrated collection of pictures, or down on to the tables, at books and manuscripts and <i>objets d'art</i>.

Butts's depiction of the room's tight order and self-conscious construction denies it the status of space. If Stein's salon, as Lyon has suggested, sought to cultivate "a collective visual aesthetic rooted in the act of scrutinizing [her] large collection of controversial anti-representational post-Impressionistic paintings," then Butts's story declares Stein's project a failure.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  According to Butts's critical eye, the seeing solicited by Stein's celebrated collection of pictures is ritualistic and rote, unimaginative and conditioned by socio-aesthetic training and tedious decorum. Butts describes an aesthetic code of behavior governed so strictly, a space so shrunken, that whatever action it creates is only valuable in its repetition. 
</p>

<p>
The passage at hand reminds one of <i>The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</i> and Stein's claim that she tended to seat famous painters in front of their own paintings so as to force some kind of self-recognition. The paintings do produce self-recognition in the sense that they elicit social insularity and paranoia. The visitors' revolution around the tables yields only the sight of their counterparts' backs; Butts's criticism exposes the salon, ostensibly frequented as a room for looking, as it cultivates a paranoid fear of looking&#x02014;at other people. In stark contrast to the house in "With or Without Buttons," which opens itself to the world, this illustrious chamber possesses objects that do not perform their proper functions. Rather than expanding the self to encourage collective looking and empathic spectatorship in Worringer's sense, the items on display lack sufficiently critical recipients. Like the museum in "In Bloomsbury," the look elicited by these paintings does not free the self from its confines. In other words, Stein's salon forbids empathy. The room refuses attachment, and Vincent commits an egregious faux pas when he tries to speak to Cherry from <i>across</i> the long table, and even more shockingly, "when he anchored himself with a bun and more tea in a dim corner" as a stranger and an observer (252, 253). Considering the pride Stein took in her inventive seating patterns, Vincent's self-appointed action of seating himself violates the taboos that produce the anonymity and neatness of a void.

Conclusion: Object Lessons
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Because he indelicately locates himself as a point in space that others must notice and navigate around, even if he does only sit in the corner, Vincent's action is over-familiar, if not invasive. From the viewpoint of the salon set, he values himself as 

<b></b>

highly as the art objects that comprise the only other fixed points of attraction in the room. His perverse movement depreciates the value of the room, since seating oneself comprises one of the first steps in inhabiting it, or transforming it into lived space. In Butts's stories, this absence of lived space, characterized by a detachment that denies the objects on display any connection to the human world, evidences failures of both intimacy and empathy. Butts thus identifies the emptiness of a form of observation that is both affectively detached and disinterested. More specifically, she critiques an aesthetic decorum that attempts to separate the aesthetic realm from lived space, and which furthermore views this spatial etiquette as productive of some advanced degree of sociability. The assortment of hallowed paintings is placed too rigidly, and according to Butts, solidifies Stein's own great personality. It does not promote empathy, which results from an engaged form of perception that respectfully affirms the existence of the object and simultaneously places it. This understanding of empathy departs from many accounts in contemporary criticism and particularly queer theory which maintain that objects must be elusive or even "disappeared," must lack private grounding, in order to avoid their inevitable reification. In contrast, writers such as Butts emphasize the lessons that can be learned from the visible appearance and ethical ownership of objects.
</p>

<p>
Among these lessons is one about the inner lives of objects, which, like humans, possess interiors that they communicate through a phenomenological grounding <i>beside</i> each other. This sense of profile decenters the subject as the repository of a hidden psychology lodged within its secret recesses. Rather, empathy offers an opening into the external world that extends beyond individual psychology, subjectivity, and personality. As a result, Butts's work allows us to view a concept that has traditionally been claimed for humanism, such as empathy, from a post-humanist perspective. Whereas a humanist version of empathic exchange tends to see it as a transfer of subjectivity, Butts's literal profile of the object-world suggests that empathy is more a matter of surfaces&#x02014;"as pleasant as petal or silk" (not heart-wrenching or agonizing or self-involving).<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Empathy is not merely a matter of sentiment or psychological involvement, nor does it result from an attempt to possess or infiltrate the external world. Instead, Butts constantly negotiates the ethical and spatial distance that protects the integrity of the object without disregarding private possession altogether. As an alternative to the exclusivity of private ownership, her work advocates a mode of private possession where the relationships between subjects and objects are ultimately social, attached rather than detached, arising counter-intuitively through the precise placement of each object in relation to its surrounding world. This version of modernism both affiliates itself with and departs from the more masculinely inspired modernisms of Pound and Lewis. A more reflexive and ethically self-conscious version of Pound's imagism, Butts's modernism affirms the proximity of subject and object, dispelling identity in favor of a more soluble sense of self.

Douglas Mao correctly asserts that modernism's well-known "antipathy to the commodity" has too frequently driven critical treatments of the modernist object, especially since the publication of Andreas Huyssen's <i>After the Great Divide: Modernism, Mass Culture, Postmodernism</i> (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986).

One such theoretical argument is exemplified by John Paul Ricco's <i>The Logic of the Lure</i> (Chicago, IL: Chicago University Press, 2002)<i>,</i> a text which unites a queer theory that contests identity politics with the discipline of art history. As an attempt to offer an alternative to a theoretic practice that distinguishes too stringently between subject and object, this text explores the "middle grounds" of sociality, or "forms of sociability that do not require an object to either identify with or against in order to be viable" . Within Ricco's new "queer sex space theory," any form of phenomenological grounding ultimately acts as a device for the "circumscription or delimitation of space," inevitably reifying that object . As a response, Ricco advances the notion of a queer "disappeared aesthetics," which enforces the difficulty of determining "artifactuality, authorial presence, even form and content" (ibid). While I support Ricco's defense of a public sex culture of "passing intimacies" and "local encounters" against the communitarians who pathologize it, I wonder how the premised disappearance of the object acts less as an ethics of apprehending the object than as a dismissal of it.

I have modified Bowlby's statement slightly, which appears in her collection of essays on Virginia Woolf, <i>Feminist Destinations and Further Essays on Virginia Woolf</i> (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1997).

I would suggest that Woolf's fiction, and Butts's, for that matter, laments the loss of fixed points of affective attachment that dispel rather than solidify identity, a concept that neither writer demonstrates interest in affirming.

Butts compared herself explicitly to both Eliot and Lewis. While Eliot himself was not an admirer of Butts's writing, Butts professed in a 1927 journal entry that Eliot's work had been "before her," and, in a move typical of the self-aggrandizing alliances she frequently drew, stressed the similarity of their projects: "T. S. Eliot . . . the only writer of my quality, dislikes me and my work, I think. But what is interesting is that he is working on the Sanc-Grail, on its negative side, the Waste Land" (<i>MB:SL</i> 186).

For example, critics such as Daniel Tiffany argue that Pound often semantically inverts our general conceptions of subjectivity and objectivity, particularly as the terms relate to emotion and detachment, respectively. In <i>Radio Corpse: Imagism and the Cryptaesthetic of Ezra Pound</i> (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1995), Tiffany suggests that the "'objective' image in particular raises interesting questions, since it emerges from a state of possession, an emotional seizure that Pound terms a 'vortex'" . Furthermore, Tiffany stresses that the 'objectivity' of the Image occurs not by purging emotion, but through the agency of emotion" . Following Tiffany's claim, I suggest that Pound's empirical relation to the image or the object incorporates the human, as opposed to blockading it.

Mao identifies this conflict specifically in regard to Virginia Woolf and sees it as having been engendered by writing "which may outlive its author and evade the author's intentions yet seem to speak nonetheless . . . " (<i>SO:MTP</i>, 56). This writing makes it difficult to "live the belief that meaning resides only in relations between subjects, never within the thing itself or the realm of Being" (<i>SO:MTP</i>, 56). I argue here that Butts's version of empathy synthesizes the difference between these two situations.

Woolf uses the term to describe a phenomenological mood that the perceived object calls into being. This phenomenological ground is not always stable but is subject to various shifts. At this particular moment in the essay, Woolf describes a dwarf who enters a shoe store, accompanied by two women of "normal" proportions. By presenting the shopkeeper with her beautiful and "aristocratic" foot, the dwarf "changed the mood," having "called into being an atmosphere which, as we followed her out into the street, seemed actually to create the humped, the twisted, the deformed" .

However much Butts appears to render suspect the classical trappings of plot by confusing the reader and her characters about what "really" happens in the story, she does tend to create plot according to the model Peter Brooks identifies in <i>Reading for the Plot: Design and Intention in Narrative</i> (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1984). Following Tzvetan Todorov, Brooks claims that plot "is constituted in the tension of two formal categories, difference and resemblance" . In Butts's story the serial appearance of the gloves creates the plot; their simultaneous similarity and difference organize the space of the story. As Brooks observes, this "same-but-different" narrative presents temporal form according to an "implicitly spatial" model .

While one sister in the story controls the narration, at the beginning it is not clear which one it is. In accordance with a style of narration that reduces the potency of the individualized "character," the pronouns "us" and "we" take center stage as the story unfolds: "It was trying to get out anyhow, but if he had not irritated us and made us want to show off, we would not have made ourselves serviceable to it. And it was we who came off lightly" . The "we" here, which reads as if the narrator literally suffers from multiple personality disorder, resembles a royal we whose power lies in the fact that it is not an "I." Indeed, as the story progresses, the sisters appear unable to operate independently. This confusion of identity functions as a means of enhancing their impersonal power, which develops through their de-individuation.

This essay, excerpted from a larger study of queer optimism, extends a delineation, if not exegesis, of the myriad smiles found in the poetry of Hart Crane. The sheer multitude of Crane's poetic smiles is only slightly less extraordinary than the fact that these smiles have hitherto been so cursorily (if not dismissively) broached by an otherwise sophisticated and burgeoning tradition of Crane scholarship. Extant critical engagements of Crane's smiles have seemed cursory to the extent that they have seldom taken Crane's smiles <i>as such</i>, but have instead swiftly co-opted them into either neutralizing temporal registers (the nostalgically preterite or untenably futural), or apposite (but by no means equivalent) affective categories. Exemplary of such co-optation is Eric Sundquist's conflation of smiles and smirks, although the smirk appears in only one of Crane's poems: "Lodged throughout Crane's poetry in enigmatic postures of martyred comedy, the 'smirk' or 'smile' . . . has always the questionable status which Freud assigns to the joke. . . . "<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Although smiles are indeed "lodged," enigmatically, "throughout Crane's poetry," Sundquist's analysis is misleading, if not apprehensive, in its dependence on an equivalence between smiling and smirking&#x02014;an equivalence that Crane's poetry, taken on its own terms, cannot support. Exemplary also is Sundquist's presumption that a Cranian smile, when not smirking, is the screen for a more interesting or authentic emotional state: "What is concealed by these smiling fa&#x000E7;ades is a prophetic suffering. . . . "<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Why presume the indistinguishability of smiles and smirks? Why presume that a smile not only is a fa&#x000E7;ade, but a fa&#x000E7;ade for suffering? What does it say about Crane scholarship, and criticism more generally, that a smile, critically speaking, so seldom is allowed to be a smile? As such questions suggest, my subject in this essay is not only Crane's poetry, but also the specific manner in which this poetry has been understood and misunderstood. If this essay arises out of an interest in queer optimism, it likewise arises in a frustration with the sorts of critical pessimisms that would disallow a smile's being taken seriously&#x02014;without its renomination as smirk or fa&#x000E7;ade, without its imbrication with some more authentic mode of suffering. More simply put: I wish to take Crane's smiles seriously.
</p>

<p>
To the extent that I imagine this essay as an exercise in queer optimism, I should at the outset clarify that my interest lies primarily in how Crane's poetry has been received by queer criticism. Crane's profound importance to such criticism might register, in shorthand, in the fact that two of Crane's earliest and most innovative queer readers, Tim Dean and Lee Edelman, have since become important and prolific contributors to the field of queer theory. That Sundquist's ostensibly non-queer scholarship would be susceptible to the same limitations as queer Crane criticism (and, I elsewhere argue, queer theory more generally) importantly indicates that a resistance to something like Crane's smiles&#x02014;or a critical suspicion of something like optimism&#x02014;is not a uniquely queer blind-spot. The resonances between queer and non-queer responses to Crane's smiles would be all but irrelevant, were I not myself committed, in the end, to positing a particular intervention in queer theory. For instance, queer theory's fetishization of self-shattering, inaugurated in Leo Bersani's 1987 essay "Is the Rectum a Grave?," has inspired if not monopolized most queer readings of Crane. Such readings take Crane's biographical suicide, or notorious poetic failure, or no less notorious textual difficulty, as paradigmatic of queer self-dissolution. This essay seeks to extricate Crane from narratives of <i>jouissance</i> and self-destruction. As I will argue in a subsequent section of this essay, the non-acknowledgement of Crane's smiles within Crane criticism significantly dovetails with a similar non-acknowledgement in the work of Bersani and Michel Foucault. Crane's smiles provide not only a problematic that the work of Bersani or Foucault cannot sufficiently address, but also a site from which to elaborate upon and supplement an already available queer vocabulary. This is not at all to say that I'm using Crane as the occasion for making a purely theoretical argument. Rather, I hope to recover in Crane what criticism thus far has overlooked. Such a recovery, as I imagine it, would involve a differently conceived optimism, the consequences and possibilities of which would extend beyond the purview of queer theory and speak to any person who, like myself, might be inclined to imagine smiles, or optimism, as sites of critical interest&#x02014;as opposed to sites of suspicion, conversion, or outright eschewal.
</p>

<p>
As the following section will make clear, optimism is not only my term, but Crane's. While it is indubitably counter-intuitive to apprehend optimism in the poetics of a suicidal alcoholic, Crane specifically invokes optimism in his correspondence, nearly as incessantly as his poems invoke smiles. Again, like Crane's smiles, this optimism has not yet been given due critical attention. Optimism, like smiles, seems to elicit a kind 

<b></b>

of critical nervousness, literalized in Christopher Nealon's account of Crane in <i>Foundlings: Lesbian and Gay Historical Emotion Before Stonewall</i>. Nealon's book, which dexterously situates Crane's difficult poetry alongside the differently difficult genres of physique magazines and lesbian pulp fiction, further intimates Crane's importance for conceptions of history or personality beyond Crane's own immediate modernist context. My reservations with Nealon's analysis are local, as are my reservations with Sundquist's: this is to say that my engagement with these and other scholars does not question their diverse interests and contributions to their respective fields. Having said that, Nealon's treatment of Crane's optimism&#x02014;which, as the next section addresses, Crane himself cultivated in response to the pessimism he perceived in the work of T. S. Eliot&#x02014;seems heuristically limited, analogous to Sundquist's foreclosure of smiles as a priori smirked, or fa&#x000E7;ade. Following an analysis of the final section of T. S. Eliot's <i>The Waste Land</i>, Nealon writes thus: " . . . Eliot's poem handily illuminates some key differences between his poetic grasp of history and Crane's&#x02014;and not the reductive difference between some poetic 'pessimism' of Eliot's and Crane's 'optimism,' however Crane himself might have imagined the difference that way."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Nealon's framing of optimism and pessimism in quotation marks might simply denote that optimism and pessimism are Crane's particular terms&#x02014;as indeed they are. The work of the quotation marks would seem nearly superfluous, however, since Nealon immediately explains that these are the terms in which Crane "imagine[s] the difference" between Eliot's poetics and his own. Emphatically signaling the extent to which Crane's terms are not Nealon's own, Nealon's quotation marks function as scare-quotes. In this regard, the quotation marks reenact the a priori reductiveness, for Nealon, of Crane's terms&#x02014;qualified in the manner other scholars might qualify "reality" or "natural" as dubious if not ideologically suspect. Because Nealon is able to find a difference between Eliot and Crane putatively more interesting than the one Crane himself articulates, he seems willing gingerly to allow Crane his insistence on optimism. But admitting Crane's optimism seems a strange critical move, not incommensurate, for instance, with admitting Eliot's anti-Semitism. Nealon's accommodation of Crane's optimism amounts to a polite ignorance of it. Scare-quotes recapitulate, consolidate, an imputed reductiveness that goes without saying. This essay suspends this presumption of reductiveness; frees optimism from scare-quotes; investigates how Crane's sense of optimism bears on his poetry's intense proliferation of intensely unfamiliar smiles.

Affirming Certain Things
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
In letters coterminous with much of the <i>White Buildings</i> poems, Crane describes his poetic project as a departure from the pessimism of T. S. Eliot. In the context of his poetry's difficulties, Crane's epistolary descriptions of his poetic optimism are tantalizingly intelligible. In a 1922 letter to Allen Tate, Crane writes that "one <i>does</i> have joys" (emphasis in original) and that "the vocabulary of damnations and prostrations has been developed at the expense of these other moods . . . so that it is hard to dance in proper measure."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  In a letter written to Gorham Munson in January 1923, Crane 

<b></b>

identifies this vocabulary of "prostrations" as T. S. Eliot's. "I take Eliot as a point of departure," Crane writes, "toward an almost complete reverse of direction. His pessimism is amply justified, in his own case. But I would apply as much of his erudition and technique as I can absorb and assemble toward a more positive, or (if [I] must put it so in a sceptical [sic] age) ecstatic goal. . . . All I know through very much suffering and dullness (sometimes I seem to twinge more all the time) is that it interests me to still affirm certain things" (<i>LHC</i>, 114&#x02013;5 [5 January 1923]).
</p>

<p>
Crane's letter to Munson designates at least two important components of this "complete reverse" of Eliot's pessimism. Crane's positive, here, denotes not only the positive outlook of more familiar conceptions of optimism ("one <i>does</i> have joys"), but more peculiarly implies the imbrication of this recognition of happiness with a commitment to recognition more generally. The positive of Crane's anti-pessimism invokes not only the smiles of positive affect, but a stranger smile of positivity, if positivity is taken to signal a certain receptivity to fact. Crane's positive predisposes him "to still affirm certain things." The litany of smiles in Crane's poetry indicates an affirmation of joy, but also an affirmation that smiles <i>are </i>"certain things." The smiles of Crane's poetry resemble the smile of the Cheshire cat, which outlasts the cat, and seems not only to have its own autonomy, but ontologically to constitute the cat itself. Crane's poetic project, then, involves not only a recuperation of optimism (i.e. the idea that optimism, as much as Eliotic pessimism, could yield, say, truth or beauty), but a recuperation of the unequivocal objectness of the positive.
</p>

<p>
Positive, for Crane, is not equivalent to ecstatic. Ecstasy might describe the first component of Crane's project ("one does have joys"), but not the second. Ecstasy, like <i>jouissance</i> or masochism, teeters between joy and pain; ecstasy lets pessimists eat their pain-cake and have it, too. Crane's positive, on the other hand, is non-ecstatic, which is to say unequivocal. <i>The fact of having joys, within this poetics, is inextricable from the joy of having facts ("to still affirm certain things").</i> Ecstasy, in Crane's letter, amounts not to the apotheosis of positive feeling, but the mistranslation of positive feeling for an age whose skepticism would distrust that feeling's self-commitment.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Crane's attempt to save joy (and no less radically, to save affirmation) from the demands of skepticism instances one of the most singularly important and as yet unacknowledged contributions made by Crane, to both poetry <i>and </i>criticism. To look ahead to this essay's own horizon, Crane's is an attempt I not only trace, but attempt to extend, as both vocabulary and possible practice.
</p>

<p>
About halfway through Hart Crane's 1926 book of poems, <i>White Buildings</i>, and without recognizable reason, Crane's poems begin registering the peculiar affective fact of a smile. "Possessions" ends with the line "All but bright stones wherein our smiling plays."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>   The first stanza of "Lachrymae Christi" ends with the "sluice" of "one unyielding smile" (<i>CP</i>, 19), and the poem itself ends with "Thy/Unmangled target smile" (<i>CP</i>, 20). The speaker of the next poem asks of another re, "Why are you back here&#x02014;smiling an iron coffin" (<i>CP</i>, 21)? And the speaker of the next poem, "The Wine Menagerie," directs the reader to "[r]egard the forceps of the smile that takes her (<i>CP</i>, 23)," and later, invokes a time when "my blood dreams a receptive smile . . . " 

<b></b>

(<i>CP</i>, 24). The smiles of <i>White Buildings</i> continue, from "this much-exacting fragment smile" ("Recitative," <i>CP</i>, 25) to "stenographic smiles" ("For the Marriage of Faustus and Helen," <i>CP</i>, 26), the "counted smile of hours and days" ("Voyages IV," <i>CP</i>, 37), "[o]ne frozen trackless smile" ("Voyages V," <i>CP</i>, 38), and "[t]hat smile unsearchable repose" ("Voyages VI," <i>CP</i>, 39). This proliferation of smiles demands to be read, if only because such repetitions suggest a trace of intention, an entry into meaning, within poems which otherwise seem ruthlessly opaque. With each poem read, and each smile added to the collection, it seems all the more evident that Crane is up to something.
</p>

<p>
The unequivocality of these smiles results in their seeming ponderously nonmetaphorical, in a poetics that seems nothing if not metaphorical. Following Lee Edelman, we could say that Crane's metaphoricity is more precisely catachrestic, and that catachresis in Crane often operates at the level of the adjective.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  For instance, Crane writes of "tendoned loam," ("Lachrymae Christi," <i>CP</i>, 20) and "inventive dust" ("For the Marriage of Faustus and Helen," <i>CP</i>, 27). Loam and dust are resuscitated through adjectives that pull their respective nouns toward some new form. In the case of the former, loam acquires the taut architecture of a body; in the latter, dust acquires the potential inventiveness to become nearly anything. The adjectives appended to Crane's smiles, as already listed, include "unyielding," "unmangled," "frozen" and "trackless." Whereas loam and dust are adjectivally torqued into alterior shapes, smiles are adjectivally stabilized. Adjectives do not transform smiles into something else, or even describe their particularity, so much as insist (strangely, tautologically) upon a certain unbudgeability. This unbudgeability is itself catachrestic in an emblematically Cranian way, insofar as smiles, ordinarily, are definitionally short-lived. In any given situation, a smile becomes less convincing, the longer it is held.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Real smiles, ordinarily, are quick glimmers. Not in Crane. Ironically, the Cheshire-positivity of Crane's smiles makes them difficult to hold onto, even as they aspire, in their resilience, toward being held.
</p>

<p>
The relation between the optimism adduced in Crane's letters and the smiles littered through Crane's poetry is hardly self-evident. While it is uncontroversial to imagine optimism and smiles as situated in each other's vicinity, to extrapolate from vicinity any account of causality (e.g. one smiles if one is happy, one is happy if one is optimistic) or synecdochal identity (smiles in Crane's poetry signal condensed shorthand for optimism) presumes from the get-go that we know how Crane's smiles and optimism operate when in fact the poems present a version of smiling that is anything but familiar. For instance: ordinarily, a smile exists within a slender window of opportunity&#x02014;because a smile is short-lived, it most often comes on the immediate heels of what it is a response to. Or failing that, a smile comes on the heels if not of the event, then the recollection of the event.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Many of Crane's smiles, by contrast, follow no such logic.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Such a logic seems inapplicable to Crane's poetics in part because the event, as a component of his lyric poems, is so much subordinated to the exigencies of his thick, catachrestic style. Crane's style <i>is </i>the event, and in this regard, if smiles indicate an affective response, they are responses not to what the poems describe, but to the poems' style as such. Affect, within Crane's writing, is no more beholden to protocols of intelligibility than is, for instance, speaker or narrative. These smiles are confusing, 

<b></b>

then, because they are at least nominally identifiable even as their contexts are not. And furthermore, their adjectival modifiers don't specify the qualities of the smiles, but rather specify non-fungible duration, before the poetry has disclosed what the smiles are non-fungible or durable in relation to. Take, for example, the first stanzas of "Lachrymae Christi:"

Joseph Riddel's influential essay, "Hart Crane's Poetics of Failure" usefully illustrates how such smiles have otherwise been read. "Lachrymae Christi," Riddel notes, "moves from smile to smile through the agony of sacrifice and tears, and ends in the ecstatic moment of anticipated self-transcendence."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Indeed, the poem <i>does </i>move from smile to smile. Its last stanza reads, 
</p>

<p>
For Riddel, Crane's poetry is bound between the insufficiency of words that could never rise beyond their worldly limits, and the impossibility of words that could do his poetic vision justice. As such, Riddel converts (I would venture <i>yields </i>and <i>mangles) </i>this poem's smiles into respective instantiations of the insufficient and the impossible. This conversion effectively wipes the smiles from the poem's face. The first smile ("its one unyielding smile"), Riddel claims, "is the blank expressionlessness of a sterile world . . . " ("PF," 487).For Riddel, that is, "unyielding" is equivalent to a sort of obdurateness that disqualifies the smile from expression. To imagine the sterile world as blankly expressionless is to perform a personification devised to shut itself down.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, Riddel nullifies the second smile ("Thy/ unmangled target smile") by deferring it as "a vision of wholeness anticipated in the moment of fragmentation . . . " ("PF," 487). More emphatically, Riddel later claims that the "smile of Dionysus . . . is not an achieved and communicated vision in the poem; it is the ecstasy of anticipated 

<b></b>

fulfillment" ("PF," 491). In claiming this unmangled smile as "anticipated," Riddel defers it to some unspecified future. The smile can't be reached, in part, because Riddel's Crane can't reach it without sacrificing himself on the altars of that "vision of wholeness" ("PF," 487).<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  To reach wholeness, one first has to endure obliteration. Riddel directs his reader to "the crucial passage from <i>The Birth of Tragedy</i>," which would underwrite this necessity of deontologization: " . . . [T]ragic myth, through the re of the hero [i.e. the poet] delivers us from our avid thirst for earthly satisfaction and reminds us of another existence and a higher delight. For this delight the hero readies himself, not through his victories but through his undoing" ("PF," 477). Crane's Dionysus, however, is not necessarily identical to the Dionysus of <i>The Birth of Tragedy</i>. The passage that Riddel quotes from Nietzsche concludes that "[b]y virtue of this noble deception [of tragedy] it is now able to move its limbs freely in dithyrambic dance and to yield without reserve to an orgiastic abandon. . . . "<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Orgiastic abandon or, as Crane writes in his letter to Allen Tate, "dance in proper measure"? Riddel's argument for "Lachrymae Christi's" ecstasy depends on the poem's smiles being read in dialectical opposition, the terms of which, while readily importable from Nietzsche, seem less than immediate in the poem itself. I want to stump here for the possibility of smiles being purposively unyielding/unmangleable, but also for the extent to which Crane himself seems interested in a reiterative, accumulative network of smiles, not only in this poem, but in the poems of <i>White Buildings</i> by which it is bordered. Read serially, the smiles of <i>White Buildings</i> not only ask not to be discounted or transformed, but ask, with all the contested eloquence of a writer wanting to counter Eliot's pessimistic project, what it would mean to take smiles seriously as both unyielding rhetorical and affective phenomena. This isn't to say that Crane necessarily knew how to answer his own question. Riddel, in only a slightly different context, cedes as much: "Crane's poems do often achieve a constellated structure of recurrent images&#x02014;the curve and circle imagery of <i>The Bridge</i> for example&#x02014;but what kind of vision these manifest patterns represent is, to say the least, ambiguous. Surely it is more something desired than something possessed and known . . . "("PF," 476).
</p>

<p>
To return to "Lachrymae Christi," the poem's title connotes both the tears Jesus weeps upon being crucified, and a brand of sweet wine named Lachrymae Christi. Getting drunk and getting crucified are two ways of imagining a body in throes (though it may be useful to recall that intoxication as often conjures the idiom of being plastered as it does being sloshed, or smashed; and that being plastered isn't necessarily the precondition to being smashed, but its own state). Also, moonlight, here, is conceived as the solvent benzine, as though to become visible under the moon were to become susceptible to erasure. The poem's last lines&#x02014;"Thy face/ From charred and riven stakes, O/ Dionysus, Thy/ unmangled target smile"&#x02014;clinch the reading of the poem offered by Thomas Yingling, which (in concert with Riddel's reading) argues that "the dismembered body is for Crane the eroticized body carried to its logical extreme . . . But perhaps we ought to take the poem's closing image as a re for textuality itself, one that suggests the importance of a dismembered text."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Perhaps we ought to recall, however, that we are met in these lines not by a dismembered body, but by a disembodied face. And that the face signals not the dissolution of Dionysiac frenzy but rather a counterintuitively non-bachannalian "unmangled[ness]." This unmangleability forms a frame with the first stanza's "unyielding." The poem counters its dismantling energies with an intense valuation of the non-dismantleable. Benzine, after all, might be capable of dissolving other solutions, but solvency is itself comprised of bonds between carbon and hydrogen. The CH groups of benzine (and of the Cheshire cat) reappear in the CH of "lachrymae" and "christi," as well as the first stanza's "machinery," the last stanza's "charred," and elsewhere through the poem ("chant," "chime," "unstenched"). The proliferation of CHs posits an elemental integrity that is inextricable from a poem otherwise read solely for its thematization of breakage. Inside the machinery of the poem is a tacit insolubility, whose initials, as though held up to a mirror, are the initials of Crane himself. Along these lines, the poem's smiles not only evince the intransigence of the CH, but are registers of intransigence. Smiling, in this poem and others, does not describe delight, or for that matter any other affect, but rather describes durability itself.

The Smile of Prufrock
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Crane's first book experiments with a smile's durability at the expense of the personal relations that might produce it. These experiments are a direct response to the more personalized, but (or "and therefore") degradable smiles that surprisingly litter T. S. Eliot's first book of poems. <i>Prufrock and Other Observations</i>  contains twelve poems, and these poems invoke nine smiles. Eliot's smiles designate possibilities that have been either foreclosed, or almost eschatologically deferred, and as such their mode is emphatically subjunctive. Eliot's poem, "Portrait of a Lady" ends with the question "And should I have the right to smile?" which reiterates both Prufrock's question "Would it have been worthwhile,/ To have bitten off the matter with a smile," and the futural formulation of the book's last poem, "La ia che Piange:"
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
So I would have had him leave, <br />
So I would have had her stand and grieve, <br />
So he would have left <br />
As the soul leaves the body torn and bruised, <br />
As the mind deserts the body it has used. <br />
I should find  <br />
Some way incomparably light and deft, <br />
Some way we both should understand, <br />
Simple and faithless as a smile and shake of the hand.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
The stanza's anaphoric "so" posits the first set of actions as causal (I have him leave so that she grieves) or analogous (just as I have him leave, I have her grieve) without specifying a preference for either. Similarly, the next anaphoric "as" describes a relation between events that is neither precisely narrative nor analogous (do soul and mind 

<b></b>

leave the body at the same time, or in the same way?). This collapse of modes converts romantic (i.e. causal/narrative) crisis into a series of poetic (i.e. analogous) relations&#x02014;a conversion apparent even in the imposition within the scene of this orchestrating "I," who arranges the other two res (him and her) as an author arranges characters. 
</p>

<p>
From this series of postulations (I would have done this, and this, he would have done that) in the past, the stanza switches registers not to what the poem's "I" <i>should have</i> done, or what he does, but to what he "should" do. That is, the second half of the stanza doesn't provide an alternative to the sets of possibilities already adduced (which is how a "should" following a "would" might ordinarily be understood), but seems rather to introduce a distinctly separate, if obliquely related, system of contingency. The stanza's system of subjunctives delineates a temporal zone of contingent past and contingent future that skips over anything like a present. In this crowd of persons that could (but don't necessarily) leave, and should (but don't necessarily) come together, the smile and the handshake govern as liminal res that constantly write themselves to the point of being unwritten.
</p>

<p>
The formulation beginning "So I would have had him leave . . . " worries the relation between persons by suspending accounts of how personal motivations are related (narratively/causally, analogously/synchronically). The stanza's last lines, on the other hand, question neither the temporal nor the rhetorical conditions of persons and their actions, but rather the terms of the very moment of interpersonal connection. (Even as "the very moment" is to be understood as qualified by the force of "should"&#x02014;this is not a moment that is happening, but that might happen, were it not for any number of unspecified intervening factors.) Taken on their own, the "smile and shake of the hand" would in fact seem to designate simple ways of understanding&#x02014;one thinks, for instance, of all the smiling and handshaking Eliot must have executed in 1917, the year both of his book publication and the beginning of his career at Lloyd's Bank. The "way" understanding is demonstrated, however, is as dangerous as it is simple. The smile and handshake form a contract between persons ("let's shake on it"), which their ascribed faithlessness would seem to void. And yet are both persons privy to the smile's faithlessness, or is faithlessness the prerogative only of the poem's "I"? It is unclear within the stanza to whom "we both" even refers (e.g. two people, or three?), or to what understanding they are coming, or to what end this understanding is staked. What difference would it make, for example, if "I should find" or not find this way of marking mutual recognition? Eliot's smile is the simultaneous beginning and end of loyalty, emerging as reparation after the leave-taking of a lover ("As the soul leaves the body torn and bruised"), when in fact reparation counts only as the grounds for future betrayal, governed by contingencies which seem not to matter, in part because the terms of understanding are so jeopardized from the start.
</p>

<p>
Within this epistemological muddle, the questions of "Prufrock" and "Portrait of a Lady" resonate darkly. <i>Would it have been worth while to have bitten off the matter with a smile? Should I have the right to smile?</i> Even if the former Prufrockian smile weren't faithless, but productive of an engagement with the world that wasn't undermining, the question of worth would be unanswerable if not irrelevant, because 

<b></b>

this sort of engagement remains suspended as an unexecutable possibility. Or rather, Prufrock's evaluation of action's worth displaces the more operative question as to whether Prufrock could actually have engaged the world in such a way (he cannot), and so the smile is not Prufrock's (nor even a retroactively projected version of Prufrock), but belongs more precisely to a person that Prufrock cannot imagine, let alone emulate. Eliot's "Portrait of a Lady," on the other hand, mobilizes smiles not as visible traces of the unenvisionable, but as the enigmatic sign of the confusion of understanding, misunderstanding, and complacent ignorance. In its second section, the poem's titular lady observes a decidedly non-Prufrockian interlocutor:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
Now that lilacs are in bloom <br />
She has a bowl of lilacs in her room <br />
And twists one in her fingers while she talks. <br />
'Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know <br />

(Slowly twisting the lilac stalks) <br />
'You let it flow from you, you let it flow, <br />

And smiles at situations which it cannot see.' <br />

<p class="noIndent">
Like the faithless smile of "La ia che Piange," the smile of the cruel youth simultaneously affirms and undermines relation, by making a contract out of misrecognition. Smiling, the lady's companion makes good on the lady's charge (that youth is cruel), while turning not-seeing into its own (if not only) form of understanding. And in leaving unchallenged whether he in fact sees or doesn't see, the youth and his smile make indistinguishable the surfacial distinction between understanding and not caring. Thus, if the poem's final question, "should I have the right to smile" (<i>TSE:CP</i>, 12) lexically echoes Prufrock's, it nevertheless conjures not an unimaginable agency which might produce engagement (were agency itself less unimaginable), but rather a fantasy of ceding engagement. The right to smile, as smiling is defined by the poem, would amount to the right to contractual faithlessness&#x02014;the right not only to "not knowing what to feel or if I understand" (<i>TSE:CP</i>, 12), but more emphatically, the right not to care whether one knows or feels at all. Smiling, here, functions less as a register of affect, than as a substitute for affect.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  The stakes of Eliot's smiles involve an agreement against having stakes. Thus the smile that ends the poem "Morning at the Window" can hover and vanish without even seeming like lost possibility. Within Eliot's poetry, the smile as often as not designates the abdication of possibility (hence the uninterest, in "La ia che Piange," in distinguishing one form of contingency from another):

<p>
Insofar as Eliot's smiles seem related to each other if only by their consistent ironizing of what a smile could/should mean, their iterations within the book acquire the energy of a compulsion to repeat.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  In a poetry which (even at this early stage) privileges an ethics of impersonality, it isn't surprising that affect, and registers of affect, would be controverted as untrustable. This untrustability, of course, itself depends on affect being intelligible as operative within the domain of the personal. And indeed, within Eliot, it is. Smiles belong to persons who misemploy them for depersonalizing/estranging ventures; or emphatically don't belong to but are longed for by persons who would use smiles correctly if they weren't ontologically unviable; or don't belong, as in the stranger of "Morning at the Window," in ways that suggest the shedding of old skin, that in the velocity of the urban street a smile and its repertoires (ironic or non-ironic) would be obsolescent if not already obsolete.
</p>

<p>
As we have already seen, the smiles of <i>White Buildings</i> are more often than not deracinated from the axis of the personal, neither belonging nor not belonging to an individual, but rather cropping up, as it were, within the materials of the poem. Whereas the smiles of Eliot are scrutable throughout (if only as undoing the sorts of things of which a smile might otherwise be imagined capable), the smiles of Crane are emphatically not scrutable. Rather than adhere to persons, the smiles more often than not are asked to be read as commensurate with terms with which smiles seem initially non-coincident. For all their proliferation, Eliot's smiles don't add up&#x02014;because they are either too deferred or too disintegrated to be counted. Crane's smiles, by contrast, accumulate, take up space. And not just any space, but the space of rejected writing, writing explicitly used up to the extent that the event it commemorates is over. Such a space is conjured at the opening of Crane's great 1923 poem, "For the Marriage of Faustus and Helen:"

</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
The <i>heft</i> of the stenographic smiles&#x02014;the way in which even <i>shorthand</i> could litter streetcurbs&#x02014;angles toward the insistence with which Crane associates smiling with a weird form of solidity. As though durability as such weren't enough, the remaindered smiles that the poems precipitate are imagined as non-fluid.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  This oscillation within Crane's poetry between fluid and non-fluid (resonant enough in Crane's book-titles, <i>White Buildings, The Bridge, Key West, </i>which respectively signal the architecturally non-fluid, the architecture across water, the geography of water and island) is reflected in Crane criticism, whose trope of choice in describing fluidities in Crane's poetry is booze. R. P. Blackmur paradigmatically characterizes the language of "Lachrymae 

<b></b>

Christi" as "in the flux of intoxicated sense."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  He describes its principle of association (which Crane would later himself denominate the logic of metaphor) as "resembl[ing] the notion of wine . . . the notion of extra-logical, intoxicated metamorphosis of the senses [which both] controls and innervates Crane's whole sensibility" ("NT," 59&#x02013;60). To discuss Crane's poems as though liquor were both origin and constitutive energy conjures an especial problematic of intentional fallacy, in claiming that poetic meaning lies beyond the purview of the poem proper, but that meaning as such would speak in the slurs of a "rum-scallion" (<i>OML</i>, 226).<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  The conjoining in Crane (or at least in Crane criticism) of poetry and alcohol suggests one of Crane's consanguinities (to use one of Crane's words) with Whitman. Leaving booze and flux (of Crane, of Whitman) aside, there nonetheless exist moments in Crane in which the argot of flux seems acutely inapplicable. This is much less to say that flux isn't ubiquitous as a style throughout Crane's writing (it is), than that the poetry reacts against itself in decisive moments, and that the flotsam of these non-fluid formulations has a particular quality, and in especial relation to the lyric tide on which it washes up.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Before further engaging what strike me as unusually unfluid Cranian formulations, I want to specify the sort of poetic fluidity that seems most characteristically Cranian. First, though not necessarily most importantly, this fluidity is commensurate with what in Crane's writing is most unintelligible. Or rather, this fluidity marks the threshold beyond which Crane's most challenging formulations become jettisonable in their inscrutability. Past this point, the challenges of poetry whose meaning is always on the move (which is to say, elsewhere) seem nearly indistinguishable from those of poetry that won't budge. This radical opacity seems, in its inaccessibility, to force novel ways of engagement. If meaning, per se, can't be gleaned from these "new thresholds" of imperviousness, then how, meaning aside, do the formulations recall earlier formulations? What are the sounds of these words, and what is the ambiance of these sounds? This is to imply, at the risk of seeming tautological, that what seems to have become non-fluid in its impenetrability is itself a sort of liquid&#x02014;at least insofar as the cues solicited by these tough coinings would seem to recalibrate the hermeneutic project of understanding Crane as a sort of (Kristevan) semiotic. Being before language (Kristeva) and being after (Crane, with his rococo of Elizabethan jazz-age bricolage) amount to uncannily similar scenarios.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The almost (al)chemical shifts of state in Crane's poetry (Blackmur's "intoxicated metamorphoses") are a function, I've suggested, of what Crane calls his poetry's "logic of metaphor." John Irwin adroitly glosses Crane's formulations as being productive of "a continuing metaphor in which the tenor is taken for granted on the level of surface form while a series of vehicles drawn from different image networks are allowed to interact in order to create progressively more complex names [in the instance of 'Voyages'] for love."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  This sort of continuing metaphor "creates a medium that holds words in suspension, allowing them to interact in ways more complex and more numerous than any normal, unviolated structure . . . " ("HCLM," 215). In Irwin's reading, Crane's "adagios of islands" thus serves as exemplar of the logic of metaphor at work, and a re for the logic of metaphor itself, in which islands of lexical meaning could rise (or 

<b></b>

in the case of "Atlantis," sink) within "the ocean of love" ("HCLM," 214). The ocean of love, in this instance, would re the inscrutable-as-liquid, that which escapes logical explanation because it is beyond it, or that out of which explanations arise.
</p>

<p>
The logic of metaphor, as it is understood by both Crane and critics such as Irwin, enacts what might be imagined as a rhetoric of desire. Desire, that is, glossed as a fundamental relation to absence. One desires what one lacks, what one isn't, and along these lines, Crane's metaphorical vehicles persistently reach toward a tenor they can only begin to imagine. The logic of metaphor, thus formulated, requires of its readers a hermeneutic position that is also, acutely, an eroticized position: desire, here, calibrated to the level of rhetoric, of occluded, even botched, syntax: not only are Crane's poems about love (he describes, for instance, "Voyages" as a love poem for welkin-eyed sailor Emil Opffer), but they construct for the reader a structure whose inhabiting renders reading and desiring coincident practices. Along these lines, Crane's poetry, at its most fluid (which is to say, at its most characteristically difficult and analytic), not only seems to affirm conceptions of desire as elsewherebut also creates within itself a disciplining space in which "the ideal reader" would likewise construe the project of satisfaction as a practice of cultivating, even enjoying, deferral.
</p>

<p>
In his essay "General Aims and Theories," Crane singles out "Possessions" as a poem that cannot be technically explained, that must rely on its organic impacton the imagination to communicate its meaning: "In manipulating the more imponderable phenomena of psychic motives, pure emotional crystallizations, etc., I have had to rely even more on these dynamics of inferential mention, and I am doubtless still very unconscious of having committed myself to what seems nothing but obscurities to some minds. A poem like 'Possessions' really cannot be technically explained . . . ."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  While Crane himself thus notes "Possessions" as exemplary of a poem that demands for entry an emotional, as opposed to logical, mode of reading&#x02014;and thus, exemplary of a poem that would perform the sort of absented metaphorical tenor characteristic of what I imagine as Cranian reading-as-erotic-project, "Possessions" seems striking less for its hermeneutic difficulty than for its own internal reaction to that particular sort of difficulty. Within a poetics that construes desire as a rhetorical problem, that invokes emotion as the means, as much as the object of understanding, "Possessions" reformulates desire not only as an analytic of presence, rather than absence, but furthermore conceives its erotic immanence as extravagantly intractable. "Possessions," that is, revises the poetry's more pervasive notion of desire as a movement toward something else&#x02014;and even more egregiously, revises the notion of desire as self-shattering&#x02014;in imagining a presence-of-desire around which the poem's more equivocal terms and formulations circulate. This revision of desire itself depends on the poem's beguiling final line's "bright stones wherein our smiling plays."

<p>
While the syntactical and conceptual logistics of Crane's poem, "Possessions," remain perennially mystifying to Crane's readers, there nonetheless seems a sort of consensus among critics as to what the poem is about&#x02014;as though designating the subject of the poem, somehow, could organize or even decode local opacities which, taken on their own, or even collectively, remain insoluble. Critics as various as R. W. B. Lewis, Warner Berthoff, and Robert Martin agree that "Possessions" is about cruising.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Methodologically, such readings depend on a sort of excavatory hunch whereby the cruise at hand fundamentally is Hart's own, and whereby the poem's difficulty arises as a form, on Crane's part, of self-censorship. Such a hunch implies that Crane strategically mystifies the experience within the poem, so as to make it available only to those readers already in the know.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Such a reading grossly simplifies the subtleties of interaction/non-interaction glossed in the deceptively sleek denomination of cruising (cruiseboats, cruisemissiles; or more complicatingly, albeit no less etymologically related, the "crux" of crucifixion). Also, this reading implies, unhelpfully, that difficulty within the poem is something like phobic, self-proscribing response, additive to experience rather than constitutive of it; 

<b></b>

or constitutive not of the experience, but of its recounting. My reading of Crane's poem means to suggest that cruising is more complicated than the likes of Lewis, Berthoff, or Martin let on&#x02014;which is to say more interesting&#x02014;and that difficulty within the poem is thus as fundamental to its cruisy subject as to its style.
</p>

<p>
I mean here to address Blackmur's contention that Crane's poetry exonerates itself of referential obligation. "In a lesser poetry of the same order, and in poetry of different orders, words may only indicate or refer to or substitute for the feelings; then we have the poetry of vicarious statement, which takes the place of, often to the highest purpose, the actual complete presentation, such as we have here. Here there is nothing for the words to take the place of; they are their own life, and have an organic continuity, not with the poet's mind nor with the experience they represent, but with themselves"("NT," 57&#x02013;8). Blackmur's divorcing of words from what words might take the place of, however, becomes increasingly difficult to imagine in the context of cruising, which, like Crane's poetry, depends on so ornate and palimpsestic a semiotic. Cruising, understood as the elaborate choreography by which two strangers end up in relation, provides a somatic, interpersonal correlative to Crane's logic of metaphor. The intersection of erotic and poetic practice might be heard in Crane's exposition of the latter in a 1926 letter written to Harriet Monroe, if one substitutes "cruising" for terms such as "language," and "cruiser" for "reader" (even as a cruiser is nothing if not a reader, par excellence):

Cruising, like Crane's difficult poetics, is a pseudo-statement, the reception of which depends on the supply not of any clear explication but of "emotional connectives." And "Possessions," as Crane notes in his essay "General Aims and Theories," is exemplary of his difficult poems. That is, "Possessions" is both a poem about cruising, and an instantiation of a poetics nearly analogous to it. 
</p>

<p>
There are many smiles involved in cruising. First would be the smile across the room, or across the street. This, as a smile, is the drop of a fishing-line, the letter addressed to whomever receives it. This first smile communicates the cruiser's interest and availability; ideally, this smile meets with a smile that communicates a specular interest on the part of the other. If smile #1 is not met by smile #2, smile #1 may as well not have occurred. It is a tree falling in a forest without audience, and for it to be recognized without reciprocation amounts usually to embarrassment, but not to resignation of 

<b></b>

the smiling game. If smile #1 is reciprocated/reflected back by smile #2, then smiling escalates and intensifies. Faciality initially packaged as politesse&#x02014;in those opening cruising gambits, it is crucial that interest, if not reciprocated, can slink back into polite friendliness, in case lack of interest adheres also, say, to homophobic recoil&#x02014;ups its ante with cocked eyebrows and lambent lips. These smiles are a kind of bidder's stick, a silent opera of evaluation and contingent commitment, until the auction's deal is sealed. Cruising ceases to be cruising when smiles and their gestural extensions cede to words. Once two people are talking, the cruise qua cruise is complete.
</p>

<p>
"Possessions" suggests the stratagems of a cruise in its capacity to cover its own tracks. Erotic innuendo, intense volley of ocular exchange, depends on the initial registration of a glance; what Crane, in his letter to Harriet Monroe, calls "emotional connectives." Failing these connectives, Crane cedes, the poem will remain closed to its reader. The text can't guarantee its being understood (any more than Crane, walking the dark docks, can guarantee a hookup) so much as guarantee its ever (potentially occluded) availability. The poem signals this perpetual availability in its opening imperative, "Witness now this trust!" What trust? What is one witnessing? The object of the reader's gaze, at this point, seems less clear than the terms under which this gaze operates. First, witnessing presupposes a relation that is at least minimally dialectical&#x02014;to bear witness requires at least he who sees, and what/who is seen. Second, witnessing presumes (for its Austinian felicitousness) the synchronicity of the act of witnessing and the event that is witnessed. It is the fact that the witness sees (as opposed to remembers or retroactively elucidates) that authorizes what has been witnessed. Each time a reader turns to "Possessions," he is bearing witness before knowing what he is seeing. As witness, he authorizes ("this trust!") before he understands. The poem might "be" about a cruise. More eerily, the poem picks up the reader faster than "this trust" becomes a tryst. Faster, indeed, than "witness now" melts into "white as snow."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  The "he" that transforms "witness" into "w(h)it(e)ness" is both the subject and the object of Crane's cruise.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  He energizes the poem by being both simultaneously possessed and eluded.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to this flickering "he," the smiles of the poem's final line seem acutely immanent. Such is the effect of their being bound to "bright stones," although how the stones and smiles are related remains unclear. "Wherein," as a preposition, would seem to describe relation, but what does it mean to imagine an inside to a rock? (This is a question to which Crane will return, three years later, in "Island Quarry.") Are we talking geodes? Or a sort of stony crypt? Or might "wherein" refer not to a literal interiority, but to a stone's reflective surface, as when one speaks of objects "in" a mirror? Regardless, these particular scenarios seem to indicate a realm in which smiles are preserved at the expense of being removed. But then how can smiles in individual stones play? Does each smile live in its own stone? Are stones shared? Are the stones bright because illuminated by the smile, like a face's blush? Do smiles play with each other, or by themselves? Is playing an active enterprise, as in games, or an incessant reeling, like the play of a radio? The poem's cryptic final line mobilizes these problems of relationality, interiority, and agency, which smiling occasions, even if not critically engages.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
These smiles, clearly enough, are no longer the smiles of a cruise, cruisily as this poem begins. They obliquely conjure a much stranger terrain. Most readings of "Possessions" claim that its concluding vision is one of ecstasy. Tim Dean, for example, writes that these last lines "go beyond sex to a different kind of intensity," red as "ecstatic transcendence."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup> Such a reading is dissatisfying in part because ecstasy would by definition so exceed description that locating it in Crane's poetry practically amounts to giving up on trying to describe it. I don't yet know how to describe this poem's final smiling, or to what such smiling might refer. I venture that both the smiling and the stones that keep them are obliquely borne of "the pure possession" (if not, more simply, the objects to be possessed). Further, I venture that Crane has this "pure possession" in mind when, in "General Aims and Theories," he writes of those "pure emotional crystallizations" which his poetry seeks to "manipulate." Manipulation itself suggests the fact of holding something, "ready to hand," as though emotions were something that could be held. Manipulation, in this context, as much suggests that emotions could be handled, as that they could be altered. Hence Crane's insistence on "pure emotional crystallizations," an exquisite sort of petrifaction surely of a piece with the poem's own "pure possession." Rather than ecstasy, these last lines ruminate a non-ecstatic ardor as permanent (if not as clear) as crystal.
</p>

<p>
As I suggested at this essay's outset, for all that the practices of queer theory have opened and illuminated Crane's difficulty, the singular difficulty of smiles like those of "Possessions" corresponds to a blind spot within most psychoanalytically inflected queer repertoires. As an illustration of the quandary posed to queer theory by something like Crane's smiles, I turn now to a different text, which relates an uncannily similar scene: "People can tolerate two homosexuals they see leaving together, but if the next day they're smiling, holding hands, and tenderly embracing one another, then they can't be forgiven. It is not the departure for pleasure that is intolerable, it is waking up happy."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  The observation is Foucault's, made in the late 1980s in the gay French magazine <i>Mec</i>. It makes its way into English, and therefore, into the annals of American queer theory, via Leo Bersani, who cites the observation in his book, <i>Homos</i>. The smiles of Foucault's hypothetical happy gay men prove as mysteriously untenable for Bersani as Crane's smiles do for critics such as Riddel and Dean. "There may be nothing to say," Bersani writes, "about these gays holding hands after a night of erotic play . . . " (<i>H</i>, 78). There <i>is </i>something to say, however, for both Bersani <i>and </i>Foucault, if only on a different register. By "nothing to say," Bersani doesn't mean nothing, per se, but nothing other than what initially is communicated. "Don't, Foucault warns us, read <i>their </i>tenderness as the exhausted aftermath of cocksucking that would 'really' be a disguised devouring of the mother's breast, or a fucking that would 'really' be the heterosexual repossession of a lost phallic woman . . . " (<i>H</i>, 78). Don't, that is, presume metaphoricity where meaning is unequivocally literal. As in Crane's poetry, which reiterates smiles as the privileged site at which meaning doesn't waver, Bersani and Foucault exempt gay tenderness ("two homosexuals . . . smiling") from the equivocations of (metaphorical) psychoanalytic interpretation. For both Bersani and Crane, the smile monkey-wrenches poetic practice.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Just as Riddel reads the opening smile of "Lachrymae Christi" as expressionless, Bersani reads Foucault's smiles as blanks. "No, those homosexuals gaily embracing as they go to breakfast in the Castro or somewhere off Christopher Street are blankly, superficially, radically, threateningly happy. 'There is,' Foucault says, 'no anxiety, there is no fantasy behind happiness' . . . " (<i>H</i>, 79). The redundancy of a smile's instancing nothing but a smile seems as discomfiting here as the redundancy of a <i>gay gay</i>. If there were not anxiety behind happiness, readings such as these wouldn't be so quick to equate happiness with nothing. "[W]ith no fantasies to fantasize about, the silenced interpreter becomes the intolerant homophobe" (<i>H</i>, 79). By "silenced interpreter," Foucault refers to the average Joe on the street who can't abide that gays are happy. From a different vantage, however, Foucault and Bersani are silenced interpreters, too. The homophobia of such a silenced interpreter poses a threat to the scene's gay couple, but it is not threatening, per se, to Bersani's theorizing of it. More simply put, the subject of homophobia is the site, in Bersani's account, of neither nonplussedness nor intimidation, but of the mental agility and brilliance characteristic of Bersani's writing from the outset. At the same time, however, Bersani's project seems least sure-footed (which is to say, admittedly, seems least sure <i>to me</i>) in its engagement with the threatening blanks of gay happiness, as such.
</p>

<p>
Happiness, within Bersani's analysis, is asymptotic. Claiming to "want to return to those two happy men and, without wishing to explain or interpret their happiness, at least conjecture about how they spent the night" (<i>H</i>, 80), Bersani nonetheless does not return to those two happy men, per se. He skips past them, past the morning street, to an anterior cruise and its consequent sex. <i>(It is not the departure for pleasure that is intolerable, it is waking up happy.)</i> Bersani wants, maybe, to return to the smiles, wants, even "to be one of those happy gays [himself]" (<i>H</i>, 79), but within his account, he cannot. He may not want to explain or interpret happiness (although the question remains <i>why</i> happiness remains exempt from interpretation), but in fact he <i>does. </i>What is conjecture, after all, if not an attempt at explanation or interpretation?
</p>

<p>
After further digression, Bersani returns, in a way, to Foucault's smiles. "Indeed, Foucault's thought is all the more appealing, to me, in that his utopian visions never include the pastoral promise&#x02014;so fashionable in utopian vision in recent years&#x02014;of predominantly caring and nurturing human intimacies. There are of course those two hauntingly happy and tender men . . . " (<i>H</i>, 83). Published in 1995, I wonder to what "fashionable utopias," and "recent years" Bersani refers, because queer theory's most fashionable strain much more plausibly involves the <i>exclusion </i>of nurturing human intimacy. Even as Bersani wants "happy and tender men" to exist unproblematically without fantasy, they return, within Bersani's essay, as what analysis cannot make sense of. Such is the force of "there are of course," which performs diffidence even as the reintroduction of these gay gays seriously challenges both Bersani's and Foucault's accounts of homosexual threat. If these gay men, for Bersani, are no longer "blankly" happy, it is because Bersani has alarmingly upped his adverbial ante. Now, the gay men are "hauntingly" happy. (As though a happy homo were a dead homo. As though not having an unconscious were equivalent to <i>being </i>an unconscious.) The durability 

<b></b>

of Crane's smiles emerges in Bersani as the spectral smile that won't go away. It seems Bersani cannot look at the happy men without inadvertently conjuring their own retroactivity. We have moved from a happiness that is blank (which can tell us nothing beyond the tautological) to a happiness that is haunted (which might speak, but only, as it were, from the other side of the grave). And this movement, in a way, aligns Bersani with his own opposition:

Smiles, within this optic, are both doomed and indefatigable. If the smiles of a cruise are singular in their capacity to undo themselves, the smiles of "Possessions" (and the smiles which hauntingly possess Bersani) are singular in the intensity with which they are both ever-present and undone.

Whereas Bersani under-reads the smiles of Foucault's anecdotal gay men, Crane, in "Possessions," literally encrypts smiles, as though to save them from being read at all. This is not to say that the smiles of "Possessions" are constitutively unreadable. Similarly, to note their encryption is not, in the manner of Antigone, to ascribe to these smiles a living death. Crane gives no indication that these smiles could or would ever fade out: interminability (if not utter deracination from chronology) most saliently is conjured in Crane's designation not of a single smile, or even several smiles, but of "smiling," (in fact, "<i>our</i> smiling"). A noun (such as a smile, potentially subject to narratives of ephemerality) becomes a gerund, "smiling," which (as a verbal noun) isn't in Crane's poem subject to an extrinsic temporality so much as definitionally, autonomously temporal. "Gerund," after all, etymologically denotes a carrying on, which is precisely what these smiles do&#x02014;whether read, misread, or unread altogether. That this smiling might be <i>potentially </i>intelligible without being immanently so frustrates the poem's titular interest in possessability. What does it mean to have something without access to (which is to say, understanding of) it? In this manner, Crane's "bright stones" resemble D. W. Winnicott's transitional object, imagined as a "first possession" intermediately existing "between the subjective and that which is objectively perceived."<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  This intermediate area (Crane's simultaneously compelling and occluding "wherein") "is an area," writes Winnicott, "that is not challenged, because no claim is made on its behalf except that it shall exist as a resting-place for the individual engaged in the perpetual human task of keeping inner and outer reality separate yet interrelated."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Three years after writing "Possessions," Crane returns to the problematic of happiness and stone in "Island Quarry." If the earlier poem posits the dilemma of smiling to be had if one could have it, this dilemma is itself an effect of the poem's titular parameters: the vicissitudes of possessability define the terms by which satisfaction might be gained, lost, or pined. "Island Quarry," on the other hand, reconres happiness not in terms of an object, a stone that could be held; rather, this later poem converts the hermetic emblems of "Possessions" into their own geography. The earlier poem's bright stones seemed either identical to, extensions of, or revisions of the "fixed stone of lust" which earlier circulates through the poem. "Island Quarry" by contrast reverts to a scene anterior to possessability, before stone could circulate at all. Another way of understanding the difference between the two poems would be this: if "Possessions" conceives of happiness as Winnicottian intermediate object somewhere between the outside world and the self, "Island Quarry" allegorizes happiness <i>as </i>outside world (however complicated a term "outside" is in the context of the exaggerated external and internal valences of a quarry). Translating happiness from object into geography would itself suggest one poetic tactic by which happiness could be explored (the way a geography might be explored). Provocatively, Crane's geography of happiness involves not some rainbowed waterfall or bower of bliss (as such allegorical terrains might otherwise be conceived), but a mountain quarry. "Island Quarry" thus further extends Crane's distinction between "positive" and "ecstatic." Whatever happiness might be found on or in this mountain, it is not obliterative, in the manner of ecstasy. Contrary to any Bersanian conflation of happiness with pleasure, pleasure with sexual pleasure, sexual pleasure with <i>jouissance</i>, <i>jouissance</i> with a sort of death (etc.), Crane produces a radically opposite account, where happiness is not only divorced from narratives of evanescence or self-dissolution, but bound to opposite possibilities of geological force:

The closest the poem comes to a circulatable stone is the opening spondee of "square sheets." With damning bluntness, however, these sheets are discarded as "flat prison 

<b></b>

slabs." The metaphor by which these stone sheets also connote sheets of both bed and book is knowingly heavy-handed (heavy, say, as marble), and echoes the stained page of "Possessions" whose stain is either semen or ink. The bed and the book are discarded if not as penitentiary, then potentially so. Discarded by extension are the particular relations to these objects that make of them potential prisons. It isn't that the marble couldn't be quarried toward other ends&#x02014;the limitation is not of material, but of vision. Whereas "Possessions" begins with "Witness now" (as though the poem at its opaque outset were wedded to the <i>act </i>of seeing more than the object of vision), "Island Quarry" begins with "they saw." The latter formulation seems at once more despairing and more hopeful than the injunction to witness. Despairing, if one takes "sawing" as a petrification of seeing. Even as <i>this </i>sort of stoniness is discarded, however, the poem queries the possibility of relations to stones that aren't incarcerative. "Island Quarry" doesn't imagine an anterior to the square sheets (such a claim misrepresents Crane's poem as nostalgic) so much as an alternative to them. Within the poem's system, how one might otherwise see the quarry is coextensive with what the marble might otherwise be sawed into. Vision and practice aren't merely at odds; hence the promissory formulation of "I'll see to it." To see that something gets done might be the same as doing it oneself, or the supervision of someone else doing it. 
</p>

<p>
"Island Quarry" continues as an ocular experiment within the terrain of durable stone. Vision is directed and redirected by a scramble of ever-widening prepositional locales&#x02014;at the quarry, at the bend in the road, around the roots of the mountain (as though the mountain were a tree, or tooth), where the road would seem to ply below the stone. Here, vision is shaken, and loses is orientative faculties. Where the straight road "seems" to ply below the stone, perspective, as ocular practice, replaces a vision organized by known hierarchies. From the poem's vantage, the sea is towering, and not the mountain. This perspectived landscape allows the counterintuitive misalignment of objects, the underwriting/justifying of a composition that would otherwise seem illogical. Perspective, then, is a description of counterintuitive relationality, or the moment at which relation answers to a phenomenological power higher than the intuitive.
</p>

<p>
Tricks of perspective save the quarry's stone from being seen as merely slabs. As though perspective weren't disorienting enough, the poem further undermines ordinary vision by dimming its lights (twice, the poem mentions it is dusk). The eyes which walk "the straight road" toward thunder are asked to differentiate between this silvering road which leads "on into marble" and the "goat path quivering to the right." The quivering goat path might sound like the way for Crane, but it isn't. "Tears and sleep" suggests another shitty night, not incommensurate with the rage and partial appetite penultimate in "Possessions." The road into marble, on the other hand, does not weep. This negatively-defined alternative to tears is informed by the eyes, "hard and glad," that view it. Gladness, that is, might be not only the eyes' predisposition, but their choice. This conjunction of hardness and gladness seems intuitive enough for a poet taken by the vagaries of his and other erections. Still, the gladness of being (staying) hard risks falling out of the poem. Edward Brunner and Allen Grossman, for instance, argue that "Island Quarry" entails a choice not between dissatisfaction and gladness, but between 

<b></b>

reason and sentiment. Brunner writes that the speaker "has had enough of vulnerability, and he is drawn instead to . . . the firm 'marble that does not weep,' that is inexpressive."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Grossman describes the eyes as foregoing "the wavering path of sentiment . . . putting an end to the monumental craving."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Brunner's elision of gladness in favor of a reading privileging inexpressivity recalls Riddel's misattribution of inexpressivity to the opening smile of "Lachrymae Christi." The blind-spot that precludes Brunner's ability to envision the simultaneity of "hard" and "glad" depends upon the presumption that gladness could be simultaneous only with frenzy, or even with the tears which the poem's eyes pass over. To choose the "straight path" ends up seeming queerer than choosing the bent road curving up the mountainside. So difficult is it for the poem (and us) to imagine this strange alignment of stubborn gladness (i.e. a stubbornness other than stoicism, or reason, or cadaverous non-expression) that the poem can commit to its choice, but cannot further imagine what this choice would look like.
</p>

<p>
Choice is difficult to conceive in "Island Quarry" because agency itself has become diffuse. There is no subject of the poem who could choose durability for himself, as though durability were an object to be acquired or ethic to be cultivated. The closest thing the poem has to a subject is the set of eyes which saw the marble, and walked the straight road, and did not take the quivering path. The precedent for Crane's strange subjectal dusk-vision, of course, is Emerson:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Emerson is as meticulous in describing the whereabouts of his ocular transformation as is Crane. He is crossing a bare common, he is standing on bare ground. Crane's eyes&#x02014;Crane's dissipated person&#x02014;is at the quarry out of which comes the square sheets (of prisons, of poems), and the quarry, at this magic hour, is floating as though attendant to some new set of laws. Whereas Emerson's "I" is glad to the brink of fear, Crane's eyes are glad without brink whatsoever. Crane's brinklessness, in fact, might be the more fearful proposition.

Epilogue: Threshing, Holding
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
There is among Crane's critics an acquiescence if not a tacit consensus that "The Broken Tower" was Crane's last poem. In a 1959 essay titled (straightforwardly enough) "Hart Crane's Last Poem," Marius Bewley opines that "[t]here is a literary superstition to the effect that the last work of a good artist is likely to show a deeper insight or wisdom, a last gathering of forces, as death comes on."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  The deeper insight which the "The Broken Tower" purveys has, invariably, to do with its brokenness. For Joseph 

<b></b>

Riddel, brokenness describes the insolvent suicidal poet who can't help but write a poem that performs his own inability: "Hart Crane's last poem, 'The Broken Tower,' is so confused with the sensational events of his last days that it is hard to consider the poem apart from the man. On the whole, it seems wise not to try to, for this is a poem which dramatizes, once and for all in our time, the pathetic gesture of a man dying into his work" ("PF," 473). Revamping not the fact of failure, but its theoretical fruction and the aura around it, Tim Dean more recently notes "that Crane identifies neither with mother nor father, but with <i>the brokenness of relation itself</i>. This symbolic identification not with any positive entity but with an absence, a rupture, is suggested in Crane's final poem, 'The Broken Tower'" (emphasis in original).<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Likewise, Lee Edelman writes that in "'The Broken Tower,' [his] final poem . . . [Crane] identifies his poetry as a 'long-scattered score/ Of broken intervals' in a stanza that refuses to evade the necessary and generative violence that marks the origin and originality of his work" (<i>TS</i>, 268).
</p>

<p>
These Cranians expound the "deeper insight" of breakage, even as such critical recursions produce a sort of monolithic reading of Crane opposite to the violence and pathos and ruptures on which such analysis seemingly depends. In disavowing Crane's identification with any "positive entity," Dean's championing of the negative takes up a suspicious amount of space; and Edelman's detection in Crane of a "poetics that embraces the necessity of discontinuity" (<i>TS</i>, 269) seems, in its emphatic return throughout Edelman's study, similarly, uncannily continuous (which is to say, divergent from Edelman's commitment to the necessarily discontinuous). Recuperating the negative into something resembling a positive which itself goes unquestioned, however, forces Crane and his poetry (not to mention the persons and practices for whom Crane and his poetry always potentially, imminently stand in) into an impossible corner in which the positive/non-broken/continuous is without explanation verboten, even as the negative/broken/discontinuous acquires (if only covertly) the former's putatively hegemonic tendencies.
</p>

Contrary to such readings, and as evinced in poems such as "Possessions" and "Island Quarry," Crane's poetry attempts a sustained broaching of "positive entities," where the positive signals persuasiveness and value in its own right. (We will not know the full implications of what Edelman terms Crane's "ideology of rupture" or "poetics of negativity" [<i>TS</i>, 13] until Crane's poetics of positivity has itself been done justice.) This latter poetics would accommodate cohesion, and consistency, and non-dissolution, as well as non-<i>jouissant</i> joy which needn't have traveled through the circuitries of pain at all, to count not only as joyful, but as critically and/or poetically interesting. This poetics comprises a critical gap, which in part explains why "The Broken Tower" would remain unchallenged as Crane's final poem. Although few critics are as forthright as Bewley in admitting to the superstitions of finality, the last poem of a poet nonetheless records a sort of poetic last will and testament&#x02014;or in the case of a poet who kills himself, a suicide note.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Without necessarily wanting to vitiate the "last poem's" fetishistic magic, I want to posit an alternate ending to Crane's life and career, in "The Circumstance," a poem which extends the work of "Possessions" and "Island Quarry" in a last investigation into 

<b></b>

the mysteries not of dissolution, but of a curious, oracular permanence. (Whether the persuasiveness of finality is "legitimately" intrinsic to the text itself, or a theater borne from the text's readers, strikes me as tangential to the questions I am raising.) "The Broken Tower" was finished in March 1932, and may in fact be Crane's last <i>published </i>poem, but in April of that year, perhaps just days before drowning in the sea, Crane was writing "The Circumstance:"

In his analysis of "The Broken Tower," R. W. B. Lewis rues that "the voice of vision and of love" would be so definitionally short-lived, that "the vision begotten out of the almost intractable materials so desperately yet necessarily chosen had never endured for more than 'an instant.'"<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Plangently, his next paragraph begins, "Doubts and queries persist yet a little longer . . . " ("PHC," 417).<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
"The Circumstance," however, provides a model for a voice of love that lasts longer than an instant&#x02014;in Xochipilli, the Aztec god of flowers, love, games, beauty, song and dance, to whom the poem is dedicated. The poem, in fact, seems dedicated not to the god, per se, but to a statue of the god. Or rather, the qualities of the statue&#x02014;specifically, its non-<i>ekphrastic</i> stoniness&#x02014;are as reverenced as the qualities of deity that the statue represents: "A god of flowers in statued Stone . . . of love&#x02014;/ . . . stronger than death smiles in flowering stone . . . " Crane may be referring to an important sixteenth-century Xochipilli statue, exhumed from the side of the Mexican volcano, Popocatapel. 

<b></b>

As such, Crane's poem channels Emily Dickinson, who famously mobilizes Popocatapel as an emblem of igneousness:

</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
For Dickinson, Popacatapel exists as a recent discovery, which reaches Amherst as news. Crane, on the other hand, is living in Mexico on a Guggenheim fellowship; what Dickinson can only imagine as volcanic analogue to a person, Crane inhabits first-hand. Crane lives Dickinson's metaphor.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Part of the energy of "The Circumstance," advertent or inadvertent, derives from its animation not only of Aztec artifact, but of Dickinson's textualized volcano. Indeed, Crane's poem resonates with Dickinson's iambic trimeters (in turn a borrowing of hymn meter): "If you could buy the stones,/Display the stumbling bones/ . . . As they did&#x02014;and have done . . . " Is this metrical affinity to be taken as an echo of Dickinson, or a ventriloquizing, or a sort of curatorship? Are Crane's trimeters an extension or an imitation of the past? <i>As they did and have done. . . . </i>
</p>

<p>
The poem's insistence upon this metrical unit <i>(your unsuspecting shins . . . subtract and concentrate)</i> denatures the poem's movement; unlike "Possessions," "Island Quarry," or any number of Crane lyrics, "The Circumstance" does not follow the rhythm of thought or utterance, but rather takes the shape of an archive. Each iambic grouping has the quality of a shard, akin to the Aztec artifacts Crane digs up in Mexico.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  In contrast to these pieces, the poem's subject and dedicatee is a stone idol, imagined as intact. In this respect, "The Circumstance" is a different sort of encomium than, say, Shakespeare's sonnets. Both Shakespeare and Crane praise the durability of art, but the former imagines his sonnet as exemplary of that aesthetics impervious to temporality.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  By contrast, Crane calls attention to the reliquary quality of his own writing. Along these lines, Grossman aptly notes that "Crane invests the present not with the intelligibility, but with the unreachability of the past, and the past with the urgency of the present" ("HC&amp;P," 100&#x02013;1).
</p>

<p>
Insofar as "The Circumstance" reveres the "god of flowers in statued stone," it is not for the god's unity, but for its local, composite surfaces. The reliquary (a Cornell box, or Crane poem) imagines a space in which breakage is not privileged over wholeness, nor, however, vice versa: what is broken itself becomes an object of devotion, its own inviolable entity. The reliquary's logic, even in its nonsecular forms, would seem premised on a kind of belief different, say, from that of crucifixion (in whose ecstatic penetrations we find a model for Bersani's theorizations of sexuality). A logic, rather, premised on primordial petrifaction, as though there were no Xochipilli on which the 

<b></b>

statue were based, but in fact the statue were the god. Crane's poetic is difficult, here (not because metaphorical vehicles reach toward unavailable tenors, but) because it replaces synecdoche with a drastic literalism. The end of synecdoche is red by the death smiles in flowering stone, where the smile isn't synecdochal for a larger happiness, <i>and for this reason</i> cannot be taken for granted. "Eliot and others have announced that happiness and beauty dwell only in memory," Crane writes. "I call for a positive attitude!" (<i>LHC</i>, 117, 20 January 1923). Crane's positive attitude, what I call his optimism, involves a smile that outlasts its moment, to the point (stronger than death) of forsaking memory.
</p>

<p>
Indubitably, there remains much to be said about the relation between Crane's serial smiles and the optimism that Crane, more generally, seeks to imagine (if not against, then) beyond the pessimism of Eliot. Likewise there remains more to be said about the relation between the pessimism of Eliot and the theoretical optics through which Crane, more and less recently, has been read. More specifically, I think Eliot's dictum of poetic impersonality bears an important and as yet under-examined relation to modes of queer theory which have proved so productive and illuminating not only within a general field of literary investigation, but within the specific field of Crane criticism. Namely, that the poetics delineated by Eliot anticipates certain psychoanalytically informed strands of queer theory that are aligned with (if not founded on) a suspicion of ontological permanence.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  If the smiles of <i>White Buildings </i>have proved difficult to see, let alone adequately theorize, this lacuna seems itself an effect of the potential inflexibilities of a queer theory unable to see beyond its original commitments. I offer this essay as an echo of Crane's call "for a positive attitude." To this end, I offer it as a challenge for new ways of theorizing optimism, and by extension, as a challenge for queer theory to do justice to something as strange as Crane's smiles, to something as unthinkable as a non-ecstatic joy: a durable, serial joy whose durability serves not as grounds for suspicion, but the ground on which new, as yet unimaginably generous forms of queer theory might build.

Crane's fastidious differentiation between "positive" and "ecstatic" seems all the more salubrious in a critical climate that uncritically presumes Crane as an avatar of the ecstatic. Nealon describes Crane's poetics as an "ecstatic lyricism." Thomas Yingling likewise regards Crane as ecstatic&#x02014;as do Lee Edelman, Tim Dean, and Robert K. Martin. The ubiquity in queer Crane readings of such pronouncements both incites my own interest in imagining a non-ecstatic Crane, and suggests that the skeptical age invoked by Crane might presciently describe not only the time of Crane's writing, but the time of our own.

Catachresis, sometimes more loosely defined as a mixed metaphor, describes (from Quintilian, Puttenham, and on) "the practice of adapting the nearest available term to describe something for which no actual term exists." Metaphor, for Quintilian, involves <i>translatio</i>; catachresis, <i>abusio</i>. As a form of abuse, catachresis seems serendipitously apposite to the violences and improprieties by which queer subjects of all sorts get interpellated. For instance, Edelman's mobilizing of catachresis not just as a queer trope, but as a trope for a particular queer sensibility seems evident in his writing that "catachresis . . . as a verbal abuse . . . has the air of something dangerous and disreputable" (Lee Edelman, <i>Transmemberment of Song: Hart Crane's Anatomies of Rhetoric and Desire</i> [Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1987], 12, henceforth abbreviated <i>TS</i>).

"Expressions of long duration&#x02014;certainly ten seconds or more, and usually 5 seconds&#x02014;are likely to be false. Most felt expressions don't last that long. Unless someone is having a peak experience, at the height of ecstasy, in a roaring rage, or at the bottom of depression, genuine emotional expressions don't remain on the face for more than a few seconds. Even in those extreme states expressions rarely last so long; instead, there are many shorter expressions. The long expressions are usually emblems or mock expressions" (Paul Ekman, <i>Telling Lies</i> [New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc., 1992], 147). Ekman's work, motivated by thinkers such as Erving Goffman and Silvan Tomkins, extends the nineteenth-century observations of Guillaume-Benjamin Duchenne du Bologne's <i>Mechanisme de la Physionomie Humaine</i>. Darwin, also following Duchenne, likewise notes that indelible smiles might be a sign of idiocy. "There is another large class of idiots who are persistently joyous and benign, and who are constantly laughing and smiling. Their countenances often exhibit a stereotyped smile . . . " (Charles Darwin, <i>The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals</i> [Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1965], 197.)

To further hypothesize the relation between Crane's serialized smiles and his professions of affirmation, I would recall the very extent to which optimism, fundamentally, hinges on the futural mode. Optimism might designate that the future will be beneficent (in a Leibnizian theosophic register), but might also, more loosely, designate the contiguity of the future with the present; that is, that there will be a future which I, in my present form, will find recognizable. Further, that I shall be recognizable to myself, as will my feelings, as will my perceptions. Optimism, in this sense, would seem less an outlook, and less an affective position, than an epistemological ground, governed, in the case of Crane, by the lyric possibilities borne of seriality. Seriality, that is, would become the means within lyric poetry by which the experience of durability is imagined, if not obtained. I thank Irene Tucker for helping me (at least begin to) think through these complicated relations, to which I return in the larger project of which this essay comprises one part.

I mean, here, to distinguish the repetitiveness of Eliot's smiles from the repetitiveness of Crane's. The latter repetitiveness, I am arguing, is essentially accretive, whereas (consonant with a psychoanalytic logic of repetition), the former is compulsively (if ambivalently) undermining. As a more explicitly psychoanalytic formulation of what I ascribe to Eliot, consider Cathy Caruth's helpful observation (in a different context) that "[t]he accident is thus not a reality that can simply be known once and for all, but an encounter with the real that must take place each time anew in the accident of where the words happen to fall" (<i>Unclaimed Experience: Trauma, Narrative, and History</i> [Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996], 107).

One finds ample ambient support for this alcohol-criticism in Crane's own correspondence, for instance in the following June 1922 excerpt from a letter to Gorham Munson: "I feel an enormous power in me&#x02014;that seems almost supernatural . . . I can say this now with perfect equanimity because I am notoriously drunk and the Victrola is still going with that glorious 'Bolero'" (<i>O My Land, My Friends: The Selected Letters of Hart Crane</i>, ed. Langdon Hammer and Brom Weber [New York: Four Walls Eight Windows, 1997], 92, henceforth abbreviated <i>OML</i>). In his important essay "Danced Undone: Performances of Exhaustion and Resignation in Crane's Lyrics," John Vincent notes that for Riddel, exhaustion (as particularization of Crane's brand of failure) "happens to rather than is performed in Crane's poems" (Vincent, <i>Queer Lyrics: Difficulty and Closure in American Poetry</i> [New York: Palgrave, 2002], 130). Intoxication, following a Blackmurian trajectory, happens to and is performed in Crane's poems. Or rather, performance within Crane's poems implicitly (or as in the case of Blackmur, explicitly) is imagined as under the influence. Thus, Vincent's lucid analysis of exhaustion within Crane as phenomenological experience of interpersonal boundary nonetheless depends on the rush (the lush?) that speeds against boundary, and which sometimes breaks through. Exhaustion, then, becomes an affective ring of what is left after "self-shattering"  or "breach"  or outward radiation of waves" . Exhaustion is related to intoxication (alcoholic, anal, syntactical, or some composite of the three) as its endgame, and intoxication itself presumes a certain sort of flux, within Crane's poetry, as definitionally operative.

While Vincent's interest in exhaustion might seem like a comparable site of poetic inertia, his is a sort of "I'm too tired to move," which smacks of (drips with, smells like) the movement that has precipitated it (see Vincent's reading of Portapovitch's ballet shoes, <i>Queer Lyrics</i>, 122&#x02013;5); the formulations that interest me are extrinsic from the narrative of dissipation altogether. It is not, to recall a temporality described by Renu Bora, that one asks what made these formulations immobile; they could, it seems, exist in no other way.

This whiteness resonates with the "white wind" that ends the poem, as well as with the "white paraphrase" that ends the poem just preceding "Possessions," as well as with the adverbial "whitely" of "Lachrymae Christi," the poem that follows.

Doing justice to the relation between Crane's whiteness and theirs would require more space than this footnote.

"Among the sporadic poems and fragments Crane wrote in Mexico, several reflected on the present condition and the evil history of the Mexican Indians" ("PHC," 406). Lewis further discounts "The Circumstance" as an echo "if not plagiarism" of Crane's own earlier poem, "The Dance."

There is, more generally, an eerie blur in Crane's life between the literal and the rative, belied in the preponderance in his biography of allegorical names. His own name, Hart; his mother, Grace; the lifesaver candy invented by his father, a man whose poet-son drowns; a hometown named 

<b></b>

Chagrin Falls, outside of Cleveland, a name shared by a metaphysical poet singled out for his (proto-Cranian) baroque extravagance, etc. (In fact, Clevelandism is nearly synonymous with catachresis, Crane's signature mode. See, for instance, John Dryden's "The Art of Dramatick Poesie": " . . . [I]f now and then he does not offer a Catecresis or Clevelandism, wresting and torturing a word into another meaning . . . "

Crane wrote: "One can sleep soundly almost anywhere and be thankful for the limited diet of beans and tortillas if one has spent the whole day walking, scrambling over dizzy crags or hunting fragments of old Aztec idols, of which the surrounding cornfields of Tepoztlan are full" (<i>LHC</i>, 380, 21 September 1931).

For example, sonnet no. 55, "Not marble nor the gilded monuments/ Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme,/ But you shall shine more bright in these contents/ Than unswept stone, besmeared with sluttish time . . . ."

Such suspicions stem in part from the lessons of Foucault, for whom identity is inextricable from the taxonomic, and taxonomy inextricable from the oppressive. Within Crane criticism, this suspicion informs the work of many of Crane's most committed recent queer readers. For instance, Tim Dean claims that "Crane's poetic language does not aim to produce a homosexual self or subject-effect; on the contrary, it aims for an experience whose intensity shatters any self" ("Hart Crane's Death Drive," 3). Michael Trask suggests the extent to which non-permanence pertains not only to the suspicion of self-consistency, but likewise to the suspicion of consistency more generally: "Matter is conceived as dynamic and substitutive in the same way that those who labor on this matter are understood to be portable and disposable" ("Hart Crane's Epic of Anonymity," in <i>Cruising Modernism: Class and Sexuality in American Literature and Social Thought</i> [Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2003], 141). While shattering and disposability are hardly equivalent, both phenomena (in regard to persons, interpersonal relations, and objects) insist upon a liquidation of the unequivocal. This undermining of stability and concomitant privileging of instability&#x02014;to the point where equivocation could be imagined as the foundation of an ethics&#x02014;amounts, in Foucault's words, to a "hyper- and pessimistic activism" ("On the Genealogy of Ethics: An Overview of Work in Progress," in <i>The Foucault Reader</i>, ed. Paul Rabinow [New York: Pantheon Books, 1984], 343). Pessimism, in this case, denotes what Eve Sedgwick illuminates as an abiding paranoia that systems of care or versions of therapy are in fact extensions of coercion. (I'm thinking specifically here of Sedgwick's "Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading," in <i>Novel Gazing</i>, ed. Sedgwick [Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1997].) It is within these interstices that Crane's optimism seems in conversation not only with Eliot's pessimism, but proleptically, with that of Foucault and those who have followed this particular Foucaultian gambit. I do not mean to discount the contributions that the likes of Dean or Trask have made to either queer theory or Crane criticism, so much as to complicate and add to vocabularies and practices already at hand.
