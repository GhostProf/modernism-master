When that Byronic gay blade of Bloomsbury Clive Bell proposed in his 1923 pamphlet <i>On British Freedom</i> that "Great Britain is one of the least free countries in the world," he had in mind not Britain's great political freedom, admired by all Europe, but the everyday personal, social, and public freedoms that ordinary Frenchmen take for granted.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  In France, Bell observed, art, literature, and theater flourish without a censor's interference; bars and restaurants may be open at all hours yet do sometimes close without a curfew; people pursue their amatory affairs without state supervision; and a working man can raise a point of Biblical textual criticism without fear of prosecution by the state. An "ordinary Englishman" enjoys none of these freedoms, Bell pointed out, and indeed "is, on the whole, less free than a Roman slave in the time of Hadrian" (<i>OBF</i>, 4). From the Puritan revolution to the 1737 Licensing Act that put the playwrights of Shakespeare's land into shackles through the nineteenth-century "reign of the Puritan middle-classes," the ordinary Englishman's everyday freedoms have been so far curtailed that such writers as Shaw and Wells, "when they sit down to work for humanity," must "wonder whether what they want to say will be sanctioned by some shop-keeping alderman, or illiterate fox-hunter, or by a committee of dyspeptic and time-worn virgins" (<i>OBF</i>, 13, 10).
</p>

<p>
Although Bloomsbury's significance as a modern movement is often dismissed on grounds of class privilege, Bell writes here on behalf of "ordinary" Englishmen. The English aristocracy after all suffered few practical restrictions on their personal and social freedoms, and Bell's Bloomsbury compeers had long 

<b></b>

ago seceded from the upper-middle-class milieu of their youth to what seemed, after Roger Fry's 1910 "Manet and the Post-Impressionists" exhibition, almost a faubourg of Paris, a province of France&#x02014;not exactly a bohemia but a safely upper-middle-class colony of artists and intellectuals who practiced privately the personal and social freedoms Bell advocates for ordinary Englishmen. What bends Bell's screed on freedom out of true is less class than gender, for his ordinary English subject is as masculine as his ordinary Frenchman&#x02014;and his (rather idealized) Roman slave, who "had never heard of <i>Magna Charta</i> or the <i>Bill of Rights</i>" yet, when at leisure, could (at least in theory) "read, or hear read, what he liked; no committee of old maids claimed the right to deprive him of the superb indecencies of Juvenal or the malicious indecencies of Petronius or the mellifluous indecencies of Ovid, or even of the latest . . . <i>simplicitas romana</i> (frank smut)" (<i>OBF</i>, 6, 5). Whereas Bell's Roman slave "might enjoy a play by Aristophanes," "can you fancy an unexpurgated . . . <i>Lysistrata</i> being given in Miss Horniman's house?" (<i>OBF</i>, 5). He "might eat and drink whatever he could pay for at whatever hour he chose; without let or hindrance . . . gratify his sexual tastes"; and bet on "a cock-t unmolested by the police"; but the "free Manchester wave-ruler is shot out of the bar at ten, haled before the magistrate if he winks at ('annoys') a wench on his way home, and fined if to console himself he indulges in a quiet game of put-and-take" (<i>OBF</i>, 5, 6).
</p>

<p>
Likewise, "our fortunate friend" the Frenchman can laugh on a Saturday evening at "some <i>Palais-Royal</i> farce of which the censor here would have made the shortest work"; then, over a drink in his local caf&#x000E9;, play cards, amuse himself with "a comic paper, full of pictures and anecdotes which in this land of the free would have led . . . to police intervention," read a novel by Balzac or Zola "the like of which no modern British author dares publish in his own free country"; or "regale himself all night long with as much female society, bad music, dancing even and sweet champagne, as his heart desires" (<i>OBF</i>, 6&#x02013;7). No "Norman rake-hell" but "the father of a family and a pillar of the State," Bell's ordinary Frenchman "would be astonished to learn that, were he resident on the other side of the Channel, in this one night he would have committed crimes enough to have cost the tax-payer a small fortune in policemen, courts and magistrates, and himself a quarter's salary in fines: the purveyors of his pleasures would, of course, have been ruined" (<i>OBF</i>, 7).
</p>

<p>
Surely Virginia Woolf applauded this salvo in the cause of freedom by that "sprightly journalist," her friend Clive?<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Didn't she herself have to navigate the wandering rocks of British censorship as both writer and publisher? Wasn't the Woolfs' fledgling Hogarth Press legally constrained from publishing <i>Ulysses</i> even had it possessed the resources to do so? Wouldn't Woolf later attend the <i>Well of Loneliness</i> obscenity trial, ready to testify to the book's right to exist?<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Yet her diaries and letters are all but silent about <i>On British Freedom</i>. Around May 1923, shortly before it appeared from Chatto and Windus, Woolf importuned Clive to send "your pamphlet" for Hogarth.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Evidently he did send a pre-publication copy, for on 29 May she wrote him that she had composed "the most brilliant charming, and flattering letter that I have ever written, or you received," but stuffed it in a rose catalogue by mistake; and recounts remarking to 

<b></b>

Leonard and Tom Eliot that Clive, unlike Raymond Mortimer and F. L. Lucas, is not "afraid to have an idea," so that "besides perking it with the best of them; something solid remains."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Might the fact that Bell so strongly marks the subject of the freedoms he advocates as masculine have anything to do with the vagueness of Woolf's praise for his "idea," his "something solid"? Put another way: how do her own life and work, and Vanessa Bell's, reflect on the "French" and "British" freedoms Clive describes, in themselves and in implicit dialogue with Clive's "solid" "idea"? In the Bloomsbury milieu, that London extension of Cambridge that young Vanessa and Virginia Stephen entered by way of their brother Thoby, these sister adventurers and revolutionaries actively forged their modern freedom in critical and creative dialogue with freedoms both "French" and "British." As they did so, early Bloomsbury emerged dialectically not just from the differences between French and British freedoms but from the gender differences within them. In this light, Bloomsbury seems no longer the English afterlife of modern French art in the wake of the 1910 post-impressionist exhibition, as it is often made to appear&#x02014;a late-blooming poor cousin of France, belatedly imitating such freedoms as fostered the tremendous explosion of creativity that made the country across the Channel the capital of modern art. Bloomsbury appears, rather, an experiment in vivo in the new freedoms modernity could afford not just to ordinary Frenchmen, ordinary Englishmen, and Parisian artists but to English women artists.
</p>

<p>
To take by the horns the matter of Bell's Frenchman who could gratify his sexual tastes without let or hindrance, let us consider Robert Scholes's article "In the Brothel of Modernism: Picasso and Joyce." For Scholes, Paris is the center of a modernism he characterizes as "a masculist activity that positioned women voyeuristically and turned would-be agents into patients to an astonishing extent"; "a gendered movement, driven by the anxieties and ambivalences of male artists and writers," that brought "the re of the prostitute to the center of the modernist stage" along with the artist himself.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Following T. J. Clarke, Charles Bernheimer, and others, Scholes observes that prostitution played an "extraordinary role . . . in the development as modernists of those two giants of the movement, Joyce and Picasso" ("IBM," 1:2). From Baudelaire, Manet, and Degas to Picasso and Joyce, the brothel as "subject matter" constituted modernism even as it "excluded women who were not . . . prostitutes" ("IBM," 3:5). Thus "if we . . . try to imagine one of Joyce's sisters becoming a modernist writer," Scholes writes, "we can readily see how a certain crucial experience of prostitutes and brothels was simply impossible for her, while it was almost inevitable for her brother" ("IBM," 3:5).<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  For this reason, he says, Virginia Woolf "never quite becomes a modernist" but "remains an impressionist or post-impressionist throughout her career"&#x02014;a judgment he frames as "purely descriptive" not "evaluative" ("IBM," 1:2).
</p>

<p>
Now, when Scholes highlights brothers' and sisters' different sexual experiences to prove Woolf's exclusion from modernism, he knocks over the very can of worms that his idea of modernism peels open. For when it comes to the brothels of modernism, the documents of early Bloomsbury unfold a different tale, no less arresting than Picasso's or Joyce's&#x02014;one that foregrounds the presumptive masculinity of Bell's 

<b></b>

exemplary free citizen, challenges Scholes's confidence in a modernism limited to the privileged male gaze, and casts a different light upon the popular image of a French provincial Bloomsbury.
</p>

<p>
In fact Fry's "Manet and the Post-Impressionists" exhibition offers a useful approach to the gender, class, and national contexts and limits of modernist artistic freedom, for it brought home&#x02014;and, in the controversy it provoked, brought to life&#x02014;such differences between French and British freedoms as Bell's pamphlet remarks. As everyone knows, the art that caused such a sensation in 1910 London was already history in Paris. Desmond MacCarthy, who accompanied Roger Fry to the continent in September 1910 to select art for the exhibition, wrote his wife Molly from France that he "enjoyed choosing the pictures (which will by the bye give you the most tremendous shocks)"; he predicted that the British public would raise "a howl of fury and derision" on encountering, say, Van Gogh's 1889 postman (<a href="#1"> 1</a>)&#x02014;"wonderfully hideous, alive, and as disconcerting as a face put suddenly three inches from one's own."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  As MacCarthy later put it, the pictures amounted to an artists' "imaginative declaration of rights": to be "independent of literal representation," "to handle nature with more imaginative freedom; and above all . . . to experiment" (<i>CH</i>, 111).
</p>

<p>
Yet the art on display was not uncensored. Expecting "a huge campaign of outraged British Philistinism," Fry took care to emphasize the modern French artists' embrace of primitivism&#x02014;their revolt against "the tempered realism of the last four hundred years"&#x02014;rather than their indifference to the British Public's moral sensibilities, the care of which Fry placed in MacCarthy's hands.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  "At these interviews with dealers I used to pose as M. le Publique," MacCarthy recounted, "and on one point my verdict was final: Was there, or was there not, anything in some nude which might create an outcry in London?" (<i>CH</i>, 108; cited in <i>EBIW</i>, 177). By this criterion Gauguin's 1892 <i>L'Esprit veille/Manao Tupapau&#x02014;The Spirit of the Dead Keeps Watch</i> (<a href="#2"> 2</a>) and Picasso's 1905 <i>Nude Girl with a Basket of Flowers</i> (<a href="#3"> 3</a>) passed muster before M. le Publique and were hung in the Grafton's Large Gallery.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Fry's effort to focus the spectators' attention on the artists' rejection of photographic realism succeeded to a considerable degree.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Even so, exhibition secretary MacCarthy remembered, "I kept overhearing such remarks as 'Pure pornography.' 'Admirably indecent.' Not a word of truth, of course. . . . As M. le Publique, I had been careful to exclude too frankly physiological nudes and, indeed at the last moment, instead of hanging two of the pictures, I told Roger they had better be kept, for a time, in my sanctum downstairs."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
That the British Public found much to deplore in the French paintings even after their censorship by M. le Publique casts a telling light not only on the gap between its sense of decency and Bloomsbury's but also on the gender and class of decency. The anti-imperialist aristocrat-poet-statesman Wilfrid Scawen Blunt, who (Lucy McDiarmid tells us) "had thirty-eight lovers in forty-eight years (1862&#x02013;1910) and would be considered a serious amorist by most standards," was shocked&#x02014;shocked&#x02014;by Fry's "pornographic show."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  The Duchess of Rutland, a talented if assiduously literal amateur draughtsman in her own right, confessed herself "very very much upset," indeed "so <i>horrified</i> at having my name associated with such an <i>awful</i> exhibition of horrors"

that she wished it expunged from later printings of the catalogue (<i>CH</i>, 112). (It was.) Virginia Stephen, on the other hand, remarked that she thought the pictures less good than books, "but why all the duchesses are insulted by the post-impressionists, a modest sample set of painters, innocent even of indecency, I cant conceive" (<i>LVW</i>, 1:440, 27 November 1910). Six years resident in Bloomsbury by 1910, the Stephen sisters had long since parted ways with philandering poet-statesmen and offended duchesses, not just in appreciation of modern French primitivism but in fine moral discrimination. When, some weeks later, Vanessa and Virginia fleshed out their aesthetic judgments by dressing as living Gauguins at the Chelsea Art Club ball for the Slade students' parody exhibition, "Septule and the Racinistes," the duchesses and their ilk were not amused. "Mrs. Whitehead was scandalized," Virginia recalled.</p>

<p>
Ninety-five years later, amused by Woolf's parody of Bloomsbury's affront to gossiping dowagers, we perhaps take for granted that the Bloomsbury group began when the Stephen siblings forsook irreproachable Kensington for that disreputable British Museum neighborhood after their father's death in 1904. But, with respect to the brothels of modernism, was it not the other way round? In this same memoir, "Old Bloomsbury," Woolf recalls the hypocrisy and repression of a specimen Kensington evening at the theater with George Duckworth and Countess Carnavon around 1900, in the course of which George kissed Lady Carnavon behind a pillar, bundled them all out onto the pavement when French actors made as if to copulate onstage, and, safe home at 22 Hyde Park Gate, burst into Virginia's room and flung himself on her bed&#x02014;having given her to understand, Quentin Bell informs us, that "Vanessa's unkindness" in refusing to accompany George on such evenings threatened to "drive him from home" to seek "consolation in the arms of whores. It was for Virginia to rescue him from this awful fate" ("OB," 181).<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Bell echoes Woolf's 1920 memoir, "22 Hyde Park Gate," in which she depicts her young self pondering the "dark and extremely lurid" intelligence "that the chaste, the immaculate George Duckworth would be forced into the arms of whores": "Needless to say he did not put it like that; and I could only conjure up in my virgin consciousness, dimly irradiated by having read the 'Symposium' with Miss Case, horrible visions of the vices to which young men were driven whose sisters did not make them happy at home."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In juxtaposing this Kensington sexual farce with the comparatively chaste Bloomsbury evening when the company celebrated their new free speech in pronouncing the word "semen" aloud for the first time, Woolf makes a deadly serious point. It was not in Bloomsbury but at 22 Hyde Park Gate that Vanessa and Virginia endured seven "Greek slave years," pressed into service to preserve their "incestuous brother" from "the arms of whores" ("OB," 195).<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  It was not a Bloomsbury denizen but one of the "old ladies of Kensington and Belgravia" who fled the French actors like nymphs from a satyr, whisking Virginia away with her; who took leave of her by saying "she did hope I wasn't tired, which meant, I felt, she hoped I wouldn't lose my virginity or something like that"; yet who "never knew that George Duckworth was not only father and mother, brother and sister to those poor Stephen girls; he was their lover also" ("HPG," 177; "OB," 181). It was her Bloomsbury companions who could occasion and receive Virginia's memoirs, not the Kensington ladies, who surely would have been scandalized to learn of Virginia's late evenings with George&#x02014;his "tap at the door," extinguishing of the light, and "cuddling and kissing and otherwise embracing me in order, as he told Dr Savage later, to comfort me for the fatal illness of my father, who was dying three or four storeys lower down of cancer"&#x02014;except that (like Clarissa Dalloway, who refuses to hear a word against Hugh Whitbread, accused of accosting Sally Seton in the smoking room) few, it seems, would have consented to hear a word against George ("OB," 182).<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In any case, just here in "Old Bloomsbury" Woolf observes that "46 Gordon Square could never have meant what it did had not 22 Hyde Park Gate preceded it" ("OB," 182). At 46 Gordon Square, Virginia Stephen had her first "room with a lock on the door," 

<b></b>

one that ensured the bodily autonomy and security that <i>A Room of One's Own</i> makes the first condition of a woman's freedom of mind.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  And it is her old room at 22 Hyde Park Gate&#x02014;a room with no lock on the door&#x02014;that she cannot force herself to reenter in memory as she struggles to write her late memoir of "the seven unhappy years" ("SP," 136). In short, it was in "respectable" Kensington that the motherless Stephen sisters found themselves immured in a house that in certain respects resembled a brothel, and in d&#x000E9;class&#x000E9; Bloomsbury that they first tasted autonomy and freedom, as modern young women and as artists aspiring to represent the modern world. If, for Scholes, the brothel served as a screen on which Picasso and Joyce projected anxieties about the commodification of their art, the documents of early Bloomsbury bring to light a quasi-brothel within "respectable" Kensington&#x02014;one that must surely have outraged the puritanical British Public had not actual censorship, internalized censorship, and a little-remarked public complicity impeded its public representation.
</p>

<p>
How then does the Stephen sisters' "Greek slave" experience in this hidden brothel&#x02014;its manifestations repressed or denied by "respectable" old ladies and disclosed only to such intimates as the Bloomsbury Memoir Club&#x02014;qualify Scholes's claim that modernism is inherently bound to the brothel, hence "masculist"? Modernist artists "were fascinated by prostitutes because they saw in them an image of themselves," Scholes writes. Thus, as Picasso's landmark 1907 <i>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</i> evolves from sketch (<a href="#4"> 4</a>) to painting (<a href="#5"> 5</a>), the prostitute at left "absorbs" the male gaze "and turns it back upon us, the spectators, in the role of a client of sex or art" ("IBM," 2:10). Extending Scholes's reading of the way this demoiselle refracts the client's specifically male gaze, we further note the way the intense dark gaze of Picasso's self-portrait of 1907 (<a href="#6"> 6</a>) seems to migrate to the (at first eyeless, in the sketch) demoiselles. (Lest the idea of Picasso's demoiselle as self-portraiture seem farfetched, consider Barbara Bagenal's 1959 photograph of Clive Bell with Picasso in tart masquerade: corduroy trousers below, blonde wig and seductive mask above, his hands sculpting his jersey into pointy gunslinger breasts [<a href="#7"> 7</a>].) If the fierce gaze of Picasso's demoiselles compounds the prostitute's, the client's, and the artist's, the fierce gaze in the documents of early Bloomsbury is a woman's. Just as the mature Joyce conjures Dublin's Nighttown of 1904 through a temporally laminated remembering gaze that recovers and analyzes his early experience, Virginia Stephen Woolf's analytic gaze at the brothels of modernism spans time lived, recorded, represented, and remembered in diaries, letters, fiction, and memoirs. The analytic gazes of Joyce and Woolf, moreover, foreground what Scholes overlooks in limiting modernism to the male gaze: the modern sex/gender system that makes prostitution continuous with the bourgeois marriage system.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  In doing so they excavate the socioeconomic links between pornography (from Greek <i>porne</i>, harlot or female slave, thus: the writing about or drawing of whores) and sex slavery and open the question of their relation to modernism.
</p>

<p>
As daughters of Leslie and Julia Duckworth Stephen, the young Virginia and Vanessa were, of course, poised to be molded by that system or "social machine" into "respectable" married ladies&#x02014;and might have been had their mother Julia (d. 1895) and/or half-sister Stella Duckworth (d. 1897) lived ("SP," 153).<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  In that case, Woolf might

Making the case for a "masculist" modernism inextricable from the brothel, Scholes notes that Ovid's Cretan tale of Queen Pasipha&#x000EB; and King Minos is the common source of Picasso's minotaur and Joyce's modern Daedalus in these artists' mythic self-portraiture. In Picasso's 1935 etching <i>Minotauromachy</i> or minotaur battle (<a href="#9"> 9</a>), for example, the artist portrays himself as the minotaur, half-man, half-beast, the monstrous offspring of King Minos's wife Pasipha&#x000EB; and a bull, who was imprisoned in a labyrinth created by Daedalus and there each year devoured an Athenian tribute of seven maidens and seven boys until Theseus killed him. The minotaur, Kirk Varnedoe notes, entered Picasso's work in 1928 as "a hybrid monster of virile power and unbridled appetite"; this "cruel beast of ancient legend bore the body of a man, but his head, the seat of reason, had been displaced by that of a bull," so that he was "incapable of being civilized."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  In Picasso's etchings the minotaur is "sometimes a hearty <i>convive</i> at the studio revels," later "an ultimately tragic re" as the artist came

His hair curled naturally in dark crisp ringlets; he was six foot high; he had been in the Eton Eleven; he was now cramming at Scoones' in the hope of passing the Foreign Service examination.

Miss Willett was reminded of the Hermes; but if you looked at him closely you noticed that one of his ears was pointed; and the other round; you also noticed that though he had the curls of a God and the ears of a faun he had unmistakably the eyes of a pig. So strange a compound can seldom have existed. And in the days I speak of, God, faun and pig were all in all alive, all in opposition, and in their conflicts producing the most astonishing eruptions.

Summoned from the rigors of Greek grammar to bare-armed, low-necked display on the upper-middle-class marriage market, the aspiring young artist who suffered George's "sullen look" "like a horse in a show ring" while feeling "condemned from more points of view than I could then analyse" looks back two decades later at this privileged male subject of the sex/gender system and renders Greek god, faun, and pig in cubist simultaneity. As Picasso imagined "the horned intruder" of his 1936 etching <i>Faun Unveiling a Sleeping Girl</i> (<a href="#2"> 12</a>) "wondering whether the girl 'loves him <i>because</i> he is a monster,'" Woolf's minotauromachy depicts George from the split and doubled vantages of two sacrificial virgins ("PSP," 153). To "Miss Willett of Brighton"&#x02014;a fictional alter of young Virginia, as far as I have been able to determine&#x02014;George is a sort of flasher-Hermes; her idealizing allusion evokes his sexual body behind a chaste classical eaf. Meanwhile, "I"&#x02014;the memoirist&#x02014;qualifies Miss Willett's enraptured gaze by recalling the closer vantage of her youth, from which "you" (even "Miss Willett," presumably) could distinctly observe George's faun's ears and pig's eyes. As Picasso dreams a faun uncovering a sleeping girl who loves his very monstrosity, Woolf's ambivalent maidens unveil a monster, a spectacle compounded of god, faun and pig, alarmingly "alive" and (in a deft abstract stroke that leaves much to the imagination) "producing the most astonishing eruptions."

projected in Gabriel Conroy a life and self that might have been his had he not flown Dublin's labyrinth, Virginia imprisons Miss Willatt in a psychic labyrinth from which Virginia herself is already devising an escape. Miss Willatt's life is marked by an excessive and reticent propriety, which her devoted biographer, Miss Linsett, does not pierce through but only reinforces. To the alert but disappointed reviewer, Miss Willatt's life and letters seem an elaborate tissue of evasion: Miss Willatt "thought it indecent to describe what she had seen, so that instead of a portrait of her brothers (and one had led a very queer life) or a memory of her father (for which we should have been grateful) she invented Arabian lovers and set them on the banks of the Orinoco . . . in an ideal community, for she enjoyed framing laws."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Her talent diverted from realism to escapist utopias, Miss Willatt dies with her "indecent" stories untold, her witness to her brother's extraordinary life unuttered: "Once she raised her left hand, 'upon which she wore her mother's wedding ring,' and let it fall again; they expected something more but . . . <i>they did nothing</i>, and half an hour later the counterpane was still."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Sifting the tedious remains of Miss Willatt's life and letters, which less document than displace "what she had seen," the fictional reviewer subtly probes the social repression that silences women's testimony, relegates it to the obscene. As the novelist Miss Willatt foreshadows the poet Miss Willett whose sentimental ode to George reposed in his (and Virginia's) mother's "writing drawer," "Memoirs of a Novelist" subtly challenges Bloomsbury's aspiring New-Woman novelist&#x02014;its author, Virginia Stephen&#x02014;to soar over the concealing walls of the private house into public speech.</p>

When her friend and former housemate John Maynard Keynes pronounced her 1920 sketch of George her "best thing" to date, Woolf scoffed at the idea that "George" was her "climax."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  But documents of her own minotauromachy&#x02014;resonant in the unspeakable life of Miss Willatt's brother&#x02014;lie scattered throughout her writings. In 1903, even as George was exerting himself to groom his half-sisters for the "show ring" and tame them to the genteel servility to which women of their class were destined, Virginia was posting comic vignettes of her half-brothers to her confidante Violet Dickinson, promising that "If ever I write a novel, those two shall go in large as life" (<i>LVW</i>, 1:101, 11? October). In 1911 she recounted to Vanessa that talking about "copulation" with her old Greek tutor, Janet Case, "led us to the revelation of all Georges malefactions." Case had already glimpsed them, for she used to express disgust "when he came in 

<b></b>

and began fondling me over my Greek"; still, "When I got to the bedroom scenes, she . . . gasped like a benevolent gudgeon" (<i>LVW</i>, 1:472, 25? July). In 1922 Virginia tells Vanessa that she confided "the story of George" to that "gigantic mass of purity" Elena Rathbone Richmond, wife of <i>TLS</i> editor Bruce Richmond, who traveled in George's social circles. Elena, who had "never liked him," was "shocked at first; but very soon reflected that much more goes on than one realises"&#x02014;perhaps, Woolf speculates, "alluding to her father and Miss L&#x000FC;lling."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Imagining that Elena would tell Bruce, who as a "perfect gentleman" would then have no choice but "to spit in Georges face in the Club," Virginia asks her sister, "Dont you think this is a noble work for our old age&#x02014;to let the light in upon the Duckworths&#x02014;and I daresay George will be driven to shoot himself one day when he's shooting rabbits" (<i>LVW</i>, 2:505, 20 February). That Elena's possible allusion to whatever went on between her father and Miss L&#x000FC;lling needed no gloss for Vanessa suggests both the sub rosa circulation of such knowledge and the force of social repression that anyone proposing "to let the light in" would face. Only "at first" was Elena shocked, and not for long, as if quickly assimilating George into a capacious social category already made familiar by occupants such as Lord Rathbone, whose social status it silently preserved. No wonder George, far from executing Woolf's fantasy of a remorseful suicide, could play the social machine "so assiduously that he emerged at the age of sixty with a Lady Margaret for wife . . . a knighthood . . . a sinecure . . . three sons, and a country house" ("SP," 153). Here Woolf's "noble work" of illuminating Kensington's darker precincts runs aground on the gender of free speech, both private and public.
</p>

<p>
Not every privileged "masculist" subject was as oblivious as George to the analytic gaze young Virginia trained on him. After their father died in February 1904, Vanessa, Virginia, Thoby, and Violet Dickinson toured Italy and stopped in Paris on their way home in early May; Virginia and Vanessa stayed on a few days after Thoby and Violet left for London. There they saw Thoby's Cambridge friend Clive Bell, whom they had met once before at a Trinity College Ball and who was sojourning there on a Trinity research grant.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Clive was an habitu&#x000E9; of the Montparnasse restaurant Chat Blanc where, in an upstairs lair "reserved for . . . artists, their friends, models and mistresses," he kept company with expatriate painters such as Gerald Kelly, J. W. Morrice, and the saturnine Irishman Roderick O'Conor, who had studied with Gauguin at Pont-Aven and in 1905 would exhibit work influenced by C&#x000E9;zanne at the Salon d'automne and the Salon des Ind&#x000E9;pendants.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  "Only once," wrote Clive, "did I see [O'Conor] impressed by a human being, and that was by . . . Virginia Stephen. . . . In 1904 she was very young and quite unknown, having published nothing: but O'Conor confessed after their first and, I think, only meeting&#x02014;'she put the fear of God into me.'"<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Just how Virginia incurred this distinction Clive, if he knew, does not divulge. But O'Conor's unwonted awe lends force to Clive's later declaration that, of all his wide acquaintance&#x02014;from John Maynard Keynes ("the cleverest man I ever met"), Lytton Strachey, T. S. Eliot, and Roger Fry to Auguste Rodin and Jean Cocteau&#x02014;the only two "from whom emanated simply and unmistakably a sense of genius" were Picasso and Woolf.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  He would have felt it, he says, had he never seen a Picasso or read a Woolf

novel. Meanwhile, writing from Paris in 1904, Virginia teased Violet Dickinson that she had found in her pocket an unposted letter that "should have been sending shocks and thrills through [Violet's] maiden bosom" and regales her with caricatures of their Parisian adventures. They took "the valiant old Heathen" Beatrice Thynne "to dine with Bell last night," she reports, "a real Bohemian party" where everyone smoked "half a dozen cigarettes a piece" and Thynne and Kelly engaged in impassioned argument about painting: "He actually shook his fist at her across the table, and at one moment I held her down&#x02014;a stormy scene." Beatrice "originally meant to stay 6 weeks with us," Virginia deadpans, but "left early this morning." The Stephens planned a "last expedition" to "Rodins studio"; and if, on their return, Violet could find her "a great solid bit of work to do" so that she could "forget my own stupidity," Virginia would be "so grateful. I <i>must</i> work," she adds; she would sell her brains "cheap at this moment" (<i>LVW</i>, 1:139&#x02013;40, 6? May 1904).
</p>

<p>
On 9 May 1904, Vanessa and Virginia returned from Paris to 22 Hyde Park Gate, "escorted by George Duckworth," who had come over the day before to fetch them (<i>VW</i>, 1:193). The very next day Virginia "suffered a severe mental breakdown," lending support to Scholes's observation that the brothels of modernism did much to turn would-be agents into patients (<i>LVW</i>, 1:141, editors' note). While Virginia lay ill&#x02014;at first attended by three nurses, later staying for almost three months with Violet, once flinging herself from a window (a low one, as if to say she wanted to live but could not see how)&#x02014;Vanessa dismantled 22 Hyde Park Gate and organized the move to 46 Gordon Square. In August and September Virginia was well enough to rejoin her family on holiday at the Manor House in Teversal, Nottinghamshire, with a nurse in attendance. Virginia did not travel to George's wedding to Lady Margaret Herbert on 10 September at Dulverton Hall in Devon but remained in Nottinghamshire, where Violet Dickinson came to stay with her. After the first night of wedding festivities, the stoic Vanessa, a bridesmaid, wrote her sister that "George embraced me and fondled me in front of the company&#x02014;but that was only to be expected."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  For Vanessa's biographer Frances Spalding and others, "The fact that this fondling occurred in front of polite society raises the question as to its precise nature. As Virginia is our chief source on this matter it is possible that her accounts of George's behaviour were exaggerated" (<i>VB</i>, 19). Although Spalding assumes that this company of earls, countesses, bishops, Eton housemasters and the like would not have countenanced improper fondling, Virginia's later accounts of talks with Janet Case and Elena Richmond suggest quite the opposite: the very great extent to which upper-class society was habituated to overlook improper behavior in one of their own, as long as that one was a man. Woolf later stages this phenomenon in fictional scenarios in the disagreement over Richard's kiss between Helen Ambrose (the Vanessa re) and Rachel Vinrace (the Virginia re) in <i>The Voyage Out</i> and in the Sally Seton/Hugh Whitbread affair in <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it is no coincidence, then, that hardly were George's nuptials concluded than Virginia's health dramatically improved. Only a week after the wedding she wrote Violet that her visit had "set us on our legs again," and praised her "beneficent powers" (<i>LVW</i>, 1:141&#x02013;2, 17 September 1904). A few days later she pronounced herself "a 

<b></b>

recovered bird. . . . It is the oddest feeling, as though a dead part of me were coming to life. I cant tell you how delightful it is. . . . All the voices I used to hear telling me to do all kinds of wild things have gone"&#x02014;voices she would translate into those urging Septimus Warren Smith to "kill yourself, for our sakes."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  She added, "I really think [Vanessa] is happy with me now" (<i>LVW</i>, 1:142&#x02013;3, 22? September). On 26 September, sixteen days after the wedding, she rejoiced, "Oh my Violet, if there were a God I should bless him for having delivered me safe and sound from the miseries of the last six months! You cant think what an exquisite joy every minute of my life is to me now, and my only prayer is that I may live to be 70" (<i>LVW</i>, 1:143). That autumn Virginia plunged into "solid" work at last, publishing her first pieces in the <i>Guardian</i>. In early 1905 Dr. Savage pronounced her well, and on 10 March&#x02014;six months to the day after the wedding&#x02014;her first <i>TLS</i> piece appeared.
</p>

<p>
The year 1904, then, marked a critical turning point in young Virginia's minotauromachy, a battle against that "sportive and demonstrative" God-faun-pig George that came close to doing her in ("HPG," 167). Here is Quentin Bell's take on it: The young Stephens' plan that Bloomsbury would be an "escape from the past and all its horrors," he writes, had "one fatal, one appalling drawback": "George, always affectionate and kind, could not bear the idea of leaving his sisters with nobody but Thoby and Adrian, who from a social point of view were worse than useless . . . go with them he ought and must." The dismayed Stephens "hardly knew how to oppose so much well-intentioned fraternal feeling," Bell continues, hence "were weak to the point of pusillanimity: for the long story of George's attentions had . . . been made so far public that he could surely have been called to account" (<i>VW</i>, 1:95&#x02013;6). How far was "so far"? From Woolf's remark in "Old Bloomsbury" that George, when confronted by Dr. Savage, excused his behavior as meant merely "to comfort me for the fatal illness of my father," Bell infers that George <i>was</i> called to account that summer: Vanessa, he speculates, told Dr. Savage, who "taxed George with his conduct" ("OB," 182; <i>VW</i>, 96 and n). But this interview, if it occurred, can scarcely be called <i>public</i>. In any case, no such rebuke as Dr. Savage may or may not have offered could deter George from his purpose: "Gone then were all their hopes of flying from the past: the past was coming to live with them" (<i>VW,</i> 1:96). If George announced his intention to live with his half-sisters in Bloomsbury on their return from Paris that May&#x02014;if nothing and no one could prevent him from making himself at home in 46 Gordon Square&#x02014;the suicidal madness into which twenty-one-year-old Virginia then fled might have seemed the only possible escape from the emotional labyrinth that threatened to entrap and destroy her. That she survived to create <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>&#x02014;which, "by the madness which interrupts it, . . . opens a void, a moment of silence," wherein "the world finds itself arraigned . . . and responsible before it for what it is"&#x02014;gives Woolf the stature of a Picasso and makes <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> a work to set beside Picasso's <i>Minotauromachy</i>.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
But in May 1904, when Virginia broke down after being escorted home from Paris by George, thirty-six-year-old George had for some time been trying to settle his own future. And if George had sex, age, wealth, and convention on his side in their minotauromachy, his eventual good fortune was also hers, for once he did so his solicitude for 

<b></b>

his sisters ebbed. When George was refused by Wilfrid Blunt's daughter Judith, Woolf recalled, "he sat at the head of the table sobbing loudly, but continuing to eat" ("HPG," 167). Next, Lady Flora Russell briefly accepted him, and an enthusiastic Virginia wired, "She is an angel," signing her family nickname "Goat"; that the telegram delivered read "'She is an aged Goat' . . . had something to do, George said, with Flora's reluctance to ally herself with the Stephen family" after all ("HPG," 167). Woolf hangs this comic anecdote on an error of transmission, and anyone who has worked with Woolf's elegant but elliptical handwriting knows the telegraph operator's predicament.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Still, since the assumption of conjugal duties by the elder fianc&#x000E9;e, or "aged Goat," would have relieved the hapless young Goat of her duty to preserve George from the arms of whores, we can't rule out a Freudian slip. No matter. Suddenly that summer, Bell writes, "like a Goddess from a Machine, came Lady Margaret Herbert. George proposed; she accepted . . . they were married. . . . The Bloomsbury m&#x000E9;nage was saved from disaster," and Virginia emerged from suicidal madness to embark on a new life, "full of experiments and reforms," at 46 Gordon Square (<i>VW</i>, 1:96; "OB," 185).
</p>

<p>
With their immediate experience of modernism's unacknowledged brothels behind them at last, Vanessa and Virginia embraced Bloomsbury's new freedoms by degrees. Years before she met Roger Fry, Vanessa had read Camille Mauclair's 1903 <i>The French Impressionists</i> and learned that "living painters might be as alive as the dead, and that there was something besides the lovely quality of old paint to be aimed at, something fundamental and permanent and as discoverable now as in any other age."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  At first it seemed to her that Charles Furse and the New English Art Club (NEAC) had "the secret of the art universe within their grasp, a secret one was not worthy to learn, especially if one was that terrible low creature, a female painter"; but by 1905 she decided, after viewing an NEAC exhibition, that Steer, Tonks and Furse had already done their best work, so that "one could take no interest in their development."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Although Vanessa had seen works by Van Gogh, C&#x000E9;zanne, and Degas before 1910, when the post-impressionist show opened she found in the French paintings "a sudden liberation &amp; encouragement to feel for oneself which were absolutely overwhelming . . . as if at last one might say things one had always felt instead of trying to say things that other people told one to feel. Freedom was given one to be oneself &amp; that to the young is the most exciting thing that can happen"&#x02014;as the evolution of her style from <i>Iceland Poppies</i> (<a href="#3"> 13</a>), exhibited at the NEAC in 1909, to <i>Nude with Poppies</i> of 1916 (<a href="#4"> 14</a>) suggests.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
As for private freedoms, both sisters "in effect entered the smoking-room and joined in the all-male chat."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Possibly Virginia's delicately sardonic 1906 review of <i>Euphrosyne</i> , a privately printed book of mostly insipid poems by Thoby's Cambridge friends&#x02014;among them a male speaker's lament of having earlier ruined a young woman he has encountered again by chance in a brothel&#x02014;owed something to the hyper-alertness to obscenity, hypocrisy, and indecency that her minotauromachy had thrust upon her.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Certainly 1906 marked a watershed between the sisters' thralldom to repressive Kensington hypocrisy and Bloomsbury freedom. "Margaret [Duckworth] sends a post card," Virginia wrote Violet, "to say 'I quite understand. Shant expect you 

<b></b>

at Devonshire House or Osterley or anywhere' is that a snub? I think so&#x02014;but we had to bring it upon us, and the sooner the better. And now we are free women! Any form of slavery is Degrading&#x02014;and the damage done to the mind is worse than that done to the body!!" (<i>LVW</i>, 1:228, 29 June).
</p>

<p>
A few days before Virginia issued this elated emancipation proclamation, she wrote her first extant short story. Unpublished and untitled by its author&#x02014;"Wed. June 20&#x02013;23rd. 1906." appears at the top of the first page&#x02014;it bears the title "Phyllis and Rosamond" assigned it by Quentin Bell.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Its [eponymous] characters&#x02014;two sisters of marriageable, indeed urgently marriageable, age&#x02014;follow a Kensington evening like those the Stephen sisters had by now forever escaped with a late-night visit to the beautiful Miss Tristram and her novelist sister, Sylvia, in a Bloomsbury square. This scenario doubles, mirrors, and contrasts the Stephen sisters' successive lives in two London neighborhoods as each pair of sisters regards the other across an almost unbridgeable social divide.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  Phyllis and Rosamond are the women Vanessa and Virginia might have had to struggle even harder not to become had their parents and Stella lived, while the orphaned (a condition perhaps registered in their surname) Tristram sisters dwell in a freedom Phyllis and Rosamond only glimpse from their own position of "slavery."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Whereas these latter two cannot escape the marriage market&#x02014;portal to the only future either can imagine&#x02014;Miss Tristram and the autobiographical Sylvia (whose name, from Latin <i>silvanus</i>, makes her the first of many autobiographical artist-res associated with trees) inhabit a periphery of the socioeconomic sex/gender system.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  They have money enough for rooms of their own, discuss sex and marriage freely in mixed-sex conversation, can choose to marry or not, and meanwhile flourish unchaperoned in stimulating company.
</p>

<p>
Was this the story Virginia sent her friend Madge Vaughan, who replied that Virginia had "no heart&#x02014;at least in my writing"? "[R]eally I begin to get alarmed," Virginia mused, foreshadowing <i>Orlando</i>. "If marriage is necessary to one's style, I shall have to think about it. There is some truth in it, isn't there?&#x02014;but not the whole truth. And there is something indecent, to my virgin mind, in a maiden having that kind of heart. 'The air is full of it' says Madge: but I breathe something else" (<i>LVW</i>, 1:228, June? 1906). Far from Kensington's unacknowledged brothels, Virginia breathes freedom in a Bloomsbury home that "could never have meant what it did had not 22 Hyde Park Gate preceded it"&#x02014;and, rather than enter the socioeconomic marriage system, vivisects it ("OB," 182).
</p>

<p>
For Vanessa and Virginia, modern women artists who wrested control of their destiny from the marriage market, not only thought and speech but love and mating partook of a new freedom, floated on comfortable inheritances that were stretched by communal living and supplemented by paid work.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  At 46 Gordon Square the four Stephens were ontological if not economic and political equals: the leveling effects of siblinghood and birth order counterweighed their differential sex privilege.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Having disengaged themselves from George and Lady Margaret as well as other connections who expressed alarm at the intoxicating air the sisters now breathed, Vanessa and Virginia seized freedom each in her own way.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  The adorably bawdy Vanessa&#x02014;to

whose own minotauromachy Duncan Grant's 1917 <i>Leda and the Duck</i> (<a href="#5"> 15</a>) may allude&#x02014;married the wealthy libertine Clive and, in what soon became an open marriage, took as lovers first Fry, then Duncan Grant (who seemed to her an imperturbable fortress of inner freedom); she raised three children by two fathers and pursued in her painting the path opened by the post-impressionists.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  Like Virginia's, Vanessa's life and art gave the personal, social, and public freedoms of Clive's French model a local habitation and a name, as they exemplify women as subjects and "agents" rather than mute objects or "patients" of those freedoms ("IBM," 1:1). Vanessa's 1913&#x02013;1914 <i>Adam and Eve</i> designs for Omega Workshop domestic furnishings&#x02014;a screen, a bedstead (<a href="#6">. 16</a>, 17)&#x02014;evoke a joyous sensual paradise free of hypocritical censure, whether divine, parental, or imposed by the British Public. In its bold, still intensity, her 1917 <i>Tub</i> (<a href="#8"> 18</a>) stands with Gauguin's and Picasso's expressionist nudes.
</p>

<p>
If Vanessa parlayed French bohemia into Bloomsbury's mixed-sex artists' milieu and French expressionism into an emancipatory modernism that, a century later, still eludes some cultural historians, Virginia Woolf's life and work are shaped by a different confluence of "French" personal, social, and public freedoms with "British" political freedoms.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  She married Leonard Woolf, a "penniless" but brilliantly gifted and Cambridge-educated "Jew"; had a passionate affair with Vita Sackville-West; and produced an oeuvre that stands with Picasso's and Joyce's in conceptual and analytic power, stylistic range, invention, and virtuosity, and sheer imaginative genius (<i>LVW</i>, 1:500, 4 June 1912). Whereas Vanessa brought the fruits of her private freedom to the public eye through painting, Virginia created literary masterworks even as she publicly claimed for women not only the private, personal, social, and expressive freedoms Clive associates with France but the collective political freedom he attributes to England. Thus in 1910, while enjoying the French paintings Fry and MacCarthy had brought to London, Virginia was also stuffing envelopes and attending suffrage meetings. Although Leonard, who revered Pericles's funeral oration on civilization's unwritten laws, sang Virginia's praises as "Aspasia" (after Pericles' learned and eloquent mistress), it was not lost on Virginia that Aspasia was neither Pericles' wife nor (like other Greek women) a citizen of his great democracy. When the name "Aspasia" surfaces briefly in the 1920&#x02013;1921 manuscript of <i>Jacob's Room</i>, Jacob Flanders is thinking of the London prostitute who sits on his knee as "did all good women in the days of the Greeks"&#x02014;her name "bestowed . . . by a painter who had wished it to signify that the flower of her maidenhood was still unplucked": Florinda, who, if she "had had a mind, . . . might have read" the contradictions of her position "with clearer eyes than we can."<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
By the time she wrote those words, Woolf was a modern Aspasia with a vote, a pen, and a press&#x02014;a genius on the order of Picasso whose portrayal of the "horribly brainless" Florinda pursues the "noble work" of letting light in on London's brothels in a way that refrains from driving the horribly brainless George to shoot himself.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  For Woolf as for Joyce and Picasso, the brothels of modernism are nothing so simple as an "aesthetic space" ("IBM," 1:1). Taken together, these artists make visible the socioeconomic link between the brothels of Dublin and Barcelona and the unacknowledged spaces of enslavement in "respectable" houses in Kensington and beyond. In doing so, they bring

to light a realist underworld that exceeds the bounded nighttowns Scholes imagines impenetrable to all but men and prostitutes. As for the young "Goat" conscripted into "Greek slavery" and a minotauromachy that almost vanquished her, Woolf survived to embrace freedom of body and mind, founded on a room of her own with a lock on the door and sustained by her inheritance, paid journalism, aunt's legacy, novels, and Press. Both the art she created out of her "French" personal, social, and public freedom and her eloquent calls for women to claim "British" political freedom resonate far beyond Bloomsbury's borders of time and space.

her work speaks ever more widely to women and men around the world. And if the gender of freedom is any less a problem in our day than when Woolf pondered it in her late essay "Professions for Women," that is in part because her work unchains modernism from sentimental voyeurism and trains an analytic gaze on the project of freedom that engendered many of modernism's experiments and reforms. Finally, what makes Woolf an author "at least as interesting as Joyce" ("IBM," 1:2)&#x02014;and a painter of modern life that no deep understanding of modernism, no real recognition of its analytic power and its emancipatory project, can ignore&#x02014;is not that she wrote from within modernism's brothels but that she survived her minotauromachy, wounded yet with her genius unscathed, to see with clear eyes far beyond them.

Thus, annoying as Adrian Stephen may have found Vanessa's delight in "bawdy remark[s]" as well as Virginia's "daring sallies" and the Bloomsbury "method of wooing" she deployed upon Leonard (i. e., "to talk about nothing but fucking and [illegible] which she calls with a great leer copulation and WCs and I dare say she will be successful, I hope so anyway"), he had neither George's sensibility nor his influence (Jean MacGibbon, <i>There's the Lighthouse: A Biography of Adrian Stephen</i> [London: James &amp; James, 1997], 64, 84).

E.g., Hugh Kenner, whom Scholes cites, equates high modernism with American and Irish expatriate art (Pound, Eliot, Joyce, Stein) and, ignoring Bloomsbury's internationalism, places Woolf with "provincial," "regional" authors such as Faulkner and Williams ("The Making of the Modernist Canon," <i>Chicago Review</i> 34 [Spring 1984], 49&#x02013;61).
