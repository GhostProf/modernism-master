[H]e listened with a pleasure because she was singing again, but this was quickly altered by the way she sang. Not the passion of her at sixteen but echoing the tentative circle of light around her in the darkness. She was singing as if it was something scarred, as if one couldn't ever again bring all the hope of the song together. It had been altered by the five years leading to this night of her twenty-first birthday in the forty-fifth year of the twentieth century. Singing in the voice of a tired traveller, alone against everything. A new testament. There was no certainty to the song anymore, the singer could only be one voice against all the mountains of power. . . . The one voice was the single unspoiled thing. A song of snail light.

<p class="noIndent">
In an essay on Jean-Fran&#x000E7;ois Lyotard, "Modernism and the End of Beauty," Calvin Bedient raises the vital question of the place of aestheticism in our dark age. He asks what art has lost in the postmodern era; specifically, he asks whether the notion of beauty based on "a Hellenic ideal of a harmony of the mind and senses" (prescribed by Arnold and Pater and "revived, in however altered a manner," by modernist writers) is plausible after the death camps.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Bedient connects that idea of beauty with eros and, paradoxically, with the death drive, as the presence of the sublime&#x02014;of what we might, perhaps, call epiphanic moments&#x02014;cannot be unlinked from death. (It is this pairing that Bedient deftly calls the "jack-in-the-box terrorism of eros" ["MEB," 109]). And indeed, a return to the origins of this particular ethos in modernism (the epiphanic ethos, which eroticizes the sudden discovery of meaning in a wider context of ultimate meaninglessness) together with a closer engagement with its early proponent, Walter Pater, suggest an unmistakable, decadent preoccupation not just with death in the abstract, but with corpses and ghosts. That preoccupation seems both ironic and prescient in retrospect, after a corpse-strewn century in which it is hard to imagine an experimental literature <i>not</i> haunted by bodies.
</p>

<p>
Epiphany, by definition, emerges from darkness. But how is the darkness of a writerly sensibility half in love with easeful death (a sensibility which knew nothing of industrialized warfare, let alone atomic or mechanized killing) in any traceable or meaningful way linked to the darkness of the world itself? What is its connection with the resultant miasma inhabited by any would-be aesthete, in the postmodern era? How can dead bodies, eroticized by Pater, still be aestheticized by any writer of conscience, no matter how in love with Renaissance art? The noted Holocaust scholar Laurence Langer poses the issue this way in his <i>Holocaust Testimonies: The Ruins of Memory</i>: "Helena B. [a Holocaust survivor] . . . tells of the day when a friend came up to her . . . carrying a woman's <i>foot</i>. . . . Whatever the exact cause, the fragmentation of the physical self conveyed by this stark image remains overpowering. [ . . . ] Among the many victims of the Holocaust was the classical idea of the beauty of the human <i>form</i>" (emphasis in original).<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Bedient writes:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
As if heeding Matthew Arnold and Pater, the modernists revived, in however altered a manner, the Hellenic ideal of a harmony of the mind and senses. . . . But this ideal has 

<b></b>

died in a horde of destructions. For the most part, today's art has lost erotic eagerness. . . . Though this collapse of the body as an enjoying substance (in a Lacanian phrase) began long before the death camps, if not long before the Great War, the shame oozing from the camps is its inescapable sign and explanation. And this shame <i>can</i> be articulated.

<p>
Bedient goes on to cite Primo Levi, expert on shame, but his general point about its articulability is reminiscent of W. G. Sebald declaring that the conscientious writer&#x02014;in this case, Peter Weiss, but the same might be said of Sebald himself&#x02014;binds himself on a wheel in which absolution is only to be gained by the continual re-representation of humanity's cruelty. This is far from "beauty" as we understand it. Nonetheless an examination of Sebald's work, of the artists he prefers and the way he looks at their paintings, suggests that we may still be permitted a sense of beauty for moments at a time if those moments are predicated on a recognition of that which is out of joint, perverted, twisted&#x02014;of that which has potential to spoil the beautiful picture and, at the same time, makes it truthful in an age of atrocities.
</p>

<p>
Sebald thus represents the end-point (for the moment) of a process begun by Walter Pater in <i>The Renaissance</i>, his celebration of the odd, the oblique, and the striking in painterly representations, particularly of the human face and body. For Pater, such attention to oddity represents a subversive unorthodoxy. It is intimately tied to his queerness at a time when homosexuality was outlawed in England, and it inaugurates a modernist vision insistent upon the seemingly offhand, yet ultimately significant image or moment. Michael Ondaatje, who is perhaps perversely inserted here in a discussion linking the proto-modernist Pater and the postmodern Sebald, is instructive as a postmodern Romantic yearning for beauty in an era of extreme violations. It is no accident that the main characters in his story of a charred body, <i>The English Patient</i>, are an explorer, a sapper, a nurse, and a thief. Because of their vocations, all of these res are compelled to be exceptionally attentive to what others overlook. They must notice telltale signs and symptoms and attend to them. Detail cannot elude them. (Yet all except the eponymous central re are confounded by a mystery: who is this patient Englishman who lies in their midst, half revealing secrets? Is he English at all?) Their world is the chiaroscuro world of the Renaissance painter Caravaggio, who reveals details in all their sordid humanity in an atmosphere of darkness penetrated by oblique light. They must find their way in a literal minefield by locating the details that matter.
</p>

<p>
In her book <i>Reading in Detail: Aesthetics and the Feminine</i>, the late feminist theorist Naomi Schor interrogates the classical contempt for details, and examines their increasing prestige in the twentieth century (especially in the post-structuralist era):
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
[A]s any historian of ideas knows, the detail has until very recently been viewed in the West with suspicion if not downright hostility. The censure of the particular is one of the enabling gestures of neo-classicism, which recycled into the modern age the classical equation of the Ideal with the absence of all particularity. The normative aesthetics of neo-classicism did not, however, simply fade away upon the advent of Romanticism; 

<b></b>

constantly reinscribed throughout the nineteenth century they continue to resurface well into the twentieth, constituting the indelible marker of nostalgics of the Ideal. . . . Viewed in a historical perspective, the ongoing valorization of the detail appears to be an essential aspect of that dismantling of Idealist metaphysics which looms so large on the agenda of modernity.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The nostalgia for classical perfection that carries on into the twentieth century manifests itself in the politics of racial perfection, with the idea of the perfect physical type and the subhuman race that sullies the picture of human perfectibility. This is a metaphysics insistent on the wiping-out of difference, and, according to some thinkers, the end point of Enlightenment idealism, whose light was ultimately so bright that difference appeared as a blot. "Is the detail feminine?" asks Schor (<i>RiD</i>, 11), and concludes that, inasmuch as it is associated with d&#x000E9;cor and domesticity, with both the ornamental and the quotidian, and with that which distracts from the central icons of masculine hierarchy, it is. "[W]hat is most threatening about the detail [is] its tendency to subvert an internal hierarchic ordering of the work of art which clearly subordinates the periphery to the center, the accessory to the principal, the foreground to the background" (<i>RiD</i>, 20). Pater's attention to intimations and obliquities was similarly threatening to the authorities of Oxford and the conservatives of his intellectual circle, who condemned the so-called hedonism of his prescription for aesthetic attentiveness and pleasure.
</p>

<p>
Mieke Bal, another feminist art historian, carries on Schor's project in her own critique of Enlightenment oversimplifications and her insistence on the ethics of the detail&#x02014;or rather on the ethics of reading the detail, and reading it against the grain of conventional interpretation. Her argument in <i>Reading "Rembrandt": Beyond the Word-Image Opposition </i>is directed consistently against "the logos turned doxa, the general cultural interpretation of the text which is, in <i>its</i> turn, a misreading."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  To this end, Bal attends to the oblique detail. Her introduction contains a rumination on Vermeer's well-known painting <i>Woman Holding a Balance </i>(ca. 1662&#x02013;4), which itself contains an image of the <i>Last Judgment</i> hanging on the wall behind the woman. Bal's attention is deflected, however, by a nail and hole the painter has included in the wall to the left of the painting, emphasized by the light entering the window in front of the woman. These compel speculation:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
For me [Bal is here at pains to emphasize the subjectiveness of reading paintings] it was the nail and the hole that the light made visible, produced; that instigated a burst of speculative fertility. When I saw this nail, the hole, and the shadows, I was fascinated: I could not keep my eyes off them. . . .<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  The painter surely did not need to <i>paint</i> the nail and the hole, even if, in setting up his studio, he actually may have displaced the <i>Last Judgment</i>.
<p class="blockquote">. . . The nail and the hole, both visual elements to which no iconographic meaning is attached, unsettle the poetic description and the passively admiring gaze that it triggered, and dynamize the activity of the viewer.

<p>
This dynamic activity is the one embodied in a modernist ur-text, Virginia Woolf's early short story "The Mark on the Wall" &#x02014;a work essential to an understanding 

<b></b>

of modernist subjectivism and subversiveness. In "The Mark on the Wall," the narrator gazes at the eponymous spot and free associates; that free association is both the aesthetic of the story&#x02014;the mode the story is built in, its style&#x02014;and its ethos. The ruminating narrator is a rebellious soul averse to hierarchical orderings and "generalizations," and her stream-of-consciousness constitutes a reaction against such imposed structures and strictures.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  To attach one's eye to a small spot and let the mind wander is to free oneself of what Bal calls "doxa," official interpretations that hide truth or stunt imagination; Woolf's story contains numerous examples of such doxa, beginning, paradoxically, with "that old fancy"&#x02014;paradoxically because fancy, in the sense of whimsicality, is precisely what the story would seem to endorse. In this case, however, a fancy is a kind of old myth, an enshrined image that imprisons consciousness: "that old fancy of the crimson flag flapping from the castle tower . . . and . . . the cavalcade of red knights riding up the side of the black rock. . . . [I]t is an old fancy, an automatic fancy, made as a child perhaps."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  It is a moment remarkably similar to that later moment in Woolf's 1927 novel <i>To the Lighthouse</i> when Mrs. Ramsay, letting her mind wander, suddenly finds herself uttering the phrase "We are in the hands of the Lord" and instantly reprimands herself for the automatism and insincerity of the sentiment. Such doxa keep us from discovering our own subjective truths; worse, they can be used to mask atrocity. The feudal romance of knights aestheticizes the violence knights do; moreover, such romances imprison women writers, since the female re, most likely inside the tower, cannot act for herself but can only be rescued, abducted, at best wooed.
</p>

<p>
As Perry Meisel has suggested in <i>The Absent Father: Virginia Woolf and Walter Pater</i>, from the mix of Woolf's feminist and aestheticist sensibilities she derived, through Pater, the inclination to privilege play, happy accident, and contingency over fixed assumptions. The Woolfian mode of observation is a form of inattentive attention that allows the unorthodox and the seemingly incidental to occupy center stage in the mind long enough to un-do certainties about the way the world works or what one "should" believe, but not long enough to harden into new doxa. Wolfgang Iser calls this spirit in Pater simply "scepticism": "The sceptical, relative spirit," he writes, "is a countervailing force, subverting and undoing all frameworks set up by the filing system of the human mind. It releases the facts from their subservience to general principles to which they have been yoked by the absolute spirit. In undercutting all normative ordering, it highlights open-endedness . . . "<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Carried on into our late age, this Paterianism involves a restoration; not a regeneration, precisely, but a re-revealment of what has been deliberately hidden or, in Paul Celan's words "written asunder."

Here is John Ruskin lecturing on Botticelli&#x02014;all Victorian reassurance:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
[In the Uffizi's "Judith and Holofernes," Judith] is returning to the camp of Israel, followed by her maid carrying the head of Holofernes. And she walks in one of Botticelli's light dancing actions, her drapery all on flutter. . . .

<b></b>

<p class="blockquote">
	And at first glance&#x02014;you will think the re merely a piece of fifteenth-century affectation. "Judith, indeed!&#x02014;say rather the daughter of Herodias, at her mincingest." 
<p class="blockquote">
	Well, yes&#x02014;Botticelli <i>is</i> affected. . . . And he likes twisting the fingers of hands about, just as Correggio does. But he never does it like Correggio, without cause. 
<p class="blockquote">
	Look at Judith again,&#x02014;at her face, not her drapery. . . . 
<p class="blockquote">
	[Y]ou will feel . . . that [Judith] is not merely the Jewish Delilah to the Assyrian Samson; but the mightiest, purest, brightest type of high passion in severe womanhood offered to our human memory. Sandro's picture is but slight; but it is true to her. . . .<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Ruskin looks past unorthodoxy, past multiplicity and confusion&#x02014;myriad folds, queerly turned fingers&#x02014;to purity, single-mindedness, chaste Victorian femininity. Here, Walter Pater describes Botticelli's Virgin Mary:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
[W]ith Botticelli she too . . . is one of those who are neither for Jehovah nor for his enemies. . . . Her trouble is in the very caress of the mysterious child, whose gaze is always far from her, and who has already that sweet look of devotion which men have never been able altogether to love, and which still makes the born saint an object almost of suspicion to his earthly brethren. Once, indeed, he guides her hand to transcribe in a book the words of her exaltation. . . . But the pen almost drops from her hand, and the high cold words have no meaning for her, and her true children are those others, among whom, in her rude home, the intolerable honour came to her . . . &#x02014;gipsy [sic.] children, such as those who, in Appenine villages, still hold out their long brown arms to beg of you, but on Sundays become <i>enfants du choeur</i>, with their thick black hair nicely combed, and fair white linen on their sunburnt throats. 
<p class="blockquote">. . . [Botticelli] paints Madonnas, but they shrink from the pressure of the divine child, and plead in unmistakable undertones for a warmer, lower humanity.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
It is the very opposite move to Ruskin's. Where Ruskin wishes to right wrongs&#x02014;a misperception of unorthodoxy, of art for art's sake (an idea Ruskin vehemently eschews), of pleasure in virtuosity and neglect of virtue&#x02014;Pater prefers a sinister interpretation. Just as Pater detects leftwardness in Leonardo&#x02014;who begins his career as an individual painter by executing an angel in the "left-hand corner" of a Verrocchio Baptism of Christ; whose John the Baptist and other smiling res have "a touch of something sinister"; who, "though he handles sacred subjects continually, . . . is the most profane of painters"; to whom the Renaissance itself is "that rebellion, that sinister claim for liberty of heart and thought" (<i>R</i>, 16)&#x02014;he discovers the human, earthy needs beneath the madonna's garb of saintliness. And as he sees Botticelli projected on his madonnas, Pater projects himself on Botticelli, with his ambivalence&#x02014;"neither for Jehovah nor his enemies"&#x02014;and his virtuosity that betrays forbidden orientations. ("Pater's refusal to oppose religion is a refusal to engage in dogmatic disputes," says Richard Dellamora. Dellamora quotes Pater on his suppression of the original conclusion to <i>The Renaissance</i>, wishing to "avoid 'well-recognised controversy, with rigidly defined opposites, exhausting the intelligence and limiting one's sympathies.")<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Discernible in Pater's famous purple prose is his desire to spill over, and his interpretations demonstrate his sympathy with others who, like him, are subject to efforts at containment; as Dellamora writes, "Pater subtly alters current . . . theory by reading the myths to 

<b></b>

which he directs his attention as the coded protest of marginalized groups."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Gypsies, it happens&#x02014;those untamed persons who, like the madonna, are Christians on Sunday and dirty, demanding, uncontainable when no religious authority is looking&#x02014;are among the most marginalized peoples of Europe; they were the only group besides Jews the Nazis singled out for extermination.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  If Pater could not foresee this, he nonetheless knew what gypsies represented: unpoliceable energy, an elusive mobility that threatens propriety.
</p>

<p>
Pater comes from the edges to unsettle the center, an approach which cost him something in his own career as Oxford don and compelled him publicly to retract some of his more overt statements endorsing a life of aesthetic pleasure. His influence, however, remained; as Denis Donoghue, one of his biographers, writes, "Pater is a shade or trace in virtually every writer of any significance from Hopkins and Wilde to Ashbery."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Donoghue's trope of "shade or trace" is deliberately chosen, as Pater deals throughout his writerly career primarily in chiaroscuro and communes with res he perceives as ghosts. He detects something haunting in the lives and pictures he gazes at, a residue or hidden truth "d'outre tombe" (<i>R</i>, 59) that betrays itself in expression or gesture, or simply in the pattern of light against dark&#x02014;for light is always defined as contrast to, or difference from, dark.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> To Pater the modernists owe their conception of epiphany, the visionary glimpse defined against the dullness of habit or the obscurity of mere background. As in Caravaggio (a painter impossible not to think of in connection with Pater's chiaroscuro and his focus on unorthodox lives, early deaths, and homoerotic proclivities), such glimpses are not by definition elevated or metaphysical, but can reveal a magus's unclean foot soles or a saint's encrusted nails. ("[A] taste for metaphysics may be one of those things we must renounce," writes Pater in the chapter on Winckelmann.) David Trotter describes the sensuous focus of Pater's art criticism as "let[ting] loose in the mind a palpable instability. What is at issue . . . may be . . . dirt, seepage, stickiness"&#x02014;the messy stuff rejected by orthodoxies and order-mongerers.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  It is, in short, an aestheticism that does not necessarily favor prettiness over truth; nor, on the other hand, does it reject prettiness as mere embellishment in favor of a higher moral purpose, as Ruskin does.
</p>

<p>
Such an aestheticism implies an ethics as well, one that eschews the untouchability mandated by caste, homophobia, or precious (Ruskinian) attitudes toward the art object. Pater's responsiveness to art, and to the artists whose spirit he strives to imagine and embody, is tactile, fleshly, physical rather than metaphysical. He locates his own attitude in Abelard's love of Heloise: "he tries to find a ground of reality below the abstractions of philosophy, as one bent on trying all things by their congruity with human experience, who had felt the hand of Heloise"(<i>R</i>, 5). His mode of reading&#x02014;or rather, of looking&#x02014;attends to the body and its signs; he sees gestures, indications, of desire and unorthodoxy, in hands or drapery, the very details Ruskin wishes to deny. This is partly because he values the act of looking in and of itself, an attitude Donoghue repeatedly emphasizes: "Pater's sentences ask to be read as if they wanted to be looked at, not merely to be understood" (<i>WP</i>, 133); "[a]t the beginning [of an essay], he seems merely to be looking at something, not very closely" (<i>WP</i>, 308). "Not merely 

<b></b>

to be understood": Pater's unorthodoxy stands the normal looking-reading hierarchy on its head, suggesting that "merely" to take in (the receptive attitude) might be more valuable than interpretation or theorizing (the imposing attitude). As Donoghue writes, "To work undisturbed by any moral ambition is itself a moral ambition" (<i>WP</i>, 132). Pater's aesthetic suggests an ethical reading mode for a dark time: not to cast excessive light on the object, rather to keep an open eye toward the small light the object itself might cast. To see this light, the reader must be unprejudiced, even, in a way, unfocused: looking directly at something may yield less vital information than gazing obliquely.
</p>

<p>
Upon Pater's death, Henry James damned him with the following faint praise: "He reminds me, in the disturbed midnight of our actual literature, of one of those lucent matchboxes which you place, on going to bed, near the candle, to show you, in the darkness, where you can strike a light: he shines in the uneasy gloom&#x02014;vaguely, and has a phosphorescence, not a flame" (cited in <i>WP</i>, 14). In a 1974 assessment, Harold Bloom "venture[d] the prophecy that [Pater] will prove . . . to be the valued precurser of a Post-Modernism still fated to be another Last Romanticism."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Given the human histories of fire, to be merely phosphorescent in this post-Holocaust, post-Hiroshima age might be the most moral way of shedding light on a subject. In <i>Rings of Saturn</i>, W. G. Sebald devotes a lengthy excursus to the peculiar phosphorescence of the over-fished herring, contrasting the herring's gleam to man's "relentless conquest of darkness" and its resulting horrific conflagrations.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Pater's held-over, skeptical Romanticism, his unassuming glow, is surely the appropriate ethos for any postmodern work that attempts to celebrate beauty in a century of burned bodies.

There is no one way to read in <i>The English Patient</i>. All the characters are readers of a sort; they read for a living, indeed, they read for their lives&#x02014;and others'. Hana, the nurse, must read the symptoms of soldiers too incapacitated to voice needs. She also spends a portion of the book reading aloud&#x02014;to the English patient, who is an explorer, a mapmaker, a reader of landscapes as well as an avid autodidactic reader of classical texts. Kip, the Indian sapper, reads landscapes and furniture for hidden mines; he reads the insides of bombs. (People can also be bombs&#x02014;they are certainly texts&#x02014;in this novel about dangerous human potentialities, hidden possibilities of explosion.) Caravaggio the thief read the shadowy interiors of Toronto houses before the war; now his skills of discovery are employed by the English for spying.
</p>

<p>
There is no one way of reading, nor is reading unidirectional. Spies espy spies. Love is described as a mutual act of reading, discernment. War is a process of two sides out-reading one another. Each time a bomb mechanism is correctly interpreted, the Germans change their strategy; Kip must look for the "new joke" inside the bomb. The written guidelines are insufficient; the sapper's acts of interpretation must arise unassisted. The English patient is the most elusive text within the novel. Because of its title, the identification sticks with readers; although Alm&#x000E1;sy's "true" identity is revealed by Caravaggio (the spy-espying spy) long before the novel's end, nonetheless 

<b></b>

we remember him as "the English patient." The very precision of that label&#x02014;the man is English, he is patient&#x02014;finally produces vagueness, a cloud like the veil of black skin that encrusts the burned man.
</p>

<p>
How we read skin color, the multiple or singular valences of "race," is also a subject of this novel. In descriptions of the devastation of Hiroshima, human beings burned black recur; Caravaggio agrees with the suddenly-racialized, furious Sikh: "They would never have dropped such a bomb on a white nation" (<i>EP</i>, 286). Up to this moment, disbelieving Caravaggio's word to the contrary, both Kip and Hana have clung to their delusions about the patient's identity&#x02014;"the man burned black. Who turned out to be, up close, an Englishman" (<i>EP</i>, 85). Both find odd comfort in their misreading, Hana because she cannot let go of the memory of her father, a Canadian soldier who died of his war burns, Kip because of his loyalty to his own substitute father, Lord Suffolk, who trained him in the dismantling of bombs. This touching imposition of his own text mutates into a tragic illiteracy when Kip, devastated by the ultimate devastation of a Bomb to end all bombs, can see only a white Englishman in the bed before him. Now the commonality of all texts, the community of cultures, is permanently desecrated: "[H]e had believed in the burned man and the civilisation he tended. Isaiah and Jeremiah and Solomon were in the burned man's bedside book, his holy book, whatever he had loved glued into his own. He had passed the book to the sapper, and the sapper had said we have a Holy Book too" (<i>EP</i>, 294). The tragedy is unspeakable: an Asian has risked his life daily, minutely, reading the landscape, for the English side; now that very side has created an unreadable bomb, an ultimate text: a "Let there be light" that destroys cultures. He "does not feel he can draw a match out of his bag and fire the lamp, for he believes the lamp will ignite everything" (<i>EP</i>, 294); he vilifies the man in the bed, and deserts from the British army.
</p>

<p>
Kip's inability to light a match in the darkness has its analogue in Alm&#x000E1;sy's final moments in the book, which are also the final moments of his life:
</p>

<p>
The ghostly presence is almost certainly Kip watching Alm&#x000E1;sy in the darkness; it is also, perhaps, Katharine, the now-dead woman he loved in Egypt; and it is Alm&#x000E1;sy's impending death. The loss of all light is the result of a light so immense, so terrible, that it obliterates in one flash thousands of individual flames.
</p>

<p>
The vignette of Alm&#x000E1;sy clutching his own book (by implication Ondaatje's book <i>is</i> Alm&#x000E1;sy's book; it is Alm&#x000E1;sy himself, a darkened text, endlessly readable) while the candle 

<b></b>

goes out, recalls a scene from a novel that attempted to grapple with the devastation of World War I. "Time Passes," the consciously crafted median passage of Virginia Woolf's <i>To the Lighthouse</i>, is divided into ten sections; the first begins in gathering darkness, with the imminent obliteration of the shoreline foreshadowing the imminent disaster of world war. Characters move into the house and turn out lights: "One by one the lamps were all extinguished, except that Mr. Carmichael, who liked to lie awake a little reading Virgil kept his candle burning rather longer than the rest."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  As readers know, the international catastrophe is mirrored by the domestic catastrophes of Prue and Mrs. Ramsay's deaths; the house stands empty for ten years, nearly falling into ruin, until, at the end of the chapter, most of the characters return. "[P]eace had come. . . . Mr. Carmichael read a book by candlelight."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  The return of peace is mirrored within the household through the repetition of this vignette. And such repetitions and returns are hallmarks of modernism, which, in its dream of an ultimate harmony, trains readers to look for patterns within apparent disorder.
</p>

<p>
Some modernist writers sought harmony within a larger Order, tending toward fascism; others envisioned individual orders subject to constant rejuxtaposition and rearrangement. <i>The English Patient</i>, in its postmodern moment, carries over the latter ethos from modernism. Some argue, basing their response more on the film than the book, that it leans toward the former in its romanticization of a central re who is, when all is said and done, a spy for the Germans. But Alm&#x000E1;sy, despite his shady dealings, cannot be reduced to a villain; though he searches for origins, his mode of reading is nonhierarchical, juxtaposing the texts of different cultures rather than seeking to promote the primacy of one, and Kip was initially right to believe in the English patient's respect for all books. "All morning he and [his colleague] have worked in the archeological museum placing Arabic texts and European histories beside each other in an attempt to recognize echo, coincidence, name changes&#x02014;back past Herodotus to the <i>Kitab al Kanuz</i>, where Zerzura is named after the bathing woman in a desert caravan" (<i>EP</i>, 153). Though an originary moment is assumed, it is worth noting that Alm&#x000E1;sy's reading practise asserts&#x02014;paradoxically, perhaps, but humanistically in the deepest, <i>humane</i> sense&#x02014;the originality of both the colonized culture and of acts of translation among cultures. An echo of Pater can be found here; critics agree that Pater ultimately deprivileges ideas of origin. He asserts a comparative religious sensibility echoed by Alm&#x000E1;sy: "The basis of the reconciliation of all the religions of the world would . . . be the inexhaustible activity and creativeness of the human mind itself, in which all religions alike have their root" (<i>EP</i>, 22). Even love, in <i>The English Patient</i>, is a kind of textual juxtaposition; a couple of pages later, Katharine and Alm&#x000E1;sy are described, "their foreignness intimate like two pages of a closed book" (<i>EP</i>, 155).
</p>

<p>
In Alm&#x000E1;sy's final act of reading, <i>The English Patient</i> adapts the formal symmetry of Woolf's candlelight-reading scene to a post-apocalyptic world in which a single object can kill and maim thousands in a moment.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  "Time Passes" moves fairly smoothly between images of war and bloodshed and images of natural cataclysm&#x02014;storms at sea, the ravages of winter&#x02014;but <i>The English Patient</i> asserts again and again the incongruity of natural and manmade disasters. The flash of a bomb blast may resemble lightning, 

<b></b>

but the former indicates man's terrible manipulations of nature, not his harmony with, or even his mimesis of, the natural world. Unlike Mr. Carmichael, Alm&#x000E1;sy cannot continue reading when war has ended, since this war has ended with an event so terrible that even the act of lighting a match feels dangerous. Pompeii and Herculaneum are alluded to as prelapsarian tragedies, as is World War I, whose bombs and trenches seem minor compared to the Bomb. Truly, after Hiroshima and Nagasaki (and Auschwitz and Belsen), the act of reading is changed utterly.
</p>

<p>
This is easy to say, however; not so easy to represent, particularly when artistic creation, whether through brushstrokes or poetic language, cannot help but be an assertion of hope. As John Berger maintains, in the first essay of a collection ending with an article on the paintings of Hiroshima survivors, the aesthetic moment is always a vision of life. When the English patient's candle goes out, he will die; this is the difference between him and Carmichael. But <i>The English Patient</i> lives, and lives in the reader's mind in quintessentially modernist fashion, through its innumerable epiphanic moments. It is fitting that one of the main characters, and finally the novel's most astute reader, is named Caravaggio. Early in the book, when Hana is reunited with this uncle-re from her past, she remembers how, as a child in Toronto, "she learned to read the summer night" (<i>EP</i>, 49). "You used to be like those artists who painted only at night," she tells Caravaggio, "a single light on in their street. Like the worm-pickers with their old coffee cans strapped to their ankles and the helmet of light shooting down into the grass" (<i>EP</i>, 55). The hunt by flashlight not only represents Caravaggio's thieving talents but also emblematizes the reading activity of all the characters in the novel (the nurse, the archeologist/explorer and spy, the sapper), who must be alert to traces and signs that full light or a head-on gaze too easily obliterate. They must be alert to life in all its forms, even "ugly" ones, even those that are inert.
</p>

<p>
Such seeing represents both the end and the ends of the aestheticism first expounded by Walter Pater. After Hiroshima, "reading by candlelight" becomes impossible; it also becomes, given the surrounding darkness, the only way to read. As an activity, it is both amoral&#x02014;his insistence on a purely impressionistic criticism was Pater's revision of Ruskin's Christian moralism, and his inauguration of modernism&#x02014;and ultimately ethical. The work of Caravaggio (unmentioned in Pater's <i>Renaissance</i> but, one would think, a perfect case study for a late-Romantic/postmodern sequel to Pater) was distinguished by its realism. Like the four characters of <i>The English Patient</i>, who seem both individual to the point of eccentricity and archetypically larger-than-life, the saints in Caravaggio's paintings were rendered as real people. Caravaggio's work was also distinguished for its tenebrist method, whereby an oblique light illumines features and gestures within an engulfing darkness. Darkness sets the scene from the start of Ondaatje's novel, in which the characters find themselves in a bombed-out villa without electric light; nearly every page contains at least one tenebrist detail, and a concordance would almost certainly find "dark" the text's most frequent word, with "light" a close second. But here light always emerges <i>from</i>, never dispels, darkness. It is a highly visual, highly aestheticized, Paterian way of seeing, in which space matters more than time. Indeed time barely moves for the period in which the English patient 

<b></b>

lies simultaneously dying and apparently static within his carbonized skin. Everything that "happens" in the novel has happened already; the war has dropped a curtain over all, and with the exception of Kip, the shell-shocked characters are hardly aware of themselves continuing to live. Surrounded by trompe l'oeil walls and half broken statues, they feel like res on a fresco. Even Kip, after dismantling a bomb with Hana's help, "felt he was now within something, perhaps a painting he had seen somewhere in the last year" (<i>EP</i>, 104).
</p>

<p>
Indeed, it is Kip, efficient, functional, superficially unscathed until the terrible moment when, out in the field, he hears the news of Hiroshima on his headphones, who functions as the novel's agent of a Paterian aestheticism and its measure of beauty's destruction. Kip, after all, is the character who most actively "appreciates" Italian art; Kip is the one who illumines, with his sapper's flare, the beautiful fresco of the Queen of Sheba. "Kip is my David," Alm&#x000E1;sy says, alluding to Caravaggio's <i>David with the Head of Goliath</i>; in his final fury, his act of desertion that precedes&#x02014;and possibly precipitates&#x02014;the death of the English patient, Kip eschews his former love of Western texts and images and asserts, albeit in a small way noticed by only a few individuals, the East's rebellion against imperial power and culture. In his very repudiation of a Western visual ethos, however, Kip apotheosizes the ethics of reading by candlelight: a reading that is finally, and fundamentally, a <i>looking</i>, and which therefore notes the value, the inherent life, of what is missed in bright light. Or, to put it slightly differently, "[o]ne of evil's principal modes of being is <i>looking beyond</i> (with indifference) that which is before the eyes."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Kip refuses to continue looking beyond.
</p>

<p>
Kip realizes that he has read so busily, he has missed the significance of each individual bomb; has failed to recognize the monstrous Bomb implicit in each small one. Hiroshima functions as a terrible epiphany that temporarily blinds him; the very character who is noted early on for his fastidious reading tastes ("[h]e turned away from mystery books with irritation, able to pinpoint villains with too much ease" [<i>EP</i>, 112]) pinpoints the burned patient as English, and a villain. We do not know whether he revises this reading, but we know that he becomes a doctor, not a soldier or a terrorist (people's potential to set, but also to <i>be</i>, bombs is suggested time and again through the novel's system of imagery). This vocation spiritually returns him to Hana, whom he had loved in the villa those many years ago. The particular moment that recalls her to him years later&#x02014;treating a chemical burn on the arm of a girl (<i>EP</i>, 300)&#x02014;can also recall to us, the readers, a moment easily overlooked, an abuse forgotten.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  It elucidates the moral end<i>s </i>of aestheticism. John Berger, the marxist art critic who has spent a life cultivating the art of looking, enjoins readers not to dismiss events like Hiroshima even as we decry individual acts of terrorism across the globe; make no mistake, he says, this was a monstrous act of terrorism. Writing to her mother after Kip has left, Hana says, <i>"One day after we heard the bombs were dropped in Japan, so it feels like the end of the world. . . . If we can rationalize this we can rationalize anything"</i> (<i>EP</i>, 292; italics in original).
</p>

<p>
If we read as Berger enjoins us to, looking <i>at</i> rather than looking <i>past</i>, the burned arm of Kip's patient asks for our gaze. That it is a chemical burn suggests the girl is a victim 

<b></b>

of neo-colonialist abuses, reminding us of the chain of connections in the novel between Caravaggio's lopped thumbs (chopped off by the Germans), the patient's burned body, the death of Patrick, Hana's father, Hana's own traumatized condition&#x02014;and a small girl mentioned in an almost offhand way in one of Alm&#x000E1;sy's stories of desert exploration: "I looked around [another explorer's] tent. . . . As I was leaving I saw a mirror tacked up high against the skin wall, and looking at it I saw the reflection of the bed. There seemed to be a small lump, a dog possibly, under the covers. I pulled back the <i>djellaba</i> and there was a small Arab girl tied up, sleeping there" (<i>EP</i>, 138). Though Alm&#x000E1;sy's telling sounds indifferent, the text asks us to look at tethering as an abuse of culture; it enjoins our alertness to the overlookable instance, fragment, gesture, expression, that indicates a larger history. It is this form of looking I've called, for the purposes of this discussion, "reading by candlelight." It suggests the work to be done if the world is to be kept from total darkness.

W. G. Sebald: Less Light
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Total darkness as a result of blinding light pervades the fictions of W. G. Sebald, whose atmosphere is always post-apocalyptic, and decidedly post-Enlightenment.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  He seems to reverse Goethe's legendary deathbed outcry and say "Less light": both as a remark on his own blinded vision, and as a comment on humanity's obsession with illumination, which leads, in his view inevitably, to apocalyptic fires and firestorms:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Our spread over the earth was fuelled by reducing the higher species of vegetation to charcoal, by incessantly burning whatever would burn. . . . From the earliest times, human civilization has been no more than a strange luminescence growing more intense by the hour of which no one can say when it will begin to wane and when it will fade away. For the time being, our cities still shine through the night, and the fires still spread.

<p class="noIndent">
Yet even as Sebald's stance is doggedly, clear-sightedly anti-redemptive, he, too, seeks the Caravaggiesque detail that might, by illuming suffering, help eradicate it. Sebald's narrator describes himself, time and again, as seeing the world from behind a dark veil or curtain. He suffers from eye trouble; he links himself implicitly, in his prose poem "As the Snow on the Alps" (from the trilogy of prose poems called <i>After Nature</i>), to the sixteenth century painter Matthias Gr&#x000FC;newald, who "wore/a dark bandage over his face" in sympathy with massacred peasants whose eyes were gouged out by soldiers. This image of the blindfolded painter who embodies the suffering others look away from, who represents it, and whose re-presentations are available to those who do not allow themselves to be blinded by what Mieke Bal calls "the official story," who are willing to look and to discern, is emblematic for Sebald's ethics and his aesthetics.
</p>

<p>
Like Pater's and Ondaatje's, Sebald's aesthetics&#x02014;his view of the art of painting, and his own painterly sensibility&#x02014;is born from darkness and death and pervaded by the idea of a committed but unprejudiced <i>looking</i>. The mysterious photographs with which his writings are riddled tend to be blurry, illegible, and overlookable; often they have no 

<b></b>

obvious relation to the text itself. He favors, both morally and aesthetically, the oblique view and the detail over the panorama. Like Kip the sapper, who learns that brief attention to a different text will help him read the location of a mine, Sebald imposes distraction on the act of reading. Not only are his narratives filled with deviations, they positively <i>consist</i> of deviations. He can switch focus quite suddenly, only to wrench the reader's attention back to an earlier subject and compel us to recognize connections we might otherwise have overlooked. These connections, too, are both aesthetic and moral, so that a book like <i>The Rings of Saturn</i> manages astonishingly to weave the history of silk cultivation into European and Far Eastern history in such a way that human artistic achievement, the conquest of nature, and human atrocity all are brought together with one thread, as it were, of silken fabric. Another example is the history of sugar, whose production and trade are inextricably bound both to artistic production and to slavery: in short, to cultivation of the highest spiritual sensibilities and of the lowest colonialist-materialist impulses, and of the cultural institutions and landmarks spawned by each. In a bar in Southwold, Sebald meets a Dutchman who remarks on
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
the curiously close relationship that existed, until well into the twentieth century, between the history of sugar and the history of art. . . . [He] drew my attention to the fact that many important museums, such as the Mauritshuis in The Hague or the Tate Gallery in London, were originally endowed by the sugar dynasties or were in some other way connected with the sugar trade. The capital amassed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries through various forms of slave economy is still in circulation . . . still bearing interest, increasing many times over and continually burgeoning anew.

Again and again, Sebald's narrators make connections such as these, teaching the reader, in the process, to look for the ends of the thread binding the beautiful to the sinister.
</p>

<p>
"Sinister," as it happens, is one of Pater's pet words, and alludes to the left hand as well as to suspect persons or ideas. Where Pater rescues the idea of the sinister for a liberationist aesthetics, as in the above-cited description of Leonardo's John the Baptist, recent writers on art see the sinister hand pointing to more disturbing underground energies. Mieke Bal's feminist-ethical rereading of Rembrandt includes, as a significant motif, the idea of the "speaking hand": the painted hand that is "indexical, signaling" (<i>RR</i>, 46). In the works Bal examines, this hand is often that of a woman indicating her violation, or attempted violation, by a particular man or men. In Pater, as we have seen, the hand tends to articulate that which dare not speak its name: oblique inclinations, sinister tendencies. In Sebald's rereading of European civilization as a history of mostly human-inflicted catastrophes, it is the hand of a criminal anatomically dissected in Rembrandt's painting <i>The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp</i> , that points out criminality in supposedly proper places. (This is a painting that Bal also, not incidentally, investigates.) The cadaver's hand indicts the omissions and blind spots of Enlightenment thinking. In his interrogation of that painting, Sebald discovers something sinister: the dissected left hand of the corpse is turned the wrong way around and, rather than representing the hand as it would have been, is in essence copied from the anatomy textbook the assembled doctors are consulting:

<b></b>

</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
[W]hat we are faced with is a transposition taken from the anatomical atlas, <i>evidently without further reflection</i>, that turns this otherwise true-to-life painting . . . into a crass misrepresentation at the exact centre point of its meaning, where the incisions are made . . . It is with him, the victim . . . that the painter identifies. His gaze alone is free of Cartesian rigidity. He alone sees that greenish annihilated body, and he alone sees the shadow in the half-open mouth and over the dead man's eyes.

<p>
The faithful Sebald reader will recognize this as a classic Sebaldian epiphany, in which all the motifs, reference points, and essential strivings of his work seem tied together. There is the sudden view through the fog of habitual looking (one of Pater's bugbears), of "the official story" so often attached by art historians to canonical images. There is also the exposure of culpability in high places; not culpability merely, but collusion with the very values the system claims to reject and condemn, in this case the almost medieval maltreatment or scapegoating of a human body in a theatrical scenario staged precisely to claim the authority of science and reason. There is what critic Michael Rothberg calls the "traumatic index," a kind of metonymic pointing, in this case through the painted re's hand, toward a prior trauma.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  There is the vision of a <i>twisting</i> of the body, which occurs frequently in Sebald's work and recalls the memorable etymological linkage between torture and <i>torquere</i> (to twist) in the essay "Torture" by one of Sebald's favorite writers, Jean Am&#x000E9;ry.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Such twistings, in Sebald, are emblematic of a culture that functions ultimately, even at its most high-minded moments, through the exercise of force. There is the placement of the heart of the matter off center, the deflection of the viewer's gaze from the obvious to the apparently oblique.
</p>

<p>
Although there is no specifically Jewish content to this particular painting or its analysis, the Holocaust is never out of the picture; in fact, it is always indicated <i>by</i> the picture. Sebald is too subtle a writer to make the connections explicit, but they are there, and his work is so studded with them that the reader learns to recognize even the buried suggestions of analogy&#x02014;here, for instance, the analogy between the activity of the seventeenth-century doctors and that of medical experimentation under the Nazi regime. Sebald the pessimistic essayist is the author of the last chapter in a modernism begun with Pater's celebration of gleams in the darkness. A sense of "post," of beginning from darkness and death, informed modernism from the start, so that "postmodernism" itself is something of an oxymoron, unless one considers it to be so fully infused by dark vision that it carries modernism to its end point. In his epiphanies, Sebald is Paterian through and through; a passage in his final novel, <i>Austerlitz</i>, seems virtually lifted out of Pater's conclusion:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The trails of light which [the moths] seemed to leave behind them in all kinds of curlicues and streamers and spirals . . . did not really exist . . . but were merely phantom traces created by the sluggish reaction of the human eye, appearing to see a certain afterglow in the place from which the insect itself, shining for only the fraction of a second in the lamplight, had already gone. It was such unreal phenomena . . . the sudden incursion of unreality into the real world, certain effects of light in the landscape spread before us, or in the eye of a beloved person, that kindled our deepest feelings, or at least what we took for them.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As in Pater, the gleam vanishes almost as soon as it has been perceived; as in Pater, the attempt to distinguish such "incursions," in art, the landscape, and a loved person's features, is paramount. But Sebald, born in 1944, inheritor of a weight of national guilt, outdoes Pater for skepticism: "<i>or at least what we took for them</i>." Can we believe in the reality of what we loved when it was so easily extinguished? Not for Sebald a consoling image like that of snail shells glowing to illume Hana's birthday in 1945; instead of small light counterpointing darkness, darkness itself becomes the new form of inscription. As with the contemporary German artist Anselm Kiefer, known particularly for his ashen landscapes alluding to the ravages of the Third Reich, shades of gray pervade the work of Sebald, and erasure, uncovering, becomes an act of making-darker rather than enlightenment. Thus the refugee painter Max Ferber in Sebald's <i>The Emigrants</i> creates images through a progressive rubbing-out of charcoal. No wonder, when what the Nazis favored was light&#x02014;more light, always&#x02014;and in so doing, created an engulfing darkness. "The construction of hells on earth was accompanied in Europe by plans for heavens on earth," writes John Berger, meaning that the death camps were intended to lead to utopia.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Sebald describes such visions of heaven in <i>The Rings of Saturn</i> in his final chapter on the history of silk:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
[The nineteenth-century Bavarian] Counsellor Hazzi's vision of a nation united by sericulture and educating itself toward higher ends went unheeded, doubtless because the previous failures lay in the too recent past. However, after an interval of a hundred years it was revived by the German fascists with that peculiar thoroughness they brought to everything they touched, as I realized with some surprise when, last summer, searching in the education office of the town I grew up in for the short documentary about North Sea herring fisheries which had been shown to us in primary school, I happened upon a film on German silk cultivation, evidently made for the same series. In contrast to the dark, almost midnight tonalities of the herring film, the film on sericulture was of a truly dazzling brightness. Men and women in white coats, in whitewashed rooms flooded with light, were busy at snow-white spinning frames, snow-white sheets of paper, snow-white protective gauze, snow-white cocoons and snow-white canvas mailing sacks. The whole film promised the best and cleanest of all possible worlds, an impression that was confirmed when I read the accompanying booklet, which was intended for our teachers. Citing the F&#x000FC;hrer's pronouncement, at the 1936 party rally, that Germany must become self-sufficient within four years in all the materials it lay in the nation's power to produce itself, the author of the booklet observed that this is self-evidently silk cultivation.

<p>
Between the film on phosphorescent herring and the blinding film on sericulture, both produced by the same company&#x02014;the same culture&#x02014;lies the historical gap between Paterian luminescence and Sebaldian grayness. If light can come to this&#x02014;genocide, Hiroshima (whose survivors remembered the infamous white flash of light at the moment of catastrophe)&#x02014;then better choose gray, the in-between, after the century of white nights. And indeed, modernist aestheticism has always inhabited a twilight, a recognition that ultimate light is neither achievable nor desirable; it remains to see whether that twilight produces a new Renaissance&#x02014;Pater's fantasy&#x02014;or merely illuminates, as on a movie screen, the mistakes humanity continues to make.
