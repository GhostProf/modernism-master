Contrary to the expectations that might be engendered by its title,
this essay does not concern itself in any way with unorthodox Marxist
theories of history and society; nor does it so much as advert, except
in this sentence, to any of the conflicts--1789, 1830, 1848--that made
up the so-called "Age of Revolutions" in late eighteenth and early
nineteenth-century Europe. No, the subject of the present article
conveys none of the drama and grand narrative sweep associated with
those ideas and events, though like them it has, in its way, organized
the experience of modernity. I am referring to the revolving door,
an unsung but pervasive--dare one say <I>pivotal</I>--technology for
modern living. It has been slighted by most historians of architecture,
by philosophers of the modern city, by historians of the department
store, and even, bafflingly, by Gretl Hoffmann's seemingly exhaustive
<I>Doors: Excellence in International Design</I>,not to mention Val
Clery's ruminative, phenomenological essay, <I>Doors</I>.
<SUP><A NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Yet certain artists, writers, and filmmakers were quick to discern the
 symbolic suggestiveness residing in, and the cultural work performed
 by, the revolving door. In a dazzling essay on "The Use of Analogy in
 Legal and Political Argument," Elaine Scarry takes the emergency hand
 brake found in railway passenger compartments as a "materialized locus
 of consent," pointing out that, since the brake is accessible to any
 passenger at all times and

<B></B>

since pulling its lever actually causes the train to stop (it does
not send a signal to the engineer, but directly intervenes in the
vehicle's operation), it "has no equivalent within any other form of
transportation."
<SUP><A NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 For me, the revolving door is just such an incomparable modern mechanism,
 similarly dependent upon individual participation and similarly replete
 with significance. Consisting typically of three or four glass panels
 inside a circular frame, the revolving door multiplies the possibilities
 of its "inherently ambiguous" plate glass by using it to reconre
 the space and experience of the threshold.
<SUP><A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 We are inured to the revolutionary nature of this architectural miracle,
 inside of which material and location, glass and threshold--each
 in its way "a field on which the exchange between inner and outer
 occurs, a field reflecting the violation of space but also enclosing
 and protecting"--achieve a powerful interaction through a particular
 distribution of space and motion inside the revolving door.
<SUP><A NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 This "inside of which" calls for comment, for the revolving door is,
 of course, the only kind of door that is also a chamber, so that one
 can speak of being "inside the door." This renders it fundamentally
 different from the humble turnstile on which it is based.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The revolving door was the creation of one Theophilus Van Kannel
(of Philadelphia), who on 7 August, 1888, received U.S. Patent number
387,571 for what he called his "New Revolving Storm Door," and who the
following year was awarded the Franklin Institute's John Scott Legacy
medal for useful inventions. In recommending this award, the Institute's
Committee on Science and the Arts noted that "persons passing through
[the new door] pass as through an ordinary turnstile," but its members
recognized that, in boxing up the turnstile, Van Kannel had transformed it
utterly, turning it into something like a mechanical lung for controlling
the circulation of air and bodies alike. "At each one third turn of the
door," they noted, "a volume of air equal to the space between two arms
and from the floor to the roof of the door, is pumped out from the room
to which it is attached and a similar volume of air is pumped in."
<SUP><A NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Van Kannel first began producing his new invention through the
 Storm-Proof Door Company of Philadelphia, and his earliest testimonials
 come from Philadelphia restaurants, dry goods stores, clothiers, as
 well as the city's Chamber of Commerce. Writing on 30 August, 1888,
 J. T. Harker, manager of Thackray's Restaurant, celebrated the door in
 terms that made plain its transcendence of the open turnstile:

In the coldest days during the great blizzard, we felt no discomfort,
as it [the door] completely excludes the strongest wind, even while
persons are passing in or out. Aside of its effecting a great saving
of coal, it makes the front of the room as comfortable as other parts,
thus adding to the availability of seating room. I at no time found any
trouble in its use, a solid stream of persons passing in, and another out,
without collision, and with much more freedom than the old-style swinging
doors I had in use. The absence of all slamming, and the exclusion of
street noises, are also an important feature.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Starting in the 1890s, the Van Kannel door began to appear across both
the architectural and the tropological landscapes of America.
<SUP><A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 By the second decade of the twentieth century it had become a symbol,
 even a synecdoche, of modern American city life. When, in 1916, Man
 Ray resettled in Manhattan after a stint in small-town

<B></B>

New Jersey, he initiated the new urban, experimental phase in his career
with <I>Revolving Doors</I> (1916-1917), a series of abstract
collages hung on a hinged stand which spectators could turn as they
wished. A spinning door might well have seemed a fitting emblem for
modernity, since that condition was often described in terms of the
"dizzying" changes it wrought upon traditional social orders, and since
it was regularly evoked through images of rotation--Yeats's "gyres,"
Wyndham Lewis's "Vorticism," the chocolate grinder and orbiting
bachelors of Duchamp's <I>La Mari&eacute;e mise &agrave; nu par ses
c&eacute;libataires, m&ecirc;me</I>, and so forth.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Our habit of associating the revolving door exclusively with the
fast-paced, skyscrapered American city, however, may obscure a certain
ambivalence in its original conception and early promotion that can
usefully remind us of the door's Victorian provenance.
<SUP><A NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 It is true that Van Kannel himself sometimes addressed his public as an
 aggressive forward-thinker, disdainful of outmoded ways and means. In an
 early leaflet, the inventor somewhat irritably confronts the customary
 reaction to his door: "'Just like a turn-stile,' so say nine out of
 ten persons who first see it. As well may we say a tea-kettle is like a
 locomotive boiler." Much of the leaflet is characterized by just this
 sort of pugnacious modernism. "In the old way," Van Kannel recalls,
 "every person passing through [a door from the outside] first brings
 a chilling gust of wind with its snow, rain or dust, including the
 noise of the street; then comes the unwelcome 'bang!' This interesting
 programme is repeated in proportion to the number of callers. All these
 and many other annoyances are entirely obviated in the <I>New Revolving
 Storm Door</I>," since "[each] person passing through the door pushes
 any one of its four wings forward, the wing behind him arriving at the
 curved side wall before the wing in front leaves it."
<SUP><A NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 As Reyner Banham points out in <I>The Architecture of the Well-Tempered
 Environment</I>, Van Kannel's brainchild, which was initially marketed
 under the slogan "Always Closed," constituted an important step on
 the way "toward full control" of atmospheric conditions inside of
 buildings--in other words, toward the creation of spaces finally
 independent of nature's rhythms and constraints.
<SUP><A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And yet the inventor betrays a hint of Victorian double-voicedness
about this prospect, some portion of his sympathies hankering to
retain connection to, or dependency on, seasonal cycles. Van Kannel
envisioned that in normal use his door would have "solid or glazed wings
during the winter season and gauze or lattice wings during the summer"
("MEPA"). The very idea of fitting out a revolving door with gauze or
lattice must strike us--for whom the glass is a definitive feature,
part of the door's cold, antihumanist appeal--as an atavistic absurdity,
a misplaced piece of pastoral sentimentality. Still, one of the reasons
Van Kannel gave why the wings of his doors had to be able to fold back
and open a clear passageway was "to provide for the circulation of air in
the event of . . . a suddenly warm day in the spring or fall, after the
solid wings have been applied to the door" ("MEPA"). Like many another
bourgeois Victorian, Van Kannel seems torn between the allure of the
coming mechanical age and the currents of Romanticism still whispering
the possibility of a natural humanity. His early fantasy--shocking to
contemplate--that his invention might be installed not only in public
buildings <I>but in private homes as well</I> is of a piece with the
machine-age

<B></B>

domestic architecture parodied in Waugh's <I>Decline and Fall</I>
: even to think of imposing the revolving door upon the suburban
domicile seems an act of modernist totalitarianism worthy of Waugh's
Professor Silenus, who despises "all the thoughts and self-approval of
[the] biological by-product [humankind]" and who believes that "the only
perfect building must be the factory, because that is built to house
machines, not men."
<SUP><A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 The dream that the revolving door could be "an ideal entrance closure for
 residences" persisted in Van Kannel promotional materials for many years:
 a catalogue probably dating from the 1930s is still rather half-heartedly
 pushing the idea, even though no private residences are listed on the
 appended "Abridged List of Buildings Equipped with Revolving Doors."
<SUP><A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 But Van Kannel's ardent-modernist side eventually acquiesced to the
 residual Victorian ideology of sacred domestic space. The Van Kannel
 door may have been "Always Closed," but, as its inventor eventually
 began to emphasize, it was "Always Open" as well, and the keepers of
 the American home declined to open their domestic sanctums to this
 "mechanical paradox."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another sign of the revolving door's late Victorian origins is to be
found in the nature of the claims put forward about it. It is not simply
that these claims are inflated, but that they are inflated in such a way
as to endow the effort to promote the installation of revolving doors
with a moral grandeur comparable to that of the great nineteenth-century
reformist projects, such as Chadwick's sanitation campaign. Under the
heading "<I>WILL IT PAY?</I>" Van Kannel's early leaflet declares that
the new door "will [not only] in a short time earn its cost in fuel
[for heating], but it will do what is of far greater importance. <I>It
will save life</I>, by preventing those deadly lung and throat diseases
which are sure to overtake the unfortunate salesman, cashier or clerk
whose duty keeps him near the <I>constantly opening front door</I>"
("MEPA," emphasis in original). The rhetoric of the early Victorian
better-ventilation crusades, with its "noxious effluvia" and "baleful
miasmas," is not far below the surface of such a passage. As Chadwick
had done for the rookery-denizens of 1840s London and Manchester, Van
Kannel will do for the turn of the century's new subclass of shop clerks,
whose members are on the front lines of commerce and cannot evade the
perilous influences of the streets.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given such rhetorical affiliations, it is not wholly surprising to see a
latter-day advocate of the Van Kannel door place his discussion of its
merits in the framework of a Victorian-style comparative, evolutionist
and universalist anthropology. This is what Robert L. Blanchard does in
his remarkable <I>Around the World with Van Kannel</I> (2nd ed. 1930),
a text whose size and imaginative scope--it is nearly a hundred pages
long and contains dozens of photographs of Van Kannel doors on location
in several countries--make it something like the <I>Golden Bough</I>
of promotional literature. Blanchard's text is no mere catalogue
but a fanciful tour of the world, stopping off wherever significant
exhibits are to be found. "No matter where we go," Blanchard writes,
"over land or sea . . . we meet one familiar thing. An accouterment
that traces its birth to the earliest pages of history--the doorway,
or entrance." Warming to his theme, the author continues:

<B></B>

Doors have ever been a necessity to man. They have been in use, in
one form or another, since the early days when our ancestors lived in
caves. . . . Entrance has always been a problem for man to solve. So
important has been the matter that door is the one word that remains
practically the same in all the Aryan languages. But what a variety of
doors have been used.

There then follow two-and-a-half pages of examples--bundles of furze,
curtains of skin or cloth, slabs of stone, and so on--drawn from distant
lands and times. All previous means of ingress are shown to have come
into existence by the Middle Ages, but "thereafter, from medieval
times down to 1890 . . . no step was taken to improve the usefulness
of entrances" (<I>AWVK</I>, 9). The sorry state of doorway efficiency
up to the end of the nineteenth century was damning evidence that "in
one respect modern man had advanced but little from the cave-dweller"
(<I>AWVK</I>, 81). Enter at last Van Kannel, with the invention--I
quote verbatim here--"which completed man's emancipation from the dark
ages!" (<I>AWVK</I>, 81).

Its product a prominent jewel in the crown of progress, its mission
to spread that product's benefits around the globe, the Van Kannel
Revolving Door Company as this sedulous scribe presents it stands in the
vanguard--or at the doorway--of civilization. If you do not adopt the
revolving door, Blanchard warns, "you place your health and your life,
or the health and life of your customers at the mercy of the elements
and in the hands of chance" (<I>AWVK</I>, 93). Van Kannel has answered
the desire of the ages for an airtight domain of human liberty--"Always
Closed"--where Chance and Nature cannot penetrate. A cartoon that opens
and closes the volume (<A HREF="8.4buzard_1.html"> 1</A>)
links the revolving door with the revolution of the earth itself,
both of them turning us from old worlds to new, from determination by
material forces to mastery over them, from beings "half-akin to brute"
to wholly free makers and products of culture.

And yet darker energies than these have also gathered on Van Kannel's
doorstep. Summing up the way Van Kannel's creation functions as an
"environmental filter" by "admitt[ing] persons but not the wind," Reyner
Banham writes that the revolving door "strangle[s] violent up-currents
at birth."
<SUP><A NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 The invention put an end to the phenomenon known as "stack effect,"
 to which tall buildings having banks of elevators placed in a certain
 relation to the entrances were especially prone: rising elevators sucked
 conventional exterior doors inward, making them difficult to open from
 outside, and descending elevators blew them out--the building seeming
 to respire like a slumbering giant. But it is the recourse to violent
 metaphors like Banham's that concerns me here, a habit that has perhaps
 been encouraged, by the historic portentousness of thresholds: it is
 through a doorway that we see the corpses of Agamemnon and Cassandra,
 over a gate that we read "Lasciate ogni speranza, voi ch'entrate"--or
 for that matter, "Arbeit macht Frei." Also contributing to this custom
 may be what Rem Koolhaas calls the "humanistic assumption" in Western
 architecture that there is a

<B></B>

"moral relationship" between the exterior and the interior of a building
and that "the 'honest' fa&ccedil;ade speaks about the activities it
conceals."
<SUP><A NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Such an assumption makes the threshold a site for the practice of candor
 or cunning, plain-dealing or treachery and deceit; and it underwrites
 the tendency of Van Kannel advertising to envision the entrance to
 every public building as the stage for a morality play depicting the
 clash of Reason and Nature.

But there seem to be reasons beyond the traditional, more specific to Van
Kannel's invention, for thinking of the revolving door as a strangely
dangerous thing, a blend of beauty and menace that can take us places
we may not want to go. In the recent film <I>The Truman Show</I>, the
title character begins the painful process of unraveling his illusory
world when, instead of entering his office building one morning, he
spins the revolving door 360 degrees around and catches the actors and
stagehands of his televised existence off-guard. However comforting
it may be to contemplate the benefits conferred on humankind by Van
Kannel's sealing off of the threshold, there can be something unsettling
and disorienting about the experience of actually using the door--as if
the new invulnerability of the building has been purchased at the cost of
a new vulnerability for individuals. In Part VII of Hart Crane's <I>The
Bridge</I>, the poet conducts his readers through a subway station and
counsels them to "[a]void the glass doors gyring at your right, / Where
boxed alone a second, eyes take fright / --Quite unprepared rush naked
back to light. . . ."
<SUP><A NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 What is Crane afraid of? Francis Ford Coppola's <I>The Godfather</I>
  provides a memorable answer in the sequence, late in the film, in
 which one of Michael Corleone's henchmen, reversing that Enlightenment
 spin which Van Kannel liked to place on his invention, stages the
 whacking of a competing

mob boss in the revolving door (<A
HREF="8.4buzard_2.html">. 2</A>, <A
HREF="8.4buzard_3.html">3</A>). The new Don's hired gun
follows his mark toward the revolving door and flips the lock atop
the door's panels, shutting off Van Kannel's "stream of persons" and
turning the fluidly spinning wheel into a glass cage--ultimately into
a transparent coffin. The sequence gives us an exaggerated, gothic
explanation for Crane's dread of being "boxed alone," however briefly,
in this device that makes <I>visible</I> our vulnerability to assault.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If we consult the useful annotations in the <I>American Law Reports</I>
(<I>ALR</I>) by Gregory G. Sarno and F. G. Madara on "Liability for
Injuries in Connection with Revolving Door on Nonresidential Premises"
and "Liability for Injury by Revolving Door," we must come away from
the experience powerfully impressed by the wealth and variety of mishaps
capable of occurring in and around this type of door.
<SUP><A NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Among the "contributing factors" to revolving door accidents which Sarno
 enumerates, one finds "location of door or nearby doormat or step,"
 "use of opaque panels," "size of revolving door's compartments,"
 "worn or defective friction strips or retarding devices," "collapsing
 of revolving door's wings," "improper use of directional signs or
 failure to provide warnings," "slippery or sticky substances on the
 floor in or near revolving door," and "other and unspecified causes"
 ("ALICRD," 138). The historical evolution of isolated incidents into
 a whole little class of legal proceedings can be charted by comparing
 the index to the 1st and 2nd <I>Decennial Digests of American Legal
 Cases</I> (covering 1685-1916), which contain only a subheading,
 "Door, revolving," and list two negligence cases, with the index to
 the 3rd and 4th <I>Decennial Digests</I> (1917-1936), in which
 "Revolving Door" has earned an entry of its own, under which to organize
 its ever-proliferating examples.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The decisions reached by American courts during the last decades of
the nineteenth century and the first few of the twentieth tended to
reinforce the idea inscribed in the revolving door's allotment of space,
namely that while inside the door you are on your own. In <I>Washington
Market Co. v. Clagett</I>, a 1901 case in which "the plaintiff [had]
slipped on a pile of fish immediately after emerging from a covered
revolving door leading into a market," the court held that while the
proprietor was obliged "to keep entrances [to his market] in a reasonably
safe condition," he was by no means "an insurer of the safety of the
persons who come there" ("ALIRD," 1346). In the 1905 matter of <I>Harris
v. Cowles</I>, the complaint charged the revolving door with being
"particularly enticing to children of tender years," adding that the
hotel in question had "fail[ed] to provide any apparatus to prevent the
limbs or body of a person from being caught between the door's jambs and
partition" ("ALICRD," 146). The ruling in favor of the defendant set a
precedent by rejecting the idea that the revolving door could be classed
with those special objects set aside as "attractive nuisances," for
which property owners must assume responsibility even where (underage)
trespassers are concerned. Traffic flow took precedence over other
considerations: it was, the court said, "manifestly impracticable"
to take the precaution of keeping the door locked, since "the purpose
of this circular door . . . requires that it shall be subject to the
uses of ordinary passage at any moment" (qtd. in "ALIRD," 1350). The
1937 case of <I>Provo v. Toledo Trust</I> reaffirmed this ruling: young
Albert Provo had, to his cost, evidently

<B></B>

drawn "the inference that the revolving door was to him a new toy with
which to play." But the judge emphatically denied that the revolving
door could be considered an "inherently dangerous instrumentality,"
finding that "if not defective, the possibility of danger inures in the
manner of its use."
<SUP><A NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In these cases, the revolving door was playing its part in the evolution
of tort law. The accidents taking place in or around it became occasions
for testing the boundaries of those fuzzy categories of the "inherently
dangerous instrumentality" and the "attractive nuisance," which contained
the only recognized exceptions to the blanket indemnity then enjoyed by
manufacturers and to the somewhat less spacious but still significant
freedom from responsibility possessed by the proprietors of hotels,
stores, and the like. The notion of an "inherently dangerous" product
had originated in a New York case in 1852; afterward, as <I>Prosser on
Torts</I> informs us, "for more than half a century . . . there was much
pointless dispute . . . as to how such products as soap, chewing tobacco,
or the container of a beverage were to be classified."
<SUP><A NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Prosser characterizes nineteenth-century courts as animated by a general
 "social viewpoint" that made them reluctant to impose "too heavy a
 burden upon manufacturers and sellers" by holding "them responsible to
 hundreds of persons at a distance whose identity they could not even
 know . . . It was better to let the consumer suffer."
<SUP><A NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Since direct agreement--or "privity"--had not taken place between makers
 and users, no contract was deemed to exist between them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Benjamin Cardozo's decision in <I>MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.</I>
in 1916 virtually created product liability law <I>ex nihilo</I>, by
identifying a defective product as an inherently dangerous one. In two
cases in the years that sandwich that decision, the Van Kannel Revolving
Door Company came as close as it ever would to the territory Cardozo was
opening up. Both were proceedings in which, as in most cases featuring
revolving doors, the complaints focused on "the rubber and felt strips
. . . attached from the top of each wing to the bottom along the outer
edge" ("ALIRD," 1350). In <I>Buzzell v. R.H. White Co.</I> of 1915,
the department store in question was exonerated of negligence when it
stipulated that, even though the strips were indeed worn down to such a
degree that they did nothing to restrict speed of revolution, they were
never intended to have such a function, but were simply seals to prevent
heat loss. In his patent application, in fact, Van Kannel never raises
the issue of velocity at all: for him, the strips "bearing against
the inner faces of [the] segmental side portions of the structure,"
derive their rationale entirely from their function as guards against
air leakage and, somewhat incidentally, caught fingers.
<SUP><A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 In <I>Hochschild v. Cecil</I>, a 1917 case about a sixty-eight year
 old woman who had "received a sudden blow from behind while proceeding
 cautiously through [a] store's revolving door," "a consulting engineer
 testified that the 'Van Kannel' door used by the store was what might
 be termed a 'pioneer,' but now 'obsolete,' type of revolving door which
 had been replaced by modern [versions] with stationary ceilings and more
 easily controlled momentum" ("ALICRD," 159-60). With the concept
 of manufacturer's liability in its infancy, however, the question of
 whether a revolving door can be considered defective, and hence an
 "inherently dangerous instrumentality," because it lacks any form of
 "spin control" remained a dead

<B></B>

letter. Beefed-up strips were quietly introduced; a feature of later
catalogues was the "Governing Device," which, it was asserted, "does
away with the <I>only</I> objection to the use of revolving doors,
i.e. spinning of the wings when a person goes through the vestibule in
a great hurry" ("GENIN," 28; emphasis in original). These alterations
were made not only to manage turn speed but to prevent backward, or
clockwise, movement--a phenomenon that was to have painful results in
more than a few instances, even though Van Kannel had said in his patent
application that his revolving door would "preferably [be] provided at

 In <I>Finch v. Horn and Hardart Baking Co.</I>, a 1928 Pennsylvania case
 that bore out the principle of <I>respondebat superior</I>, the automat
 was held liable for the action of an "employee who was coming out of
 the restaurant's revolving door just as [the] plaintiff was entering,
 [and who] suddenly retraced his steps and went back into the room the
 way he had come, causing the door to revolve backwards and to knock
 the plaintiff onto the restaurant's floor" ("ALICRD," 148-99). No
 liability was attached to the manufacturer of a door capable of being
 misused in this way.

It would be misleading to suggest that people have shown a greater
propensity to harm themselves, or others, in revolving doors than
they have done in or with any number of other objects. But the
injuries sustained and the fear aroused by revolving doors has much
to do with the fact that they place two or more people in a form of
relationship not created by any other apparatus for the movement of
bodies through space. In the revolving door, strangers who are visible
to, yet partitioned off from each other are obliged to act not merely
courteously but collaboratively, choreographing their movements by
silent agreement so as to ease the passage of both to their opposite
destinations. What ought to occur is a model in miniature of the
well-functioning civil polity, a system of cooperative strangers and an
equilibrium of individual interests: the enterer's desire for ingress is
presumed to counterbalance the exiter's for egress, and the revolving
door is supposed to effect "the simultaneous passage of one stream
of persons <I>in</I> and another <I>out</I> with freedom and comfort"
("MEPA," emphasis in original). Furthermore, the revolving door gives
concrete shape to a vision of society in which the individual is, as
Rachel Bowlby puts it, "the only significant social category."

 Larger social units, such as the family, do not re in Van Kannel's
 calculus: this was a man who, when he thought of the future, thought
 first of the 21st-century "boarding house," an institution that exists
 to serve a population of unattached urban males.
<SUP><A NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 In place of that absent <I>privity</I> between manufacturer and user,
 the revolving door substituted an unspoken pact among its isolated users
 to ensure the smooth operation of the mechanism and the safe passage of
 all parties. Anyone unlucky enough to step into the revolving door at
 the same instant that a homicidal maniac, a staggering drunk, or just
 a very incompetent <I>schlemiel</I>, was entering it from the other
 side was certainly to be pitied, but such a person would have no legal
 recourse against Van Kannel--even though dependency upon the other and
 inability to flee are built into the design.

Just as Cardozo was making legal history with his decision in
<I>MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.</I>, another visionary was developing
his account of a world centered on the revolving door and operating
on principles utterly different from those of Van Kannel's libertarian
utopia. Working in his scriptless, experimental manner, Charlie Chaplin
did not hit upon the notion of using a revolving door to provide the
engine of mayhem for his 1917 short film "The Cure" until take #77. Once
he had glimpsed the device's comic possibilities, however, Chaplin went
about constructing his film according to the method characteristic of
all his early comedies: "Every one of them," said an early reviewer,
"is built <I>around</I> something."
<SUP><A NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 "The Cure" makes this principle plain for all to see, since Chaplin,
 flying in the face of premises liability case law, has decided to
 install his inspirational prop smack in the middle of a spa courtyard,
 perilously close to the pool of medicinal waters. He has also opted for
 that "pioneer" model of the revolving door that is capable of spinning
 rapidly in either direction. It is only a matter of time before he starts
 inflicting all manner of injury upon the prodigiously bandaged appendage
 of Eric Campbell and discharging pursuers headlong into that pool (<A
 HREF="8.4buzard_4.html"> 4</A>). Every hilariously bruising
 relationship Chaplin creates in and around the revolving door is derived
 from the repressed unconscious of Theophilus Van Kannel. Ultimately,
 the circular movement of the Van Kannel door becomes more than just
 the motive force of Chaplin's slapstick: it becomes a re for his
 comic genius, the signature or promise of an endless capacity for
 ludic invention.

Lawyers filing suit against the proprietors of premises on which revolving
door accidents occurred frequently invoked the doctrine of <I>res ipsa
loquitur</I>, considering those proprietors responsible for keeping
all mechanisms on their properties in safe working order. <I>Promisel
v. Hotels Statler Corporation</I> of 1934 went in favor of the plaintiff
because the glass in one panel of the door had been temporarily replaced
with a wooden board, which blocked a woman's view of the man who was on
his way out as she prepared to step in: "the court declared that . . . the
opaque board created a danger in the use of the revolving door which made
it defective" ("ALICRD," 157). But proprietors were in the clear when no
such defect was discernible and the door "was operated and controlled by
an independent third party whose unusual method of operation . . . was
the proximate cause" of the injury ("ALIRD," 1349-50).

 Only in rare cases such as the 1938 affair of <I>Schubart v. Hotel
 Astor</I> did a court sustain a complaint against the proprietor of
 a premises that featured a revolving door in good working order. In
 this instance the court found that it would have been reasonable for
 the hotel to post attendants on the doors on the particular Saturday
 evening when an elderly woman was injured in them, because it was the
 evening after the big Army-Notre Dame football game, and a group of Army
 fans "in a gay, hilarious, and carousing mood" had taken "possession of
 [the] main lobby"--a fact that should have alerted hotel management "to
 the anticipation that the revolving door would not only be subjected to
 excessive use but also that it would be likely to receive rough usage
 and unseemly abuse" ("ALIRD," 1354). Poor Mrs. Schubart was the victim
 of "a couple of young fellows" who, in a carousing mood, entered one of
 the door's compartments all together and gave "a big or extra hard push"
 ("ALIRID," 1354). So much for that hopeful Van Kannel vision of sociality
 inscribed in the door's design.

But even when no accidents occurred and no bodies were bruised, bent,
or broken, there still remained a sense in which the revolving door might
be thought an instrument of a certain kind of violence. This door which,
Van Kannel said, "never needs closing, [yet] cannot be left open" was also
"a mechanical paradox," and by the time Blanchard wrote his treatise,
the company motto had been amended to "Always <I>Open</I>, Always Closed"
(<I>AWVK</I>, 94; emphasis added). For while it may be true that the
revolving door outdoes all other entrance mechanisms in safeguarding the
boundary between inside and out, there is another point of view from
which it opens up that boundary, giving movement across it a fluidity
no other door can match. "Persons on first hearing of the new door,"
Van Kannel wrote, "often fall into the error of underrating its capacity
for passage, supposing it will not permit as many persons to pass in
and out in a given time as the old style storm doors" ("MEPA"). But the
revolving door "keeps the in-going and out-going streams of passengers
separated, thus allowing one solid stream to pass in and another out
without collisions" ("MEPA"). Notwithstanding the inspired abuse to
which geniuses like Coppola or Chaplin have submitted it, the device in
its normal working groove converts human bodies into these "solid streams"

<B></B>

of traffic, then condenses those streams back into isolated particles,
each of which is encased, as if on display, behind plate glass for the
instant or two it takes the door to spin. Though in one way more fluid,
passage into and out of the building is also broken by this tiny hiatus,
which the user spends in a vacuum-like "<I>apart</I>-ment." The fact
that ambient noise is muffled during this brief delay tends to heighten
the impact of entrance into and exit from the door. The moment of exit
now comes as a release or, as in Crane's <I>The Bridge</I>, a rebirth,
after the user has been "boxed alone."

The revolving door's appearance of being a machine for breaking down and
reconstituting individuals "cut to size" is strongly suggested by King
Vidor's <I>The Crowd</I> , a film that bemoans the dehumanizing
effects of the modern city but also replicates them in the assembly-line
manner in which it furnishes its hero and heroine. The office workers
John and Mary are elevated to the status of protagonists only by virtue
of their utter typicality: give me any two of this teeming mass, Vidor
seems to say, and I will build my story around them. The couple is first
brought together for a blind date that commences at the close of business
hours. The sequence begins when John joins a line of men awaiting their
dates of the evening on the sidewalk across from the Van Kannel doors of
the building where Mary works. Spinning and releasing individual women
with the apparent randomness of a lottery canister, the revolving door
here marks the boundary between the new paper-pushing, service-economy
workday and a leisure-time, heterosexual economy whose processes hark
back to old-fashioned factory production. Each revolution of the office
building's door pumps out one unit of female product, straight onto the
arm of a waiting escort (<A HREF="8.4buzard_5.html"> 5</A>). This
curbside dispensary

<B></B>

of womankind manufactures straight couples with near-perfect efficiency,
producing but few "surplus goods." (Vidor briefly disrupts the workings
of this compulsory-heterosexuality machine by isolating a couple of women
who, "dateless," emerge from the revolving door, pay no attention to the
men waiting on the curb, and go off together. Only by producing a Mary
out of the revolving door, to go with his John, can Vidor proceed to the
task of producing his own narrative, which now begins to spin as briskly,
from date to marriage to consequences, as a Van Kannel "pioneer" when
pushed by a hurried user. Like the door--like the turning film reel on
which Vidor spins his story--the narrative of <I>The Crowd</I> describes a
circular motion, bringing its couple back around again to their starting
point. Chastened by the many sufferings he endures throughout the film,
John winds up happy to accept the job of street clown which he and Mary
had once laughingly, and literally, looked down upon, from the upper
deck of the bus that bore them away on their first date. In his end is
his beginning.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Films like <I>The Crowd</I> secured the revolving door's identification
with the new American world of skyscrapers, commerce, and clerks. In
Europe, where "prior to World War II, the commercial high-rise was
unknown," Van Kannel's creation found its natural habitat not in the
American-style "cathedral of commerce"--the label given to Woolworth's
Gothic tower of 1913--but in the very different precincts of the Grand
Hotel.
<SUP><A NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 In F. W. Murnau's <I>The Last Laugh</I> (<I>Der Letzte Mann</I>, 1924)
 the circular door is, if geometry will permit the phrase, squarely at
 the center of the tale, first pathetic, then comic, of an aging doorman
 who finds himself abruptly demoted to washroom attendant and then,
 as if in recompense, suddenly made a millionaire to be waited upon by
 every employee of the institution that once degraded him.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Two settings divide Murnau's movie between them: the hotel where
the doorman labors and the working-class neighborhood in which he
lives. Conductor of human traffic into and out of the hotel, he is also
the film's humble Hermes, the only character who can take us from the
one environment to the other, traversing the whole social system whose
classes are otherwise so morally invisible to each other. The uniqueness
of his Dickensian capacity to connect the estranged segments of society
is signaled by the fact that he wears his doorman's uniform not only
on the job, where it is a badge of service, but all the way home as
well, where it is magically transformed into a mantle of authority: the
doorman strolls his neighborhood like a benevolent ruler, waving benignly,
comforting hurt children, deferred to by everyone. The <I>Dreht&uuml;r</I>
(revolving door) he presides over at work becomes the emblem of this
man who "makes the rounds" of a fragmented society.

Murnau's revolving door is, like Vidor's, part dehumanizing machine,
part re for the medium in which he works, part wheel of fortune. On
the day the hotel decides to replace him with a younger man, the
old employee walks to work as usual, enters the Van Kannel door,
and finds himself looking into the distorted mirror of his fate 
(<A HREF="8.4buzard_res.html">. 6-9</A>). The impersonal system
that dispenses with his services has unceremoniously ousted him in favor
of a new and improved cog, that erect and impassive re whom Murnau
places in motion on the opposite side of the revolving door exactly as
the older one enters it. In this brilliant piece of staging, the old
doorman's professional

<B></B>

<b>[Begin Page 575]</B>

talisman turns against him, and, pathetically, his first impulse is to try
to turn it back: having passed into the hotel interior as his replacement
has headed out to the curb, he now makes a feeble push backward against
the momentum of the door, as if he could undo his fate the same way one
might wind back a reel of film. His young usurper does not re at all
in the narrative: he is just the individual who happened to get the job,
and he just happens to pass by at that moment; but Murnau's dazzling
sequence suggests that Van Kannel's social ideal of a silent partnership
of strangers has been exchanged for the harsh vision of society as a
zero-sum game, all individual relationships corrupted into various forms
of unequal competition, all success gained at another's expense.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Murnau, what is initially felt as the mere coincidence of two men's
movements turns into the violence done by an alienated social order to
its faceless functionaries. In the deliriously gratifying conclusion of
<I>The Last Laugh</I>, the dehumanizing mechanism spins the other way:
through the revolving door the former wage slave now emerges as a new
and pampered hotel guest. In a similar spirit, a memorable passage in
Kingsley Amis's <I>Lucky Jim</I>  uses the Van Kannel door to strike
a blow for all downtrodden and dependent workers, making it the tool
of the title character's anarchic retribution against his thoughtlessly
cruel, cruelly thoughtless superior, Professor Welch, for whom temporary
lecturers are as interchangeable as hotel doormen. The passage begins
as Jim Dixon leaves his oppressor at the entrance to the college library:

Dixon turned away, only to start violently and look back as a loud
thundering noise broke out behind him. Welch, his hair flapping, was
straining like a packed-down rugby forward to push the revolving door
in the wrong direction. Dixon stood and watched, allowing his mandrill
face full play. After a time Welch, somehow divining his error, began
pulling instead at the now-jammed door, changing his semblance to that
of anchor in a losing tug-o'-war team. With a sudden bursting click the
door yielded and Welch overbalanced backwards, hitting his head on the
panel behind him. Dixon went away, beginning to whistle his Welch tune
in a solemn, almost liturgical tempo. He felt that it was things like
this that kept him going.

In other instances of the Grand Hotel paradigm, the Van Kannel door may
stake no special claim to identification as a weapon of class struggle,
but functions as a more or less benign re for the changeful and
aleatory nature of life. This broadly "democratic" vision, with its
pacifying message that all are subject to the turns of fortune's wheel,
was perhaps an especially palatable one for American audiences of the
early Depression era, and it res most prominently in Edmund Goulding's
<I>Grand Hotel</I> , an MGM production that puts this distinctly
American spin on the Continental idea of the revolving door. The film,
which is set in 1920s Berlin, gains access to this generalized viewpoint
on life by focusing not on a single member of the subordinate class but
on an ensemble of characters, most of them guests, who pass through the
hotel and move into and out of various forms of relationship with each
other. In its extended final sequence, set in the hotel lobby, <I>Grand
Hotel</I> makes Van Kannel's invention the definitively human doorway,
the mortal portal, expressing with every revolution the mutability of
earthly existence.

richly textured interface between social castes, a field for the comedy

give every incident dramatic relief. With the Waldorf, the Hotel itself

"Wise old Van Kannel" is rather darkly impersonated in <I>GrandHotel</I>
by the character of Doctor Otternschlag (Lewis Stone), the <I>genius
loci</I> of the circular lobby that is the primary space in this circular
film. A resident of the hotel, he keeps his station through all the
arrivals and departures charted in the movie, arrivals and departures
both literal and metaphoric (the film records one death, one birth). He
is given, for good measure, a face half blackened by wartime injury, so
as to identify him all the more plainly as Janus, the two-faced god of
doorways. His closing line in the movie repeats his opening one--"people
come, people go; nothing ever happens"--as the revolving door, spinning
almost continuously throughout the closing sequence, becomes his Ixion's
wheel. Doctor Otternschlag is Hollywood's Continental philosopher, its
minor Nietzsche for the inter-war years: deadened and detached before the
human comedy, he stands in stark contrast to the vigorous, newly-married
American couple that arrives and pushes its way through the revolving
door just after the many corrupt, disabled, or deluded Europeans have
passed out of it (<A HREF="8.4buzard_0.html">. 10</A>, <A HREF="8.4buzard_1.html">11</A>).

In the fifty-year span I have traced here, Theophilus Van Kannel's most
famous invention established itself not only as a definitive feature of
urban experience but also as a particularly rich and flexible trope. All
sorts of repetitive or alternating processes could be represented by means
of it. On it could be focused all manner of social hopes and fears; in
the glass panels of its quiet chambers subjectivity might glimpse itself
anew. I propose to halt on the threshold of subsequent developments,
which would

<B></B>

<b>[Begin Page 578]</B>

include the proliferation of the revolving door metaphor throughout
contemporary life, a development especially notable in the discourses
of government and public policy. Today an internet search of the phrase
"revolving door" will turn up a dreary catalogue of journalistic and
other reports on various suspect practices (as in the revolving door
between the domains of politics and corporate lobbying) or distressingly
recurring phenomena (as in the revolving door of jails, drug-treatment
centers, and the like). Since the conclusion of the Second World War,
the idea of being caught or trapped in the revolving door has come to
express the conviction of Red-scared, bureaucratized, conspiracy-theoried
publics that the modernist transparency of the revolving door is a
lie, that the forces propelling our movements and shaping our world
operate elsewhere, on some inaccessible, invisible plane. The sense of
fear and vulnerability that has long circulated around the revolving
door received its most notorious updating in the George Bush (senior)
campaign's race-baiting ad of 1988 attacking Michael Dukakis's prison
furlough program: that "stream of persons" Van Kannel had imagined was
now turned into a flood of dark-skinned felons making their way out of
lock-up and into our (white suburban) nightmares.

back to an era when the revolving door could inspire feelings, not of
despair or of jadedness, but of wonder and joy. Before reentering as I

returns to an enchanting Pandemonium whose victim just kept coming back

By 1900, the Van Kannel Revolving Door Company, headquartered in the
Fuller Building at 23rd Street and Broadway in New York, was operating
internationally, with branch offices in Paris and Berlin, and holding
patents in many European countries. The spread of the Van Kannel door
in Europe was somewhat delayed, however, by various restrictions there
on building heights: the London Building Act of 1894, for instance,
set a limit of 30 meters, and without very tall structures (and banks of
elevators) the desirability of the Van Kannel door could not so readily
be perceived. See Lee Polisano, "Complexity and Contrast: American and
European High-Rise Buildings," <I>Reaching for the Skies: Architectural
Design Profile</I> 116 : 30-35.

can probably describe at length the advantages and disadvantages of
different methods of using the revolving door when in the company of
small children. Do you put them in your compartment, and risk tripping
over them, because in this position you can better protect them against
sudden lurches caused by other users? Or do you let them go it alone--and
if so, in front of you or behind you?--subjecting them to the whims
of every errant door-shover, or worse, every lurking child-snatcher,
who might come along? If you let them face these dangers on their own,
it is somehow worse that you can see them but not reach them, so that
you might see the waiting pedophile who abducts them as they emerge and
then prevents your pursuit by jamming the door with some metal rod or
piece of wood.

Polisano, "Complexity and Contrast," 30. Its absence, Polisano argues,
may be traced to a fundamental difference between European and American
economic strategies: European nations opted to reduce domestic competition
by forming large syndicates or cartels that would "co-ordinate investment,
share capital and benefit from government support;" in the U.S.,
where a strong distrust of government prerogatives prevailed, mergers
of private companies gave rise to numerous very large ones controlling
sizeable pools of capital and requiring vast areas of office space in
the commercial centers. Kenneth Turney Gibbs links the emergence of the
skyscraper more specifically to the "meteoric rise of life insurance in
the business world" after the Civil War. The Equitable Life Assurance
Co. was "the first corporation bold enough to undertake a great office
building in connection with its own necessary place of business:" its
headquarters, constructed in 1868-1870, was also the first to have
a passenger elevator. See Gibbs, <I>Business Architectural Imagery in
America, 1870-1930</I> (Ann Arbor: UMI Research Press, 1984), 25.
