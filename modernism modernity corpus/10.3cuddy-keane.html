<!--_epigraph-->
In the last hundred years the world has changed far more quickly and
completely than in many preceding centuries . . . People in a hurry
travel by aeroplane; you can fly to Paris for tea and be back in London
in time for dinner. First the telegraph, then the telephone, and finally
the discovery of wireless, have brought the remotest parts of the earth
closer and closer together. . . . The United States are, in effect,
nearer to London than Scotland was one hundred years ago.
<p>
The developments of science . . . are welding the world into a whole,
whether its people wish it or not.

</blockquote>

<p>
So wrote Maxwell Garnett, Secretary of the League of Nations Union,
in 1924.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
Today, the clock may be running faster, but the discourse of
globalization is surprisingly the same. Contemporary theories, it
is true, focus on the compression of the world through internet
connectivity, the rise of multinational corporations, and the
homogenizing work of globally marketed music and film; today economics
rather than science is "welding the world into a whole." But it is
doubtful whether we are much further in grasping the implications of
Garnett's title, "The World Becoming One."
<p>
Globalization, although frequently hailed as a recent phenomenon, has
been a long historical process. Political scientist David Held traces
the development of globalization from the Roman and Mongol empires;
sociologist Roland Robertson begins his schematization in the fifteenth
century. Both identify a shift, in the eighteenth century, away from
incipient global forms to the primacy of the nation-state; yet both
mark the beginnings of a new global consciousness in the second half of
the nineteenth

<b></b>

century.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
Held designates globalization's "modern" period as 1850-1945, noting
the rise of transnational secular ideologies and discourses, such as
liberalism, Marxism, and modern science; Robertson calls the 1870s to the
mid-1920s globalization's "Take-off Phase," citing the sharp increase
in global communications, the entry of non-European societies into
"international" society, the increasing diffusion and implementation of
ideas at the international level (the ecumenical movement, the Olympics,
the Nobel Prizes, the Gregorian calendar, and the League of Nations),
and the first <i>world</i> war.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
The modernist period merits attention for its significant role in
the emerging global consciousness; moreover, investigating this role
in its literature enables two important critical moves. First, it
deflects the appropriation of "globalization" for a process driven and
determined solely by economics, claiming cultural globalization as an
equally important, if indeed not earlier, development. Second, it poses
modernist literature's engagement of perspectivism and pluralism as a
generative site for an alternative discourse of globalization&#8212;one
that at the very least complicates the specters of exploitation and
homogeneity that are often assumed to be the inevitable consequences
of a globalized world. Early work on modernism tended to connect its
fascination with subjective perceptions to philosophical relativism or
psychological impressionism, but other equally strong factors include
the increase in world travel (particularly to and from Asia), the
rise of translation, and the growing sense of crisis regarding global
conflict. Did modernist perspectivism, applied in these situations,
yield insights in global understanding? Or, to pose the reverse question,
did increasing encounters with cultural others help to <i>produce</i> the
multipersonal novel? Did an expanding awareness of <i>inter</i>-cultural
connectivity inform the new <i>intra</i>-cultural discourse that was
beginning, at that time, to emerge?
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
To pursue a <i>cultural</i> discourse of globalization,
however, we need first to distinguish between "globalization" and
"geopolitics." Today geopolitics can be used broadly to refer to any
locational approach to political issues, but historically the term was
introduced with the specific connotation of location as territorially
framed. <i>Geopolitik</i> was coined in 1899 by the Swedish political
scientist Rudolf Kjell&eacute;n, for whom it signified a Darwinian model
of state power dependent on territorial growth: stronger organisms survive
by displacing the weaker. Kjell&eacute;n's theories were a major influence
in the developing ideology of Nazi Germany, but the geopolitical model
is generally taken to be the dominant paradigm in the West until the
end of the Cold War. As geographer Brian Blouet points out, geopolitics
is a land-based ideology; it locates power in territorial magnitude and
focuses on the carving up of earth's space. In contrast, Blouet identifies
globalization as originally a maritime-based ideology deriving in large
part from the Dutch; it offers an open rather than closed space paradigm,
locating power in movement rather than bounded territory.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
It is important to note that the contrast is not one of <i>bad</i>
geopolitics versus <i>good</i> globalization; both paradigms can be
subject to imperialist co-option. Territorial imperialism involves the
annexing of space and/or of minds; globalized imperialism relies on
movement&#8212;the ability of power to cross borders, to reconre
itself, to maintain its exploitative role by shifting to the most
vulnerable site for its goals. But in a further complexity, we should
also not assume that

<b></b>

globalization works only in imperialist ways. Economic globalization may
be predatory or productive; cultural globalization may be colonizing
or cooperative. Both dystopian and utopian potentialities are within,
and negotiate within, both economic and cultural forms.
<p>
Geopolitics shifts to globalization as crucial technologies become
increasingly based on the <i>circulation</i> of capital, information,
goods, and services, and as the operative model shifts from bounded space
to multidirectional flows. On the economic side, globalization can be
succinctly defined as "the progressive integration of national economies
into a global market economy, as measured by the increasing flows of
trade, investment, and skilled personnel across national boundaries."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
Cultural globalization is a much less certain process; who can measure
the flow of an idea, much less track its origin or gauge its effect? The
very messiness and uncertainty surrounding the issue has led many either
to reject globalization as an overused and now meaningless clich&eacute;
or to identify it exclusively with economic imperialism, leaving, as the
only alternative, the oppositional stance of <i>anti-</i>globalization. A
third possibility is a broad and continuing historical investigation
of global currents of thought, tracing the complexities and thus the
choices that animate the multidirectional experience of living in an
interdependent, interactive world.
<p>
The first half of the twentieth century offers an excellent point of
entry, since the period both marked the demise of the British Empire
and simultaneously saw the emergence of the field of international
relations. When, at the outset of World War I, Leonard Woolf wrote his
pioneering proposal for international government as a first step in
the prevention of global destruction, he relied almost exclusively on
primary sources. As he recalled, "You could not become an authority on
international government in 1915 by reading books, because the books
did not exist."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
Yet Woolf discovered that the world was not lacking in examples of
international cooperation. In the postal service, for example, he
noted the remarkable handling, in 1906, of an international imbalance
in which the Persian government was carrying internal delivery costs
for foreign bibles being shipped to them from Great Britain and the
U.S., with no corresponding recovery of postage costs for equivalent
external shippings of the Koran. While Western Christians displayed
"a passion for sending bibles to the Persian Muhammadans," there was
a notable absence of missionary zeal on the other side. Responding to
the inequity, the Postal Congress authorized the Persians to impose an
internal levy on all incoming foreign post. Another more amusing instance
that Woolf cites involves an attempt, in Warsaw in 1913, to forge an
international agreement among eighty-nine white slave traffickers;
the meeting terminated with all participants being apprehended by
the police. If international relations had not yet been theorized,
there was nevertheless varied evidence of its emergence in practice
(<i>AA,</i> 2: 135-6).
<p>
In larger terms, the increase in world travel, the broader dissemination
of information through newspapers and broadcasting, and the openness at
the time of both Russia and China all stimulated a growing awareness,
on the part of the ordinary citizen, of living in global space. And,
again in England, this ordinary citizen was being strenuously urged to
develop a broader cooperative consciousness in relation to the world.

<b></b>

In their popularizing, educative role, supporters of the League of Nations
disseminated the message that the League was dependent for success on
the support of the general public. Whatever the political reality,
the materials produced for schools and general audiences emphasized
the democratic, grassroots nature of the League's operation: if the
League was shaped by its members, its members were in turn shaped by
public opinion. In characteristically inclusive fashion, E. E. Reynolds
explained, "That is where we come in; for we help, each of us, to form
public opinion."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
And the values stressed as the foundation of public support were, in
the words of the essay by Garnett cited above, "mutual dependence,"
"international co-operation," and the rights of "minority populations."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>

<p>
Garnett's essay appeared in the journal of the Workers' Education
Association, and the responsiveness of at least some of the British public
to these appeals is reflected in a student's essay that appeared a few
years later in the same periodical. Written by W. H. Drumm, a member
of the Bradford Psychology Tutorial Class, "The Best Practical Way to
Internationalism" proposed to make such theorized mutual dependence a
reality: the "international ideal" could be achieved "by allocating to
certain countries the job of supplying the world with those commodities
for the manufacture of which each country is most suitable."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
England would supply cloth; Germany, toys; Denmark, dairy products;
and Greece, dried fruits. Competition would thus be eliminated in
international markets and all countries would be bound together
in interdependence and "friendly trust." Drumm's practical reality
may not have been too practical, but he understood the ideological
task. Advocating, in addition, foreign travel and the learning of foreign
languages, Drumm concluded by urging the common goal of cultivating
the cooperative spirit in individual minds.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>

<p>
That this cooperative ideal was constructed <i>in opposition</i> to
the reigning imperial paradigm is clear in Leonard Woolf's scathing
critique, <i>Imperialism and Civilization,</i> published the following
year. Placing the root problem firmly on an economic footing, Woolf
asserted that the current global tensions were not attributable to
differences in nationality, race, or religion but to the descent of a
"new, commercialized industrialized civilization" upon civilizations
organized primarily along traditional and agricultural lines.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
While acknowledging that the nineteenth century was not the beginning of
imperial relations, he argued that it did produce an entirely new form:
a "predatory"
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
technological economy that demanded a constant diet of ever-expanding
markets and raw materials (<i>IC,</i> 9), joined to a new nationalistic
patriotism that sought not only to annex territory&#8212;as older
imperialisms had done&#8212;but to force the subordinated civilization
to adjust or conform to the civilization of the dominant. Forcing other
peoples to change in ways that previous forms of imperialism had not
attempted to do, nineteenth-century imperialism exerted the double
power of "economic penetration accompanied by political control"
(<i>IC,</i> 61). The resulting disparity in power relations, Woolf
argued, <i>produced</i> racial and religious tensions where they had not
existed before; in addition, the inevitable revolt against inequality
caused new, and to some extent artificial, geopolitical coalitions to
be fabricated out of previous diversity. Likening the rising fear of a
"Pan-Islamic movement" to the earlier "Yellow Peril" that

<b></b>

haunted Kaiser Wilhelm II, Woolf claimed a certain poetic justice in
the terror inflicted on the imperialists by "these international bogeys"
of their own creation (<i>IC,</i> 26). For these seemingly united forces
were both bogus and yet an identifiable sign:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
There has been a notable revolt of Islam against the Christian States of
the West, and a remarkable drawing together of Islamic peoples. But it
is the revolt against imperialism, against the tyranny of the Western
civilization and the hegemony of European States, which has effected
this. [<i>IC,</i> 26]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Similarly, in Asia and Africa, Woolf continued, imperialism <i>forced</i>
nationalisms to appear, uniting the oppressed peoples and "[teaching]
them to use their new cohesion against their conquerors and rulers"
(<i>IC,</i> 28).
<p>
There is much in this irascible and yet astonishingly prescient book that
would be worth pausing over today, but what interests me here, in light of
the issues I raised earlier, is the interaction in Woolf's text between
the global and the geopolitical. We can mark the incipient presence of a
globalized economic imperialism in the process that Woolf is recording,
but then trace the way it becomes subsumed under geopolitical aims,
and produces geopolitical thinking in response. For not only does Woolf
delineate the emergence of geopolitical identities as a reaction against
exploitation; he himself turns ultimately to the geopolitical as the only
immediately viable path. Convinced of the insurmountable impasse created
when radical imbalances of power define relations between an alien enclave
of one people situated within a larger population (whether that enclave is
the African American in the United States or the white minority in South
Africa), and seeing only in South America an ameliorative intermixing
and intermarrying between the "invading Europeans" and the "native
inhabitants," Woolf resorts to the preservation of national purity as the
only alternative to violence until an equality of peoples can be achieved.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
The thrust of his separatist argument, it is true, is to dissuade his own
government from further white settlement in Kenya, and he gestures toward
a future guided by the League's alternative discourse: a "synthesis of
civilizations" as interrelated parts of a vast international society,
in which "[t]he forcible subjection of one people . . . by others
. . . becomes an absurdity and an anachronism" (<i>IC,</i> 120). But he
nevertheless concludes that, as long as "the whites are determined to
preserve their political and economic supremacy," as long as "Europe is
to be for the Europeans, and America for the Americans, and Australia
for the Australians," then "Asia must be for the Asiatics, and Africa
for the Africans" (<i>IC,</i> 103, 134-5).
<p>
Woolf's indictment of the human being as economic animal is strong,
but it is precisely at this point, at the point of retrenchment into
separatist isolationism, that his model needs the complication of other
dimensions. Economic circumstances produce cultural attitudes; however,
the flow of influence can also run in the reciprocal direction. There can
be more motivating factors, even in financial matters, than materialism
and testosterone. And while it would be na&iuml;ve to think that all
cultural attitudes work for the good, the realm of human thoughts and
emotions is nevertheless the place where <i>better</i> motivations must
be sought. Cultural globalization offers not an exclusionary sphere but
a different starting point. By turning from economic to cultural

<b></b>

forces, and from the geopolitical to the globalized imagination, we
can facilitate other answers by questioning in different ways.
<p>
What, then, is cultural globalization? The authors of <i>Global
Transformations</i> take, as their definition of culture, "the
social construction, articulation and reception of meaning," which,
in the processes of globalization, become subject to "the movement
of objects, signs and people across regions and intercontinental
space." Yet such movement is meaningless for an understanding of
cultural globalization without an account of its effect&#8212;without an
examination of "the stretching and deepening of cultural relationships and
practices." Cultural globalization is found in "patterns of reciprocal
interaction," which include, but also expand far beyond, "the global
spread of corporate symbols and pop culture." The "modes of interaction"
are diverse, flexible, varied&#8212;ranging through "homogenization,
contestation, hybridization and indifference" (<i>GT,</i> 328-31).
<p>
The definitive quality of cultural globalization thus lies in
interactivity and interdependency. The flows of influence are
multidirectional; nothing is static or fixed. Arjun Appadurai defines
the new form of "global cultural processes" as "an organized field of
social practices, a form of work . . . and a form of negotiation between
sites of agency (individuals) and globally defined fields of possibility."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
Delineating the various areas in which such negotiation takes place
(categorized as ideoscapes, technoscapes, financescapes, ethnoscapes, and
mediascapes), Appadurai shows, at the same time, how these "scapes" exist
in interaction with each other. Approaching the world as "one large,
interactive system, composed of many complex subsystems," Appadurai's
recourse is to chaos theory and "complex, overlapping fractal shapes"
to image the whole (<i>ML,</i> 41, 46). Fractals, as stochastic and
unpredictable and yet with detectable repetitive patterns, serve well
to represent the nature of "disjunctive global flows" (<i>ML,</i> 47).
<p>
Chaos, it should be noted, while unpredictable is not indescribable and,
from what I have observed, globalization, in both economic and cultural
forms, is marked by at least four characteristics. Disjunctive global
flows are:

<ol>
<!--_orderedList-->
<li><i>kinetic</i> (Global processes are marked by movement, fluidity,
and a continuous process of formation, deformation, and reformation.)</li>

<li><i>interdependent</i> (No action occurs in isolation; whatever one
country or person does affects other countries or people, and the meaning
of a practice in one location is in part dependent on what others are
doing elsewhere.)</li>

<li><i>contextual</i> (The same action has different meaning in different
places.)</li>

<li><i>impure</i> (A globalized understanding involves a recognition of
diversity with the self, within cultures, and within the globe. And,
perhaps paradoxically, this acknowledgement of differences must
ultimately incorporate the "pure," according to the principle that,
if conceptualizations of the globe are to be inclusive, they must also
accommodate those who define their identities as homogeneous.)</li>
<!--_/orderedList-->
</ol>

<p>
Globalization thus does not exclude identity as conceived in terms
of geopolitical boundaries; but it situates those constructs within a
multidirectional, global space. The geopolitical and the global will
always coexist; furthermore, within the global, there will always be
both imperializing and liberating tendencies at play. In E. M.

<b></b>

Forster's <i>Passage to India,</i> when pushed to respond to the question
why he is in India filling a post that an Indian would otherwise have,
Fielding answers, "I take up some other fellow's air, don't I, whenever
I breathe?"&#8212;a remark that is both insensitively facetious and
ruthlessly to the point.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
John Updike's early poem "Trees Eat Sunshine" is another succinct
reminder that our mutual inhabiting of the globe is always a
consuming of someone else's resources&#8212;a brutal reality that,
once recognized, argues for the ethical realism of balancing our needs
as inevitable consumers against our <i>need</i>&#8212;again a basic
need for survival&#8212;to maintain, both cognitively and physically,
an ecologically balanced world.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
And to do that, we must be self-reflexively aware of our cultural
locations and understand these cultural locations not as autonomous
countries but as regions of the world. For some cultures, that may
involve thinking themselves out of positions of dominance and into
mutually dependent forms. Critiquing the patriarchal and militaristic
professor of literature, Sir Walter Raleigh, Virginia Woolf wrote,
"He never pressed on over the ruins of his own culture to the discovery
of something better."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
It is that impetus or "pressing on" in modernist literature that I seek
to trace.
<p>
In the next section of this paper, I turn to an analysis of various
"modes of interaction" that constitute modernist global flows (<i>GT,</i>
330). My approach is to categorize different tropic structures, or
"res of thought," in order to explain some of the ways in which
global connectivity entered into literary, and hence public, discourse
during the early twentieth century.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
Without suggesting a comprehensive schematic, I distinguish four strands
of globalized thinking in modernist texts, which, for ease of discussion,
I call critical, syncretic, cohabiting, and runaway modes. There is,
of course, an extreme irony in logically separating identifiable
units out of a fluid, chaotic, and kinetic process. These modes are
not as distinct as rational division makes them appear. Nevertheless,
by dipping into literary texts and scooping up particular narrative
events, we can isolate some distinctive characteristics of cultural
encounters before returning them to the flow.
<p>
My approach, it should be noted, in many ways echoes Susan Stanford
Friedman's delineation of five "tropic patterns"&#8212;which she names
nation, borders, migration, "glocation," and conjuncture.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
But I find it revelatory of the nature of globalization that the
logical relation between our different categorizations is difficult if
not impossible to fix: they overlap but are not collapsible; neither
can be construed as subsets of the other. To some extent, Friedman's
tropic patterns are at a broader theoretical level; they refer perhaps
to the materials of transcultural thinking whereas mine refer more to
resulting effects. But our schematizations relate to each other&#8212;to
borrow Friedman's term&#8212;paratactically; I hope they will be read
side by side.
<p>
What our projects have perhaps most in common is an attempt not to
systematize but to use systematic understanding to open up the multiple
possibilities in transcultural encounters. If Orientalism is the dominant
formation of the geopolitical imagination, we need a corresponding
understanding of the global imagination, even though it may be less
amenable to a singular approach. In the following examples, I attempt
to delineate the transformative possibilities arising when the self is
resituated out in the world

<b></b>

of global flows. Such reformation of the self constitutes merely one
aspect of globalization, but an aspect, I submit, whose consideration
could not be more pertinent to the global problems confronting us today.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
1. Critical Globalization
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Critical globalization uses knowledge of other regions or countries to
disrupt habitual perceptions and practices, and to prompt a self-reflexive
repositioning of the self in the global sphere.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
It resembles the typical learning experience of the traveler but the
transformative experience arises, not through an encounter with the
foreign, but through the imagined adoption of the other's point of view.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
The trope for this perspectival shift is chiasmus, sometimes enacted in a
literal shift to another's eyes. In the following passage from <i>Heart
of Darkness,</i> for example, Marlow's reversing perspective, as he
walks toward an approaching African, inverts the racial clich&eacute;:
"He had a uniform jacket with one button off and seeing a white man on
the path hoisted his weapon to his shoulder with alacrity. This was
simple prudence, white men being so much alike at a distance that he
could not tell who I might be."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
The shift merely gestures to the African's point of view, but it effects
a change in the white intruder from seeing to being seen, from privileged
individual to the unknown mass. The mirror of self-ethnography thus
critically disrupts the complacency of self-location, as in this 1929
critique of the teaching of history in the British schools: "Many of
us grow up knowing nothing of China but pigtails, and that the women's
feet were cruelly bound there (the teachers who told us were at the
waist tightly corseted themselves)."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>

<p>
This reversing gaze is the foundational trope in <i>Letters from John
Chinaman,</i> in which Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson adopts a Chinese
persona to construct the English as the foreigners in the text.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
The genre is the Oriental Tale, in the tradition of Oliver Goldsmith's
<i>The Citizen of the World,</i> where the voice of an Asian observer
is employed to distance and satirize English customs; but Dickinson
goes further to inhabit the body of the other, locating himself
within a different system of belief. According to Forster's biography,
Dickinson once told a group of students that "in a previous existence,
[he] actually was a Chinaman!"
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
The claim might appear to be fanciful teasing, except for its congruency
with a line from one of Dickinson's private letters: "It's a curious
thing to have a woman's soul shut up in a man's body, but that seems
to be my case."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
Dickinson's ability to slide between gendered and cultural locations
becomes a way of achieving critical globalization in his own imaginative
space. Posing anonymously as John Chinaman, he enacts&#8212;on the
analogy of cross-dressing&#8212;a cross-culturing that exhibits the
multidirectionality characteristic of global flows.
<p>
The letters are forerunners to Leonard Woolf's attacks on predatory
imperialism and indeed to Dickinson's formulation of the initial scheme
for a League of Nations, in August 1914.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
In this earlier work, international tensions are evoked in the lightly
sketched political background of the crisis that the British called
the Boxer Rebellion, but which John Chinaman describes as "the recent
attack of the Western Powers on China" (<i>LJC,</i> 52). But the focus
shifts from immediate events to underlying causes,

<b></b>

mounting a disparaging critique of the primacy given in the West to the
"cash-nexus" (<i>LJC,</i> 7), the na&iuml;ve belief in international trade
as a stimulant to global relations (<i>LJC,</i> 15), the violence and
lawlessness of imperialist behavior in occupied lands (<i>LJC,</i> 17,
52-3), and the correspondingly ironic "mission" to "civilize the world"
(<i>LJC,</i> 10).
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
In contrast, Chinese society is shown to display the alternative values
of a rational, humane, moral, and <i>democratic</i> approach. But
cultural contrast on its own does not make the global imagination;
the sense of multidirectional flows derives from the dialogic relation
between writer and reader. The anonymous Chinese official encodes the
voice of the other&#8212;meaning the <i>English</i> reader&#8212;in
his text, considering and answering his reader's objections, admitting
imperfections in China, acknowledging the value of Western inventions,
allowing for the possibility that long absence has caused him to
idealize home. The writer presents a balanced, self-reflexive view,
and he does so through an ongoing response to an encoded "you"
in his text. As he admits, "I am too well aware of the complexity
of all human affairs to deny that there may be something in your
point of view" (<i>LJC,</i> 59). While the situating of narrator
and narratee inscribes the geopolitical idea of opposing cultures,
the dialogic treatment breaks down oppositional relations. Even the
title of the work is difficult to fix: as the phrase of an English
writer, it inscribes Anglo-centrism; as a phrase from a Chinese pen,
it parodies and critiques the colonizing English mind. Ultimately the
one significant difference is between monocentric and global views:
the writer attributes Christianity's failure to produce an adequate
social model to its origins in the "untravelled imagination" of a "mild
Oriental enthusiast," whose knowledge of other cultures and languages
was not very great (<i>LJC,</i> 26, 48). John Chinaman, by contrast, has
a broader understanding, not simply because he is Chinese, but because
he has also lived in England for some time. For it is the traveled
imagination that grasps the chiasmic twist: "Learn to understand us,
and in doing so learn better to understand yourselves" (<i>LJC,</i> 63).

2. Syncretic Globalization
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
The traveled imagination perfectly describes Yoshio Markino, a Japanese
artist who lived in London for well over forty years. Markino was
well versed in ancient Chinese philosophy, history, and poetry, and in
the literature and history of Japan; he read extensively in English,
publishing an essay, for example, on "Chaucer and Chinese Odes."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
He lived in Japan, America, and England, and he painted in England,
Paris, and Rome. But in Markino's work, the globalized imagination works
syncretically rather than critically. Syncretic globalization refers
to processes of accrual, expansion, or extension&#8212;but not merger:
<i>The American Heritage Dictionary</i> defines <i>syncretic</i> as
"a reconciliation or fusion . . . <i>especially when success is partial
or the result is heterogeneous.</i>"
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
In <i>A Japanese Artist in London,</i> Markino's title is deliberate. His
writing identity is not hyphenated Japanese-English, but "Japanese in
England and in English," indicating the self situated in global flows.
<p>
Yoshio Markino was born into a Samurai family at the time of the Meiji
restoration and the advent of modernization in Japan. Like Dickinson,
Markino fit uneasily into

<b></b>

his society's gender roles, being&#8212;though apparently
heterosexual&#8212;as much like a girl as a boy. A sensitive child and
close to his parents, he suffered the loss of his father's Samurai
position, the death of his mother, and a somewhat unhappy adoption
into a family of cousins. Avoiding an arranged marriage, he "ran away"
to the West in the hope of becoming an English poet. Convinced by
friends to shift to the study of painting, Markino spent an unpalatable
four years in San Francisco, after which he moved to London (in 1897),
where he lived on his painting and writing until his return to Japan in
1942. Whereas Dickinson lived as a Cambridge don under the adopted sign
of a Chinese cap,
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
Markino inhabited an adopted name. "Yoshio" was the name given to
him after his mother's death, to avoid confusing him with a cousin;
the spelling "Markino" altered the usual transliteration "Makino,"
by adding an "r" to ensure an English pronunciation closer to the
original. Forced in part to respond to a naming by others, Markino
nevertheless used the floating sign to construct a Japanese self in
global terms. Once signing an art gallery guest book, "Whole world is
my home," Markino turned dislocation from a sorrow into a freedom.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
At the same time, selective syncretism provided points of cultural
contact through which he became a self-appointed cultural ambassador,
negotiating friendship between East and West.
<p>
In his written English, Markino believed he was inventing a "new
style"&#8212;an attempt "to express [his] emotion in the way of ancient
Chinese rhetoric," while simultaneously striking a corresponding
"sympathetic emotion" in the English reader.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
The emotional connection depends, as he says, on both "sympathy" and
"wisdom," thus requiring from his readers an active response (<i>RR,</i>
123). For the writing is both delightfully simple and perceptually
demanding.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
Markino presents himself with a humility, a childlike trust, a
na&iuml;vete that, in its apparent lack of concern for self-preservation,
is easy to misidentify&#8212;as English critics often did&#8212;as
artlessness, as "charm," as picturesquely quaint. Yet his writing is
charged with a complexity that is at once disrupting and affiliating in
effect. The title of one of his books, for example, <i>My Idealed John
Bullesses,</i> plays with the English stereotype with even further twists
than Dickinson's "John Chinaman." At the same time, Markino recuperates
the stereotype through his kindness and affection, presenting the
Englishwomen as neither ideal nor idealized, but <i>idealed.</i>
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
His courtesy denotes a highly sophisticated ethics requiring a shift in
English positionality to understand its implications; it also functions
as a mirror asking his audience to respond in kind. His words are formed
for "friend making," and designed to "win the hearts" (<i>RR,</i>
127, 125). His dream is to create global harmony and a better world,
by advancing what I might term "the ethics of a circulating spiritual
economy."
<p>
An ordinary incident readily illustrates his approach. Although habitually
poor, whenever he could afford to eat in a restaurant, he did so in
order to study the people. On one occasion, leaving what he believed
to be three pennies on the table, he mistakenly left a ten-shilling
piece as well. When the waitress ran after him to correct his error,
Markino&#8212;despite his poverty&#8212;immediately divided the amount
into five shillings each. And he explains, "I was much appreciative with
her faithfulness."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
The unidiomatic words are semantically exacting: honesty appreciates
in repeated giving,

<b></b>

for the waitress was <i>literally</i> faithful to the "sacred conscience"
common to us all (<i>JAL,</i> 72). Money and generosity must be freely
given into sacred circulation, but the functioning of the system depends
on constant return. On another occasion, Markino credits a shopkeeper
with displaying no racial discrimination in his welcoming greeting,
"we 'ave our colonies all <i>hover</i> the world, sir, white men,
yellow men, brown men and black men are forming parts of the British
nation" (<i>JAL,</i> 9). "What a broad mind he had!" writes Markino,
both capturing the shopkeeper's own variety of English and generously
refraining from any comment on the imperialist phrasing or the ignorance
of Britain's relations with Japan. The challenge to the reader, however,
is not to underestimate Markino's implications. He "charms" by being
grateful and appreciative, but he seeks to elicit a corresponding
appreciation of <i>his own</i> generosity to the English, and to stimulate
an ever-expanding generosity in return. And his syncretic writing,
which Douglas Sladen describes as "a medium using the capabilities of
both languages," expertly articulates his combinatory cultural approach.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
3. Cohabiting Globalization
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Dickinson's rational critique and Markino's empathetic appeal work
in different ways to pull the reader into the global dynamics of the
text&#8212;one a Western text in disguise as an Eastern text, one an
Eastern text in Western disguise. What they establish is reciprocal rather
than oppositional relations (between East and West, between writer and
reader), and a desire to move into the stream of cultural flows. But
if critical and syncretic globalizations attempt in different ways to
put cultures into relation with each other, the third mode involves a
perception that understands them as separate and distinct. However,
unlike Orientalism, this mode of globalized perception understands
difference as operating from a different center; the other culture remains
unpredictable, uncircumscribable, because it originates elsewhere. Cast
as "cohabiting globalization," this mode acknowledges the autonomous,
independent being of the other. It treats the "unknown" in the foreign
culture not as an inherently mysterious and exotic element but as
a condition of the necessarily limited understanding of the viewer;
and it resists the assimilation of difference into one "normative"
language. As an apprehension of alterity that refrains from positing
essence, it imagines a world of separate, complex individuals who inhabit
and share mutual space.
<p>
My informing example here is a short story by Joyce Cary, first published
in 1950, but most likely written in 1938-39, and originating still
earlier, in Cary's experience as a lieutenant in the Nigerian Regiment
in World War I.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
Set in a temporary camp in the Cameroons, the story recounts a late-night
conversation between an Irish-British subaltern, named Corner,
and Umaru, a Hausa sergeant. The exchange is neither a sentimental
sharing&#8212;which would appropriate Umaru into Corner's world&#8212;nor
an epiphany of mystic otherness&#8212;which would construct Umaru as
an exoticized foreigner. Instead, Corner apprehends Umaru as another
human being in the world.
<p>
Set within the cultural crisis of war, the subsidiary setting of an army
camp internalizes a further "contact zone"&#8212;what Mary Louise Pratt
defines as a "social space where

<b></b>

disparate cultures meet, clash, and grapple with each other."
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
But whereas Pratt notes that such zones often display "radically
asymmetrical relations of power," the power dynamics in Cary's story
reveal multiple orderings at work.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
Army hierarchy subordinates the sergeant to the commissioned officer,
but the ordinary soldiers, shy of both Corner and Umaru, isolate their
superiors together on one side of the giant canvas that shelters their
rest. But equitable relations among all the men are red in the
domestic imagery that converts the scene to "a vast family bed with
one white and nineteen black faces sticking out all round a large
patchwork quilt" ("U," 20). The domestic analogy furthermore implies
an alternative hierarchy&#8212;the precedence of age: "Sergeant Umaru,
thirty-year veteran, called often Father Umaru by the men" is credited
with clear seniority in experience ("U," 19).
<p>
On this particular night, Corner lies awake grappling with the cataclysmic
disruption of the war and troubled by existential angst. Unable to sleep,
he attempts to engage Umaru in conversation, but every assumption he makes
about Umaru's thinking turns out rather comically to be wrong. A pattern
emerges in which Corner advances a hypothesis which Umaru then disproves,
or Corner invokes consensus only to encounter Umaru's dissent. Corner
assumes that Umaru's second name&#8212;Bauchi&#8212;refers to his place
of origin; Umaru dryly remarks that the name is simply an identifying tag
in the Army. Corner, seeking sympathetic understanding, ventures that it
isn't good to be lonely; Umaru asserts his solitary independence. Corner,
a Protestant, blunders in taking Umaru's comment that it is good to
live like a Haji to mean that Umaru, a Muslim, regards God familiarly
as a friend; and finally Corner's digressions on the beauty of the
clouds are rejected in wondering contempt by the old sergeant who
reads in the clouds a coming storm. But rather than plunging Corner
further into troubled anxiety, the imperturbable stability of the older
man brings the younger ecstatic relief. The reversing view of his own
<i>in</i>experience releases Corner from the burden of his attempts to
understand&#8212;either Umaru or the world. Corner's inability to "know"
Umaru is cathartic, confirming that the universe is not coterminous with
his own limited self, and relieving the burden of alienation through a
non-appropriative or non-assimilated epiphany of an<i>other</i> man.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>

<p>
The experience of cohabitation is then realized through the sense
of touch. The conversation ends when Umaru leads in a traditional
Hausa blessing for sleep and good health, and turns his back to go
to sleep. But one tiny part of their bodies remains in contact. Lying
still for another hour, Corner is aware of "the place where his elbow
touched Umaru's back" and that one tiny point generates a steady flow of
affection and pleasure ("U," 24). Corner experiences a moment of being
in touch&#8212;ratively and literally&#8212;but the experience is not
one he requires his conscious mind to possess. The native "Other" in this
narrative is still limited to a role in the British&#8212;or in this case,
Irish&#8212;man's experience, since Umaru's own narrative is only lightly
glimpsed from the outside. However, in this particular mode of global
imagining, that is the very point. The autonomy of the other person is
asserted by recognizing the real existence of other subjective worlds.

<b></b>

<p>
Cohabiting globalization fosters the construction of home identity
not as a center but as a region of the world; it correspondingly
promotes an understanding of the world as a pluralistic home of diverse
individuals. I have referred elsewhere to "universal individualism"
as a pivotal modernist concept, deriving the term from Leonard Woolf.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
As Woolf asserts, the democratic ideals of the French Revolution
"only translate into social and political terms the consciousness of
<i>universal individuality</i> and the right of everyone to be treated as
an individual, a free fellow-human being" (emphasis added; <i>AA,</i> 2:
386). In perceiving the "I" of "the Other," the traditional opposition
between individualism and collectivity is diffused. Encounters with
individual voices from elsewhere situate the self relationally and
equally with others in the world.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
5. Runaway Globalization
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
If cohabiting globalization signals the positive potential in modernist
pluralism, a pluralistic vision nevertheless runs the risk of losing
an effective interventionist stance. The posture of extreme tolerance
can become an accommodating mode of passivity; more problematically,
it begs the question of how far tolerance should be extended to
the intolerant. Unlimited pluralism leads to the problem of runaway
globalization, to use a term borrowed from Anthony Giddens's <i>Runaway
World.</i>
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
For Giddens, the loss of control is closely associated with the vast
destabilizing forces of electronic money; in cultural globalization,
the loss posed by an excessive submersion in disjunctive flows is one
of ethical and emotional commitment.
<p>
Runaway globalization is evocative of the Gatsby era and, perhaps even
more strongly, of the rootless cosmopolitan society of Berlin in the
years leading up to World War II. The fascination of this free-floating
era is captured in Christopher Isherwood'sBerlin novels: <i>Mr. Norris
Changes Trains</i> and <i>Goodbye to Berlin.</i>
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
Set in the last days of the Weimer Republic, the novels present a world
in which identities and desires are unbound, crossing both literal
borders and socially constructed boundaries of gender, sexuality,
politics, and the law. And for the narrator William Bradshaw (a
fictional-autobiographical crosser, bearing Isherwood's two middle
names), one significant crossed border runs between England (where
homosexuality was still criminalized) and Berlin (city, in the 1920s,
of de-territorialized sexual expression). But this freedom, though
liberating and even hypnotizing in <i>Mr. Norris Changes Trains,</i>
is ultimately runaway. Sexual and political promiscuity become merely
another capitalist coin&#8212;or electronic sign&#8212;in circulating
exchange.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
The penultimate of the linked short stories that make up <i>Goodbye to
Berlin</i> concerns the relation of the narrator (now named Christopher
Isherwood)&#8212;an impoverished writer and language teacher with vaguely
communist sympathies&#8212;and the Landauers&#8212;a wealthy capitalist
Jewish family, and owners of a high-class department store. Both the
Isherwood character and Bernhard Landauer, the nephew who manages the
family business, inhabit a world of global flows: the narrator is an
Englishman more psychologically at home in the sexually liberated and
erotically charged underworld of Berlin, while Bernhard is a Jew who
is at once the son of an English mother and a German father, a capitalist

<b></b>

through family responsibility but a sculptor by desire, and a traveler
throughout the Jewish diaspora who nevertheless feels that China is
his psychological home. Although the territorialized oppositions of
English/German, Aryan/Jew, Occidentalist/Orientalist, Communist/Capitalist
threaten to divide the two men, a stronger and more compelling connection
is implied through their common lack of fixity in any one position. But
despite the positive implications of their fluid subjectivities,
the disturbing weakness of this open world is exposed in their last
conversation, in which Bernhard makes the sudden, and deliberately
fantastic, proposition that the two of them leave (elope?) immediately
that night for China. Despite their previous, intimate contacts of touch,
in moments when Bernhard rests his hand on the narrator's shoulder,
Bernhard's proposal is treated by <i>both</i> men with an ironic blend of
politeness and mockery that exposes a fundamental <i>self</i>-mockery at
its roots. The daring proposal is of course not taken up; detachment from
the territorial, it seems, rests on a personal aloofness from commitment,
a constant multiple performative that makes a serious pledge too dangerous
a risk. But the unacted narrative disrupts the focalization for which this
work is well known ("I am a camera") with the alternative possibilities of
what might have happened had the narrator come out from behind his lens.
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
As it is, eighteen months later, the narrator learns of Bernhard's
mysterious disappearance and death; the Third Reich begins; and the
narrator retreats to his English "home." Despite the unspoken bond
between Christopher and Bernhard (for by 1933, both Jews and homosexuals
were victims of Nazi persecution), in the world of nomadic nonjudgmental
detachment, tolerance has no ethical force. Runaway globalization is
routed by the power of the returning geopolitical.

Future Directions
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
What I have outlined here is merely a beginning, but I hope it will
be enough to suggest further worthwhile directions to pursue. There is,
however, an obvious question that must be addressed. Will seeking a global
consciousness in the modernist period ground our study once again in the
perspectives of white, Western, and privileged groups? Consciousness
of the whole needs to aim for inclusiveness of voice. The examples I
discussed above are admittedly all by male writers, but the selection
was deliberately made to represent various ethnicities and regions:
Chinese, Japanese, Nigerian Muslim, and German Jew. In addition, these
writers indicate a range of forms that globalized voices might take:
cross-culturing and performative (Dickinson), autobiographical (Markino),
and fictional (Cary and Isherwood). My earlier reference to an essay by
a student in working-class education suggests a further way to extend
our scope, and there is a rich field to explore in the prolific work
of modernist translation, including the translation of little-known
works into English and the translation of English modernist works into
other languages.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>

<p>
In addition, cultural globalization, as I have defined it, involves
not only the movement of people but also the movement of objects and
signs. Literal travelers enact one form of global contact but objects
and artifacts speak in a different way to the complex

<b></b>

imbrications of cultural ties. Willa Cather's novels, for example,
quite apart from their numerous immigrant journeys, abound in markers of
embedded travel&#8212;the "traveling-in-dwelling" which James Clifford
argues is always already encoded in any putatively fixed cultural site.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
Objects have traveling histories: witness the bell, in <i>Death Comes
for the Archbishop,</i> which has come to New Mexico from Mexico,
but whose medieval Spanish inscription hearkens back to the time when
it was reputedly cast from silver melted down from household objects,
pledged by the Spanish during their war with the Moors. Furthermore,
this seemingly monolinear lineage is complicated by the information
that the ringing of the Angelus descended from a Moslem custom and
that the Spaniards learned everything they knew about working silver
from the Moors&#8212;a knowledge then passed on to the Mexicans, who
in turn taught the Navajos their art.
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
The path running back to past origins leaps the rails, so to speak, to
become, in reverse, a trajectory of skills moving into the present. But
what is important for my argument here is the way an ordinary artifact
embodies the complexities and contradictions of cultural crossings, here
encoding the paradoxical entanglements of hostilities and indebtedness
that define our relations in the globe.
<p>
Additionally, global consciousness can be accessed not only through the
life of common objects but also through a tie to the land. Cultural
globalization is distinguished by a consciousness of dwelling in
the world, and a conception of that world as a fluid, interconnected,
conflicted, and dynamic whole. At its best, perhaps, it manifests itself
as an ecological imagination, and in this form can be found in Native
American writers like Zitkala-Sa (Gertrude Bonnin). In her essay,
"Why I am a Pagan," Zitkala-Sa defines her "Paganism" not as belief
in pagan gods, but as "a compassion for all echoes in human guise,"
a compassion emanating from a conception of the globe as animated by
the Great Spirit flowing through us all.
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
Although critical of the white Christian culture that inserts its
antithetical values into her world, she images the larger construct of
human community as "a living mosaic of human beings" or as "the ivory
keys of one instrument where each resembles all the rest, yet varies
from them in pitch and quality of voice" ("WIP," 802-3). If we take the
global imagination as signifying the ability to conceive of one's own
identity as part of an interrelated and interdependent world space,
and that space as multiform and contradictory, then imaginings such
as Zitkala-Sa's form part of the complex intersections that constitute
modernist cultural globalization.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>

<p>
The critical challenge for this project may therefore lie not in
the exclusivity of globalization but in the need to establish certain
definitional parameters: not every cultural encounter should be taken as
a form of cultural globalization. Fundamentally, what is at issue is not a
prescribed feature of a text but a distinctive form of consciousness. And
it is this peculiar consciousness that relates so strongly to the kinetic,
heterogeneous fluidity that is a frequent characteristic of modernist
texts. For, in all my examples above, the narrative focalization is
subjected to a wobble&#8212;one that frustrates a fixed and exclusive
identification between the self and a home location, and constructs a self
that depends <i>for its identity</i> on being situated in the world. The
result is epistemic instability, but the accompanying gesture is toward a
"stability-of-process"&#8212;

<b></b>

a continuously decomposing and recomposing equilibrium created through
negotiations with views from other eyes. The paradigmatic shift traced
in outline replaces the ideal of cognitive certainty with the broader
value of cognitive mobility.
<p>
In thus bridging the aesthetic and the social, my analysis relates the
modernist effects of destabilized focalization to a growing awareness
of cultural heteroglossia. Equally crucial, and indeed deriving from
modernism's self-reflexive awareness of positionality, is a modernist
engagement with the ethical implications of living in an interdependent,
interactive world. For the question we continue to face is whether
cognitive mobility will be passive, or predatory, or productive of a
liberating, cooperating world. Today, calls for ethical commitment are
<i>part</i> of globalized discourse; they inhere in the process that
Richard Falk discusses as "globalization-from-below" (<i>CG,</i> 192),
or that Richard Sandbrook more broadly names "civilizing" or "humanizing"
globalization (<i>CG,</i> 2). But in economic globalization, ethical
intervention is most often framed as reactive and oppositional; in the
larger schematic, as Sandbrook indeed recognizes, we need to effect a
change in the way the world thinks (<i>CG,</i> 10).
<p>
It is my argument here that humanists have a role in humanizing
globalization, and that achieving a "culturally sensitive global economy"
requires culturally sensitive thought (<i>CG,</i> 266). The extent to
which <i>ideas</i> have the power to move economic and social realities
is, of course, debatable, as is the question whether a way of thinking
could ever be globally shared. The sobering effect of working in a
historical area such as modernism is the constant realization of how
little has changed. I have long been convinced of the Red Queen's command
to Alice, "<i>here,</i> you see, it takes all the running <i>you</i>
can do to keep in the same place."
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
Yet the battlefields of Europe in the modernist period have been
replaced, as I write, by communal forums working to forge a Constitution
of the European Union;
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
and the Dutch, who in the seventeenth century denoted the globalizing
imperialism of a seaborne empire, went on to provide a model, in the
1990s, for the mutually supportive structure of a cooperative welfare
state.
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
As for the power of ideas, I balance their frustrating ineffectuality
with another view I encountered long ago&#8212;that the Industrial
Revolution was "technically possible" long before it happened, and it
required the presence of an enabling philosophical system to actualize
its birth.
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
By recognizing at least the potential for the cultural imagination to
guide and direct economic forces, we open up a space beyond materialist
determinants for the vitally enabling role of human thought.
<p>
I began this essay by quoting Maxwell Garnett's words, in 1924, on
the world becoming one. In 1932, at approximately the same time as the
ending of Isherwood's <i>Goodbye to Berlin,</i> Nowell Charles Smith,
writing on the League in collaboration with Garnett, identified <i>two</i>
aspects of the changing world: in addition to <i>contraction</i> or the
shrinking of the globe, he named <i>sensitization</i>&#8212;the process
of being affected by what is happening elsewhere in the world.
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
Smith coined the latter term from the verb to <i>sensitize</i> in
photography&#8212;the action of "render[ing] (a plate, film or paper)
sensitive to the influence of light"
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
&#8212;a meaning that he wanted to "transfer by metaphor to the human
race."
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
We need to seek, in modernist literature, a history of that
sensitization, charting its rapids, eddies, and flows. It is unlikely
to be the utopian project hailed in

<b></b>

Smith's title, "The Dawn of a World Order"
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>
but, if it can help us to understand the complexities, the variations,
and even the failures of cultural globalization, it will contribute
its share to the foundation of a sustainable world.

(<i>IC,</i> 47, 133-4) Woolf's listing and then rejecting, on the grounds
of impracticality, the alternative of "extermination" has to be read as
a Swiftian outburst (<i>IC,</i> 100). As his autobiography makes clear,
not only did Woolf identify slavery with the Jewish progroms; he felt a
profound sympathy with all victims of "senseless savagery," and responded
with emotions of "acute pain," "disappointment," "horror," "discomfort,"
and "disgust" (<i>AA,</i> 2: 200-1, 487-8). Sudden outbursts of satire
or sarcasm are not uncommon in his writing and it is certainly debatable
whether he was really the calm, rational "Other" in his marriage to
Virginia Woolf.

with a comprehensive grasp of possibility and a penetrating sensitivity
to political implication. Although she refers to her subject as
"geopolitical," feminism, in her analysis, acts on geopolitics in ways
that produce the pluralistic, relational, contradictory, and interactive
processes I refer to as cultural globalization.

my description of the self resituated in global flows. See Berman,

Although the letters are addressed to an English audience, the

for the "fate of the Western world." See [G. Lowes Dickinson], <i>Letters

Markino did work with an editor, for whom he read his chapters out loud,
but she corrected them only when the sense was obscure. According to
the writer and art collector Douglas Sladen, Markino's style "is not
pigeon-English; the Japanese do not use pigeon-English, they abhor it. It
is the result of a deliberate intention to apply certain Japanese methods
of expression (like the omission of

the article) to the writing of English, in order to produce a more direct
medium, and the result has been a complete success." Douglas Sladen,

Many modernist works were translated into Chinese before the Cultural

Own</i> and <i>Flush.</i> In the late 1930s and the 1940s, John Lehmann's
periodicals <i>New Writing</i> and <i>Folios of New Writing</i> featured
translations of unknown young writers from a variety of countries,
including France, Germany, Spain, Greece, Poland, Russia, and China.

The fact that Zitkala-Sa's works were published in the broadly circulated
journals <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> and <i>Harper's Magazine</i> raises the
further questions of modernists as <i>readers</i> of texts from other
cultures, and such texts as embedded influences in the larger circuit of
modernist discourse. Amardeep Singh provocatively raised these issues in
his discussion of prefaces written by Westerners to non-Western texts,
in his paper delivered at the 2002 conference of the MSA.

That this model appears to be now currently under threat, and for complex
reasons combining liberal attitudes to homosexuality with reactionary
economic and immigration policies, suggests to me first, that there is
never any end to history and, second, that concentrated effort is indeed
required even to keep in the same place.
