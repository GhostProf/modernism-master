<p>
What is it about T.S. Eliot's putative anti-Semitism that provokes
such prolonged and extravagant response&#8212;attacks of increasing
stridency from his critics, apologetics of increasing imaginativeness
from his defenders? Readers of  are doubtless
familiar with the latest burst of warfare occasioned by Ronald Schuchard's
spirited January 2003 defense of Eliot, "Burbank with a Baedeker, Eliot
with a Cigar," published along with by-and-large critical responses by
distinguished modernists. So let me instead offer as evidence of the
persistent power of this controversy the following datum. I recently
co-edited a special issue of the <i>Michigan Quarterly Review</i> entitled
<i>Jewish in America,</i> and my fellow editor and I were surprised to
discover that no fewer than five submissions contained allusions to,
or denunciations of, Eliot. We accepted one of these, a poem by Roger
Kamenetz entitled "The Lower Case Jew," in which Eliot is put on trial by
a heavenly rabbinical court for anti-Semitism. Prosecuted by Bleistein and
defended by Sir Ferdinand Klein, Eliot is found guilty and sentenced to
attend "Hyam Plutzik's grandson's bar mitzvah / . . . [where] he'll hora
with Rachel n&eacute;e Rabinovitch / And kazatzki with Allen Ginsberg /
who will give him wet sloppy kisses." ("Oh, I am bound to a bagel of
fire!" Kamenetz's Eliot cries in response to this doleful fate.)
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
Cruel as such a <i>contrapasso</i> might seem&#8212;it nails Eliot on
just about every ground I can imagine, including what Kamenetz sees
as his snobbery and his panicked homophobia&#8212;it was nevertheless
striking that we received no submission similarly indicting Pound,
Fitzgerald, Wharton, Hemingway, or Cather, to

<b></b>

mention other writers of Eliot's vintage whose attitudes towards Jews
were not always respectful.
<p>
Taken together, Schuchard and Kamenetz's responses, polar opposites
in every other way, pose two similar questions: why now, why still,
Eliot? And what, if anything, does the presence of Jews as equal players
in the game of culture-making upon which Schuchard comments and to
which Kamenetz's poem testifies mean not only for Eliot scholarship,
but for our new, reconring sense of Eliot's era?
<p>
To address the first of these, as I tried to suggest in my 2000 book,
<i>The Temple of Culture,</i> the controversy is rooted in the absolute
preeminence Eliot assumed in the booming literary academy of the 1940s
and 1950s, especially in America.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
To be a college professor of English in this period was, perforce, to
come to terms with a model of literary history and cultural value that
placed Eliot, the work Eliot esteemed (e.g. metaphysical poetry), and
the religious vision that Eliot affirmed at the center of critical and
pedagogic practice. And such a period was also, and not uncoincidentally,
the period in which an Anglo-American professorate which had closed
itself off to Jews, frequently on the not-un-Eliotic argument that one
needed to have a thorough and deep&#8212;a feeling&#8212;knowledge of
Christianity in order to understand a literary tradition suffused with
that faith, began to open up to this previously excluded group. Eliot's
responses to Jews rankled many Jewish critics then.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
They continue to do so, perhaps all the more vigorously as Jewish critics
have abandoned the tactics of passing, accommodation, or internalization
that marked their early years in the academy.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
But more, it seems to me, is at stake in this continuing battle. For
those critical of the New Critical canon and the rhetoric that
informs its continuing study, Eliot offers a case study in that
canon's complicity with prejudice, reaction, and the worst episodes in
twentieth-century history. For those who wish to defend the canon that
Eliot did so much to put into institutional practice, his problematic
moments need to be explained. Battling over Eliot, in other words, is
a way of battling over the nature and shape of literary experience and
expression itself, and has been for at least the past two generations. It
should not come as a surprise&#8212;it should in fact come as a
relief&#8212;that this battle continues even at the moment when cultural
studies has challenged the salience and value of the literary itself.
<p>
As for my second question: what does the new evidence that Schuchard
has brought to the table mean? That issue ultimately opens out onto not
only the literature, but also the ethno-racial dynamics of literary
modernism itself. Setting aside his strained explanations of the
worst of Eliot's anti-Semitic tropes and references, Schuchard has
some interesting evidence to offer. He's clearly shown that Eliot's
social and intellectual life intersected with that of many Jews without
his expressing visibly anti-Semitic opinions and without their overtly
shunning him. And, following up the discovery (generously acknowledged)
of Ranen Omer-Sherman with hard work in the archive, he's shown that Eliot
engaged in a long correspondence with American Jewish intellectual (and
fellow Harvard alum) Horace Kallen which ended with Eliot's expressing
disappointment at Kallen's militant secularism.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
There is clearly more such evidence to be added to the record, and it
comports with the main outlines of Schuchard's argument

<b></b>

(although it will do nothing to mollify his critics).
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
To be frank, the implications of this evidence aren't all that
earth-shattering. But the evidence does offer us an interesting
opportunity to reassess a curious feature of the phenomenon we call
literary modernism: namely, the complicated lines of personal and
professional relation between Jews and gentiles, often crossing over
between amity, enmity, desire, and rivalry, reflected in both the lived
experience of modernist writers and in their work. These phenomena give
us an opportunity to move through and beyond the latest flaring of the
great Eliot debate, to use the issues raised by it not to resolve the
question "was he or wasn't he?" ("he was, but so what? they all were,"
is more or less my position) but to suggest something fundamental
about modernism itself: that along with relations with such recently
canonized reifications as gender and race, modernism's distinctive
literary investments and complex self-positioning may be seen as deeply
implicated in&#8212;fundamentally structured around&#8212;what the
nineteenth century called "the Jewish question."
<p>
<p>
One place to start to address not only the question of Eliot's
overdetermined relations with Jews, and modernism's as well, is not the
salons and little magazines of London or Greenwich Village, where he and
his generation were encountering writers, intellectuals, publishers,
and artists who were assimilating Jews. Rather, we can scroll back a
bit and start, as so much of twentieth-century American thought does,
at Eliot's Harvard&#8212;the Harvard, as well, of Robert Frost, Wallace
Stevens, Gertrude Stein, and, at least in fiction, Quentin Compson and
Shreve McCannon. For in addition to the many things that this Harvard
was&#8212;the center of New England and hence national intellectual
life; a grand experiment in grafting a modern research university
onto a liberal arts college; a cradle of pragmatist philosophy and the
scientific study of the mind&#8212;it also served simultaneously as a
home for Jewish students and as an incubator of racist, anti-immigrant,
and anti-Jewish thinking. Harvard, like Columbia, Chicago, and Penn,
was located in a major metropolitan area to which Eastern European Jews
thronged; its undergraduate admissions policies, at least until the 1920s,
were relatively open, and Jewish students like Bernard Berenson (whose
father was a local peddler) and German-born Horace Kallen found a tolerant
home there. At the same time, however, Harvard was also a bastion of race
thinking of the most problematic kind. Major res in the elaboration
of American race and eugenics theory included such Harvard luminaries as
Louis Agassiz, Professor of Geology and Zoology until his death in 1873,
and Charles Davenport, Harvard B.A. and Ph.D., instructor of biology
until he departed in 1899, soon to become one of the most important
res in the eugenics movement. In the 1910s, Harvard offered no fewer
than four courses in the principles of eugenics. Indeed, so pervasive
was the connection of America's most prestigious university with this
hot new form of academic thought that Eliot's cousin, President William
Charles Eliot, was named a vice-president of the First International
Congress of Eugenics in 1912.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
These atmospherics clearly influenced a number of its students: for
example, Lathrop Stoddard, author of the anti-immigrant tract parodied
in Fitzgerald's <i>Great Gatsby,The Rising Tide of Color</i> ,
graduated from Harvard Law School in 1908 and received the M.A. and
Ph.D., in History in

<b></b>

1910 and 1912; it was while at Harvard, he later said, that his work
turned in an explicitly racialist direction.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>
Eugenics and race-theory comported with explicitly anti-immigrant and
anti-Jewish sentiment and activity. In 1894, three Harvard College alumni,
Charles Warren, Robert DeCourcy Ward, and Prescott Farnsworth Hall,
founded the Immigration Restriction League, which included in its number
many other prominent alumni and professors, including Abbott Lawrence
Lowell, later president of the University. The efforts of the League,
buttressed by the nascent eugenics movement led by Davenport, climaxed
in the Immigration Restriction Act of 1924, shepherded through congress
by Harvard alumnus (and former student of Henry Adams), Henry Cabot
Lodge. Also at this time, President Lowell sought to institute quotas
on Jewish admissions; his efforts blocked, he advocated geographical
ones. T.S. Eliot himself articulated the essential logic behind these
quotas&#8212;that too great numbers of intellectually competitive
but undercultured Jews were distorting the student body&#8212;when he
complained, in a 1915 letter to his cousin Elinor Hinckley, of having
encountered "the clever Jew undergraduate mind at Harvard, wide but
disorderly reading, intense but confused thinking, and utter absence of
background and balance and proportion."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>

<p>
To be sure, there's no one-to-one correspondence between the tides of
racist, eugenicist, anti-immigrant or anti-Semitic sentiment, and Eliot's
own experience there. He made friends with Horace Kallen, as Schuchard
reminds us. And he does not seem to have read deeply in race theory or
proto-eugenics at Harvard, although he did imbibe a considerable degree
of comparative anthropology that was to have unfortunate applications
in the dogma, later appropriated by the Nazis, of Aryanism.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
Moreover, it's important to remind ourselves that Eliot's poetry reflects
this milieu with a certain degree of ambivalence. As Lyndall Gordon
reminds us, he lampoons high-toned Harvard ways&#8212;the drawing rooms
best known for the taking of toast and tea&#8212;and haunted the streets
of Roxbury (in which one of the <i>Preludes</i> was originally set) and
North Cambridge in search, presumably, of a gritty urban authenticity
that contrasts with the effete hermeticism of the world chronicled in
<i>Prufrock</i> or <i>Portrait of a Lady.</i>
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
But at least considered in its ethnoracial guise, this gesture is perhaps
more loaded than it might appear: unmentioned by Gordon, many of the
areas into which the young college student wandered and from which he
took impressions of fin-de-si&egrave;cle deliquescence were precisely
the ones in which Russian-born immigrant Jews congregated.
<p>
All this is not to indict Eliot for his reading, the attitudes of his
peers, or his slumming&#8212;I'd hate to be held responsible for the
currents of thought in my Northwestern University dorm, circa 1976, and
the ethnoracial dimensions of my own fascinations with Chicago street
life in that time would not, I'm sure, bear much scrutiny. But it is to
suggest something about the world he, and much of American modernism,
came from and the baggage he&#8212;and it&#8212;carried into the charged
political and social atmosphere of London, Paris, and New York. Race
thinking and a tendency to equate immigrants&#8212;especially Jewish
immigrants&#8212;with the decline of Western culture; responses towards
Jews that mixed a sense of tolerance and the possibility of friendship

<b></b>

with the sense that those Jews were somehow overly competitive,
lacking balance, background, poise: these were the attitude to which
young men and women at Harvard and Radcliffe were exposed in their most
impressionable years, as they were at Yale, Columbia, and Princeton,
which imposed quotas on Jewish undergraduates in the 1920s.
<p>
Indeed, the encounters on the terrain of high culture between aspiring
Jews and ambivalent gentiles was not only a Harvard phenomenon, or
even a university one; nor are they of interest for merely biographical
reasons. Rather, such encounters are an explicit theme of much of the
writing of the first three decades of the twentieth century. Consider the
following. In 1905, Edith Wharton published <i>The House of Mirth,</i>
in which the downward path of a self-destructive gentile woman, Lily
Bart, is plotted against the upward curve described by the career of a
Jewish financier, Simon Rosedale; that the ascendancy of the latter in
the corrupt and attenuated world of turn-of-the-century New York is on
Wharton's mind may be best indicated by the fact that the working title
for the novel was "The Year of the Rose." In 1907, Henry James published
an account of the Lower East Side of New York in his travel book, <i>The
American Scene,</i> which contrasted the seemingly barbaric language and
customs of the swarming Jews to his own; but his account also located in
them an energy and an intellectual power which he acutely felt lacking
in both himself and his gentry class. In 1925, F. Scott Fitzgerald
published <i>The Great Gatsby,</i> a novel in which a Jewish gangster,
Meyer Wolfsheim ("the man who fixed the 1919 World Series") weaves a
vast underworld web around a maniacally self-improving Minnesotan veteran
and Oxford graduate, Jay Gatsby n&eacute;e Gatz. Wolfsheim is a sinister
but oddly sympathetic re, with cuff links made of human molars but
a kind word for his prot&eacute;g&eacute; after the latter's death; but
he is untouched by Gatsby's demise, and remains a shadowy but successful
player behind the scenes, running one criminal enterprise after another
from his office at the Swastika Holding Company. In 1926, Willa Cather
published <i>The Professor's House,</i> a novel in which a middle-aged
professor with the resonant name of Godfrey St. Peter faces what can only
be called a mid-life crisis as his wife and children prepare to move
into an extravagant new mansion. He spends much of his time in his old
house thinking of his former student Tom Outland, a perfect paragon of
a man killed in World War I. St. Peter's daughter who was betrothed to
Outland, has married instead a Jewish entrepreneur named Louis Marsellus
who has brilliantly marketed Outland's invention, the Outland vacuum,
and enriched St. Peter's increasingly vulgar, materialistic clan. Also
in 1926, Ernest Hemingway published <i>The Sun Also Rises,</i> in which
Jake Barnes, the castrated, war-wounded narrator, is shadowed by Robert
Cohn, the alcoholic, former boxing champion at Princeton, now besotted
with Lady Brett Ashley, with whom he has a brief affair about which
he whines for most of the novel and whose new boyfriend, a matador,
he savagely beats at the end of the novel.
<p>
Taken together, then, American modernism (which begins, in my view,
with James) presents a remarkably consistent pattern of response
with respect to the re of the Jew, a response sustained over two
generations. And this response is encoded in narrative form as well as
ideational content. The Lower East Side Jew is to James as Rosedale

<b></b>

is to Lily as Wolfsheim is to Gatsby as Marsellus is to St. Peter as
Cohn is to Jake Barnes; significant if complexly wrought doubles. Thus,
Rosedale as a "plump rosy man of the blonde Jewish type" seems to be
the slender, dark-haired Lily's antithesis and his desire repulses her;
but as their fortunes shift and paths cross, they briefly meet in the
middle, fellow outsiders in the gossipy, status-conscious world of New
York. Robert Cohn, who discovers in boxing an antidote to his sense of
outsiderdom as a Jew at Princeton, crosses romantic and professional
paths with the novel's castrated journalist narrator Jake Barnes
and then repeatedly rediscovers precisely that sense of outsiderness
again in the circle of Lost Generation expatriates in which they both
move. Wolfsheim is an immigrant (he still speaks with an accent) who
uses the Oxford-educated veteran Jay Gatsby as a front for his various
schemes, but Gatsby, like Wolfsheim, stands curiously without the social
whirl that he has entered (when Nick Carraway first meets him, he seems
to be a guest at his own party). The novel's lachrymose conclusion
metaphorically positions Gatsby, too, as a kind of a reverse immigrant,
a Midwestern emigr&eacute; who has to come to the East in order to find
his green-lighted dream. Marsellus is obviously the world-withdrawing,
aesthete St. Peter's antithesis just as Outland was his wish-fulfillment
version of himself; yet even St. Peter admits that the Outland vacuum
could not have been made into a success without Marsellus. Tellingly,
it is Marsellus's words that serve as the epigraph to the novel, not
those of Outland or St. Peter.
<p>
In the works of all these writers, we see a remarkably similar relational
logic, juxtaposing gentile and Jew and thereby defining all the things
that are missing in the former&#8212;and all the things, for better or
worse, supplied by the latter. Thus the gentiles are marked by effeminacy
or at least ineffectuality, particularly in the massively restructuring
postwar world. They are war-wounded or sexually dysfunctional; ridden
by obsessive but fallible passions (Lily's for Selden, Gatsby's for
Daisy, Jake's for Brett), and marked by an inclination towards dreamy
aestheticism. Precisely the opposite qualities are associated with the
Jews, who are sexually vital if not voracious, and capable of sustained
energy and prodigious success in the ordinary world. But there is one
highly significant overlap between the two categories. With the exception
of Wolfsheim, who is comfortably and vulgarly himself, all these Jews have
aspirations to enter the precincts of high culture that had previously
been the precincts of the attenuated and attenuating gentile elites
whose lack of faith even in their own tradition is summarized by the
name of Cather's protagonist, "God-free" St. Peter. Rosedale has an eye
for bric-a-brac; Marcellus leads the family on a Jamesian trip to Paris;
Cohn is an aspiring, and appallingly unsuccessful, novelist, and so on.
<p>
The secret story of modernism these texts tells, then, is of an increasing
contact between Jews and gentiles leading to complex relations of
mutual desire and emulation, rivalry and respect, in the terrain of
cultural achievement: Rosedale, Marcellus, and Cohn, want what Lily,
St. Peter, and Barnes have, and the latter (and their creators) treat
them with a mixture of affection, condescension, and contempt. And here,
it seems to me, we can link historical experience with literary/cultural
representation in a fairly explicit way, for these relations allegorize
the experiences of the authors who

<b></b>

have created them. As one set of outsiders&#8212;Midwestern Americans like
Eliot, Hemingway, Cather, for example&#8212;sought to make their mark
in the sphere of cultural distinction, they encountered in the salons
and cenacles of Paris or Greenwich Village, in the little magazines,
in the publishing houses, in the university classrooms (but not the
faculty lounges) another set of deracinated outsiders elbowing their
way in alongside them, namely assimilating Jews. The ensuing struggle
structures their work. Gentile writers, particularly in the 1920s, create
narratives that, despite their experimental tenor, identify their brood
with the values of the <i>ancien regime,</i> with the cultural politics
of nostalgia, superannuation, world-weary aestheticism, romantic idealism,
and the like. These texts simultaneously and by the same gesture identify
Jews not only as embodiments of modernity or materialism (this alone
is a not-unexpected development, surely) but as culture-vultures, avid
seekers after the legitimacy of taste or imaginative production, who are
all too frequently rewarded for their lack of imaginative amplitude and
cultural sophistication, not punished for it.
<p>
This pattern of representation isn't <i>overtly</i> anti-Semitic, despite
lapses into anti-Semitic rhetoric of the deepest hue on the order of,
say, C&eacute;line or Pound: human molar cuff links indeed! But it can't
be freed from the charge of anti-Semitism either; indeed, on the deepest
level, it is structurally so. To these writers, the re of the Jew is
an overdetermined one, freighted with all the anxieties and rivalries
they were experiencing in the new literary and cultural marketplace,
and all the more loaded because through that re, they also had
to reckon with the identification, as old as Matthew Arnold, between
the alienated artist-intellectual and the assimilating Jew. Indeed,
it is perhaps the last of these that is most persistently provoking,
and can explain most fully the obsession with the Jew that marks the
imagination of this generation of American modernists. For (and here I
am adapting an argument made with respect to Eliot, Joyce, and Pound by
Bryan Cheyette and Maud Ellmann
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>) insofar as writers of Eliot's generation defined themselves as
international rather than local in their interests; as exiles,
outsiders, others, &eacute;migr&eacute;s, wanderers&#8212;insofar,
that is, as they defined themselves as what we have come to think of as
"moderns"&#8212;their very self-conception made them look suspiciously
like the Jews with whom they were competing for cultural legitimacy
and artistic status. And the result is the response I have tried to
detail above, in which Jews may be&#8212;almost always are&#8212;oddly
sympathetic characters, certainly far from anti-Semitic stereotypes, yet
are also positioned as illegitimate questers after the cultural authority
and writerly excellence to which these American &eacute;migr&eacute;s,
internal and external, aspired.
<p>
Thinking in these terms has two consequences, one of them specific to the
Eliot problem, the other, opening up onto a consideration of literary
modernism at large. As far as the first is concerned, placing Eliot's
response to Jews in this broad conration of thought resituates the
debate about his anti-Semitic expressions from their occurrence to their
motives, from the question of whether he was an anti-Semite to where his
anti-Semitism might come from and what it might mean. This is not to say
that there aren't spasmodic and quite disgusting anti-Semitic tropes in
his poetry for which no amount of apologetics should acquit him; indeed,
when compared to the contemporaries

<b></b>

I have described above, the ugliness of those tropes becomes clearer. But
it also is to say that Eliot's poetry of this era comports itself to
the pattern I have sketched above. It's filled with images of masculine
distress, castration, ineffectuality, aestheticism, or obsolescence
and populated with Jewish characters like Rachel n&eacute;e Rabinovitch
or Bleistein who contain a certain sexuality, if not vitality, and are
connected by a set of allusions, conscious and unconscious, that point
back to the &eacute;migr&eacute; poet himself. Consider, as just one
example, the first named of these. Defined by her Russian last name,
Rabinovitch, as one of the surging hordes of <i>Ost-juden,</i> her first
name also identifies her as a Jew, and a Jew of a particular type. That
name ties back to the nineteenth-century French actress Rachel who,
as I have tried elsewhere to suggest, provides one important model
for the Arnoldian intellectual as well as for Henry James's maniacally
self-fashioning actress Miriam Rooth in <i>The Tragic Muse.</i> Like
Arnold's or James's Rachel, Rachel n&eacute;e Rabinovitch is a partially
assimilating Other, "uptorn" as Arnold puts it, from her own origins
but not yet arrived at a new one: if she was born as Rabinovitch,
what, other than Rachel, or perhaps "Rachel," has she become? She is
thus a re not only of horrific appetency, but also a re of
socio-cultural liminality, and as such mirrors another assimilating
re performing on the English stage of Arnold and James, confronting
his own essential rootlessness,
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
and embarking upon an enterprise of assimilative refashioning:
T.S. Eliot himself.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

<p>
More broadly, this phenomenon suggests one way in which we might want
to rethink the nature and possibilities of the category "American
modernism" itself. Wonderful recent work has identified the modernist
enterprise with complex engagements with gender; with race; with
non-heteronormative sexuality. In doing so, it has supplemented the
modernist canon&#8212;Eliot, Joyce, Stevens, Pound, et al&#8212;by
constructing alternative canons that emphasize different aspects of the
modernist enterprise, that have foregrounded various different sets
of writers. Faulkner and/or the Harlem Renaissance is crucial in one
reckoning of the modernist enterprise; Stein and other queer writers
in another, and so on. My response to the Eliot controversy suggests
a different approach to the same revisionary enterprise, one which
would not so much define a new "Jewish" modernism (Stein, Mina Loy,
Louis Zukofsky, Henry Roth, Charles Reznikoff), but rather stress the
ethnoracial dimension of the tropes, assumptions, and imaginative patterns
that structured not only the modernist movement, but the academic study
of literature itself. First, within the circles that created literary
modernism in the 1920s and 1930s; then, in the university English
departments that reified modernism's critical techniques and canonized
its central texts in the 1940s and 1950s; departments which then, in the
1960s and 1970s, proclaimed its death at the hands of the post-modern (a
term circulated, it might be added, by arch-Jew Leslie Fiedler&#8212;his
revenge against the gentile tradition): in all of these various sites,
the social and imaginative encounter between Jews and gentiles shaped
the very terms by which literary modernism and the academic study of
literature were built.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
In this sense, and in this sense only, Eliot at his most problematic
perhaps can be given the last word. With respect to the complex,
charged affective and social matrix out of which modernism emerged,
the study of literature was institutionalized, and both

<b></b>

questioned and complicated; with respect, that is, to the dominant
tendencies in American literature and criticism of the last fifty years,
"the Jew"&#8212;the set of imaginative constructions and deconstructions
attendant upon the entry of Jewish intellectuals into the terrain of
high culture&#8212;truly <i>is</i> underneath the lot.

Foremost among these, of course, was the irrepressible Karl Shapiro, who
was also notoriously outspoken in his response to Pound. In a symposium in
<i>Commentary,</i> "The Jewish Writer and the English Literary Tradition,"
for example, Shapiro wrote: "I have always been able to 'understand'
Chaucerian and even Shakespearean anti-Semitism as lingering concepts
of the medieval mind. Naturally, I make no such concessions to the
modern literary anti-Semite, however great an artist he happens to
be. . . . When Eliot perpetuates the myth of the bestial Jew, without
taking the pains elsewhere to mollify this image, he commits an outrage
against his Jewish contemporaries." [<i>Commentary</i> 7 (October 1949):
369-70]. For an uninhibited attack on Eliot and his critical hegemony
on other grounds, see "T.S. Eliot: The Death of Literary Judgment" in
Shapiro, <i>In Defense of Ignorance</i> (New York: Random House, 1952,
1960) 35-60. Here is a sample of his "take" on Eliot:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Eliot invented a Modern World which exists only in his version of it;
this world is populated by Eliot's followers and is not a reality. The
Eliot population consists of a handful of critics and professors and
a few writers of Eliot's generation, though one would think, reading
modern criticism and teaching from modern literary textbooks, that there
really is a kingdom of Modern Poetry in which T.S. Eliot is the absolute
monarch and Archbishop of Canterbury in one.

Within the field of English literary studies, some important works in
this process were Bryan Cheyette, <i>Constructions of the Jew in English
Literature and Society: Racial Representations, 1875-1945</i> (Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1993); James Shapiro, <i>Shakespeare
and the Jews</i> (New York: Columbia University Press, 1995); and my
own <i>Temple of Culture.</i> This new interest in Jewishness and the
literary canon are part of a generational shift&#8212;Shapiro, Cheyette,
and I are all roughly the same age&#8212;which has also seen the rise,
within Judaic studies, of so-called Jewish cultural studies&#8212;I
am thinking here of the work <i>inter alia,</i> of Daniel and Jonathan
Boyarin; and more generally, the rise of the study of Jewishness in the
context of the questions of gender and race particularly evident in the
oeuvre of Sander Gilman, but crucial as example and provocation to us all.

In a recent biography of the late Leslie Fiedler [Mark Royden Winchell,
<i>"Too Good to be True": The Life and Work</i> (Columbia, MO. :
University of Missouri Press, 2002)], for example, Mark Winchell recounts
the details of an unpublished early correspondence between the young
Fiedler (who was quite unsparing about Eliot later in his life) and
the distinguished poet; and one can note in his paraphrase of Eliot's
response both the outlines of Schuchard's own defense and an echo of
Eliot's correspondence with Kallen:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Fiedler dealt directly with [the anti-Semitism of the literary canon]
in a letter to T.S. Eliot, dated, December 13, 1948. Although that letter
has not been preserved, Eliot's reply of January 14, 1949, is currently
housed in Leslie's private files. Essentially, Eliot sees the charges
against his own poetry as a matter of geographical and generational
sensitivity. Neither the Jews he has known in England nor his older
Jewish friends in America have ever mentioned

<b></b>

evidence of anti-Semitism in his work. (The poems in which the word
<i>Jew</i> appears were all published by Jews&#8212;in England by Leonard
Woolf and in America by Alfred Knopf and Horace Liveright.) In any event,
those poems were written many years ago, before racial sensibilities
have become as polarized as they are today. Eliot then concludes on a
personal note. "Incidentally, and last," he writes, "as you say that you
are Jewish: I hope that you will not consider it an impertinence of me to
express the hope that you are diligent in attendance at your synagogue
(if you are so fortunate as to have one in Missoula, that you observe
the Law and read the Scriptures, and that you cherish the faith of your
fathers" .

Eliot's response didn't mollify Fiedler, to say the least. According
to a witness, at a conference in 1975 held in Athens, Ohio for example,
he referred to Eliot as an "asshole," causing a number in the audience
to walk out. (Ross Posnock, personal communication to the author).

See William Tucker, <i>The Funding of Scientific Racism: Wickliffe Draper
and the Pioneer Fund</i> (Champaign-Urbana: University of Illinois Press,
1997), 23. Tucker goes on to trace Harvard's continuing connection to
the eugenics movement in the 1920s&#8212;William McDougal, chair of
the Psychology department, was a great advocate&#8212;and its gradual
distancing from the fad: in 1927, it turned down a $60,000 bequest to
fund eugenics courses, although the principle at stake here may have
been autonomy from donor requests than changes in communal predilection.

For Eliot's connection with eugenics, see Donald Childs, <i>Modernism
and Eugenics: Woolf, Eliot, Yeats, and the Culture of Degeneration</i>
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002). In my view, this connection
is considerably less problematic than his studies in Sanskrit, primitive
religion, and comparative anthropology, for these are connected, via
a number of different sources (comparative philology, the Cambridge
school of anthropology, etc.) to the discourse of Aryanism, one which
had even in its pre-Nazi instantiations a problematic relation to Jews
(or "Semites"). For a fascinating account of some of the cultural and
intellectual positioning involved, see Maurice Olender, <i>The Languages
of Paradise: Aryans and Semites, a Match Made in Heaven,</i> trans. Arthur
Goldhammer (Cambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1992). For an
astute reading of Eliot in the context of anthropological thought, see
Ronald Bush, "The Presence of the Past: Ethnographic Thinking/Literary
Politics" in <i>Prehistories of the Future: The Primitivist Project
and the Culture of Modernism</i>, ed. Elazar Barkan and Ronald Bush

Here's an example of Eliot's sense of his own rootlessness at this
time, as given to us by Michael North. It is encoded in other racially
problematic terms, but still poignantly apposite to his comments on Jews:
"Eliot wrote to Herbert Read: 'Some day, I want to write an essay about
the point of view of an American who wasn't an American, because he
was born in the South and went to school in New England as a small boy
with a nigger drawl, but who wasn't a Southerner because his people
were northerners in a border state and looked down on all southerners
and Virginians, and who so was never anything anywhere . . . " Quoted
in <i>The Dialect of Modernism: Race, Language, and Twentieth-Century
Literature</i> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994), 78.
<p>
<a name="FOOT14" href="#REF14">14</a>.
Matters after Eliot's conversion on this front are no better, but
for reasons of space I have not included my consideration of them
here. I would merely point out that Eliot's problem with free-thinking
Jews, evident both in his University of Virginia lecture and in his
correspondence with Jews (Schuchard quotes two of these, and the Fiedler
correspondence adds a third to the list), grows out of the same dynamic
of identification as his anti-Semitic poetry. Here, it's a racialized
identification of the intellectual with the Jew, originating in Arnold's
<i>Culture and Anarchy,</i> that he's responding to and defending himself
against. Needless the say, from a Jewish point of view, the problem in
his response, phrased in the most appalling terms in his lecture but
evident in a more benign guise in the letters to Jews, is his need to
label, identify, or define <i>for</i> Jews what their Jewishness should
consist of, to tell

<b></b>

Jews how they should act in the modern world. It's this that I mean
by a structural anti-Semitism, one which is quite compatible with
philo-Semitism and one that, indeed, often encompasses it (see Pat
Robertson for a contemporary example). It inheres in a desire to construct
symbolic meanings of Jews, which then get imparted to Jews, rather than
the willingness to let Jews, as members of modern, pluralistic societies,
make up their own mind about what their Jewishness can and should mean.
