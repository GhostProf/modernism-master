<p class="noIndent">
Most studies of poetry begin with a poem. This one begins with a silence. Like a poem, a silence has both occasion and duration. The duration of this silence is a well-known quantity; after the 1934 publication of his slim volume <i>Discrete Series</i>, the poet George Oppen stopped writing poems, decisively abandoned the class of his origin ("upper class of '29," as he liked to say) to join the Communist Party, and, starting in 1950, lived as a "known subversive" in Mexico to escape F.B.I. harassment for his work as a labor organizer in the Workers Alliance. He would not write another poem for almost 25 years.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The occasion of Oppen's silence is less well understood. Considered as an episode in the history of American literary communism, Oppen's story appears at first unexceptional. In 1930, Michael Gold in the <i>New Masses</i> had condemned the "verbal acrobatics" of modernism as "only another form of bourgeois idleness."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  The aesthetics of the "Objectivist" poets with whom Oppen is associated would come under special censure for expressing what Herman Specter would call:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The limited worldview of a "detached bystander": that is, of a person whose flashes of perception for the immediate esthetics of the contemporary scene are not co-ordinated in any way with a dialectical comprehension of the life-process . . . The fatal defect 

<b></b>

of Objectivist theory is that it identifies life with capitalism, and so assumes that the world is merely a waste land. The logical consequence is a fruitless negativism. . . . Impartiality is a myth which defeatists take with them into oblivion.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Two years after Gold's broadside, Sherwood Anderson would suggest that the problem of art was not limited to a particular aesthetic theory or style&#x02014;"impartial" rather than appropriately partisan, nihilistically "objective" about the world as found rather than actively "co-ordinated" with "objective" laws of history by which revolution must eventually be made; it was a more fundamental problem with the nature of artistic labor. On this view, a truly committed artist could best demonstrate his alliance with the working classes by joining them and silencing himself entirely: "if it be necessary that in order to bring about the end of a money civilization and set up something new, healthy and strong, we of the so called artist class have to be submerged, let us be submerged."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  The annals of the 30s are filled with the mute inglorious Miltons of the left, submerged for better or worse&#x02014;deliberately or against their will&#x02014;in the interest of a radical politics.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
What makes this particular story more remarkable&#x02014;what marks it as an episode in the history of what I prefer to call a radical <i>poetics</i>&#x02014;is that Oppen, once submerged, resurfaced. His next book, <i>The Materials</i>, published in 1962 initiated Oppen's spare but uninterrupted second act in poetry, which would eventually earn him the Pulitzer Prize (for the 1968 volume <i>Of Being Numerous</i>).
</p>

<p>
The long silence at the center of Oppen's career is a mystery sustained by attempts to resolve it, which range from Hugh Kenner's semi-serious denial of the need for explanation (Kenner to Oppen: "it took you 25 years to write the next poem,")<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> , to Rachel Blau DuPlessis' excesses of explanation: "a critique of modernism which ran counter to contemporary critical, poetic, and academic thinking, a choice of activism in a deeply felt political crisis, a process of self-testing, a war injury, and recovery; later these were joined by a set of taboos and inhibitions around parenthood, and a fear of his own power" (<i>Selected Letters,</i> xiv).
</p>

<p>
The poet's own slim self-accounting for the occasion of his silence is more interesting than a long pause, more specific than a catalogue of everything that happened to Oppen in the intervening years:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
25 years to write the next poem means. . . . we didn't know enough from the poetry that was being written; from the poetry we had written. And when the crisis occurred we knew we didn't know what the world was and we knew we had to find out so it was a poetic exploration at the same time that it was an act of conscience.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This not-quite-explanation suggests that it might be necessary and possible to come to know something important about "what the world was" from poetry in a time of crisis in which Oppen was&#x02014;perhaps uniquely among his generation of poets&#x02014;a participant as well as a witness. Oppen fought at the devastating Battle of the Bulge; the infantry division in which he served has been recognized as a "liberator" unit for its participation in the liberation of the Dachau subcamp at Landsberg.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  The crisis as it 

<b></b>

"occurred" to Oppen was not just the ideological conflict in America that made him choose temporary exile but the "total war" and the effort at total extermination that preceded and precipitated it.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In his poem "Time of the Missile," (from <i>The Materials</i>) Oppen describes his historical moment as one in which the world&#x02014;reconred by the destructive work of "the mind and eye"&#x02014;has acquired the autonomous capacity to annihilate the life it had formerly sustained. Such a world "can destroy us,/ Re-arrange itself, assert/ Its own stone chain reaction".<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Under these conditions, even the most intimate forms of relationship, which have traditionally served as subjects for poetry and redoubts against history, no longer provide comfort or hope for the future:
</p>

<p>
If we take seriously Oppen's premise that his silence was undertaken in the interest of a poetic solution to the total failure of sociability, we might expect to find that his return to poetry carries about it at least the charge of a problem solved. But what most vexes the attempt to grant some substance to that sense, to credit Oppen's retrospectively implied promise that the next poem would be the next <i>kind</i> of poetry, capable of bearing new knowledge appropriate to a world in crisis, is not just that the terms of the promise are so vague; it is that one doesn't know just where to look to see if they are fulfilled. Oppen's next poems, written after a quarter century's accumulation of worldly knowledge, are&#x02014;to put it perhaps too bluntly&#x02014;not much different in kind than his first ones. Spare, tense lyric fragments linked in abstract sequences larded with sententious and didactic passages, the later poems are no more or less accessible, no more or less obviously <i>engag&#x000E9;</i> than the work of <i>Discrete Series</i>. And even where differences can be heard or seen, Oppen himself seems unwilling to give an account of what precisely they might signify, or to posit a real discontinuity between his early and later work. When, in Section 37 of his long poem "Of Being Numerous," Oppen revisits the first poem of <i>Discrete Series</i>, written thirty-five years earlier, it is with a mind to restate, rather than to reject:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
' . . . approached the window as if to see . . . ' 
<br />
The boredom which disclosed 
<br />
Everything&#x02014; 
<p class="blockquote">
I should have written, not the rain 
<br />
Of a nineteenth century day, but the motes 
<br />
In the air, the dust 
<p class="blockquote">
Here still
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<div class="attribution">
<!--_attribution-->

<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p>
In <i>Discrete Series</i>, Oppen suggested that the objects of knowledge ("The knowledge not of sorrow, you were/saying, but of boredom") are attained by attending closely to the 

<b></b>

changeable atmosphere that distinguishes one particular place and time from another: "rain falling, in the distance/ more slowly" . In "Of Being Numerous," knowledge is disclosed by the unchanging particles of dust that hang in the air now, just as they did then: "here still." From the former, we are told, one might learn about the world that one occupies at the moment, "Of the world, weather-swept, with which one shares the century" (<i>DS,</i> 5); the latter discloses "Everything." And yet, even as the poet points out the difference between the poem then and the poem now, telling us that he should have written something other than what he did write, he also writes what he did write. The passage in quotations in "Of Being Numerous" (' . . . approached the window as if to see . . . ') is a <i>quotation</i> of the poem from <i>Discrete Series</i>; indeed, it is a quotation of Oppen's quotation of Henry James. So while the poem seems to say that its views of where knowledge should be sought&#x02014;and of what knowledge is knowledge of&#x02014;have changed since 1934 (just as both have no doubt changed since a "nineteenth century day"), the claim that the difference is <i>substantive</i> is interestingly undercut by the act of self-quotation. If what has changed, in other words, is the idea that true knowledge (of "the world") resides in things that change, like the weather, and the new idea is that knowledge (of "Everything") resides in things that do not, like motes, then the words of poems seem to be more like motes than like weather. Words, <i>les mots,</i> like the dust, are "here still" in 1968 as they were in 1934&#x02014;unchanged even since the "nineteenth century day" that James first wrote them.
</p>

<p>
Of course just as not <i>all</i> the dust in the air in 1968 is the dust in the air in 1934, not all of the words in the later poem are the same as those in the earlier one. By situating old words in a new context&#x02014;replacing the earlier poem's elaborate Jamesian syntax, for example, with the minimalist syntax of "Of Being Numerous," or altering what follows the quotation in order to give a new object to the verb "to see"&#x02014;we discover the difference that context makes for meaning. But Oppen's point is not, as one could imagine, that we need to separate out one kind of word from another, the unchanging, knowledge-disclosing motes from the variable weather-words. Words, or motes, according to Oppen do not just <i>occupy</i> different atmospheres, they <i>are</i> those atmospheres. As the stanza continues:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
What have we argued about? what have we done? 

<p class="blockquote">

Thickening the air? 

<p class="blockquote">

Air so thick with myth the words <i>unlucky 
<br />
</i>And <i>good luck 

<p class="blockquote">

</i>Float in it . . .
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Oppen here undoes the distinction between weather and motes, between words and contexts. Words, insofar as they are "thickened" contexts of argument or action, are the stuff of "myth"&#x02014;shared systems of understanding that are not knowledge- or 

<b></b>

truth-bearing but as arbitrary and amoral as luck. How then can poems, which are, of course, made of words, and so consubstantial with the changeable weather of context, disclose anything, much less "Everything"? The logic of Oppen's analysis demands that such knowledge as poems have&#x02014;if they have it&#x02014;must reside in a distinction not realized in things that can take on formal differences&#x02014;not realized, in other words, in words.
</p>

<p>
In what follows, I do offer an account&#x02014;and a defense&#x02014;of Oppen's poetic knowledge in precisely these terms. More specifically, I argue that for Oppen, it is not in a practice of changeable form but in a practice of unchangeable silence&#x02014;a silence that penetrates his poems as well as bracketing them&#x02013; that we may find, not new knowledge exactly, but a new account of what we mean by knowledge. This argument has obvious consequences for aesthetics: for if silence is not, as Specter would have us believe, a renunciation of poetic work but rather the form that poetic work takes, then we might need an account of what poetry is rather different than the ones we have. But, I shall argue, this change in our account of the ontology of poetry would also have serious consequences for the idea of a poetic politics. Oppen addresses the total failure of sociability caused by "our" lack of knowledge about "what the world was" precisely by reconceptualizing both the subject and object of the verb "to know"&#x02014;and this is a reconceptualization that can and ought to bear on the question of social recognition.

I. Radical Poetics: Some Silences in Poetic History
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
In 2003, Farrar Straus Giroux published the twelve-hundred page teal behemoth that is Robert Lowell's <i>Collected Poems</i>. Even if one had not been breathlessly awaiting the appearance of a collected Lowell&#x02014;and twenty-three years after the poet's death is an unconscionably long time to hold your breath&#x02014;it would have been difficult to miss the critical outpouring that has greeted its publication. Most of the notice has been celebratory, though there has been some bickering over the quality of its critical apparatus. But the most persistent objection to the collected Lowell has been leveled at the volume's size: it is too short. Virtually every reviewer has noted, with attitudes ranging from resignation to opprobrium, what Frank Bidart, Lowell's friend and amanuensis characterizes as his "most radical editorial decision": to include the book <i>History</i>, but to omit the stranger and wilder <i>Notebook</i> out of which the later book was carved. I am less concerned to join in the chorus of critique than I am to note the apparent <i>need to note</i> that the longed for "complete" is, in fact incomplete&#x02014;that more, different, and perhaps greater poetry remains. Eager to see this book not just as a doorstop but as an anchor for a poetic present hopelessly adrift; the critic's judgment seems to be that the reading public literally cannot get enough Robert Lowell.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The year before, with much less fanfare, New Directions published George Oppen's <i>New Collected Poems</i>. This is a volume of which it must be said that nobody was exactly waiting for it, happy though we may be to have it. Its publication has gone largely unremarked outside of a sphere of initiates. In marked contrast to the Lowell phenomenon, if there has been a criticism of this already quite slim volume, it is that it is too long. For 

<b></b>

it contains what its editor Michael Davidson has chosen to call "selected unpublished poems"&#x02014;some unspecified number of which, he admits, are not obviously poems at all, but could just as easily be considered drafts, parts of letters, notes, or scrap culled from the poet's so-called "daybooks."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
I will have more to say on this difference later on. For the moment, let me just note that this coincidence of publication is and is not a coincidence. The timing, that is, may be a convenient accident, but the appearance of these two volumes is only the latest salvo in an ongoing battle to define just what the history of twentieth-century poetry consists of; a battle whose ultimate stakes are the shape of the poetic present.
</p>

<p>
To simplify what is already simplification, our prevailing taxonomy for thinking about the history of poetry in the last hundred or so years may be called the "two tradition" model. It divides the poetry of the twentieth (and now the twenty-first) century into a traditionalist or symbolist genealogy in which Modernism is continuous with High Romanticism (beginning, for example, with Yeats' atavistic modernism) and an avant-garde or experimentalist genealogy repudiating it (founded, for example, in Stein's experimental modernism). Each tradition has its historians and its champions; and between them, the critical heirs of Harold Bloom and those of Marjorie Perloff have divided the field. They may agree on very little; but they do produce an impressive consensus about which poet belongs to whom.
</p>

<p>
This effort to produce the legibility of the dense field of contemporary poetry, however, has resulted in a taxonomic engine so frightfully efficient that it has begun to reproduce itself as an unquestioned orthodoxy not just in criticism&#x02014;where it has leapt from being the conclusion of an argument to its premise&#x02014;but in poetry itself. What began as description of the art has been adopted by the artist as an obligation; the poet's felt need to find a tradition has turned into the demand to pick a side; and style has become a sort of a declaration of allegiance. This may sound melodramatic to someone not immersed in the currents of poetic culture, but it is actually quite difficult to overstate the impact this critical division is having on the shape of contemporary poetry. As a general rule, critical and poetic partisans, bent on consolidating, celebrating, claiming or extending one tradition take note of the other just long enough to deride&#x02014;and such derision is a reflexive reaction rather than an analytic one, with the result that poets are cut off from fully half of the history of what ought to be their art.
</p>

<p>
This seemed to me an unacceptable state of affairs, and I initially set out to counter the problems that have blocked literary historians by giving a fuller account&#x02014;one that could include more of what has happened in the name of poetry in the last century; but also offer a more general account&#x02014;one that might provide cause to reconsider whether it makes sense to replace "poetry" with numerous "poetries." But what I discovered is that the completeness of the critical division does, however, point toward a much more interesting and perhaps unprecedented feature of twentieth-century poetry: its major poets' spectacular lack of influence upon, and even acknowledgment of, one another's work. Though Yeats and Pound actually shared a physical home at Stone Cottage as well as metaphysical and occult sources, their utter refusal to consent to what the other had to say is astonishing. Wider still is the gulf between Pound and Stevens, who never 

<b></b>

even rose to the level of mutual misunderstanding: they appear barely to have read each other's work at all.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> .
</p>

<p>
A similar indifference extends into the next generation. George Oppen's letters over a half-century, full of news of the literary world, reveal the horizon of that world to have been quite close. The so-called Objectivist poets like Louis Zukofsky, Carl Rakosi, and Charles Reznikoff are his constant interests and interlocutors, while the poets most often understood as the central res of that generation&#x02014;Elizabeth Bishop or Randall Jarrell, or Robert Lowell&#x02014;hardly even appear as topics of conversation. Elizabeth Bishop similarly erases half the poetic world in her voluminous correspondence: one would look in vain for the barest mention of any poet calling himself an objectivist.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The depth of this division is a silence quite unlike the shrillness of our present acrimony; a separation complete enough that what might initially appear to be a clash of rival poetries begins to look more like two entirely different practices accidentally going by the same name&#x02014;"poetry". Harold Bloom&#x02014;that staunch upholder of the literary "right"&#x02014;has produced a better description of the state of this poetic world than he knew by insisting upon viewing it as the contest, not between styles of poetry, but between "poetry" and "non-poetry."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Very much against the spirit of his dismissal, I would suggest that Bloom's characteristically uncompromising description of the poets of the "left" as "non-poets" actually comes closest to identifying the most distinctive and important features of their work. Picture again the two volumes side by side&#x02014;Lowell's collected, massively loquacious, obsessively revised, a book literally, physically unable to contain all of the poems that there are; Oppen's collected, spare, quiet, padded out even to its slender length by the inclusion of non-poems. This picture requires us to confront and explain something that has been hard for readers interested in the twentieth-century literary left to acknowledge: its poems can sometimes be hard to love, or even to like; for they are made in such a way as to present problems for reception for which our traditional vocabularies of response (aesthetic, affective, pragmatic) are not appropriate. So variously fragmented, estranging, trivial, recondite, or boring are the types of poetry on the left that even critics who champion the work have had to go to great didactic and theoretical lengths to imagine and market alternative sorts of pleasure and interest to compensate for the loss of <i>aisthesis</i>.
</p>

<p>
Still, let there be as many kinds of pleasure and interest as can be conceived; the frequency with which we can encounter "non-poetry" as a literary fact should, if we attend to it, point us in the direction of a theoretical problem not just with the way poetic history has been conceived but with the way that poetry as a genre has been conceived. Stated most simply: the persistent production of non-poems asks that we must entertain the hypothesis that what the poet intends is not, or not always, the poem. The poems to which I gravitate in this essay may appear to be in various ways silent: strange, broken, or otherwise unforthcoming with the pleasures we often expect and demand of well-made poetic objects. This is so, I suggest, because for Oppen (and for others like him), "poetry" is not a techne for producing that class of objects we call poems but a form of intentionality toward persons. What the poet intends&#x02014;insofar as he intends poetry&#x02014;is to indicate, reveal, exemplify, or make manifest a principle that 

<b></b>

minimally distinguishes what a person is. This principle, capacity or "faculty" has historically gone by a variety of names. The sacred, the imagination, reason, and language are some older names. Giorgio Agamben has more recently called it a "potentiality;" Oppen, I will shortly argue, calls it a "curiosity." The social crises that made the twentieth century the most terrible century in Western history repeatedly drive poetry more emphatically than ever before away from aesthetics and toward a radically ontological project&#x02014;toward the effort to reconstruct the category of "the person" in the wake of a crisis that is at once theoretical (the "critique of the subject") and actual (the various failures to treat persons as if they were persons).
</p>

<p>
The poets of the left and those of the right oppose each other not as two opposing practices or principles oppose each other, but rather as an abstract principle opposes the concretion of its own practice. What the poets in whom I am interested suggest is that a renewed humanism (for what else should we call it) would have to take its orientation from a faculty more abstract, more universal, and, paradoxically, less directly engaged with the world than the more pragmatic definitions of identity undertaken in the name of any particular social order. A radical poetics, that is, requires us to postulate a difference between "subjects" and "persons": if subjects are understood by poems to possess qualities (voices, histories, features, bodies, rights, obligations, attachments, etc.) the persons intended by the poetic principle are defined by possessing <i>value</i>. They possess the sheer potential to be integrated into whatever social system, and that potential constitutes a sufficient demand.
</p>

<p>
Ezra Pound declared that a history of the art could only be gotten through its masterworks.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  I would suggest that a history of the poetic principle is best told through its limit cases. The goal of the poets I discuss is not to define the individual or dramatize the individual in terms of some psychological or philosophical account of subjectivity; nor is it to secure the individual in service to some particular form of social life. The goal of these poets is rather to make the person appear anew (non-theoretically) as a value-bearing fact&#x02014;as the necessary <i>ground</i> of social life&#x02014;and to offer this most abstract premise of personhood as a necessary precursor to any effective politics.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  And as the example of Oppen will help to clarify, the poetry that most directly addresses the purposes I have ascribed to the art is one that sacrifices its formal coherence, its beauty, and even its very perceptibility to the task.

II. Crusoe's Silence
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
The serial poem, "Of Being Numerous,"  is representative of the many pleasures of reading Oppen, but also of one of the major difficulties: for a poet who has been labeled an "Objectivist," he makes it extraordinarily difficult for us to feel grounded in a known or knowable world. Though he would praise above all others the "small precise . . . overwhelming gentle iron lines and images" of Reznikoff, whose poems emulated their subject matter, "the girder, still itself/ among the rubble," Oppen's poetic precision seems more that of intellect than of iron. By the end of the first five sections of the poem, we have swum through such abstract nouns as "things" 

<b></b>

(specified only as "An unmanageable pantheon" [148]); "images" (specified not at all [148]); and "people" (of whom all that is said is that "We encounter them" [149]). Verbs are equally abstract and technical ("encounter" is a case in point), or else they appear transformed into passive substantives like "Occurrence, a part/ Of an infinite series, // The sad marvels" . It is only when we reach section 6 of the poem that we wash up at last on the shore of a proper name:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">

</div>

<p>
Still, any orienting relief we might feel here at stumbling upon a named person&#x02014;even a fictional one&#x02014;must be tempered by the fact that that person is presented to us not under the auspices of perception but rather through the lens of interpretation. The poem suggests that what is of interest about Crusoe is not the vivid and loquacious fact of his own story&#x02014;<i>The life and strange surprizing adventures of Robinson Crusoe, of York, mariner: who lived eight and twenty years, all alone in an un-inhabited island on the coast of America, near the mouth of the great river of Oroonoque; having been cast on shore by shipwreck, wherein all the men perished but himself : With an account how he was at last as strangely deliver'd by pyrates / Written by himself</i>&#x02014;but rather the fact that, quote, "we" have articulated judgements about him.
</p>

<p>
The quotation marks I have placed around "we" are a way of noting those that Oppen has placed around "rescued"&#x02013; and those are quotation marks worth noting. Oppen, like many of his contemporaries, is a quoting poet. Many of his quotations represent moments of philosophical engagement; their sources (Maritain, Plato, Heidegger, Kierkegaard) are traceable with minimal effort; others derive from personal engagements (with Mary Oppen, Zukofsky, Reznikoff), many of these sources were attributed with the aid of the poet himself. But in this instance and a few others in which the 

<b></b>

quotation consists of a single word and no attribution is given ("And he fails! He fails, that meditative man! And indeed they cannot 'bear' it." [153]) the implication is that what is being "cited" is a general attitude rather than a particular one attributable to an individual source.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, I will propose two quite specific sources for the judgement that Crusoe's return to civilization constitutes a rescue: The first is in Marx's <i>Capital</i>; the second in a set of debates surrounding Wittgenstein's <i>Philosophical Investigations</i>. And while both of them might have been known to Oppen (the first one certainly was, and the second very probably),<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  I am actually not at present interested in deciding the question of whether the allusion is in fact an allusion. Choosing between these "sources" really entails choosing between two very different philosophical accounts about what it means to have a general attitude. The question is less a matter of what person to whom Oppen means to refer the quotation, than of what the quotation marks tell us that Oppen thinks a "we" is, and what it means for "us" to make judgments about, or indeed to refer to a person altogether.
</p>

<p>
For Oppen, the most ready-to-hand context for the re of Crusoe would certainly have been Marx,<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  specifically the fourth section of volume one of <i>Capital</i>, "The Fetishism of Commodities and the Secret Thereof,"<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  where he brings up the Crusoe story specifically in order to contest the way the re of Crusoe had been used in the past by political economists to naturalize and universalize the acquisitive impulse and so give natural warrant to capitalism. For Marx, the judgement that Crusoe needs rescuing could only be true of a Crusoe whose "solitude" was a sham in the first place, "an illusion and nothing but the aesthetic illusion of the small and big Robinsonades" (xx). The novelistic Crusoe's inexplicably "fortunate" salvaging of the gold for which he claimed to have no concern, like his excessive bower-building, is simply a dramatization of the fact that the Crusoe of the political economist's Robinsonade possesses desires for luxury that are given to him, as it were, from the outside (as products of the historical order of which he is a product) rather than arising from his native inclinations. Such a Robinson may appear to be alone, but as a good bourgeois he carries his whole class with him wherever he goes.
</p>

<p>
In his deceptive surfaces and self-deceiving depths, Marx's Crusoe most clearly resembles, not Oppen's, but another poetic Crusoe, that of Elizabeth Bishop in her poem "Crusoe in England."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Bishop's Crusoe comes off at first as a good empiricist who spends his time as a castaway diligently numbering his island's volcanoes (fifty-two in all) and cataloguing the variegated colors of his basalt beaches. But despite his diligence, he is nonetheless unable to perceive his island as it is&#x02014;because his sense of scale resides elsewhere. Longing for home, he sees turtles as teakettles, snail-shells as iris-gardens, and waterspouts as "glass chimneys, flexible, attenuated,/ sacerdotal beings of glass" , conflating in thought the domestic and the spiritual in just that way that we would call bourgeois.
</p>

<p>
This is nowhere more evident in Bishop's poem than in her Crusoe's attitude toward objects. When Crusoe, having been returned to civilization, contemplates the one tool that he did not make, but that enabled all the rest of his labor, what initially looks like a 

<b></b>

proper recognition of worth (commensurate with its great utility) is quickly transformed into that phantasmatic form of valuation that Marx termed fetishization:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">

<p>
Nothing in Marx's account of commodities suggests that there is a problem with developing intense emotional investments in objects that are particularly important to our survival. But the very specific personifying language Crusoe uses here belongs to what Marx calls "the mist enveloped regions of the religious world" in which "the productions of the human brain appear as independent beings endowed with life, and entering into relation both with one another and the human race" .
</p>

<p>
Bishop's genteel Crusoe&#x02014;like the political economists who celebrate Crusoe&#x02014;has what Marx would take to be false description of his experience. That is to say, Crusoe misrecognizes his nature (indeed, he misrecognizes it as natural), and therefore he talks about all things in a false language that is at once utterly persuasive and utterly bankrupt. The drama of the poem turns on the way that Crusoe's ability to articulate his exquisitely attuned sensibilities, his feelings of alienation and anomie, breaks down in moments of great pathos, demonstrating the depths of his self-misunderstanding.

<p>
Crusoe's impoverished effort to acknowledge the existence of another person may not quite reach the complete inversion of values Marx imagines when he describes the state of commodity culture as one that imagines "material relations between persons and social relations between things" (Marx, 321). Persons, as well as objects, can legitimately be thought "nice." But the barrenness of Crusoe's recollection, framed as it is from the language of banal conversation rather than the language of authentic attachments, is the best evidence of this Crusoe's determination by a reductive discourse of value and a deforming state of social relations.
</p>

<p>
It is certainly possible to read Oppen's Crusoe in similar terms. Such a reading of "Of Being Numerous" might argue that Oppen intends "our" judgment that Crusoe has been "rescued" to coincide with the political economist's mystifications and with Crusoe's mystified self-assessments. For "us," bound to a misunderstanding of value that we cannot grasp or adjust because it lies external to us, Crusoe's island can only look like a version of our own world. This Oppen would seem actually to <i>share</i> Specter's concern that Objectivist theory "identifies life with capitalism, and so assumes that the 

<b></b>

world is merely a waste land," and to set up both Crusoe's plight and "our" reaction to it as a form of inoculating self-criticism. On this account, Crusoe's "rescue" (like the judgment that it is a rescue) is merely the ironic and inevitable fulfillment of the particular form of "numerousness" that his apparent solitary singularity conceals.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, later in the poem, Oppen does provide some warrant for reading him this way, elaborating further on the inability to return to the ground of our activity in order to perceive the actual worth of anything. Contrasting us to man in his primitive state, who can see things as they are, Oppen finds that we are:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">

<p class="noIndent">
The fact that "everything is already here" for the choosing makes choosing into shopping, a mystified form of "voluntarism" that conceals the determinism of an economic system that issues only in brutality to others and to the self. It is the same falsely voluntaristic account of "choice," Marx would argue, that underlies the liberal fiction that all social relations are contractual; and it is the same one that leads Bishop's Crusoe to imagine himself responsible for his own alienation:

<p>
But at this point, we must confront the difference between Bishop's Crusoe and Oppen's. Bishop's poem is, first and foremost, a complex drama of <i>tone,</i> whose purpose is to evoke by means of voice a gently ironized sympathy, and on that ground, an identification. That is, the point of Bishop's elaborate ventriloquism of Crusoe's language of self-deception is to see <i>our</i> language in the light of his language and to see Crusoe's behavior in the light of our behavior: to see Crusoe as precisely like ourselves. While Bishop may in fact believe that a particular social and economic order gives determinate shape to&#x02014;or even exacerbates&#x02014;the misrecognitions that constitute our worldview, her poem is nevertheless consoling on the very ground of its criticism. We may be deceived and thwarted by that fact that what we take to be our languages of expression and valuation are given to rather than made by us, but such ordinarily tragic and ordinary thwartings are precisely what we share, what makes us us.
</p>

<p>
Certainly Oppen, too, is capable of pointing out false consciousness of all kinds; he, too, is particuarly aware of its consequences for language, which is reduced to "a ferocious mumbling, in public/ Of rootless speech" . This critique of the way language is abused by being ideologized lies behind a poem like "Song, The Winds of Downhill," which speaks of a longing to jettison those features of language the poet 

<b></b>

calls "tone" and "pose," aspects which suggest the stresses placed on intention by social obligation&#x02014;in favor of words like "would with and" that are hard to poison through misuse because it is hard to say they mean anything at all .
</p>

<p>
But we cannot carry this reading of Oppen as a critic of ideology internalized through language too far. Oppen's Crusoe <i>has</i> no apparent psychology which might be read as ideology&#x02014;if only because he makes no appearance at all. We cannot assess the state of his consciousness because we have nothing to go on. He is not loquacious, like the novelist's Crusoe, and therefore he is not acquisitive like Marx's, nor survivalist like the political economist's. He is not even, like Elizabeth Bishop's "Crusoe in England," pathetic or sympathetic, for he has neither tone nor pose: he is <i>silent</i>. In fact, the only thing that we know about Oppen's Crusoe is what "we" say about him.
</p>

<p>
The significance of <i>that</i> fact depends on how we read the syntax of the stanza and construe its causal logic. One could, for example, read the verse as an attenuated argument across the period: "We are pressed on each other. . . . so we have chosen." Read this way, "so" means "as a result": "We are pressed on each other, and as a consequence we have chosen the meaning of being numerous." The implied account of causality here is consistent with the Marxian narrative; it suggests that "our" positive evaluation of Crusoe's return is not really anything we have deliberated or willed. It is, rather, a belief about the nature of persons that is determined by their particular historical condition of "numerousness." "Pressed" on each other, we are transformed by oppressive social relations into reactive objects rather than active subjects.
</p>

<p>
It is, however, equally permissible to parse the verse so that it reads: "Crusoe we say was 'rescued'. . . so we have chosen." Read this way, "so" would mean something like, "in this manner." This second reading raises the possibility that what is being represented here is not a dramatized foreclosure of choice but an explanation of the manner in which "we" come to decide upon the meaning of any thing. It points us, in other words, toward the other possible source for the image of Crusoe, not in a discourse of class, but in a discourse of mind; toward a series of debates surrounding what has come to be known as Wittgenstein's "private language argument."
</p>

<p>
When Crusoe enters this debate, as he did in a series of explications of Wittgenstein's later thought that followed rapidly on the heels of the English publication of the <i>Philosophical Investigations</i> in 1953, he is obviously not the Crusoe of fiction, nor the "congenital Crusoe" of the political economist. He is rather, a <i>structural</i> Crusoe: a man not left in isolation or reared in isolation but regarded in isolation&#x02014;prior to and apart from our construal of any of his actions.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  What has come to be known as Wittgenstein's "private language argument" concerns not just "language" as such; the classic example of a rule-governed activity, used by Saul Kripke in his influential exposition of the paradox in <i>Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language</i>,<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  is the rule of addition. But Kripke selects a mathematical rule for his example only in order to emphasize the generality of the critique&#x02014;finally, it applies to <i>all</i> rule-governed actions, whether mathematical, linguistic, or merely conceptual.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Briefly stated, the skeptical paradox runs as follows: imagine that you are confronted by a resolutely skeptical questioner who wants some justification for your belief that 

<b></b>

your action is consistent with a rule. Or, more precisely, the skeptic wants to know how you know that when following a rule you are acting in accordance with that rule as you have intended it in the past. The problem is that you have in your life set out to follow any given rule only a finite number of times, in a finite number of cases or contexts. (In Kripke's mathematical example, the rule is the rule of addition, and the highest number you have ever added is 56.) What the skeptic is suggesting is that while you may have thought you followed that rule in the past because you performed according to its dictates in every case you with which you have been confronted <i>so far; </i>you cannot be certain that the rule you in fact intended was not some <i>other</i> rule&#x02014;one that stipulated that you behave as you have in all the cases you have encountered thus far, but stipulated something else in some as-yet-unencountered and future case. Kripke's example: When you followed the rule for "plus" in the past, the function you intended might indeed have been to add two numbers together&#x02014;for in the case of every number with which you have thus far been confronted, that is what you did. But on what basis, he asks, can you assert that the rule you actually intended was not the rule more properly known as "quus"? According to the quus function, one proceeds to add all numbers lower than 57 as one would if performing addition; but in <i>quuadition</i>, the answer to any problem containing a number higher than 56 is the number 5. You have never added a number over 56 before; you have therefore never formulated any intentions regarding such numbers. You therefore cannot challenge the skeptic's claim that you had meant <i>quus</i> all along by appealing to or reporting on your prior mental state.
</p>

<p>
One possible reply to the skeptic might be to observe that the number of times I have applied the rule of addition cannot possibly matter, since a rule of this kind is not limited in its application to a finite number of cases. Addition is, rather, a <i>general </i>rule (an algorithm) about what to do when confronted by two groups of objects&#x02014;i.e. you combine them and then count the larger pile. But, the skeptic might retort, this objection also depends on a rule which, in your experience, has only been applied over a finite number of cases&#x02014;the rule in the exemplary case being the rule of counting. Perhaps in every previous instance, the skeptic suggests, "by 'count' [you] formerly meant quount, where to 'quount' a heap is to count it in the ordinary sense, unless the heap was formed of two heaps, one of which had 57 or more items, in which case one must automatically give the answer '5'" . Your objection that counting, too, specifies a rule that is independent of the number of objects counted does not help matters; for a version of this critique can be made about any reduced rule, going, as it were, all the way down&#x02014;until you come to rest upon a rule that you must admit is irreducible to any other&#x02014;and that rule too will be susceptible to the same skeptical critique.
</p>

<p>
The conclusion of this argument is intended to be fatal to your conviction that you are behaving now as you once did, since you can no longer be certain what you once did&#x02014;whether in fact you meant plus or <i>quus</i>. The problem Wittgenstein's paradox poses is not just an epistemological problem that makes it impossible to be certain that the rule you intend now is the same rule you intended before. It is also an ontological problem, potentially devastating to the idea of meaning altogether. For, Kripke argues, "if there was no such thing as my meaning plus rather than quus in the past, neither 

<b></b>

can there be any such thing in the present" . The logical outcome of the paradox is the deeply anti-Cartesian conclusion that there is, <i>even now,</i> no fact about you or your mental state that distinguishes meaning plus from meaning quus. And if there is nothing about you that constitutes your intending one rule rather than another, then "there can be no such thing as meaning anything by any word" .
</p>

<p>
Wittgenstein's solution to the "private language argument" is offered, not as a redemptive account of individual psychology, but in terms of a community of language users, or what he calls a "form of life" (<i>Philosophical Investigations</i>, 8e). A form of life, as Kripke defines it, is "[t]he set of responses in which we agree, and the way they interweave with our activities" . According to Wittgenstein, then, I ascribe rule-following to you when your behavior is consistent with my "form of life," by which I mean that a) you give the same responses I am inclined to give in a situation like yours, b) you interact "properly" with my community, and c) the ascription of rule-following to you has some utility in that community. While there are no truth conditions, then, for determining whether a person follows a rule, there are assertability conditions for our judgment that he does so.
</p>

<p>
In Wittgenstein's paradox, Robinson Crusoe presents us with two problems, both of which are relevant to Oppen's Crusoe in "Of Being Numerous."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  The first is an "internal" problem about determining the nature&#x02014;or, in fact, the existence&#x02014;of one's own intentions. Considered in this context, Oppen's previously odd-seeming locution about Crusoe suddenly makes a great deal of sense as an argument about intentionality. By saying "so we have chosen," Oppen means not so much that "we" have decided (through internal deliberation or ideological formation) that it is better for Crusoe that he has been brought home; he means that "we" have decided something by talking about him in a particular way. There may not be truth conditions for determining the meaning or value of Crusoe's actions, (since they have no internal or intentional mental realization) but there are assertibility conditions for our calling his return a rescue. And indeed, as the verse goes on to imply, it is <i>only</i> by talking about things in a particular way&#x02014;by sharing a particular form of life&#x02014;that "we" exist as a communal entity at all.
</p>

<p>
But it is at this point that the silence of Oppen's Crusoe becomes particularly important&#x02014;and particularly troublesome for my hypothetical Wittgensteinian Oppen. For what can "we" make of Oppen's decision not to describe Crusoe's activity <i>at all</i>? Given a structural Crusoe, it is only when we interpret a person's responses as being in some way consistent with our own that we, in Kripke's exceedingly evocative and resonant phrase, "take him into the community." But what if Crusoe's responses did not resemble any we knew? What if his life was so different from any we might imagine as to be incomprehensible, imperceptible, <i>silent</i>? This is the second "external" problem that Crusoe poses. If there was nothing about Crusoe's mental state, nothing beyond our interpretive acts, that constituted his meaning anything in particular, from whence derives our inclination to take that person&#x02014;man considered in isolation&#x02014;into our form of life in the first place?
</p>

<p>
Kripke, tentatively though quite properly, phrases the question as a question not just of epistemology but of ethics: "If Wittgenstein would have any problem with Crusoe, 

<b></b>

perhaps the problem would be whether we have any 'right' to take him into our community, and attribute our rules to him" . Kripke acknowledges that "if we think of Crusoe as following rules, we are taking him into our community and applying our criteria of rule following to him" . But he does not exactly explain why we should think of him as following a rule. How we recognize rule-following as such, what the tests of rule following in general might be, if they do not entail the judgement that someone obeys our rules, is not at all clear.
</p>

<p>
Oppen here addresses himself to an aspect of the hard problem of other minds that Wittgenstein does not raise: that in some important respect all persons are silent, all responses sufficiently unlike our own to cast radical doubt that we are faced with a fellow rule follower&#x02014;which is to say, a potentially recognizable fellow person. If, as Oppen's Crusoe's silence suggests, silent singularity is in some crucial sense the norm, then reason decrees (and history as Oppen experienced it confirms) that it will be all too easy to make mistakes about persons: not just to fail to treat them justly, but to fail to perceive their presence or credit their existence altogether. Such normative silence threatens at every moment to lead to the failure of acknowledgement and care Oppen calls "the shipwreck of the singular."
</p>

<p>
If we were operating within some other field of inquiry&#x02014;of cognitive psychology, for example&#x02014;we might find ready to hand a set of arguments proposing to elaborate a set of procedures for the empirical detection of rule following altogether. But for Oppen, the poet, the solution is posed, not as a formal method or a form of reason, but as a form of patience, as a general attitude&#x02014;as a silent extension of credit. And the poetic form silent patience takes is, typically, the break, the pause, the caesura.
</p>

<p>
Thus the significance of this section break between 6 and 7, which separates the act of "choosing" from the mental states ("oppressed, bewildered") that determine choice and separates it, too, from the actual choices that are made (the "meaning of being numerous"). This pause illustrates that a capacity or disposition to value is independent from, though necessary for, the particular instances of valuing that the capacity makes possible.
</p>

<p>
Section 6, then, considered in isolation, suggests yet another possible way of seeing "so": "Crusoe we say was/'Rescued'/So [you can see] we have chosen." And what you can see we have "chosen" is sociability itself, conceived, not as a particular vocabulary, but rather as the obligation to say <i>something</i> about Crusoe, whether we recognize him as being part of our "form of life" or not&#x02014;because we regard him as having <i>a</i> form of life, as being a person like ourselves, though not necessarily as our kind of person. After this choice is made, the particular choice of the meanings we come to assign him ("the meaning of being numerous") may be determined by our form of life, or they determined by the relations of production that structure and give form to our lives (pressed, oppressed, bewildered). But the fact that we choose a meaning is dependent only on our acknowledgement of the existence of the other person. We do not "rescue" Crusoe by interpreting his behavior as being consistent with our own; we have already rescued him by granting that his activities need interpretation.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
This is the attitude toward persons that Oppen, citing yet another quoted (though this time, attributed) term, called "curiosity." The final section of "Of Being Numerous" consists in its entirety of a letter written by Walt Whitman:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Whitman: 'April 19, 1864 
<p class="blockquote">

<p class="blockquote">

<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<div class="attribution">
<!--_attribution-->

<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
It is quite striking to note that the poem's conclusion on Whitman's letter quite deliberately resolves, not on a description of how the statue "looks" [<a href="#1">re 1</a>]. Despite Whitman's assurances, the viewer&#x02014;whether close up and at a steeply raked angle, or near level but from a great distance&#x02014;cannot see the statue atop the capitol dome "very well" at all. Instead, Whitman's insistence on his perception of the obduracy of the great bronze becomes the occasion to describe a whole variety of subjective, imaginative, and affective responses: personification, the registration of preferences (for the way something looks at particular times of day); indeed, perception in this poem becomes something like a vision of subjectivity itself as it registers those particular qualities of sundazzle on bronze that are the result of one's particular position relative to a thing, and the changes in attitude, atmosphere, or weather that constitute subjectivity across time ("it grows upon one in time").
</p>

<p>
Nor does Oppen resolve on an account of what it looks like [<a href="#2">re 2</a>], for the poetic insistence upon likeness is also what makes possible the misperceptions or projections we call ideological.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Whitman's ability to see the feathered headdress that the Statue of Freedom atop the capitol dome wears as a star is finally not all that different from the reason why the statue atop the Capitol dome wears a feathered headdress in the first place, rather than a phrygian cap as originally intended. Both the constructed re (Crawford's) and the red re (Whitman's) are attempts to secure the legitimacy of a new government by recasting it as having highest possible sanction. For Whitman, union begins in the heavens; in 1863 America, it began by avoiding the divisive implications of topping the statue of freedom with the symbol of freed slaves.
</p>

<p>
"Of Being Numerous" resolves instead on an <i>attitude toward looking</i>. "Curious" is itself a curious term; it should be contraposed to "beautiful," or even to "meaningful." Isolated in white space, set silently apart from the fluent discourse of the letter, curiosity represents the jettisoning of a concept of "art" for a stance toward the object. Curiosity toward the other redounds upon the self; it is not a description of this object, nor is it a criterion by which we value the object; it is the name of the disposition to perceive and to value.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  It is typical of Oppen's poetry that we find consensus-type judgements (of beauty, of meaning) separated from the foundational premise of "curiosity" or care that of necessity precedes them in fact, though it may follow them in verse. Note, for example, the reversed blazon in section 15:

<b></b>

</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">

<p>
Here, the "androgynous" chorus seems at first to imply that persons can only exist insofar as they are acknowledged. And while it is true that they are individuated by being literally incorporated by communal criteria, this peculiar chora seems already mysteriously to possess the power of speech, a prior speech that voices what we might call the human (collective) capacity to be found.</p>

The poem's epigraph&#x02014;"Veritas sequitur . . . "&#x02014;invokes and alters Aquinas' doctrinal <i>Veritas sequitur esse</i> ("truth is a consequence of the existence of things"), a doctrine 

<b></b>

originally formulated to counter and divinize the Aristotelian (and, we might say, proto-Wittgensteinian) idea that truth is a consequence of cognition about things. But Oppen conspicuously and typically omits Aquinas' <i>esse</i>, which contained in it the assumption of the divine origin of "thing," (which, in other words, inscribes the "truth" that follows from objects as a particular theologically sanctioned form of value) and replaces it with a paraphrase posed less as a metaphysical dogma and more as an astonished exclamatory premise.
</p>

<p>
The difference between doctrine and premise is made even clearer in the Daybook where Oppen meditates on the same passage:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
Truth <strike>follows</strike> must follow 
<br />
after things 
<p class="blockquote">

<br />
The existence of <u>something</u>

</blockquote>

</div>

<p>
In the first formulation, Oppen strikes out the dogmatic proposition of (theological) certainty and replaces it with a statement of <i>logical</i> necessity. In the second, squared-off formulation, it is not "things," but simply the premise that an abstract "something" exists that makes subsequent "truth" possible. This something&#x02014;less certain, more abstract, but also more humane&#x02014;is what Oppen means by "knowledge." This intention towards persons, the attitude: "That they are there" is unconditioned by particular historical forms of belief, unspecified as to the particular qualities of objects, but it is forcefully stated. From this "judgment" for the existence of a necessary truth, all other sorts of judgments (like sympathy, like small beauties) may follow.

It is hard not to feel sympathy for Oppen, whose long poetic silence was subtended by bold-faced repetitions of "visionary" intent that have gone unheard. It is as if the poet himself was speaking a private language. The earliest criticisms of Oppen's earliest work denied the poet's vision by focusing on the way that the particulate materiality of his poems rendered them incomprehensible, characterizing their maker as a sort of idiot-boy stutterer: 

<b></b>

</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Mr. Oppen's offering exhibits that extreme parsimony of words that is taken today to imply infinite profundity. I don't believe it implies anything of the kind. His writing is like listening to a man with an impediment in his speech.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
More recently, however, precisely this critique has been revived as praise: "I am not sure I completely understand this poem," admits Peter Nicholls when confronted with the late poem "Occurrences" , "but nor am I sure that I am meant to. The syntax seems broken, precarious, though to describe it as fragmented would misleadingly assume a reconstitutable logic of propositions" (<i>Objectivist Nexus</i>, 250).
</p>

<p>
As I suggested at the beginning of the essay, one of the central features by which Oppen's "alternative" poetic is distinguished as alternative is by its supposed emphasis on a textual materiality that eschews claims of "vision"&#x02014;or even of propositionality altogether. Thus, in Michael Davidson's reading, as in Nicholls', "Oppen's paratactic logic, truncated syntax and ambiguous use of antecedents" do not signify an impediment of speech but a resistance to it. Such fragments "embody the shifting attentions of a mind dissatisfied with all claims to closure.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  For Davidson, the workings of that shifting and resistant mind are most emphatically on display, not in the finished and published texts of Oppen's poems, but in what he calls the "palimptexts" of the daybooks&#x02014;the drafts of poems in which line revisions are typed on cut scraps and pasted on drafts in impasto twelve leaves deep; the "book" formed by hammering a set of sheets into a piece of plywood with a nail; the "fascicles" fastened by metal screws, brads, and pipe-cleaners. But though his description is filled with romance, his point is avowedly anti-romantic; Davidson means to argue that for Oppen, writing was not the act of creating unified and rarified "works," but rather a sort of homely work:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
My purpose in describing the material component of Oppen's work is to suggest the degree to which writing was first and foremost something ready-to-hand&#x02014;as immediate as a coat hanger or a piece of wire. The pipe cleaners, metal clasps and glue are visible representations of those "little words" that Oppen liked so well, the basic materials of a daily intercourse.

</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
What we see in the typescript page but not in the published poem is the dialogue between individual sections, each responding to and qualifying the previous . . . Language is both the vehicle and the object of Oppen's speculations as he oscillates between competing propositions. Such dialectical progress can be seen in the published version to be sure, but the page&#x02014;with its spelling mistakes, holograph emendations, and variable lineation&#x02014;provides a "graphic" indication of how immediate and personal that progress is.

<div class="attribution">

<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p>
One might point out that the "little words" used to write poems on paper are themselves visible representations of the little words Oppen liked so well. But the point of Davidson's parallel between pipe-cleaner and word is less that one part of a work should be seen to be in "dialogue" with another or that the meaning of any part of a work is "qualified" by acknowledging the contingent materiality of the language in which it is 

<b></b>

rendered; it is rather that meaning&#x02014;as something that does not change&#x02014;is effectively <i>vitiated</i> by that materiality. The word, viewed as a commonplace object, makes writing a form of jury-rigged, practical, daily labor that issues not in meanings at all, but in objects. "Dialectic," on Davidson's account&#x02014;and on many accounts like it&#x02014;is not a movement from contradictory assertions toward a higher synthesis; rather, by taking materiality to qualify meaning out of existence, the proponents of this version of "dialectic" make synthesis unnecessary by canceling out anything so brutally final as an assertion, and imagine that political consequences follow from the rejection of a conceptual finality seen as inseparable from violence. Or, as Jerome McGann's argues:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
. . . when the physical aspects of writing&#x02014;its signifying mechanisms&#x02014;are made a conscious part of the imagination's activities, writing opens up the subject (and even to a limited extent the possibility) of unalienated work.

<p>
Of course, Oppen is not afflicted with other-speech&#x02014;a verbal disability that threatens to exclude the speaker from a speech-community altogether. But, as may be evident from his insistence that his work is "NOT A DIALECTIC," neither does he intend that his poems embody difficulty in order to suggest some other to speech&#x02014;a material text that would be "unreconstitutable" in terms of some "form of life" or another. Rather, if Oppen's poems seem "broken" or "parsimonious" it is because he does not really want to be making "poems" at all:
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">
<!--_poetry-->
I would like the poem to be transparent, inaudible
<br />. . . 
<br />
"Because I am not silent the poems are bad"
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<div class="attribution">
<!--_attribution-->
(<i>Conjunctions</i>, 3)
<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p>
Over and over again we find Oppen trying to indicate one great "vision"&#x02014;though it turns out to be an extraordinarily difficult proposition for his readers to see: that he aspires "to construct with language something other than language," and that such a construction properly entails not a craftsmanlike attention to the origin and function of words but rather an indifference to words: "the poem begins without the words or with one word or with any word." The something other than language that is intended by this sort of poem is not a meaning; or, as Oppen puts it, "It is not what a poem says, but what it is talking about" (Sulfur, 220). What a poem is talking about with any, one, or no words is "poetry," which Oppen understands not as a collection or series of objects, not as a set of rules about their proper construction, but as what he calls "the power to originate": "the power to originate lies not in aesthetic man (the exercise of taste) but in ontologic man; man as he confronts the world" .
</p>

<p>
These statements that I have collected here from the strange and scattered fragments of Oppen's notebooks are not, I think, poems. Rather, they address a problem that Oppen sees as endemic to poems: no matter how spare they become, they are still too fluent. Poems always seem to be saying something; or, in what amounts to the same thing, they are always making themselves available for particularizing judgement. This is what Oppen means when he says that all poems are always "bad" insofar as they fail 

<b></b>

of silence. Silence, on the other hand, is not fluent enough; not <i>properly</i> "inaudible," it appears merely to be saying nothing at all. The daybooks form a continuous running undersong whose genre is uncertain&#x02014;as is, therefore, the relationship to readers that is projected by this form of writing. If neither poems nor silence alone succeed in "talking about" the right thing; the daybooks, then, imagined as a speaking silence, aim to be at once fluent and inaudible&#x02014;aim, not to say anything but to "disclose everything."
</p>

<p>
Oppen writes, in section 10 of "Of Being Numerous":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
But I will listen to a man, I will listen to a man, and when I speak I will speak, tho he will fail and I will fail. But I will listen to him speak.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<div class="attribution">

 <sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p>
As with the "man" the speaker describes, critics have listened and failed. What Oppen means to point to (again, gesturing at his point with the resonant silence that separates the articulated sense that poetic utterance "will fail" from its compensatory solution) is the determination to listen: "But I will listen to him speak." Oppen addresses the problem of other minds not by submitting them to the chances of style but by at every moment supposing that there is someone there to understand, someone who means something, and who needs us, not in order to exist, but just to <i>find them.</i>

Oppen's account of "art" cannot be reduced to the argument that communication is always doomed to failure. And it is only by failing to attend to the silent peculiarity of this art that we could conclude that what was most important to bring to light about persons or poems was their individual "sound" or "feel," their thousandfold particularities and social distinctions, rather than their basis in the truth of one common "thing."
</p>

<p>
An attention to truthfulness, as Oppen's epigraph to this essay suggests, is "far from a social virtue," because Oppen's understanding of the truth of poetry is precisely at odds with any account of virtue that depends on the social determinations of a "form of life". Oppen's lesson to twentieth-century poetry is that a poetry sufficiently abstract to provide social hope will appear to be not just "anti-aesthetic" but altogether anti-phenomenal&#x02014;opposed not just to the idea of literary quality but to the idea of quality itself. Communication may indeed fail: but the curious recognitional fact ("that they are there") is the sort of success made possible by being willing to fail aesthetically, by being silent in the right way.

A case in point is the story of H.H. Lewis as reconstructed in Cary Nelson, <i>Repression and Recovery: Modern American Poetry and the Politics of Cultural Memory, 1910&#x02013;1945</i> (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1989). Though Lewis and Oppen are very different poets, there are some parallels between their careers: Lewis, like Oppen, was a committed leftist whose work was extremely well received by William Carlos Williams. Nelson's argument, however, has less to do with the incompatibility of poetry and politics than with the institution of literary criticism privileging a <i>kind </i>of poetry that made Lewis's proletarian and anti-experimental aesthetic invisible.

Properly speaking, the difference between congenital and structural is not just a difference between political economy and philosophy; it is a difference within philosophy as well. It was an exchange between A.J. Ayer and Rush Rhees that first took up Robinson Crusoe as the paradigm of a private language user. As Ayer explains it, the question concerns what we might call a "congenital Crusoe": "Imagine a Robinson Crusoe left alone on his island while still an infant, having not yet learned to speak. Let him, like Romulus and Remus, be nurtured by a wolf, or some other animal, until he can fend for himself; and so let him grow to manhood" . Kripke , as I will shortly explain, intensifies the Crusoe scenario by regarding him not as as the subject of suppositional history but as a structural problem. See A.J. Ayer and Rush Rhees, "Can there be a Private Language?" <i>Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, </i>Supplementary Vol. 28 : 63&#x02013;94, reprinted in George Pitcher, ed., <i>Wittgenstein, The Philosophical Investigations </i>(Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1968), 251&#x02013;285.

There is a non&#x02013;trivial disagreement about whether Kripke's Wittgenstein is a good account of Wittgenstein's "private language argument."

Though the definitive version of his interpretation of the Wittgenstein problem was not published until well after the poem appeared, by Kripke's own testimony he had formulated his account as early as 1962 and was lecturing publicly on it by 1964. Although it hardly provides evidence for the influence of Kripke's Wittgenstein, it might nonetheless be worth noting that while the earlier sequence entitled "A Language of New York"  contained a number of the sections that would later be reincorporated into "Of Being Numerous," the Crusoe passage is not one of them.

The history of the statue in question is a fascinating study in the way icons become fodder for ideological conflict. See Vivien Green Fryd<i>, Art and Empire: The Politics of Ethnicity in the US. Capitol, 1815&#x02013;1865</i> (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1992): "The United States Capitol dome and its colossal bronze statue are frequently seen on the nightly television news and in political cartoons as signifiers of the U.S. government. Neither photographs of the Capitol nor cartoons, however, provide clear details of the statue on the dome, which is often misidentified in the media and by the general public as an Indian. Thomas Crawford's <i>Statue of Freedom</i> is in fact a difficult monument to discern, in part because of its location, far above the viewer's eye, but also because the artist was forced to make a number of compositional and iconographic changes to satisfy his patron, the U.S. government, represented by two men, Captain Montgomery Meigs (1816&#x02013;1889), from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the financial and engineering supervisor of the Capitol extension between 1853 and 1859, and his boss, Secretary of War Jefferson Davis (1808&#x02013;1889). . . . Thomas Crawford allowed his statue to fall victim to southern suppression of potentially threatening symbols. As a result, he created a monument of compromise manifest even in the title; the work is identified by government publications as <i>Statue of Freedom</i> rather than its more appropriate title, 

<b></b>

<i>Armed Liberty</i>. Politics eroded the work's meaning, and, with each concession made by the artist, the work's iconography became more obscured.
</p>

<p class="noIndent">
What is ironic is that during the Civil War Crawford's <i>Statue of Freedom</i> resonated with additional meaning that applied directly to the division between the North and the South. In particular, President Lincoln had the monument hoisted onto the Capitol dome in 1863, to symbolize the nation's reunification under northern hegemony, a meaning that Jefferson Davis, now president of the Confederacy, obviously had never intended."
