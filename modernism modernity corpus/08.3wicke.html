What follows is a position paper, although it contains a number of
modernist specimen cases upon which, as if they were park benches, it
comes momentarily to rest. In the early pages of Ludwig Wittgenstein's
<I>Philosophical Investigations,</I> itself a modernist test case of
sorts, Wittgenstein proposes a language game consisting of a single
word--"slab"--shouted out as bricklayers build a foundation and a house
of language.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Think of this essay as akin to the slab game, a somewhat deliberately
 crude attempt to set up a way of talking about the larger foundation
 of our enterprise as critics of modernism and modernity, instead of
 an elegant perambulation within modernist textual spaces. Skirting
 the perimeter of modernism's walls, my polemic addresses the critical
 superstructure surrounding modernism's revival, probing its brickwork
 and sounding its slabs. These slabs, serving as the park benches I
 invoked above, are different in kind; one is a material conceit coming
 from the ground literally, while the second offers a critical concept
 taken from Ernst Bloch as a metonymic bench. Interspersed are leaves
 drawn from several modernist artifacts, while the entire essay rests
 on economic metaphors from speculative finance. Bubbles and slabs are
 antithetical, yet both can refer to critical discourse, in the first
 case as a speculative investment in value, in the second (slabs) as an
 antifoundationalist foundation for critical practice.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I'll trace out a conceit through much of the argument, borrowing
an analogy from another cultural arena also subject to speculative
bubbles. "I speak," to cite Miss Prism in <I>TheImportance of Being
Earnest,</I> "horticulturally." Consider the following remark, on its
face yet another frenzied, fin-de-si&eacute;cle denunciation 

<B></B>

of alterity: "It is impossible to deny that the blending of
foreign blood has seriously impaired the value of the pure strains. Many
of the continental sorts lack cleanliness and when they crop up amongst
their purer sisters their appearance at once betrays them." We imagine
we know the discourse of empire, with its binaries of contamination and
purity, self and other, so well we could gloss this in our sleep. Yet the
excoriation of sordid miscegenation with pure native stock emerges not
from imperial apologetics, nor from the popular press, but from a troubled
report put out by the beleaguered British tulip growers association,
circa 1900. The once majestic Royal National Tulip Society, representing
the aesthetic and taxonomic elite of the tulip industry, a society which
was down to two members when it tried to confer its varietal prizes in
1926, makes an eerie parallel to the fates and fortunes of the modernist
critical industry.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  The Royal National Tulip Society--which waned altogether in 1936--had
  been the arbiter of excellence in all things tulip for centuries, at
  the forefront of aesthetic and horticultural innovation in the United
  Kingdom; and had an eclectic membership made up of hobbyists, botanists,
  aristocratic gardeners, and garden-variety tulip fanciers (<I>TT,</I>
  247). The creations of the Society, given the name "English Florist's
  tulips," sprang up as one-of-a-kind marvels in country estate gardens as
  well as in humble plots cultivated by the side of the railways. Again
  for centuries, English Florist's tulips were judged semiannually in
  well-attended meetings held by convention in public houses. There
  individual tulips, among them the feathered Bizarre, "George Hayward,"
  the soft, yellow "Mrs. Moon," the resplendent "Bronze King," and the
  Bybloemen tulip, "Princess Charlotte's Cenotaph," went head-to-head
  for prizes and approbation, their decapitated petaled tresses uniformly
  inserted into three-inch-tall brown beer bottles.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What had interfered with this long reign of horticultural glory, not
to say purity? In a sense mass culture was the villain, the same foe
slinking down the pike and gunning for modern(ist) literature and the
arts, at least in commonly-held versions of modernism. The first insidious
notion capable of shaking the foundation of the Royal National Tulip
Society's authority came, not surprisingly, from the United States,
that bastion of sleazy mass culture. In the early-nineteenth century
an American gardener had planted and raised tulips en masse as bedding
plants; the discovery failed to catch on commercially at that juncture,
but at the turn of the century Dutch tulip entrepreneurs--who had a long
history of making guilders off the backs of tulips--systematized and
mass-marketed the American tulip bed invention. The resulting bed or plot
of tulips became not only mass culture, but mass spectacle. The pivotal
World Exposition held in Paris in 1889, itself a design monument to
modernity, where the Eiffel Tower was erected as sheer public spectacle,
introduced the first world exhibition of massed tulips as spectacular eye
candy. The great Dutch <I>tulipiere,</I> E. H. Krelage, filled the beds
of the Trocadero Palace during the fair with what a current newspaper
editorial disparagingly called the "bang in the eye" of thousands of
planted tulips (<I>TT,</I> 223). Tulips en masse surrounded the base of
the iconic apex of modern urbanism, adding a horizontal, floral modernism
to the Eiffel Tower's vertical modernist spectacle.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The mass cultural sea of tulips Krelage had planted was comprised
of no ordinary or anonymous tulip legions. As another first, these
were brand-name tulips, the "Darwin" brand to be exact. Krelage had
the creative and marketing genius to buy the rights to the name from
Charles Darwin's son, Francis (<I>TT,</I> 259). "Darwin" was an apt new
brand-name for a diverse collection of pink and purple tulip bulbs he had
bought at a vast tulip close out sale in Flanders, as that region ceased
growing tulips commercially (<I>TT,</I> 262). The individual botanical
and varietal names of the motley collection were excised; Darwin tulips
were collectivist, a brand instead of a taxonomic variety or florist's
name for a unique type. Once branded "Darwin," tulips became modern
commodities--not because they were being sold and traded on the market,
which they had been for centuries before--but because they now were
cultivated to be planted en masse, and given a brand name accordingly:
tulips became a modern, or even modernist, floral genre--tulips had
truly evolved.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Subsequent to Krelage's breakthrough on the tulip branding front, tulips
also entered modernity as a pivot of the modernizing tourist industry. In
order to replenish consumer wonderment at the spectacle of tulip fields in
bloom, thousands of bulbs were given away as municipal marks of esteem, as
awards for heroism, and even in exchange for arms at the outset of World
Wars I and II (<I>TT,</I> 268). Tulips shared another feature of modernism
in their internationalism and cosmopolitanism. An international floral
currency, the tulip began to be grown commercially in far-flung places,
such as Japan in the 1920s. The Japanese deplored tulips as unrefined and
vulgar, but overcame these aesthetic objections since they had the ideal
climatic conditions for their cultivation and export to less-refined,
tulip-hungry Western nations (<I>TT,</I> 268). Tulips acted as the thin
edge of the economic wedge in complex colonial situations, at times
valuable as a raw material for "extraction," at other moments important
as a symbolic show of imperial floral might. Hardball economic battles
waged by Britain over its possession and control of colonial tulip bulbs
echoed the violent, and ultimately successful, mid-nineteenth-century
struggles of the British empire to wipe out the indigenous Indian textile
industry. British women's clothing transmuted the often bloody suppression
of Indian weaving into flower-strewn calico cloth, its innocuous floral
prints masking a secret history; so too did brand-name tulips flower on
the foreign, colonial soil whose native tulip bulbs had been confiscated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Perhaps not surprisingly, it was a celebrated Irish gardener,
William Robinson, who proposed an anticolonialist twist in modern tulip
display. In <I>The Wild Garden,</I> Robinson argues that tulips should be
set out in masses, but not in delineated beds (<I>TT,</I> 259). Instead
they should be planted in nooks, on hillsides, or across a lawn, where
they will appear to have sprung up randomly in the wild. Robinson
articulates an anti-Plantation explosion of tulips beyond the pale of
the garden plot, and transforms the most cultivated, artificial, and
man-made flower in European history into a simulacrum of wildness. Only
the modern fashion for a Gustave Le Bon-like crowd of tulips--that is,
the brand-name cultivars Krelage and others had taught the masses to see
and revel in en masse--makes it possible for a subversive gardener to
achieve its antithesis, the aesthetic effect of rogue tulips springing
up wildly yet beautifully over a "natural"

<B></B>

landscape. Robinson poeticized the crowd of tulips by embracing their
previously suppressed wild side, in an act of colonial (Irish) mimicry
of the English Florist's tulip so strategic, his tulips could be called
Bhabha hybrids <I>avant la lettre</I>. By dint of a speculative bubble
afloat on the material froth of history, making a nearly circumferential
global orbit, and scattered by economic, aesthetic, and political
revolutions alike, the tulip had traced its way back to a <I>faux
sauvage</I> fashion identity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Modernist tulips also parallel modernism by providing a material canvas
for extensive aesthetic experimentation--or enough of a parallel to
keep this conceit in play. The departure from Kantian formalism in
the aesthetic evaluation of tulips was decisive by the end of the
nineteenth century. Heretofore, the criteria for excellence in tulips
were largely formalist. Dr. W. G. Hardy had written the seminal treatise,
"On Perfection of Form in the Tulip," in 1847, wherein he took up the
gardening cudgels against those who disagreed that the half-sphere was
the perfect form of the tulip blossom (<I>TT,</I> 232-7). Complex
mathematical equations subtended the raging arguments regarding the beauty
of tulips--whether their beauty inhered most in the straight-on frontal
view, or when seen from above looking down into the cup of the tulip,
required alternative calculations of sublime mathematical precision;
petal depth in relation to diameter offered a Platonic calculus of tulip
Form. Modernist tulip genres abandoned all such aesthetic numerology
and the formalism beneath it. The great English gardener Gertrude Jekyll
began suggesting, as of 1899, that avant-garde gardens contain beds of
multiple tulips chosen so that their colors modulated in finely-tuned
colorscapes--for example, "the blackish-purple Faust tulip" shifting to
a lighter and redder variety, bronzes shading into purple-tipped copper,
and flame reds coexisting with crimson in a fauvist riot.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
  With such a colorist's eye, mass tulips could still be differentiated
  as spectacle; Jekyll's Saussurean <I>langue</I> of tulips insisted that
  their value was always diacritical, a matter of their relation to the
  other tulips in the bed. Jekyll and other modern greats of the English
  garden established a modernist garden practice, eschewing essentialism
  and "the old stable ego of [tulipine] characters" in favor of fluid,
  nonlinear, and self-reflexive gardening techniques.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  Gardens were to be shaped with verbal and visual allusiveness: Jekyll's
  tulips entered into a modernist compact in which their most prized
  attributes, their individual characteristics, were set afloat in a
  collage-iste sea of quotation, reference, and countermemory.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the other hand, the beauty of modern tulips was also a social
construction, contingent on the material context of their viewing. The
gleaming radiance of the 30,000 Silver Hawk white tulips displayed in
the Sheffield Botanical Garden dazzled spectators thanks to the coal
mining strike then in progress; their unbesmirched whiteness was the
direct result of lowered smoke in the city's atmosphere, and depending
on the political point of view, veritably radiated governmental perfidy
or the strength of the labor cause (<I>TT,</I> 271).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The swerve toward massification in outdoor displays of tulips was
accompanied by its opposite: the very modernist vogue for tulips displayed
indoors as cut flowers, destined for vases and bouquets. Oscar Wilde
was among the first writers to bring the cut tulip into his textual
mise-en-sc&egrave;ne; in <I>The Picture of Dorian Gray,</I> tulips in the drawing 

<B></B>

room hang their heads over the rim of blue and white porcelain
vases from Japan, the visual trope of decadent modernity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  The tulip had rarely been contemplated before in its decapitated state,
  sundered from its invisible bulb, until its bizarreries suddenly made
  the indoor tulip visible, and au courant. It is almost frightening
  on this score to search out floral references in Virginia Woolf's
  <I>Mrs. Dalloway,</I> so profuse and pervasive do they prove to be.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
  Almost every page is rampant with blooms. To inventory them with an eye
  to tulips requires sharp critical pruning. In film theory a distinction
  is made when discussing the sound of a film between diegetic sound and
  the film's score or sound track. Diegetic sound refers to sound or music
  emanating from something in the scene, such as a song being played on a
  car radio, while the score or sound track comes from "outside" the scene
  or narrative, superimposed upon the visual images. Woolf's writing is
  rife with "diegetic" flowers--characters fill vases, sniff bouquets,
  peer into garden blossoms, purchase flowers, and sell them--yet
  flowers, petals, blossoms, gardens are the green fuse that drives
  her language: sinuous vines and proliferating blossoms are Woolf's
  primary metonymies. <I>Mrs. Dalloway</I> hypostatizes flowers, and
  almost obsessively specifies them. Among those mentioned diegetically
  or as glimmering metonyms are roses of all colors and kinds, including
  hallucinated red roses on Septimus's wallpaper, dahlias, sweet pea,
  violets, hollyhocks, lilies, syringa, blue hydrangeas, orchids, pampas
  grass, purple heather, moss, carnations, lilacs, delphiniums, iris--and
  one and only one mention of tulips, as follows: "It was her nature to
  enjoy. . . . She enjoyed practically everything. If you walked with her
  in Hyde Park now it was a bed of tulips, now a child in a perambulator,
  now some absurd little drama she made up on the spur of the moment."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  So Peter Walsh muses about Clarissa's character. The sight of the
  tulip bed triggers her enjoyment, but provides an occasion for her
  to illuminate the world for someone else. The tulip bed she gestures
  towards is a shared visual spectacle that the massified modern tulip
  synecdochizes perfectly. Even these almost throwaway lines about the
  tulip bed are significant in a novel so bombarded with the language
  of flowers, if one pauses for a bit of textual spadework around the
  flower's edge. One common critical notion about spectacle follows Guy
  Debord's determinist analysis in <I>The Society of the Spectacle</I>:
  that is, spectators are in thrall to spectacle, and their thralldom
  is commodified as an act of consumption.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  But <I>Mrs. Dalloway</I> as a whole will have none of this fixed
  economy of the spectacle, which Clarissa and others cut against
  repeatedly. Clarissa's expressed delight over the sight of the tulips
  nudges Peter Walsh into a moment's shared reverie. The modernist
  tulip bed is a commodified spectacle that dissolves and deliquesces
  with the nudge of an elbow. Like the coin Clarissa throws into the
  Serpentine in an act of expenditure, so too do tulips work their tiny
  magic as a feature of her gift economy. Clarissa is too old-fashioned
  perhaps to have cut tulips in her home, but she tiptoes through the
  modernist tulips to dapple the sight of them with the wonder of her
  enthusiasm. Rather than providing an occasion of "shock," which the
  novel so amply limns as a corollary modern experience, the tulip bed
  spectacle provides a distraction, in Walter Benjamin's terms, one that
  in <I>Mrs. Dalloway</I>'s gift economy is only a proper distraction
  when disproportionately shared.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Seventeenth-century Tulipomania and the South Sea Bubble affair of the
eighteenth century are retrospective instances of speculative frenzy
reaching the level of the sublime, or at least the sublimely hysterical;
the modernist tulip market I speak of doesn't have the gossamer sublimity
of those bubbles, but instead the gritty, embedded materiality of the
smutty foam that delineates a port's edge. Tulips no longer waxed and
waned in value overnight, nor were single bulbs hoarded as species
of gold. Financial speculation is an iridescent bubble in much modern
socioeconomic theory, whereby the airy liquidity of intangible speculative
value is privileged for its very vulnerability to the surface tensions
that cause it to pop--yet one more demonstration of the mysteries of
commodity form, and the contradictions of capitalism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
  Modernism as a cultural icon, or bubble, or iconic bubble, to
  oxymoronize, does not resemble the feeding frenzy of past Bubbles or
  manias, when capitalism was in doubt as a world system, nor does it bob
  up and down in the waters of a singular "market." Bursting modernism's
  bubble becomes necessary, all the more so when our own frantic critical
  splashing tries to make one large bubble come to the surface, even if
  it be a cluster of bubbles with the adjective "new" on its label. That
  is to say, we as critics and scholars of modernism have to recognize
  our own resemblance to the Royal National Tulip Society, insofar as we
  also attempt to keep hold of modernism and retain the right to award
  retroactive prizes to sportive modernist hybrids. The Royal National
  Tulip Society clung to its role as arbiter of tulip excellence, as
  it disavowed massified tulips, brand-name tulips, national and global
  tulip economies, modern spectacle, and the commercialization of tulip
  tourism. The parallel disavowals we make in our self-professed roles
  as arbiters of the new modernisms include purging modernist orthodoxy
  of formalism, tradition, hierarchies, social Darwinism, commercialism,
  bourgeois modernism, neo-imperialism, and totalization of all kinds,
  without seeing how much we rely on the modernist brand.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Modernism is a brand name. Coming from me, I should stress, that's
a compliment. Brand names have all the complexity of the Hegelian
hieroglyph, and they offer cultural space for the hierophantic, the
necrophantic, and ideological ghosts of all kinds. A brand name is not
prima facie a shill, a facade covering an empty sameness, a con game
designed to persuade gullible consumers that identical items differ
in kind due to their brand name. Brand names carve out a locus for
social recognition or attention, yet also defy linear logic or cause
and effect reasoning. Brand names are exquisitely sensitive diacritical
registers; they are more than the sum of their parts, if those parts
are taken to mean products, the ads for them, production, distribution,
and consumption. Brands can die as persons die, yet unlike the latter,
be raised from the dead in their own lifetime. Brands are aesthetic,
onto-politico-material agglomerates that live because, as with Tinkerbell,
we have applauded them into reanimation. Brand names also can live a
crepuscular existence, since twilight sleep or suspended animation is
often preferable to expending a brand's waning spirit in a waste of
shame--or killing it off. Modernism's brand name, as we know, lingered
for decades in such a boring twilight sleep, etherized upon a dissecting
table, or slumbering in a jar. Efforts such as the Modernist Studies
Association, the "New Modernisms" conferences, and even a provocative 

<B></B>

journal devoted to , share credit
for reawakening a slumbering critical and scholarly and aesthetic
spirit--modernism's brand. Each has something to do with resurrecting
and refurbishing a brand in advanced moribundity--at least in some parts
of the world. And as with so many commercial brands, the modernist
brand can only be resurrected by ironizing or implicitly denying its
original cultural status. This is glorious and salutary in some ways,
but should not be mistaken as gestures of pure cultural exhumation or
backdated exoneration. Brand names are revived so that they can still
be of use, can still move the goods. In marketing there is a name for
this: rebranding. A return to modernism with a difference, and with
a plural vengeance, as in "new modernisms," legitimately opens key
debates, stages productive re-readings, and enacts agonistic language
games of genuine import and ferocity. We cannot ignore, however, our own
investments in modernism's speculative bubble. As revivers of its brand,
a brand we cannot seem to do without, we re-brand ourselves as critics
and theorists just as we rebrand modernist others.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Because these comments can easily be misconstrued as a tired version of
the self-critical lament that "we're all complicit," or even worse in my
book, that any mode of criticism, interpretation, or theory inevitably
"appropriates" or "co-opts" something that doesn't belong to it, I'll
harp perhaps unnecessarily on what I don't mean to say, by way of the
now highly attenuated tulip analogy. Tulip growers of the late-nineteenth
and early-twentieth centuries were not "complicit" with a grubby market
in tulips worldwide, nor did they co-opt or appropriate authentic or
indigenous qualities of tulips by forcing bulbs, hybridizing them,
and finally creating tulip brands. The fierce competition between and
among tulip fanciers, tulip state apparatuses, and imperializing tulip
stratagems doesn't boil down to hegemonic violence, or not exclusively
so. Within a churning roil of bubbles, among them such contingent and
overdetermined elements as color intensity, royal patronage systems, the
rise of the natural history museum, botany hobby kits, the predilection
for British railway supervisors to dabble in passionate gardening,
nationalism, internationalism, cosmopolitanism, little Englandism, the
transformation of public space in the modern city, Dutch mercantilism,
tourism, feminism, diplomacy, imperial competition, the brutal
exigencies of colonialism and slave labor, beauty, the Eiffel Tower,
and ad infinitum, the agglomerate bubble of the modern tulip market
burbles to the surface.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As go tulips, so goes modernism. That is, its meaning is inseparable from
its uses and its overdeterminations. A relatively common stance amongst
those who would like to "make modernism new" leans away from the so-called
"high modernist canon," and tilts toward lesser known or even unknown
modernist artists to escape what appears to be the cul-de-sac of high
modernism. Exorcising the modernist canon posthumously, these critical
acts of purification disregard the modernist branding that, like Sherwin
Williams paint, covers everything, even criticism and critique. Those
nouveau modernist critics who wish to enlarge the modernist canon, so to
speak--and already the terms "modernist" and "canon" and "enlarge" beg
too many questions to address here--had better hope that the illusion of
a modernist or high modernist canon stays in place, to permit rebranding
along the edges of a very big tent.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another and to me better frame for the reappraisal of modernism I pluck
from the resonant, splendid critical opus of Ernst Bloch, resurrecting
a term he himself had borrowed, in both cases of borrowing to infuse
it anew. In the essays collected together as <I>The Utopian Function of
Artand Literature,</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
  Bloch cites "colportage," a real word that historically referred
  to the practice of travelling booksellers who crisscrossed Europe
  and elsewhere from the sixteenth to the early-twentieth centuries,
  selling novels, medical tracts, romances, scientific pamphlets,
  calendars, fairy tales, political documents, sermons, housewifery
  manuals, adventure tales, pornography, and prayer books at market
  fairs, from wagons, on the street, or house to house. Colporteurs,
  then--and the phrase unfortunately has nothing to do whatsoever with
  Cole Porter--in their meandering commercial travels gathered up,
  collected, and retailed the chaff and the wheat, the flotsam and the
  jetsam, the cream and the skim milk of published material of their
  moment. By means of colportage books and publications that belonged to
  completely different discourses, market niches, and even ontological
  levels were thrown together; in their array constituting more than
  the sum of their inventory. Cheek by jowl, their presence a matter
  of contingency as much as supply and demand, the colportage stocks
  taken as a whole offered, via commercial exchanges, an experience of
  "the <I>Novum,</I> the startlingly and unexpectedly new," (<I>UF,</I>
  xxxvii). The <I>Novum,</I> to follow through on Bloch's densely
  mystical yet materialist concept, is a concrete manifestation which
  orients people, even by way of monetary transactions, toward the wild
  horizon line of pre-illumination, or <I>Vorschein</I> (<I>UF,</I> 41,
  73-7). In Bloch's thought colportage becomes a philosophical,
  political, and aesthetic category simultaneously, and its place on
  the plane of analysis is similarly multiple--colportage is a process
  yet also a realization. Capable of referring to the plenum of genres
  and imaginative documents--including the ideologically dubious--set
  forth into the world by colportage, that is, colportage as both a verb
  and a noun, colportage is also a metacategory, a manner of regarding
  representation in its social, political, and aesthetic dimensions all at
  once. There is much that is reminiscent of Benjamin's notion of "profane
  illumination" in colportage, but Bloch applies no ideological litmus
  tests to the contents of colportage. The more Brechtian Benjamin of
  "The Work of Art in an Age of Mechanical Reproduction," for instance,
  evaluates the products of mass culture ideologically, and finds them
  wanting in all but future potential.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  Colportage in a Blochian sense occupies or engenders a site of
  anticipatory meaning. This vestibule of pre-illumination is neither
  the endlessly displaced abyss or black hole of meaning, as more
  recent post-structuralist thought would have it, nor, although
  it is dialectically informed, is colportage a form of negative
  dialectics. Theodor Adorno's crystalline rejection of shabby and
  impure genres, tainted with commerce, whereby true art must exist
  as the dark side of the cultural moon, makes him virtually the
  anticolporteur<I>.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I am inching toward an assertion that colportage, like the modernist
tulip market but less facetiously, is a remarkably helpful way to envision
the ductile "thing" we cart around from place to place, put on exhibit,
preach to and preach from, closing the doors upon certain display cases,
rearranging the merchandise within, colporteurs all. Modernism is as
baggy and capacious and eclectic as those motley wares of colportage,

<B></B>

gathered together because of historical contingency, circulated,
and sold. It is far more modernism's link to the <I>Vorschein,</I>
or anticipatory illumination, that makes the term apropos. Bloch would
probably have none of this conceit, as it runs the risk of including
"false illusion" or kitsch along with the colportage; as he wrote,
"the dream of colportage is: never again to be trapped by the routine
of daily life," (<I>UF,</I> 83). On the other hand, colportage gives me
a vivid conceptualization of and for modernism, especially as it is put
to use in cultural and academic circulation. Bloch's insistence on the
relevance of qualitative judgments within the precincts of colportage
and its often disdained genres, as in art generally, is an aspect of
his critical thought I am not willing to do without vis-&agrave;-vis
modernism. In many instances, the return to modernism as a site of study
and reconceptualization entails critical theories and assumptions where
value not only plays no role, but cannot be countenanced as anything other
than an invidious "distinction of taste," in Pierre Bourdieu's phrase.

  By other lights value smacks of a thinly veiled plot to reinstantiate
  hierarchy, elitism, or transhistorical, universal values. Bloch's
  thought, like Benjamin's and that of numerous others, points us to
  the fire escape exit from those egregious simplifications of "value"
  and aesthetics, the bonfire of the vanities. Bloch reorients criticism
  to values in time and of time. His privileged use of the word "now"
  (<I>Jetzt</I>) reveals the stakes of discriminating value as both
  "new" and "now":

The now [<I>Jetzt</I>] moves and propels itself through each day,
whenever. It knocks in all that happens, with its shortest time span,
and it knocks on the door. But not every present opens up for it. The
actual impulses, the socially driving pulses, do not knock in each
present fresh and vital. Not every time opens up for the now and the
next now that stands exactly at that moment in front of the door and
that has never "entered" before. It has not unloaded its true contents
with which and toward which it is on its way. [<I>UF</I>, 215]

Discriminations or judgments of value are being made all the time, and are
operative in every sphere, every genre, and at every level. Judgments of
value that spring from a colporteur's intellectual valise arise from a
mental economy of abundance, not scarcity, from a sense of the possible,
not measurement, and with an absolute lack of shame about expressions
of pleasure, emotion, and wonder. Bloch's colportage is predicated on
the unpredictable knock of the present on the door. More than that,
though, colportage contains a critical ethos of appreciation we can
best appreciate in textual performance. Colportage is thematized
and indeed enacted in Joyce's <I>Ulysses,</I> as in his other works,
with <I>Finnegans Wake</I> perhaps the most sustained spiritual act of
colportage ever attempted on behalf of a Europe plunging into war. Leaving
that to one side, one need only look at the encounters Joyce stages for
his characters within Dublin colportage circa 1904.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
  Leopold Bloom is the very re to whom Bloch might be referring
  in saying, "the age-old pleasure of people, in no way simple and
  no way decadent, is preserved in the fair, wanders within it and
  without," (<I>UF,</I> 182). Bloom is surely a re for the modern
  consumer--as is the entire cast of <I>Ulysses</I> and its readers
  too--yet his immersion in the artificially protracted colportage of
  Dublin's colonially-depressed economy transforms him into a species
  of colporteur<I>.</I> He shores its fragments

<B></B>

not against his ruins, but as a zone of fierce intellectual inquiry,
passionate political imaginings, and intense, pleasure-laden evaluation of
the most utopian sort. Colportage is bricolage to the third power: no mere
act of magpie borrowing and collection, colportage is materially invested,
rife with judgments of value that hinge on hope and transformation. Above
all, colportage is a site of the <I>Novum.</I> "Make it new" is a familiar
formalist credo to be found on modernist colportage's collapsible
shelves. The <I>Novum</I> or newness lying immanent in colportage,
however, is transformational, affective, collective, and interactive
illumination. It emanates not only from the work or artifact made new,
but from the rich possibilities for newness, for <I>Vorschein,</I> to be
found in the pages of its disparate volumes, many of them old, tattered,
and shop-worn. Bloom strolls into the bookstall to find himself pricked
by this sense of newness; the <I>Novum</I> knocks on his door.

When the shopman returns, replete with "oniony breath, phlegmy cough,
rawskinned bald spot" and all, Bloom has made his choice and holds it
up, numinous, before him. The shopman lifts rheumy eyes and intones:
"--<I>Sweets of Sin</I>, he said, tapping on it. That's a good one"
(<I>U,</I> 194).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
And in some odd way they are all "good ones." Modernism inevitably
contains its trash masterpieces, as it does its "classics." Bernard
Shaw made a similarly colportagist point when he insisted that people
require a steady diet of "trash" along with their masterpieces. The
colportage stall of modernism doesn't privilege a canon--for canons are,
after all, the illusory aftereffects of inclusion, not exclusion, where
canonicity produces more works, rather than fewer--but it certainly
makes distinctions, ever shifting, about which works it makes sense
to envision in relation to one another, which works give off sparks
of elective affinity, which works look different given what rests on
the shelf above or below them. The high/low distinction crumbles away,
and with it the need to tidy the wagon or purge the bookstall. This is a
modernism in and of the market, but clearly colportage as a historical
social practice involves buying and selling within a complex niche or
facet of "the" market, a niche sedimented with earlier practices such
as barter, coffeehouse information exchange, and clandestine or "black
market" elements built in. If possible, imagine modernism's brand name
as if it were a plaque or blazon or handpainted sign on a colportage
wagon, booth, or stall, a brand reprinted on all the contents of this
unclassified and unclassifiable collection.

Yet the harrowing, dystopian exigencies of colportage are on display
in <I>Ulysses.</I> As much as the colportage bookstall is capable of
cracking open the golden bowl of the

<B></B>

now, so too the fissures of class and gender and race and colonial
status striate its space. Stephen and his sister, Dilly Dedalus,
chance to meet at a bookcart, where each has headed for a private
quaff of colportering. Stephen's eye passes over assorted titles:
"Tattered pages. <I>The Irish Beekeeper.Lifeand Miracles of the Cure of
Ars.Pocket Guide to Killarney.</I>" Too mixed and motley for Stephen's
interest to be piqued--although as the titles of real books, they are
colportage squared by virtue of their hidden significance to the text
in progress--and too reminiscent of the three masters he must disavow,
his sister Dilly's book choice, a "one-pence Chardenal's French primer,"
is for her the <I>Novum</I> incarnate. "Is it any good?" she poignantly
asks the brother who is newly returned from a Paris she is unlikely ever
to see (<I>U,</I> 199-200).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the whirling dervish of a chapter, "Circe," where all that has passed
is recapitulated before a reader's eyes, Bloom is temporarily elevated to
the highest position of civil and spiritual authority. After he declares
"the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future," his bodyguards
practice colportage as miracle by distributing not only the obligatory
free loaves and fishes, but also "cheap reprints of the <I>World's Twelve
Worst Books</I>" (<I>U,</I> 395), each of which echoes a chapter of
the book: "<I>Froggy &amp; Fritz</I> (politic), <I>Care of the Baby</I>
(Infantilic), <I>50 Meals for 7 &amp; 6</I> (culinic), <I>Was Jesus a
Sun Myth?</I> (historic), <I>Expel that Pain</I> (medic), <I>Infant's
Compendium of the Universe</I> (cosmic), <I>Let's All Chortle</I>
(hilaric), <I>Canvasser's Vade Mecum</I> (journalic), <I>Loveletters
of Mother Assistant</I> (erotic), <I>Who's Who in Space</I> (astric),
<I>Songs that Reached our Heart</I> (melodic), <I>Pennywise's Way to
Wealth</I> (parsimonic)" (<I>U,</I> 396).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The colportage modernism I am trying to articulate puts a premium on
both intention and reception--on value as an affective and a cognitive
judgment intertwined with pleasure, hope, and politics--and on the
diacritical relation between and among artifacts of modernism, in their
moment and ours. A few years back I could never have written the word
"intention" as anything but a critical epithet, and even now I invoke
it neither Hirschianly nor in Benn Michaels-ese, that is, in the voices
of two critics who made intentionality a platform of antitheoretical
textual analysis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
  Intention in my critical playbook doesn't refer to a mythical inner
  intention on the part of an author to give a specific meaning to a work
  overall, or any of its parts, a meaning affixed there like authorial
  crazy-glue. Instead, I'm trying to offer intention as a dialectical
  relationship, a way of capturing conceptually the agency involved in
  tilting a work or an artifact or a critical text toward the social,
  political, aesthetic, affective, cognitive, and cultural context of
  its reception. For example, by this definition of intention Joyce
  <I>intends</I> that <I>Ulysses</I> offer an analogous version of the
  bookstall placed within its chapters, so that as readers hold the book
  in their hands they are inevitably repeating the distracted colportage
  encountered in the text, sometimes literalized as in Stephen and
  Dilly and Bloom's bookstall moments, sometimes traceable only in
  the colportage whiffs given off by <I>Ulysses</I>'s language. Its
  collection of styles, quotations, allusions, data, historical fact,
  and transgressions animate the <I>Novum.</I> Bloom's daily sojourns
  in the bookstall stage the possible, premonitory appearance of the
  new--a hope held out by the collision of his curiosity, yearning,
  and intense enthusiasm for change with an ideal constellation of books
  for sale that day, capable of allowing the present to knock upon the

<B></B>

door. Modernist writers such as Joyce don't intend a single meaning
or message, but do intend for their work to be received and consumed
in dialectical relation to surrounding works, discourses, events,
experiences, and so on--they intend the <I>slant</I> to the message,
if you will. Resistance or transgression--our critical <I>b&ecirc;te
blanches</I> these days--do not then lie in subtexts or hidden messages
under the surface, nor even in the self-unraveling of language languaging:
it's less a question of subverting a putatively hegemonic language,
than of exposing more of the material surface of the new in order for
the now to knock on the door. Modernism is colportage, then, but not
all modernists are colporteurs<I>,</I> not by a long shot.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The sounds of gunfire attend the final critical example I add to the
string of modernist allegories and conceits. Insurgent modernism is a
shelf of the modernist <I>colportagere,</I> to coin a word, an intent
within a work to push the <I>Novum</I> of awareness it entails to the
foreground. I've echoed John Reed's classic book, <I>Insurgent Mexico,</I>
in proposing yet another metonymy for modernism; the final re for
exploration of modernism's bubble then and now arises from a relatively
unknown modernist cinema, created along the U.S./Mexican border during
the Mexican revolution against Porfirio D&iacute;az and the U.S. military
who aided his regime.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
  This cinema was produced in a meteoric arc by one Romaine Fielding,
  an actor and film director who as a star was associated with the Lubin
  Film Company, headed by Sigmund "Pop" Lubin, in Philadelphia. There
  was nothing obscure about either Lubin Films or Romaine Fielding in
  the silent picture era of 1910-5, prior to Hollywood dominance,
  when film companies roamed from Astoria, Queens to Philadelphia,
  to Arizona and the New Mexico territory and on to California; even
  D. W. Griffith's Biograph Film company made two films in a one-week
  stay in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1911.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
  Romaine Fielding, whose self-authored biography claimed an exotic
  Corsican birth and a link to Napoleon, was actually William Blandin
  of Riceville, Iowa. His huge popularity in the U.S., Europe, and
  Latin America and Mexico--for early film genuinely represented the
  international modernism of Raymond Williams's analysis--was demonstrated
  by his being chosen as the "world's most popular player" in the 1911
  <I>Motion PictureStory Magazine.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
  He won by several million votes over such still-resonant names as
  Mary Pickford, Blanche Sweet, Pearl White, and Francis X. Bushman
  (<I>NMH,</I> 7). A consummate actor, Fielding was a tyro of writing and
  direction as well, and left the Lubin company temporarily to set up a
  film studio in Silver City, New Mexico. His intent was to make films in
  express sympathy with the Mexican revolution and its key res, Pancho
  Villa and Emiliano Zap&aacute;ta, as well as pro-labor films supporting
  unionization of mine workers, both involving the unprecedented use
  of mixed Mexican, Chicano, and Anglo-American casts (<I>NMH,</I>
  9). It now seems inconceivable that a film star and director of such
  widespread popularity in the U.S. and abroad could flaunt these
  pro-labor and antimilitarist stances in his insurgent modernist
  cinema, and moreover gain popularity as a result. Understanding the
  Fielding moment in modernism entails moving beyond a high/low split
  mentality, acknowledging intent on the part of its auteur, recognizing
  the popularity, pleasure, and spectacle inherent in this everyday
  modernism, whose achievement could not have occurred outside a branded,
  mass modernism without a shred of aesthetic autonomy.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The excitement about Fielding and his enterprise ran so high that the
<I>Albuquerque Journal</I> wrote hundreds of adulatory pieces covering
his work in Silver City, where he essentially commandeered the town,
titling one such dispatch, "Romaine Fielding: A Revolution of Human Energy
and Endurance" (<I>NMH,</I> 6). Among his oeuvre are films made in Santa
Rita, New Mexico at the Chino Copper Mine, exposing the grotesque labor
exploitation there, and inventing and celebrating a celluloid strike
which became real later in the year when the actual copper miners
followed cinematic suit. The audiences for these regionally-filmed
and highly insurrectionary pictures were by no means merely local, or
Southwestern--the films were circulated up and down the East Coast, and
played to transfixed audiences in Sweden, Belgium, Ireland, and Spain,
among other countries and colonies. Fielding titled one film centering
on the struggle of the Mexican peasantry <I>Los Insurrectos</I>; he
brought Mexican and Mexican-American actors and extras by the hundreds
to small-town or ghost-town sites for vividly recreated skirmishes
bursting with fire, explosions, and horses galore. The city fathers in
Albuquerque, New Mexico's largest city, were so far from scandalized
over this affront to U.S. government policy vis-&agrave;-vis Mexico and
the labor unions--the cavalry and big capital were both called out--that
they begged Fielding to relocate his fledgling studio there. But this
radical municipal glory was not to be (<I>NMH,</I> 8). When Fielding
left the Lubin Company to found Cactus Film Company, his fame faded and
his company folded within a few years. On the whole, like W. C. Fields,
he'd rather have been in Philadelphia.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Fielding's work endures, as does the historical record of its
reception. His intention for these dazzlingly innovative movies--filming
"on location," inventing special demolition effects--was to show what
he called the "romance" of revolution and insurgency, to take the
"Cowboy and Indian picture" and make it newly political (<I>NMH,</I>
12). To reach this goal, Fielding relied on a realism more exacting than
his contemporaries were able to command: to enable his insurgent cinema
v&eacute;rit&eacute; he was lavished with abandoned homes to blow up,
sought after by eager extras and would-be desert starlets, gifted with
derelict mine shafts and weary horses by a starstruck citizenry. Some may
call this realism, not modernism, but I see it as modernist colportage,
that is, the melding of genres and styles--documentary, reportage,
romance, melodrama, westerns, adventure, political propaganda, etc.--to
arouse emotional and intellectual intensity, and above all pleasure and
wonder, in the spectacle of political transformation. Romaine Fielding
of Riceville, Iowa is a vanished colporteur in modernism's colportage
legacy. To recognize the existence of a vibrant and popular modernist
cinema with an ideological and aesthetic twist that doesn't fit the
dimensions of modernism's straitjacket is to recognize the limitations
of our grasp of modernism and its possibilities, in its own time and ours.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We can rebrand modernism, or various modernisms, but we cannot recapture
the <I>Novum</I> of particular texts, whether visual or verbal or
auditory or choric, nor of politics, performances, movements, manifestos,
and events, in the absence of modernist appreciation. Appreciation
(read: valuing) has even less critical cachet and credibility than does
intention, and for good reason--any return to literary appreciation or impressionist 

<B></B>

criticism or, God help us, to belletrism, would be a
critical and theoretical disaster. But without passionate appreciation in
the market sense critics and scholars cannot make the necessary rebranding
of modernism anything more than an exercise. We have more than a little
in common collectively with the Royal National Tulip Society; we are
closer to the rheumy-eyed, onion-breathed bookstall colporteur<I>,</I>
muttering "that's a good one," than we may wish to admit; we stand in
lieu of Clarissa Dalloway directing others to "look" at modernist tulip
beds; like Romaine Fielding, even our demolition jobs must be done
with passionate intensity and spectacular flamboyance. Finding value
prompts appreciation--that sentence can be read in an economic way and
in a literary sense, yet is rarely taken as a speech act, an exhortation
to express enthusiasm. "Enthusiasm," William Blake enjoins us, "is the
all-in-all." Such enthusiastic appreciations of modernism can be (should
be) rigorous, historical, aesthetically incisive, and politically aware
all at once, yet without enthusiasm (even critique requires exuberance),
the critical acts that float modernism's speculative bubble in the
twenty-first century cannot permit us to experience modernism as a
"tiger's leap into the past."
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
  That is Benjamin's famous definition of fashion, yet it combines
  with Bloch's colportage to suggest something about leaps of critical
  enthusiasm: the tiger's leap is the same thing as opening the door
  upon hearing the knock of the now. We know that modernism and its
  myriad works did not redeem the world in the ways we would wish, and
  the impulse to reach back into the past of modernism and imagine that
  a re-branding act of criticism can change that is understandable, yet
  deluded. Like an eccentric sect that must rather embarrassingly go on
  about its daily business after its leader has misjudged the End of Days,
  we have to recognize that things are as they are. This is tautological,
  and yet also extraordinary.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Did modernism, of so many tulip stripes and shades, then fail? Is
the critical act of floating modernism's bubble a doomed or tainted
enterprise? No, and no, yet not in thunder. Echoing Wittgenstein as this
essay also began, "the world is everything that is the case."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
  Modernism is and was the case in the world experiment, which in
  Bloch's critical humanism we are always embarked upon, the "world
  experiment" being the shared need to first recognize, and then change,
  the world. The modernist bubble of our speculations, set aloft by
  our appreciations as by our depreciations alike, enlarges the surface
  of what has been and might be the case, allowing modernism into our
  moment's world experiment, making modernism anew. In retailing modernism
  this way, we don't risk selling out--the only danger lies in failing
  to appreciate and give value, and thereby selling modernism short.
