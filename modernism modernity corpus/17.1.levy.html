<p>"There can be, I believe, such a thing as a dominant art form," Clement Greenberg declares, in his 1940 manifesto, "Towards a Newer Laocoon," and "this," he adds, "was what literature had become in Europe by the 17<sup>th</sup> century."<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> His declaration itself purports to herald the moment when, after a struggle, recent enough that its violence can still be sensed, "the arts lie safe now, each within its 'legitimate' boundaries" and the visual arts can be seen to have displaced literature from the dominant position. The tone of confidence in which Greenberg pronounces "painting" the victor in this long cultural war suggests that he himself is an old campaigner, although in fact this was not at all the case. The authority of the writing in "Laocoon" and its companionpiece of the previous year, "Avant-Garde and Kitsch," tends to make one forget that before these essays instantly established the thirty-year-old Greenberg as a force to be reckoned with in the American art world, he had published only one review and a couple of short stories. Moreover, while he had a certain talent for sketching and a belief that an interest in the visual arts was part of the equipment of a person of culture, Greenberg's ambitions up to that point had been focused on the world of literature. Above all, he wanted to be known as a poet. The prospect of the publication of "Avant-Garde and Kitsch" "irks me," he writes to a friend in early 1939, the worry being "that if once they get the idea into their heads that I'm a critic, they'll decide—they're like that—that I'm not a poet no matter how good my poetry may be."<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> And yet, although he repeats this worry in subsequent letters over the course of the next year, by  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> year's end this never-to-be-published poet and soon-to-be-famous art critic will declare literature a thing of the past.</p>
<p>From the point of view of the present cultural moment, when the dominance of the image over the word goes virtually without question, Greenberg's rapid shift of allegiance from poetry to painting may seem hardly worth remarking on. In 1939, however, the choice required a breathtaking leap of imagination. "I'm trying to contain an excitement," Greenberg confessed to his friend shortly after expressing the worry that his criticism might overshadow his poetry. Having "borrowed paints from a girl," he has tried painting for the first time, and "the colors came just right, flowed smooth from my conceiving eye." The quasi-sexual pleasure Greenberg derives from this experience has peculiar implications for his sense of vocation. "[T]he instinct to draw is as deep in me as the instinct to fuck," he concludes, and "[w]hen I believe that, I believe I'm important and look at myself in the mirror with respect. Whereas with poetry—there's no instinct involved … It's all ambition and the need to create something detached and objective. Poetry is public. Drawing and fucking are private" . Heretofore Greenberg has associated "ambition," the urge to dominate, with "poetry," while "drawing," which we may take as shorthand for his investment in visual art in general, has seemed to him a merely "private" indulgence. Suddenly, however, he sees in "drawing" a means of establishing his importance: in other words, the impending publication of his first significant piece of writing suggests to him that he may dominate in the world of visual art as he could not in the world of poetry. Nonetheless, until the very moment when this career path opened up to him, Greenberg saw the way of poetry as the way of power.</p>
<p>"There can be such a thing as a dominant art form." In this essay, I will try to unpack this seemingly self-evident yet in some ways mysterious claim, to ask what significance the question of the relative order of dominance among the arts may have held for Greenberg and his readers in 1940, and what significance it might still hold for us now. To address these questions, however, we must not only look forward from 1940 but also back, toward a moment when poetry could seem more "public," more culturally central, than "drawing" to a young man driven to succeed. Born in 1909, Greenberg came of age in the period of "high modernism"—a designation used largely by literary historians, for whom modernism proper ends with the 1929 stock market crash, or at the latest, with the onset of World War II. The era of "mid-century modernism" (a phrase originally coined by furniture dealers) that followed was dominated, as Greenberg predicted, by the visual arts; in this period, the modernist aesthetic that had become a thing of the past where poetry was concerned continued to refine itself in painting. Before 1940, then, we have the Age of Eliot, and after, the Age of Pollock. I discuss below the crucial influence of Eliot on Greenberg, and to a degree my argument is structured by these paired res, at once polar opposites, as different as poetry and painting, and mirror images, the reigning critical mandarins of the two eras of modernism. But it is precisely because both Eliot and Greenberg ended up on the side of the victors in the struggle for dominance between the arts that another voice is required to tell the story of this conflict. For this change of perspective, I turn to the "miraculous poet," as Greenberg  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> called her, Marianne Moore.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> This is not to say that Moore ended up on the side of the losers; rather, for the purposes of this argument, Moore's usefulness lies in her talent for placing herself neither in a determinate position of weakness nor one of strength, but at the point where power can be seen to shift from one side to another.</p>
<p>While Moore's talent for grasping the dialectical moment was in part a matter of temperament, it was sharpened by her response to facts on the ground. Having come to New York to pursue her writing career, Moore found herself attracted to the world of the visual arts, when painting was still the weaker party in the conflict between word and image<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup>; yet at the same moment, she was on her way to attaining canonical status among the high moderns. However, the universal endorsement of her poetic peers—she was the only one of their contemporaries equally admired by Eliot, Pound, Stevens, and Williams—could not dispel the stigma of gender. Insofar as a woman was always by definition the weaker party, Moore would hold her place among the dominant practitioners of the dominant art form on sufferance. As Eliot put it in a 1923 review, Moore's poetry "is as 'feminine' as Christina Rossetti's, one never forgets that it is written by a woman; but with both one never thinks of this particularity as anything but a positive virtue."<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> To be "feminine" is a liability, except when those in authority decree that it is not; yet to do so is as much as to declare the value of femininity to be not fixed but labile. The ambiguity of Moore's situation vis-à-vis her male peers was for her at once a source of pain, and of creative energy, since the fulcrum of gender served as her primary model of the contingent and unstable character of hierarchical structures. Indeed, when such structures are called into question, it seems hard to avoid the subject of gender—Greenberg may have "borrowed paints from a girl," but in his hands, what up to that point had seemed a relatively weak medium would become an instrument of power.</p>
<p>The unstable balance of power between relatively weak and relatively strong media is the topic of a 1927 "Comment" written by Moore for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dial</span> magazine, of which she was then editor. Like Greenberg in his "Laocoon," Moore here depicts the relationship between the world of literature and the world of visual art as tense and competitive. However, from the perspective of 1927, it is the literary, or as Moore terms it, "academic" side that is in a position to set the terms of the debate with the opposite camp, whose somewhat ragtag forces are led by "that sometimes disparaged, most powerful" entity, "the museum.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Academic feeling, or prejudice possibly, in favor of continuity and completeness is opposed to miscellany—to music programs, composite picture exhibitions, newspapers, magazines and anthologies. Any zoo, aquarium, library, garden or volume of letters, however, is an anthology and certain of these selected findings are highly satisfactory. The science of assorting and the art of investing an assortment with dignity are obviously not being neglected, as is manifest in "exhibitions and sales of artistic property," and in that sometimes disparaged, most powerful phase of the anthology, the museum.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Through tone and emphasis the poet makes it clear that her sympathy is with the "disparaged" as against that "academic feeling" that lords it over other arts both high and low. With characteristic indirectness, though, she leaves us to wonder from what cultural quarter this apparently disembodied "feeling" might emanate.</p>
<p>An obvious place to turn for an answer to this question would be Eliot's 1919 essay "Tradition and the Individual Talent," the source of the most influential expression of a "feeling … in favor of continuity and completeness" in the literature of modernism.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> In Eliot's words, the modern writer who possesses "the historical sense" must have "a feeling that the whole of the literature of Europe from Homer and within it the whole of the literature of his own country has a simultaneous existence and composes a simultaneous order." Although "the supervention of novelty" will necessarily change this ideal order, it cannot seriously breach it; rather, things are "ever so slightly, altered," "readjusted," "modified," until "conformity between the old and the new" is restored (38–9). Eliot was not an academic by profession when he stressed the essential continuity between literary modernism and literary tradition. Nevertheless, the "traditionalist" Eliot is often given the lion's share of the credit, or blame, both for academicizing literary modernism and for modernizing the literary academy. Hence William Carlos Williams could view the advent of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>  as "the great catastrophe to our letters" because it "gave the poem back to the academics."<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> More recently, such critics as John Guillory, Langdon Hammer, and Gail McDonald have portrayed an Eliot singularly endowed with the power to conjure that aspect of the modern university that its constituents have come to call "the academy" into being.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> "That is," explains Hammer, "Eliot's power to project 'tradition' <span style="font-style:italic;">as an imaginary institution</span> made it an important tool for those engaged in the construction of a real one" (10; his emphasis).</p>
<p>In the years just before Eliot "gave the poem back to the academics," however, Williams had imagined a different future for literary modernism, one whose agenda was set by painters rather than poets. "Painting took the lead," according to Williams, around the time of the 1913 Armory show in New York, and those who followed that lead had the sense that the traditional order of things had indeed been breached. "Here was my chance," Williams later recalled, "that was all I knew. There had been a break somewhere, we were streaming through" . In Williams's story, the "conformity between old and new" is violently ruptured, and through the "break" streams a "we" previously excluded from a tradition that had been presumed complete and continuous. Like Moore, Williams sets the force of the visual arts against a powerfully resistant "academic feeling," but whereas for him, painting represents an anti-institutional impulse <span style="font-style:italic;">tout court</span>, for her, the impulsive turn away from the literary academy is a moment in a dialectic. Where Williams sees a rebellion of the oppressed against a monolithic authority, Moore sees a struggle for power between two institutions, one of which is in a position to exercise prejudice while the other must suffer disparagement. Or to be more precise, one is "possibly" prejudiced while the other is "sometimes" disparaged; Moore's modifiers suggest that the relative positions of the academy and the museum may be subject to change. It is just such a reversal in the relative positions of the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> prejudiced and the disparaged that Greenberg marks in "Towards a Newer Laocoon," the essay on the fate of visual modernism that is perhaps most comparable in influence to "Traditional and the Individual Talent" in its situating of literary modernism. Nonetheless, we recall that Greenberg is writing just twenty years after "Tradition and the Individual Talent" when he remarks that "We ourselves, even today, are too close to literature to appreciate its status as a dominant art" . The very thought of literature's too recent dominance presses so close on Greenberg that it produces a kind of blind spot in his writing. That is to say, he is blind to the possibility that his manifesto may (like Moore's <span style="font-style:italic;">Comment</span>) reflect a moment of transition rather than one of retrospect. By 1940, in other words, the question of which art is to be dominant may not yet have been settled.</p>
<p>If we do take this question to have remained an open one during the interwar years, it seems especially significant that as late as 1950, Greenberg himself is still presenting Eliot's early essays as his model for the sort of criticism which aims to demonstrate "that the prime fact about a work of … art is not what it <span style="font-style:italic;">means</span> but what it <span style="font-style:italic;">does</span>—how it works, how successfully it works, as art."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> It is a short step from this Eliotic credo to Greenberg's famous description of the modernist artist's proper task as "the use of the characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself—not in order to subvert it, but to entrench it more firmly in its area of competence."<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> T. J. Clark, then, was being precise as well as witty when he labeled Greenberg an "Eliotic Trotskyist"; the man whom Greenberg called "a 'pure' literary critic" may be said to have laid the groundwork for the later writer's purist critique of modern art.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Just as Greenberg's "Laocoon" may be read, as he says, as "an historical apology for abstract art," so Eliot's "Tradition" may be read as an historical apology for modernist poetry. Moreover, in the postwar art world, Greenberg's power to project his version of aesthetic history "<span style="font-style:italic;">as an imaginary institution</span>" has had, as in Eliot's case, an impact incommensurate with its author's actual position—again like Eliot, he was a freelancer whose critical reputation rests on a handful of essays. Yet despite these writers' marginal relationship to the "most powerful phases" of the institutions of art, both Greenberg's version of the history of visual modernism and Eliot's version of the history of literary modernism have become in some sense the "official" versions with which one must reckon. If Greenberg is right, that "there can be such a thing as a dominant art form," then the similarities between these two simultaneously marginal and authoritative res may be not a matter of coincidence; not entirely a matter, even, of influence. Rather, Eliot and Greenberg may be said to occupy virtually the <span style="font-style:italic;">same</span> position vis-à-vis the dominant institution of art, exchanging places as the visual arts (eventually) gain ascendance over literature in the course of the twentieth century.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Although this position is manifestly one of authority, it is always latently unstable; even as Eliot asserts that the "ideal order of existing monuments" has been re-established, or Greenberg assures us that "the arts lie safe now," we can feel the ground shaking under their feet. Outsiders posing as insiders, radicals in conservatives' clothing, the source of Eliot's and Greenberg's authority is their ambivalence about that authority, an ambivalence which is all the more powerful for being held in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> check. Moore, by contrast, is <span style="font-style:italic;">openly</span> wary of the kind of cultural authority that wears the face of "prejudice." When she declines to identify fully with either the academy or the museum, instead casting her lot with the originally literary but now institutionally homeless art form that she calls "the anthology," she betrays her ambivalence about the will to dominate that Greenberg attributes to art forms, and that she discovers in art institutions. The cultural place that Moore imagines herself occupying is not, however, so much extra-institutional as it is inter-institutional: it is a position that marks a point of tension between the two dominant institutions of modernism.</p>
<p>The position occupied successively by Eliot and Greenberg enables them to serve as guarantors, however ambivalent, of what they would call the order or safety of their chosen arts. It is less clear what power, if any, might accrue to Moore in virtue of her situation in a place of open conflict between poetry and painting. Before I can approach this question, though, I must ask again: what are the stakes of this inter-institutional conflict? Why should it matter that there can be such a thing as a dominant art form? One critic who might say that the Greenbergian question of dominance does <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> matter is Peter Bürger, whose use of the phrase "art as an institution" in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Theory of the Avant-Garde</span> has provided an impetus toward what we may call the "institutional turn" in the recent discourse of the arts.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> The word "institution" lately has come to signal an author's interest in a certain sort of materialist analysis of art.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> However, while Bürger himself claims in <span style="font-style:italic;">Theory</span> that "the concept of 'art as an institution' as used here refers to the productive and distributive apparatus and also to the ideas about art that prevail at a given time and that determine the reception of works," his focus is less on material apparatus than on ideology. Thus, <span style="font-style:italic;">Theory</span> is largely devoted to a discussion of what Bürger identifies as the dominant aesthetic ideology of our time, which asserts "the status of art in bourgeois society as defined by the concept of autonomy" ; in other words, it is a version of the argument about the role of art in modernity known as the "autonomy critique." This argument, whose <span style="font-style:italic;">locus classicus</span> is the writing of Theodor Adorno, is itself ambivalent.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> On one hand, it is a critique <span style="font-style:italic;">of</span> art for its retreat to a sphere apart from the wider social world, with a consequent loss of social effectivity; on the other, it guards the ground thus gained <span style="font-style:italic;">by</span> art from which to launch a disinterested critique of a social world otherwise ruled by instrumental rationality. Bürger notes the Janus-faced character of the critique, but ultimately lays emphasis on its binding force; since <span style="font-style:italic;">all</span> art in modernity is autonomous in Adorno's sense, there can be only a single institution of art.</p>
<p>When Greenberg puts forward his own version of the autonomy critique in "Towards a Newer Laocoon," he initially does so in the name of a unitary institution of art, "the avant-garde," which for him is merely another term for modernism. "The task of the avant-garde," in Greenberg's formulation, "is to perform in opposition to bourgeois society the function of finding new and adequate cultural forms for the expression of the same society, without at the same time succumbing to its ideological divisions and its refusal to permit the arts to be their own justification." However, no sooner has he offered this general prescription for avant-garde art practice, than Greenberg departs from the Adornian version of autonomy critique, proceeding to identify art's  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> struggle against society with the interartistic struggle between literature and painting. As Greenberg tells it, this identification was effected when "[a]s the first and most important item upon its agenda, the avant-garde saw the necessity of an escape from ideas, which were infecting the arts with the ideological struggles of society. Ideas came to mean subject matter in general." At this point, then, painting, which had been "the chief victim of literature," emerged as the prime candidate to lead "a revolt against the dominance of literature, which was subject matter at its most oppressive" . Thus, in Greenberg's account, modern art's ambivalence about its separation from society at large takes the allegorical form of a conflict between literature and painting, between a critique that can't help but enter into the lists of "ideological struggle," and an apparently self-justifying practice whose "opposition to bourgeois society" can never announce itself as such.</p>
<p>Greenberg's own ambivalence about modernist art's autonomous character is evident in essays such as the early "Avant-Garde and Kitsch"  and the later "Plight of Culture" . In the former, he takes an explicitly Marxist stance, stressing the paradoxical relation of the avant-garde to "the ruling class of that society from which it assumed itself to be cut off but to which it has always remained attached by an umbilical cord of gold" (CE 1, 10–11). In the latter, a review of Eliot's <span style="font-style:italic;">Notes Toward the Definition of Culture</span>, postwar prosperity tempts Greenberg to imagine a capitalist utopia in which, "as Marx predicted, though not quite in the way he hoped," it might be possible "to repair the estrangement between work and culture, or rather between interested and disinterested ends."<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> However, the overarching narrative of Greenberg's criticism tells of his commitment to Kantian disinterestedness in place of politically "interested" critique. Greenberg presents such commitment as an heroic sacrifice in his memoir of "The Late Thirties in New York," vowing that "some day it will have to be told how 'anti-Stalinism,' which started out more or less as 'Trotskyism,' turned into art for art's sake, and thereby cleared the way, heroically, for what was to come."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> What was to come, of course, was the rigorous Greenbergian version of art for art's sake, in which the arts "have been hunted back to their mediums, and there … have been isolated, concentrated and refined" (CE 1, 32). That medium-focused artistic purism would serve as the prevailing orthodoxy in the field of the visual arts throughout the period of the mid-century: in her monumental study of the critic's "transformation from a proper name to a dispersed critical function," Caroline Jones terms this state of affairs "the Greenberg effect."<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>The exorcism of "literature" as a threat to art's autonomy makes sense, then, in the context of the Eliotic Trotskyist's career-long struggle to frame art criticism as a self-justifying enterprise. The Eliotic acolyte's choice to forego literature's established prestige for a riskier investment in a rising art form is conflated with the Trotskyist apostate's choice to forego political subversion for an aesthetic entrenchment that is part alienated withdrawal, part strategic retreat. The consequences of these choices were not merely personal: for the field of art history, a relative latecomer to the fold of the humanistic disciplines, Greenberg's equation of painting with artistic autonomy <span style="font-style:italic;">tout court</span> offered much-needed legitimacy.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> For anyone outside the art historical  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> discipline, however, the question remains: what are the stakes of the conflict between "literature" and "painting"?</p>
<p>Yet another way to pose this question might be to ask, if "literature" and "painting" are indeed allegorical res, what are they res for? In Greenberg's "Laocoon," the two terms stand for two artistic styles, one explicit and one hermetic relative to modernist art's "function of finding new and adequate forms for the expression of [bourgeois] society." In Eliot's "Tradition," "literature" stands alone as the representative of modernism's "ideal order," i.e. its ideology, internally consistent and self-reproducing. In Moore's <span style="font-style:italic;">Comment</span>, the opposed terms tend to take the form of institutions, although her "academic feeling" and "museum" may also be said to function as what Hammer calls "imaginary institutions." That is, "the academy" and "the museum" on one hand designate actually-existing physical plants and the social groups assembled there, and on the other, the ideologies which simultaneously reflect and shape these social formations. Insofar as such formations both require and reproduce their proper ideological justifications, they are all "imaginary institutions," junctions of the real and the ideal. However, insofar as artistic institutions seem to be not merely relatively autonomous, like other institutions—like "any zoo, aquarium, library, garden or volume of letters," as Moore says—but absolutely autonomous, they may be said to be imaginary institutions <span style="font-style:italic;">par excellence</span>, symbols of the possibility of the detachment of disinterested from interested ends. Bürger claims just such a status for "art as an institution" in an essay written after <span style="font-style:italic;">Theory of the Avant-Garde</span> that revisits and partly revises that book's theme. "Autonomous art in bourgeois society," he writes, "can relate <span style="font-style:italic;">only negatively</span> to the material conditions of its production, since the autonomy of art was constituted initially in opposition to the realm of instrumental reason"<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> (my emphasis).</p>
<p>As Greenberg's "umbilical cord of gold" reminds us, though, opposition in theory does not rule out connection in practice. Moreover, even without reference to the golden last instance of art's material base we can hardly fail to see how the material conditions of production shape artworks and artistic careers. William Carlos Williams and a contemporary M.F.A. student may both produce autonomous art in bourgeois society, yet they inhabit significantly different imaginary institutions, and these institutional differences have consequences for the texture of their poetry. Style, ideology, and material apparatus cannot be completely detached from one another, any more than art as such can "relate only negatively" to society in performing "the function of finding new and adequate cultural forms for the expression of the same society." If art performs a function for society, then it must relate positively to that society in some sense. The paradox of modernist art, of course, is that society needs this art to seem to have no social function; <span style="font-style:italic;">something</span>, a voice within our heads insists, must escape determination by material conditions of production that have become synonymous with "the realm of instrumental reason." However, the compulsion Greenberg feels to purge modernist art of "literature," an art that looked pure enough for Eliot, suggests that modernism may never be autonomous enough, and thus may never be secure in the position to which it has been relegated. While modernist art as such may symbolize the possibility of disinterestedness, one art or another may have to represent art's failure to be sufficiently disinterested. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The purist may simply disregard the art that fails to meet his standards—Eliot was the only major American modernist poet <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> to register the challenge to his chosen art presented by painting—or he may try to cast it into outer darkness. Twenty years after "Towards a Newer Laocoon," we find Greenberg strenuously disavowing that "literature" had ever played a significant role in his argument about art's autonomy. Rather, he writes in "Modernist Painting," "[t]o achieve autonomy, painting has had above all to divest itself of everything it might share with sculpture, and it is in its effort to do this, and not so much—I repeat—to exclude the representational or literary, that painting has made itself abstract" (CE 4, 88). By contrast, the aesthete who situates herself between poetry and painting is likely to be drawn to impure, or as Moore terms them in her <span style="font-style:italic;">Comment</span>, "miscellaneous" forms. Such forms are not just stylistically impure; when Moore brackets "the museum" with "exhibitions and sales of artistic property," she hints that even this loftiest of institutions may bear the taint of extra-aesthetic interests. This suspicion comes to the fore in "When I Buy Pictures," one of Moore's many poems whose title begins a thought to be completed in the poem's opening lines, acquiring a twist in the process. Thus, the would-be collector of "When I Buy Pictures" hastens to add "or what is closer to the truth, / when I look at that of which I may regard myself as the imaginary possessor."<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> Interested and disinterested attitudes here are uneasily juxtaposed; the disinterested position may be "closer to the truth" as Moore conceives it, yet in the gap between the title and the caveat of the poem's first lines, she remains suspended between actual and imaginary possession.</p>
<p>Moore's poems are marked throughout by such mercurial shifts between opposed positions; and these shifts find a biographical counterpart in the poet's lifelong tendency to shuttle back and forth between the worlds of painting and literature in search of allies, outlets and examples. In a suggestive essay, Lisa Steinman contrasts "the more open group conversation" that Moore encountered in the art world when she first moved to New York, with the relatively closed literary establishment represented for the ambitious young poet by Eliot and Pound. However, Steinman also observes that Moore's entry into this "extraliterary culture" came at the risk of acceding to the "possessiveness" that was the byproduct of the art world's close association with "commercial culture," a risk of which Moore herself was highly cognizant.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> Thus, in the first lines of "New York," she speaks excitedly of the city as "the savage's romance/ accreted where we need the space for commerce," but by poem's end she is at pains to detach romance from commerce, insisting that what she loves about New York "is not the plunder/ but 'accessibility to experience'" (CP 54). What gives the poet the distance that she needs to make this crucial distinction is her foothold in the world of literature, whose relative detachment from economic interests brings it, like Moore as she recoils from the thought of actual possession, "closer to the truth," i.e. a disinterested stance. However, as with Moore's "academic feeling," this stance also has an element of hauteur. "Picking and Choosing," for example, begins, "Literature is a phase of life. If one is afraid of it,/ the situation is irremediable; if one approaches it familiarly,/ what one says of it is worthless" (CP 45). For the would-be adept, literature's pose of detachment also carries with it the potent threat of exclusion, just as the art world's "'accessibility to experience'" cannot be detached from its taste for "plunder." <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In Moore's life and work, then, the allegorical re of painting might be said to stand for openness and commerce, and that of poetry for detachment and exclusion. And as her <span style="font-style:italic;">Comment</span> suggests, the relationship between these art forms and their associated ideologies, on one hand, and society, on the other, is mediated by art institutions which for now we will call, with Moore, the museum and the academy. The opposed pairs of commerce and disinterestedness, openness and exclusion, may give us the beginnings of a sense of what is at stake in the struggle for dominance between poetry and painting; but to grasp why this struggle should matter to anyone outside the institution of art we must zero in on those points at which the museum and the academy are most closely linked to the wider society from which they seem to stand aloof. As Moore's unease about buying pictures and Greenberg's remark about the umbilical cord of gold indicate, the museum's most vulnerable point is its connection to what Steinman calls commercial culture. Indeed, the relationship in modernity between painting and what is more commonly called commodity culture has come to seem, if anything, <span style="font-style:italic;">too</span> immediate, while poetry's pose of detachment has made its worldly ties comparatively hard to discern. However, there is a critical literature, to which I have referred briefly in discussing Eliot and "academic feeling," which connects literary modernism to the development of the modern academy, and through that institution, to what has been termed "the culture of professionalism." In the remainder of this essay, I will retrace this connection, then return to the subject of the relationship between the visual artwork and the commodity, before trying, finally, more precisely to map the point of tension between the two cultures of modernism at which Moore found herself so uneasily placed.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>We have seen how, in "Tradition and the Individual Talent," Eliot manages simultaneously to expose the difficulties the modern poet encounters in establishing "conformity between the old and the new" and to assure us that they are being resolved even as we read. In a study of Eliot's career-shaping strategies, Louis Menand connects Eliot's successful handling of this artistic problem—how to deny even as you acknowledge that modernity represents a traumatic break with the past—with the success of the professionalist ideology which emerged in the mid-nineteenth century and came into its own in the twentieth.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Menand emphasizes the paradoxical character of professionalism, that it is an outgrowth of late capitalism, yet seems to go against its grain. At first glance, the professional has the look of a survival from an earlier era; he arrives on the modern scene bearing "the seal of traditional intellectuality," in the phrase of sociologist Magali Sarfatti Larson.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> Thus, to the extent that professionalism seeks to promote "traditional" values, or in Larson's words, "to the extent that it does not obey first to the profit motive, but seeks first to improve the <span style="font-style:italic;">quality</span> of life," its trend seems to run counter to the most disruptive tendencies of a capitalism that Larson, like Moore, terms "savage" . However, Larson also emphasizes the paradox of professionalism; that is, as she writes, although "[t]he regulation and organization of market-oriented practice in the professions that consolidated toward the turn of the century stood in contrast to the anarchy of commodity markets and of capitalist production" , nonetheless,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> "the professions' 'civilizing function' coexists, by definition, with a market orientation and is fused with it" . From one angle, the professions look like an anachronistic preserve of quality and communalism; from another, they appear as the cutting edge of standardization and corporatization. Menand describes the ways in which Eliot exploited this ambiguity to specifically literary ends, such that the poet acquired the newfound prestige of the professional (epitomized by Eliot himself, in his perennial banker's suit), while modernism took on the patina of "tradition."</p>
<p>The chief end of the professional and the poet alike is not to be left behind by the onrush of modernity, to establish a functional relation to a market-oriented society. The professional resembles the modernist artist in that the negative aspect of this relation, the "side that is turned away from the anarchy of open competition," which "fosters the values of continuity, autonomy and disinterestedness" (Menand 114), appears foremost: professionalism, like modernist art, seems to be most valuable to bourgeois society as a kind of utopian preserve of values otherwise threatened with extinction. Put somewhat more positively, by exercising a prejudice in favor of (historical) completeness and continuity, the professional and the Eliotic modernist may be said to provide a society still reeling from the shock of the new with an ideological bridge between one era and the next. Thus, just as all professionals, as Menand writes, could only "win a competitive advantage in the marketplace … by identifying [themselves] with a higher standard than self-interest" , so professionalizing modernists tended to conflate interested with disinterested ends. As Gail McDonald puts it in <span style="font-style:italic;">Learning to be Modern: Pound, Eliot and the American University</span>, Eliot and Pound "wanted … to reform poetry so as to re-establish its authority and to re-authorize poetry so as to reform civilization" . In theory, then, modernist poetry was to have a broadly "civilizing function." In practice, however—as the title of McDonald's study indicates—the "civilization" to be reformed by newly authoritative poet-critics in the mold of Pound and Eliot was increasingly confined to what David Lodge has jokingly but incisively called the "small world" of modern academia.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>As Lodge's phrase suggests, the "small world" of the postwar university is at once an autonomous enclave and a significant microcosm. It is significant insofar as the university, as an establisher of standards and provider of credentials, may be said to be <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> key institution in the culture of professionalism, "the hinge of the professional project" as Larson calls it; and it is autonomous insofar as it maintains its claim to be what I have called an imaginary institution <span style="font-style:italic;">par excellence</span>, a last bastion of genuine disinterestedness. Of course, the unworldly autonomy of the institution serves, to some degree at least, as the guarantee of its worldly significance; standards lose their authority if they are perceived to be entirely subservient to interested ends. The institution's need to affirm its autonomy thus came to converge with the literary modernist's need for an institutional base from which to re-establish his authority. Like Hammer, who invokes the special power of Eliot's "tradition," McDonald portrays this convergence as almost uncanny. "At the moment it was called for," she marvels, "Eliot materialized to explain why the humanistically educated were in an ideal position to make the study of literature a serious business and why that enterprise had important consequences  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> for civilization" . In other words, much as the university served as the practical guarantee of the professions' autonomy, so the humanities might serve as the ideological guarantee of the university's autonomy.</p>
<p>In the real institution built on Eliot's imaginary one, the privileged exemplum of the humanities' purity was poetry, which was conceived of as being to the least possible degree either economically or politically interested. As the well-known story goes, the appointed guardians of this purity were the New Critics. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Cultural Capital</span>, his indispensable anatomy of the modern literary academy, John Guillory evokes the apotheosis of New Criticism, in which "every poem becomes an image of the very institutional space in which it is read, a perfect mirror in the imaginary of that space, alerting the company of professional readers that the retreat of literary culture into the university can be understood as a kind of transcendence of the cultural conditions of modernity" (165–6). Although this conception of poetry's role has been repeatedly traced back to Eliot, it must be remembered that Eliot's actual relations with academic institutions were marked by an ambivalent push-and-pull. His uncertain attitude may be seen as a reflection of the fact that, in the era of high modernism, the question of whether or not literary study was indeed a "serious business" was still under debate. The enshrinement, or entombment, of poetry in the academy was left to Eliot's followers to accomplish, in the postwar period when a reformed and expanded university system became newly central to the culture as a whole. Perhaps it is because literary history so closely converges on institutional history in this period that mid-century poetry, unlike mid-century painting, is not generally spoken of as "modernist," but rather is defined in terms of its practitioners' relation to the academy, whether they were poet-professors like Allen Tate and John Berryman or self-declared outsiders like the Beats.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup></p>
<p>Poetry's shift away from modernism proper is registered by John Crowe Ransom in a 1965 tribute to Randall Jarrell, when he describes Jarrell as "a 'modern' poet, if we mean one that comes soon after Pound and Eliot."<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> Why the quotation marks around "modern"? An indirect explanation may be found in Ransom's claim that "Randall was professional both as a poet and as a teacher of poetry." Although Ransom himself intends "professional" as a term of high praise, he does so, he says, in despite of those "[c]ritics out in the world" who "tell us when the poet takes employment in the Academy he compromises his own poetic integrity" . And of course, it is poetic integrity, i.e. a purist devotion to maintaining what Ransom calls "that distinction which is peculiar and proper to poetry," that is the mark of the true modern . "The opposite of the professional, the enemy, is the man of mixed motives," wrote Eliot in 1918, adding, as a corollary, that "professionalism is hard work on style with singleness of purpose."<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> However, the "moderns" who followed in Eliot's wake experienced a tension between their poetic purism and their professional commitments; they were nothing if not "men of mixed motives." At the same time, the institution which defined both their careers and their oeuvres appeared increasingly self-contained, ever more a "small world" complete in itself. The clarity of the academy's outlines and the forcefulness of its claims to autonomy are reflected in both the number and the character of the institutional critiques it has spawned. Career studies like Menand's and Hammer's, broader analyses  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> like McDonald's and Guillory's, historical overviews like Gerald Graff's <span style="font-style:italic;">Professing Literature</span>, and the still-flourishing genre of the "academic novel" are all bound together by the assumption that "the academy," like the New Critical poem, is a more or less stable and self-reflexive object, conducive to endless interpretation.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup></p>
<p>The museum, like the academy, is self-enclosed and self-referential, and radiates an authority that derives at once from its huge accumulations of cultural capital and from its claim to be a uniquely disinterested custodian of these spoils. Many artists and art theorists have been drawn, like Moore, to this authority, and have made "the museum" shorthand for the institution of visual art.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> However, while museums may be, as Carol Duncan writes, "the supreme spaces of the high-art world," they do not define that world's limits. Duncan herself offers this definition of visual art as an institution.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>That world can be described in many ways—as a magnet for creative talent, an elitist enclave, a zone of personal freedom, a community of the alienated. Whatever else it is, however, the modern world of high art is an international market centered in New York City and emanating out to rival centers in London, Milan, Tokyo and the other great centers of capitalism. Like any market, it is organized around the production and use of commodities, in this case luxury objects produced by small manufacturers.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The museum is enmeshed in a network of more commercial enterprises which, if less authoritative than this "most powerful" of institutions taken one by one, taken all together may tip the balance of the institution of visual art toward economically interested ends. This network is the elaboration of what Cynthia and Harrison White (an art historian and sociologist, respectively) have termed "the dealer-critic system," which came into existence in late nineteenth-century France to replace the state-sponsored academic system that previously had ruled the world of the visual arts. According to the Whites, this shift occurred when the rise of the bourgeoisie led to a "[d]ispersion of buying power … to which the dealer-critic system could adapt much more effectively than the centralized official machine."<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> This dispersion of economic resources in its turn produced an ever more decentered and diversified institution of art that today encompasses galleries, art fairs, auction houses, private collections, and even casinos, as well as museums and universities. While the Whites' description of this system in its emergence is exceptionally lucid and useful, nevertheless I prefer to their term for the institution of visual art the one that is most frequently used in practice, although not in theory. That term is "the art world."</p>
<p>When I say that there is no theory of "the art world," I mean that there is no fulllength systematic study that seeks to bind together all the diverse components of the modern institution of visual art under a single rubric.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> This institution is called "the art world" by all of its constituents, from professors to dealers to street-fair artists, and yet the phrase is not in any dictionary of visual art terms. One explanation for this significant absence might be that the art world, unlike the academy, is unstable and amorphous; there is no genre of the "art world" novel, because this world lacks the compactness and clearly defined hierarchical order that links the world of academia to that of Jane Austen. However, the air of scandal that attends Duncan's claim that the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> institution of modern visual art is above all a <span style="font-style:italic;">market</span> is, I believe, a sign of the deeper reason for the art world's reluctance to speak its name. As per the Whites' account of the dealer-critic system's emergence, the moving parts of the art world are closely fitted to the movements of capital: this institution is less autonomous relative to the market than is the academy. The "market" on which academics sell themselves is still highly regulated, centralized, and driven by the desire more for prestige than for profit. The market on which artists and their agents sell their things is a barely regulated, high stakes business.</p>
<p>Of course, certain parts of the art world, such as public art projects, academic art history and art training, and above all, the museum, are more autonomous than others.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> Paradoxically, though, the literature of the museum is perhaps the richest source of references to the "scandalous" open secret of the art world's relation to the market. Adorno, to take just one example, calls the museum "a metaphor … for the anarchical production of commodities in fully developed bourgeois society."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> Nonetheless, a century of such exposés has not yet quite managed to break the spell that enables the museum to serve as, in Thomas Crow's words, "that special preserve where the commodity character of modern cultural production is sealed off from apprehension."<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> The reason "the museum" looks at times like <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> "imaginary institution" of visual art, the reason it has received so much institutional analysis as compared with the grimy world of galleries and auction houses and art fairs, which has gone almost untouched by the better sort of critic, is that the museum alone among the fragmented parts of the institution of modern art appears to have the authority to sustain the paradox that inheres in Crow's description.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup></p>
<p>To put this paradox another way: the character of the modern institution of visual art is such that it can be, indeed, must be, wide open to penetration by the forces of the market and at the same time "sealed off" from them. Just as the literary academy serves as the ultimate guarantee of professionalist culture's utopian claim to be a preserve of quality in a quantified world, so the art world serves as the ultimate guarantee of what one might call the market's utopian aspects: anarchic energy, experimentalism, and above all, democratic openness, especially to those previously excluded by more "traditional," hierarchical power structures. However, in order to affirm these virtues of the market, the art world must purify them of their associations <span style="font-style:italic;">with</span> the market.</p>
<p>In sum, although they are in crucial ways opposed to one another, the institutions of poetry and painting each in its own way exemplifies the contradictory character of the institution of art as a whole, the conflict between its apparently negative relation to bourgeois society, and that same society's demand that it serve an affirmative function, as the guarantee of its most cherished values. Adorno's own formulation of this thought is that "[w]hile art is driven into a position of absolute negativity, it is never absolutely negative precisely because of that negativity. It always has an affirmative residue." In other words, art is a preserve of the utopian hopes of a society in which actual social change seems impossible. Adorno cautions that art's intimations of such change are only "an illusion," but adds that "what has no being none the less represents a promise, if it has the ability to appear" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Aesthetic Theory</span> 332). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The final question I want to pose, then, is this: how can a modernist art committed to a stance of "absolute negativity" represent positively conceived social goods? Adorno's answer is "only in dimmed form, as though it were a dream" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Aesthetic Theory</span> 320). Keeping this caveat in mind, we may still try to interpret the dream, which is the collective dream of the adherents of modernism. The tenets of these adherents' faith require them to agree with Adorno that no value may be affirmed from <span style="font-style:italic;">within</span> the institution of art; such affirmation may only appear as a "residue," that which is extrinsic to art as such. Those who try to generate affirmation from within art fall prey to a vulgar idealism, as when Greenberg comes to believe, as Clark says in his mordant critique of his precursor, that "art can substitute <span style="font-style:italic;">itself</span> for the values that capitalism has made valueless" . However, this is not to say that society's utopian claims may be pressed on art from <span style="font-style:italic;">outside</span> its institutional bounds. To believe this places one in the camp of the vulgar materialists, who see in artistic illusion not a "promise" but a lie which may be exposed, in Adorno's words, by "calling culture as a whole into question from outside under the general notion of ideology" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Prisms</span> 31). Adorno himself rejects both of these critical positions in favor of close reading, or as he terms it, "immanent criticism." Like the art he favors, Adorno's preferred form of critique is "not one which resolves objective contradictions in a spurious harmony," as the New Criticism has been accused of doing, "but one which expresses the idea of harmony negatively by embodying the contradictions … in its innermost structure" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Prisms</span> 32).</p>
<p>I have tried to "read" the institution of modern art, then, as if it were a work of modernist art, one that generated its own critique out of its structural contradictions. Central to my argument is the contradiction between the notion of the institution of art as unified under the rubric of autonomy, and the notion of that institution as divided by the antagonism between two claimants to the right to represent the autonomous ideal, antagonists that sometimes go by the names of "literature" and "painting." While the autonomous, or negative, character of the institution of art may be the condition of its continued existence in bourgeois society, the possibility of its immanent critique depends on the fracture that runs through it, creating the illusion that the two cultures of modernism are external to one another. Each of these two cultures, in its respective imaginary institution, has been designated as the bearer of a particular utopian claim of society as a whole: literary academia, of that impulse that "does not obey first to the profit motive, but seeks first to improve the <span style="font-style:italic;">quality</span> of life," and the art world, of an openness, an "accessibility to experience," that is a prerequisite of true democracy. Again, these claims cannot be pressed from within the institutions supposed to preserve them. However, the ambiguous stance adopted by both Eliot and Greenberg vis-à-vis their chosen institutions—the outsider-as-insider—gave them the authority to affirm utopian values <span style="font-style:italic;">as if</span> from within. In fact, though, each of these two critics wielded his authority in the name of the characteristic value of the institution opposed to his own: Eliot was primarily concerned to find, or make, an opening in an always already complete and continuous tradition for that arriviste, "the new (the really new) work of art" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Essays</span> 5); while Greenberg made the Eliotic credo, "professionalism is hard work on style with singleness of purpose," the watchword of the art world. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Both Eliot's demand that his "ideal order" exhibit greater openness, and Greenberg's conviction that the imperative driving modern art history is stylistic rather than economic, then, do not arise from within each critic's chosen institution, but from outside it, or rather, from the illusion that there <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> an outside produced by the division within the autonomous institution of art. "In the room the women come and go/ Talking of Michaelangelo," messengers from the imaginary institution beyond; but like Greenberg's "literature," Prufrock's visitors from the art world ultimately represent a threat to his sense of autonomy.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> Like Eliot and Greenberg, Moore demarcates with great precision such points of conflict between the academy and the art world, but unlike them, she cannot speak "as if from within" either one of these institutions. The position to which she understands herself to have been relegated is that of one of the women who come and go between the rooms, but in taking up this position she transforms it. As drift, in her hands, becomes conscious art, weakness is converted into a kind of strength. The Eliotic or Greenbergian modernist sees the (feminine or feminized) visitor from another room as violating the "sealed off" space of autonomous art; but seen in light of that art's immanent critique, the wandering woman appears possessed of the unique power to press the utopian claims of each imaginary institution against the other, <span style="font-style:italic;">as if</span> from outside.</p>
<p>Because the relationship between the two institutions of modern art has been unstable, the claims of one institution or another have seemed more pressing, depending on which appeared to be the more "disparaged" of the two at a given time. Thus Moore, in her role of outsider, displays a certain bias in favor of "the museum" as compared with "academic feeling." However, Moore also sensed the potential for dominance in the museum, as the "most powerful phase" of the collection of lesser institutions she groups under the rubric of the "miscellany." In this respect, her <span style="font-style:italic;">Comment</span> preres the shift in power relations between the academy and the art world that Greenberg somewhat prematurely announces in 1940, but that by now has become unmistakable. The current dominance of visual art in the realm of high art may be said to represent "in dimmed form, as though it were a dream" the triumph of the values of the market over those of professionalism, a triumph that if sufficiently overwhelming would cancel the possibility of pressing the utopian claims of our culture "as if from outside." One's impulse in such circumstances is to display a bias in favor of poetry, which was once the "most powerful" representative of "academic feeling," although it is now "sometimes disparaged." Hence my decision to frame the story of interartistic struggle in Moore's terms. These terms are laid out with especial starkness in an early poem, "To Statecraft Embalmed," which depicts a contest between two opposing aesthetic attitudes that takes place in a "steep, too strict" place, a virtual fissure (CP 35). The antagonists' struggle for dominance provokes "suicidal dreams" in the poet's persona, which finally comes to "attack its own identity, until/ foe seems friend and friend seems/ foe." This is the hazard of placing oneself smack between two warring parties: one cannot be sure whose side one is on. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

For Bourdieu, a cultural producer's "position" within an artistic field is not so much a given role as a persona in continual development, a location mapped and remapped as the artist (or critic or promoter of art) responds to perceived opportunities and obstacles as they arise within the field.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f15" href="#f15-text">15. </a>The aforementioned books by Guillory, Hammer, and McDonald are strong examples of the trend toward "institutional" thinking about literature. Another influential work in this mode is Lawrence Rainey's <span style="font-style:italic;">Institutions of Modernism: Literary Elites and Public Culture</span> (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1998). My own thinking has been much affected by Rainey's study, particularly by his canny discussion of instances in which modernist poets and publishers looked to the art world in search of fresh strategies of self-presentation and promotion. Despite certain definitional difficulties, which I discuss below, some art historians have also taken the institutional line; see, for example, the collection <span style="font-style:italic;">Art History and Its Institutions: Foundations of a Discipline</span>, ed. Elizabeth Mansfield (New York: Routledge, 2002). And in the late 1960s, a number of visual artists, including  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Michael Asher, Marcel Broodthaers, Daniel Buren, and Hans Haacke began to work in the genre of "institutional critique," producing art that reflects on the conditions of its host institutions. The 1990's saw a revival of this genre; one prominent second-wave practitioner, Andrea Fraser, acknowledges her debt to Bürger in a provocative essay in which she sketches the history of this movement and assesses its accomplishments ("From the Critique of Institutions to an Institution of Critique," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Artforum International</span> 44, no. 1 [September 2005]: 278–283 and 332).</p></div>

Again, Greenberg has revised the essay, originally titled "The Plight of Our Culture," to reflect his increasingly conservative worldview.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f19" href="#f19-text">19. </a>Caroline A. Jones, <span style="font-style:italic;">Eyesight Alone: Clement Greenberg's Modernism and the Bureaucratization of the Senses</span> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005), 4, 304 and <span style="font-style:italic;">passim</span>. Jones's book aims, and to a remarkable extent succeeds, at being the last word on the sources and meanings of Greenberg's influence. And yet: while Jones can't help but notice that poetry played a significant role in the formation of the critic's persona, the continued operation of the Greenberg effect makes it hard for her to bring that role into focus. Thus, in a discussion of "[t]he <span style="font-style:italic;">paragone</span> underlying the history of the Laocoonic trope—namely, the Renaissance conceit that representational painting, not poetry, is master of the arts," she concludes that "[t]he shifting fortunes of visual art in the <span style="font-style:italic;">paragone</span> have only limited interest for us" .</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f20" href="#f20-text">20. </a>Jones gives a fine-grained account of how Greenberg's thinking both shaped and was shaped by the requirements of the art-historical field: "It was in the course of engaging with his art-world critics that Greenberg finally separated politics and aesthetics … Artists or art historians (rarely other critics) pushed Greenberg to demarcate criticism's area of competence (thus intensifying its more limited claims)" .</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f24" href="#f24-text">24. </a>In using the phrase "cultures of modernism," I echo Malcolm Bull, who in his essay "Between the Cultures of Capital" (<span style="font-style:italic;">New Left Review</span>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ser, 11 [2006]: 95–113) makes an argument that verges on mine at several points. He, too, see modernist style as shaped by the competition for dominance between two forces, "commodity culture," which he associates with the visual arts, and the more vaguely defined "classical culture" ("tradition" again, but with an emphasis on Western tradition's classicizing and neo-classical phases), which he associates with no art in particular. Like other art historians, that is, Bull tends to write literature out of the story of modernism. Thus, having disposed of the straw man of "classical culture," Bull leaves us, like later Greenberg, in a world in which painting's influence goes unchecked by any counterforce. Unlike Greenberg, though, Bull takes a dark view of this situation: painting in its triumph, he says, has made of modernism "a fully commodified practice, without foundation or metanarrative" . As I suggest below, I see this as a possible, but not necessary, outcome of the Greenbergian story.</p></div>

Or they could join an antiacademic opposition that had shaped itself as a mirror image of the academic formalism it was rejecting" .

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f35" href="#f35-text">35. </a>In the course of pursuing other arguments, some art critics and art historians, Duncan and Fraser among them, have remarked on the limitations of "the museum" as an institutional descriptor and offered in its place a more comprehensive account of the components of the art world. None, however, has followed up on the Whites' effort to produce a synthetic view of this institution.
<p class="display">It must be noted here as well that philosophical aesthetics <span style="font-style:italic;">has</span> produced a "theory of the art world"; for the debate around this theory, see <span style="font-style:italic;">Aesthetics: A Critical Anthology</span>, eds. George Dickie, Richard Sclafani and Ronald Roblin, 2nd ed. (New York: St. Martin's, 1989) 171–217. The theory is most closely associated with Arthur Danto, who argues in his 1964 essay, "The Artworld," that "[t]o see something as art requires something the eye cannot decry–an atmosphere of artistic theory: an artworld" . Only a surrounding "atmosphere of artistic theory," he claims, can explain why a Duchampian jest like Andy Warhol's Brillo Box is widely recognized as a work of art. Danto omits to say how he came by his name for this atmosphere; it may be supposed that he has conflated "lifeworld," a philosophical term connoting lived experience of a particular environment, with "art world," a colloquialism he picked up while gallery-going in New York. Nevertheless, although the central examples in his argument are drawn from the world of contemporary visual art, his theory is not designated as being specific to that social sphere.</p><p class="display">In "The New Institutional Theory of Art," George Dickie criticizes Danto for focusing on artistic theory to the exclusion of that theory's social framework, that is, "the institutions of art-making" . However, Dickie's institution of art, unlike Bürger's, is not a specifically modern creation. Rather, his version of the "artworld" concept encompasses all of the arts throughout history; in his schema, the "artworld" just is the arts' social surround. Dickie entirely misses the pun through which Danto connects the artworld concept to what the latter identifies as "the history of recent New York painting," and Danto fails to make the pun explicit because he is too quick to detach theory from practice, the "atmosphere" of the art world from its institutions.</p><p class="display">In short, neither Danto nor Dickie explain how or why the term "art world" has come, some time over the course of the last century, to be the most commonly used name for the social sphere of the visual arts. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Artworlds</span> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1982), Howard Becker accuses Danto and his fellow aestheticians of being insufficiently "empirical" in their accounts of the institution  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of art ; but Becker, too, uses "artworld" to refer to the social surround of the arts in general, without stopping to consider the provenance of the term. In my view, this provenance determines the meaning of the term.</p></p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f36" href="#f36-text">36. </a>In an essay titled "Conflicting Visions in American Art Museums" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Theory and Society</span> 10, no. 4 [1981]: 103–25), Vera Zolberg tracks two closely related changes that took place in the organization of American art museums around the mid-century. Museum staffers sought both to make their institutions more autonomous relative to their major funders, and to bring a more professionalized approach to their own work. However, Zolberg concludes that although these efforts succeeded to some degree, ultimately, a "lack of insulation from markets and the relative accessibility of non-professionals to [the museum's] information helps to explain why the parallels between museums and other institutions, such as universities and hospitals, is not more striking" .

Meyer notes that a "peculiar characteristic of the art museum is its bedevilling link to the marketplace" , but adds that it is hard to establish that link for the simple reason that "[t]he art market has a long history but lacks a historian. To fix even the simplest fact requires scavenging in monographs and memoirs—which tells us something about the curtained reticence of the art world" . Although to some extent Meyer's complaint still applies, especially where the market for modern art is concerned, certain scholars have begun to bring order to the chaos of "monographs and memoirs"; for a notable example, see Michael Fitzgerald, <span style="font-style:italic;">Making Modernism: Picasso and the Creation of the Market for Twentieth-Century Art</span> (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1996).</p></div>
