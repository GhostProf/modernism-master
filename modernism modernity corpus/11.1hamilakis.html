<p>
The broken pot, the pot in fragments, the scattered shards, is the image
that Gregory Jusdanis's text leaves us with, along with the dilemma of
whether to reconstruct the pot or display the fragments. The implication
being that archaeology desires the reconstructed whole, whereas poets,
some travelers and others perhaps, would find more awe and inspiration and
mystique in the fragments and ruins, as many have done in the past. His
final passage nicely and poetically sums up Jusdanis's edifice, whereby
archaeology stands for science and knowledge, as opposed to the romantic
inspirational desire of the traveler. Yet I want to complicate the picture
we are left with, revisit some the ground he has covered, and perhaps,
as an archaeologist, pick up some of the fragments from the ground,
and attend much more carefully to their form, detail, historical and
mnemonic weight.
<p>
Interestingly, the notion of the fragment is one of the recent
preoccupations of archaeological thinking. While much of earlier
archaeology was preoccupied with the restoration of the whole, the
re-creation of missing parts, and the reconstruction of completeness,
some of us, partly inspired by Oceanic ethnographies, have started
thinking about the broken shards, rines,


<b></b>


bones, objects, and artifacts, in the recent or the remote past; some
of these objects point to intentional fragmentation, and to their often
wide circulation among people and communities, as tokens and talismans
of human relationships, as devices that linked ("enchained") people over
long spatial and temporal distances;
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
at other times, these fragments may have acted as mnemonic objects
that would have helped re-collect the fragments of memories, memories
of events, ceremonies, and rituals; memories of people and places.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p>
Moreover, the notion of archaeology as a science which strives to
save the past and pursue the objective recovery of the truth, an image
that emerges from Jusdanis's text, is one that has been heavily eroded,
especially in the last two decades, and one that many of its practitioners
will not recognize. For them, archaeology produces various pasts, out of
the fragments and traces that have survived; this is a complex process of
production, intricately implicated with processes of identity, politics,
institutional power, disciplinary authority, and history. Archaeologists
do not just save and reconstruct: they select and valorize, but also
ignore and destroy; they produce material realities, but they also tell
stories; they too, like poets, are cultural producers working in the
field of representation.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
This reexamination of archaeology's ontology has also led to the
excavation of the discipline's genealogical and epistemic foundations. As
Jusdanis implies, archaeology has been a key device of capitalist
modernity, but one which possesses distinctive features that deserve
closer examination. Even before the establishment of archaeology as
an autonomous discipline, however, people were not indifferent to the
material traces of the past; contrary to Jusdanis's claim that they showed
"no interest in excavating the earth for its cultural treasures, other
than the pursuit of the riches in graves," recent discussions have shown
that in many different contexts starting from antiquity, ruins of the
past aroused intense interest in people, who invested them with their own
memories, meanings, and associations, often incorporated them in their
own material and social lives, and produced their own narratives and
stories about them. In other words they produced their own archaeologies.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Of course, archaeology as an autonomous discipline, a European
nineteenth-century invention, established its own discourse, narrative
techniques, institutional practices, and authority, often incorporating
some of the premodern meanings, but shaped decisively by the national
imagination; archaeology produced its object of study (the archaeological
"record") in the same way that national imagination produced its
object of desire, the nation-state. Travelers in the classical lands
of the Mediterranean, who, for at least two centuries previously
were searching for their own roots and identities, for paradise lost,
cast their colonial gaze upon what they saw as ruins frozen in time,
as remnants of the classical golden ages that were left undisturbed
by humans (or so they thought), save for the occasional shepherd and
his flock, to be discovered and enjoyed (and often plundered too),
at leisure and in perfect isolation. National archaeology, which in
contexts like Greece was formed at the interface between local and
European discourses, practices, and institutions, came to spoil all
that. It claimed the ruins primarily for the nation, purified them from
the "remnants of barbarity," cleared them from the undergrowth, often


<b></b>


rebuilt the temples from the scattered stones, erected a fence around
them, and displayed the finds in museums, often in a fetishized and
sanitized manner.
<p>
Archaeology thus expressed, helped bring about, and more importantly,
materialized, a competing identity discourse: the panopticism of the
national imagination,
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
as opposed to the colonial gaze of the romantic Western travelers. In
that sense, the reaction of the latter, who lamented the loss of the
perfect isolated ruin, is perfectly explainable. Archaeology was only
one of a whole constellation of developments, one of the many collateral
devices of modernity;
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
it can be seen as an exhibitionary device, along with museums, the grand
World Fairs, and photography; display, spectacle and surveillance lie
at their foundations. National (and neoclassical) aesthetics demanded
purity and completeness,
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
hence the ritual cleansing of the remnants of barbarity from the Athenian
Acropolis (from the Ottoman mosque inside the Parthenon&#x02014;the specter
of otherness for the European imagination&#x02014;to the medieval tower in
the Propylaia), in the same way that language (the modern Greek language,
for instance) was purified from recent, polluting, "foreign" intrusions.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
As the nation-state of Greece strove to produce its modernity, as
the material signs of that modern life became more and more evident,
both in the now reconstructed and managed ruins and elsewhere, the
new wave of travelers, the tourists, closed their eyes to them: as the
nineteenth-century Western photography of Greece shows
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
the neocolonial gaze preferred to see only the classical monuments
(which as reconstructed ruins proved particularly photogenic, eternal,
and timeless), not the signs of other historical periods and of modern
daily life, especially the signs of Western modernity.
<p>
Archaeology shares with literature and poetry more than the desire to
represent, to produce discourses and narratives, reflective or not,
about sameness and otherness. The construction of the past out of
fragmented traces, be they stones and broken pots or fragments of
memories, is perhaps a key shared device here. The text with all its
connotations, as materialized discourse, and as a product of "weaving,"
of producing something new out of scattered things, is another one. In
nineteenth-century Greece, the re-collection of the past out of its
material fragments was a constant preoccupation of authors, historians,
and archaeologists alike;
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
it was, after all, the re-collection of the national dream.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
In twentieth-century modernist poetry, this desire still prominent
(as Jusdanis shows) acquired new meanings; after all, the national
aesthetic discourse was reinventing itself, incorporating more recent
ruins, such as the Byzantine ones, and reinstating the notion of
unbroken continuity, producing thus an indigenous Hellenism: the raw
materials of late-nineteenth- and twentieth-century Greek modernity
included not only the ionic capital, but also the Byzantine crosses,
and the edifice was decorated with modern na&#x000EF;f paintings such
as the ones by Theophilos. Yet these constructions have become more
and more diverse. Seferis, the high priest of Greek modernist poetry,
the poet-as-nation (to recall one of the studies on him),
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
is tormented by the anxiety that his compatriots cannot communicate
directly with the ancient stones and statues; they fail to discover
the true essence of Hellenism. Cavafy on the other hand projects a
nonessentialist, hybrid Hellenism, wide enough to include a multitude
of Eastern Mediterranean identities;
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
and Calas, the Trotskyist, revolts against the bourgeois appropriation
of classical antiquity.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>


<b></b>


<p>
Finally, I would like to return to the cryptic quotation by Jameson that
introduces this text. This passage, the final sentence in his recent
study on modernity, does not refer to the discipline of archaeology; it
simply follows the trend of theorists, from Freud to Benjamin and Foucault
(not to mention countless recent writings) who have found archaeological
metaphors of immense power. Yet his passage resonates with some of the
previous discussion in more ways than one. My preferred reading of it
here is not that far away from the author's intentions, as I understand
them. He suggests that radical alternatives and transformations cannot be
imagined within the conceptual field of the "modern" and of modernity, a
term that he would prefer to see replaced with "capitalism"; he proposes
instead the "displacement of the thematics of modernity by the desire
called Utopia."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
To return to the broken pot with which I started, there are more
options available to us than passively to display the shards or the
reconstructed whole; neither the colonial and the neocolonial gaze
nor the sanitized sight of national aesthetics (be it archaeological,
poetic, photographic, or whatever) is a satisfactory solution. The
fragments of the pot with their materiality, sensory and mnemonic
weight, and historical resonances, can offer multiple, imaginative,
inspirational experiences, the utopian archaeologies of the future.
