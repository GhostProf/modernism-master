<span style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span><p>The influx of Russian film theory through the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Close-Up</span> (1927-1933) provided English audiences with their first glimpse of Russian Formalism, many of whose proponents, most notably Victor Shklovsky, had turned to film criticism and production in the early twenties. Drawing on H. D.'s review of a film written by Shklovsky and her essay on Carl Dreyer's <span style="font-style:italic;">Joan of Arc</span>, this essay reads H. D.'s contributions to <span style="font-style:italic;">Close-Up</span> in conjunction with her prose experiments, to identify a tension between her idealization of film as a universal language and her lingering anxiety that film restricts the creative agency of spectatorship.</p>

<p>[One] should have expected the history of "imagistic art," as they call it, to consist of a history of changes in imagery. But we find that images change very little; from century to century, from nation to nation, from poet to poet, they flow on without changing. Images belong to no one: they are "the Lord's" … Images are given to poets: the ability to remember them is more important than the ability to create them.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Images are often taken as peculiar icons of "presentness." This prevailing myth suggests that images tell essential stories about the conditions of modernity, since their very form (as Lessing once insisted) is one of simultaneity. And yet, images—whether visual or verbal—are also uncanny products of time; they stand in a mysterious relation to their present usage. This may explain Viktor Shklovsky's contention, in his 1917 essay "Art as Technique," that a rigorous history of poetics must be based upon changes of technique, since the images presented in poetry are not themselves essentially new. His point is not that images are strictly speaking "ahistorical," but simply that their histories cannot be concretely narrated. As Shklovksy suggests, images are profoundly impersonal—they "belong to no one"—because, as heightened forms of remembrance, they recall histories of use and reference that exceed their immediate appropriation. We might say, then, that part of what images conceal is their distance from us, just as what they reveal is our distance from our own perceived modernity. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The observation that images are by nature untimely pertains to the ongoing reappraisal of the relation between modernist literature and the culture of film, since cinematic form has so often been called in to support narratives of stylistic modernity.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> Indeed, it is often taken for granted that the novelty of cinematic practices provides a self-evident paradigm for modernism's own obsession with formal innovation. According to this assumption, the striking features of film's representational mechanisms—montage, close-up, the flicker of moving images—become the stylistic models for textual practices, whether or not such connections can be substantiated beyond the barest analogy.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> Yet, if cinematic style does not correspond in neatly material ways to the experiments of modernist literature, and if, as David Trotter rightly points out, our critical desire to affirm such a relation often betrays a disconcerting anachronism, we still need to be able to account for the ways that the concept of cinema itself offered writers a kind of analogy, through which the distinct aims of literary representation were articulated and modified.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> Although the "literary" and the "cinematic" can have only limited use if taken as axiomatic empirical categories, or as self-fulfilling indices of medium specificity, they often operate, as rhetorical res, with a curious disregard for this fact. Attending to the ways that modernist writers reflected on literary form in their engagements with film may not always confirm direct or concrete narratives of influence, but it does shed light on the contested reception of cinema as it came to be considered an art, and the reciprocal ways in which the identity of "literature" was redefined in the process.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The entanglement of literary and cinematic form is especially prominent in the criticism and prose work of H. D. in the 1920's and early 1930's. As Susan Stanford Friedman has argued, H. D.'s prose experiments reflected a concerted attempt to trouble her reputation as an Imagist poet.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> This shift of stylistic modes, as H. D. framed it in a 1919 letter to John Cournos, arises out of the conflicting ways of seeing implied by each genre: "You must remember that writing poetry require[s] clarity, a clairvoyance almost … But in the novel I am working through a wood, a tangle of bushes and bracken out to a clearing, where I can see <strike>clearly</strike> again."<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> The obstruction, if not the elision, of clarity that H. D. identifies as the perverse capacity of prose fiction, provided a model for her contributions to the film journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Close-Up</span>. These reviews, like her remarkable prose experiments from the period, depart from a typically Imagist attempt to transcend rhetorical verbiage through the crystallization of the visual, exploring instead how the complexities of vision solicit and are transformed by the thickets of language, metaphor, and reference. Indeed, it might be said that her critical engagement with cinema provided a crucial vocabulary for her "Dijon" novellas of the late twenties and early thirties.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> The index of this influence, however, is not limited to the ways that H. D.'s fiction emulates cinematic technique; rather, in H. D.'s film criticism she develops a kind of literary spectatorship, a way of writing about the act of seeing, that begins to double for the detached omniscience of prose works like her novella, "The Usual Star."<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>In locating a connection between H. D.'s narrative practices and the impersonal forms of spectatorship modeled by her criticism, I hope to show that the coincidence of H. D.'s experimentation in prose fiction and her interest in cinema can help to contextualize the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> ambivalent tone of her articles for <span style="font-style:italic;">Close-Up</span>, which mix literary and cinematic categories in ways that are strikingly, often frustratingly, oblivious of the ostensible "specificity" of these mediums. This tonal ambivalence can be flummoxing, but we should resist the temptation to ignore it by neatly assimilating her film criticism either to the contemporary psychoanalytic models developed by Freud or to the theories of montage and reception put forward by Eisenstein.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> As Laura Marcus observes of <span style="font-style:italic;">Close-Up</span> generally, the journal sought to establish film as an art precisely by "finding a form of writing and language adequate to the cinema … a discursive medium and forum commensurate with the new art."<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> For this reason, I find it less productive to reduce H. D.'s essays on film to their more well-known definitions of cinematic beauty than to underscore the modes of writing in them which cinematic spectatorship enables. Her dense and elusive commentaries must be read carefully as themselves mini performances of the ideas they are trying to convey. Drawing on H. D.'s review of <span style="font-style:italic;">By The Law</span> (written by Viktor Shklovsky and directed by Lev Kuleshov), I take Shklovsky and H. D. as exemplifying two distinct and admittedly extreme approaches to the relation of cinema to literature. While Shklovsky subordinates cinematic style to formalist literary categories, H. D. seeks to reconre narrative conventions through an enthusiastic emulation of the mode of visionary consciousness epitomized by cinematic spectatorship. Using a common text—<span style="font-style:italic;">By the Law</span> —as a way to clarify these divergent strategies, I suggest that H. D.'s writing shaped itself through gestures of comparative differentiation, even as it sought to transcend the antagonistic rhetorical conditions that structure film's relation to literature.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">1. Literature By the Law of Film</h1>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>The cinema has no laws; the best proof of this is that in our language only one brochure in all has been written on the 'laws of cinema' (by V.

<p>Viktor Shklovsky, father of Russian formalism, made a name for himself as a proponent of the science of poetics, the inner "laws" of literature and what he called the "revolution of the word," but he was equally a commentator on film. Between 1923 and 1930, Shklovsky was the author of more than 15 articles and multiple monographs on film,<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> and one can see in his work the ways in which his early definitions of literature shaped his appraisal of cinematic form. In "Art as Technique" (also translated as "Art as Device"), for example, Shklovsky seeks to define literary art by displacing the centrality of images. For Shklovsky, art cuts through the layers of habit and memory in order to reopen the world to the immediacy of unformed sensation, a sensation that has been reawakened, or "turned over like a log in a fire," as he puts it in <span style="font-style:italic;">Literature and Cinematography</span> .<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> Methodologically, this required a critique of what Shklovsky considers the false economy of images that facilitate a dubious efficiency. This false  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> impression of immediacy arises, he argues, from the comparative structure of verbal res which "clarify the unknown by means of the known."<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> This kind of "thinking in images," Shklovsky contends, brings the world too quickly to us as a predigested abstraction, while the aim of literary form is precisely to restore the "unknown" to perception through techniques of repetition and delay ("impedence" and "deceleration"), and by renegotiating the history of literary conventions (which need, periodically, to be replaced). In this way, the formalist definitions of "literariness" also carried basic, and often contradictory, assumptions about the discontinuous temporalities of literature, and about its constant need for renewal or "evolution."</p>
<p>Shklovsky's engagement with film (as theorist and screenwriter) in the twenties can be seen as an extension of problems endemic to his study of literature, rather than as a general application of the "formal method" to a new medium. Although Shklovsky was, among the members of the formalist school (OPOYAZ), the most prolific commentator of film, his attitude towards it betrays a marked skepticism. Indeed, it is fair to say that Shklovsky conceived of film almost entirely from the perspective of literature. He himself was a screenwriter (working notably with Abram Room and Lev Kuleshov), and while his criticism often attempts to specify the "form and material" unique to each art, his account of film relied heavily on the vocabulary derived from his work on literature.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> Shklovsky's mostly inconclusive attempts to locate "poetry and prose" in film,<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> his many discussions of film "semantics,"<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> his emphasis on the impossibility of abstract film and on the centrality of plot (in spite of the contemporary achievements of Vertov and Eisenstein in the creation of increasingly non-narrative forms of documentary and historical drama,)<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> and the concomitant privilege he accorded to the creative authority of the script<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup>—all of these point to the awkward and apparently antagonistic relationship that he discerned between literature and film. In his criticism literature colonizes film; its interpretation is inflected with distinctly literary categories, values, and criteria.</p>
<p>It is perfectly emblematic, then, that his first foray into film production, Kuleshov's 1926 film <span style="font-style:italic;">By the Law</span> (Po zakonu), was a literary adaptation.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> For Shklovsky, film needed to be explained in the language of literature if it was to be accepted.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> Cinematic expression (as technique) imitates literature, Shklovsky suggests, in its ability to "tak[e] representation out of its usual focus," and yet Shklovsky argues, somewhat perplexingly, that cinematic art, like linguistic art, cannot be based on the composition of its images but only on the movement of its plot.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> Shklovsky's reluctance to define film in terms of its visual imagery, as in the similar reluctance to admit imagery a central role in literature, stems from his distrust of the promise of expediency held out by the image; and it is in this way that Shklovsky exiles cinema from art on Bergsonian grounds:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Human motion is a continuous magnitude; human thought represents continuity as a set of impulses, a set of segments infinitely minute, minute to the point of continuity … The cinema is a child of the discontinuous world. Human thought has created for itself a new non-intuitive world in its own image and likeness … A film does not move; it only appears to move. Pure motion, as such, will never be reproduced in cinematography. Cinema can only deal with the motion-sign, the semantic motion … The semantic motion-sign triggers  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> our recognition; we complete it; it does not demand our attention … Fundamentally, cinematography is extraneous to art.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In other words, the motion of cinematic images is always remembered, always a product of synthesis and reconstruction on the part of the viewer, and because of this Shklovsky holds that it can only approximate the rejuvenating function of art. Film "art," in this sense, is defined as implicitly borrowed, and the primary source of its translations, he argues paradoxically, is literature (which offers, in its techniques of delay, a more "true" representation of human thought). The formalist attention to film thus locates it as the principle sign of growing confusion in the arts, a fact that is confirmed all the more by Shklovsky's attempts to explain it according to a "literary science." Shklovsky's ambivalent writings on film, however, ultimately testify to the failure to fulfill this ambition. As he writes in a 1927 article entitled "The Temperature of Cinema," "Everything that I have written is disproved by cinema."<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> In his writing this is practically true—nearly all of his articles end in mid-thought, as if halted by the forms of discontinuity he sought to describe.</p>
<p>H. D. reviewed Kuleshov's <span style="font-style:italic;">By the Law</span>, which was adapted for the screen by Viktor Shklovsky, for the July 1928 issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Close-Up</span>.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> All of Shklovsky's care for the ordering of the plot, however, may have gone unnoticed—for H. D. arrived at the theater roughly twenty minutes late.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> Perhaps for this reason, but in any case in spite of it, her reading of the film has very little to do with what happens, or with any of the elements of plot construction which so obsessed Shklovsky.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> Instead, H. D.'s reading of the film is focused precisely on the dispersed temporality of discrete images, which Shklovsky believed disqualified film from the realm of art. For H. D., film offers a vehicle for "abstract … remote … symbolical" meanings, suggestions of mythic or visionary parallels that bear only indirectly on the film's plot (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 126). Such images stand apart, exerting a cryptic power upon their viewer and on the extra-filmic "preparations" of the viewer—that time spent before entering the theater, wandering the streets. H. D. views film as addressing itself to the gap between the ordered time of the film's narration and the erratic time of viewing, a gap in which the image becomes subject to variable "intentions."</p>
<p>"Someone had apparently killed someone," she writes of her confusion at arriving midway through the film,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Someone was heaving a weight of something and against an upright ledge of mud, the rain poured and soaked and ran and gorged runnels in the already over-soaked bit of bed earth. Bad lands, something wasted, wasteful, over-done and done with. Rain poured over a slab of earth and I felt all preparation of the extravagantly contrasting out of doors gay little street, was an almost ironical intention, someone, something "intended" that I should grasp this, that some mind should receive this series of uncanny and almost psychic sensations in order to transmute them elsewhere; in order to translate them. Rains soaked across a slab of mud, runnels bored and jabbed and pockmarked and gusseted it. There was never an earth that could be ever again so drab, so unproductive.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 125–126). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The process of singling out these "uncanny" details—images of waste and rain and mud—for a heightened attention serves a double function. It exaggerates the materiality of these shots, their recalcitrant resistance to narrativization, while at the same time leaving this wasted field of visual signs to be all the more completely subsumed—"transmuted … translated"—by the generality of reading in which such details are construed as merely occasions for imaginative expansion. Here we see H. D. straining language to capture the elusive scintillesence of water on the screen during the film's scene of burial—"the rain poured and soaked and ran and gorged"; "runnels bored and jabbed and pockmarked and gusseted"—straining, in other words, to demonstrate the remote singularity of an image that cannot be translated, and which remains, from a narrative perspective, recalcitrantly "unproductive." At the same time, such translation involves a decontextualization, a stripping of content, that leaves such images tied only to "somewhere," "someone," "something."</p>
<p>In becoming loosely symbolic, then, the images at once free themselves from the utility of narrative and open themselves to an unstable signification in the creation of an atmosphere that is partly depicted and partly imagined. The labor of such spectatorship consists in a heightened form of "reading," a recalibration of visual tropes into codes of reference and allusion. The effect of such reading, as H. D.'s criticism attests, is two-fold and contradictory: it lends emphasis to the fragmentary or non-narrative agency of images, while at the same time offering a form of interpretive consolidation that essentially looks beyond what is shown to discover a landscape of imageless truths and ancient types. This is what H. D. in effect elaborates as she continues with her description, employing the language of classical culture in order to characterize the wasteland that Kuleshov's film presents:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Death and all its drab significance rose in its starkness to some almost Eleusinian note of purity. So abstract the land, so remote and symbolical the two res of the living that dragged the two sacks or canvas sails that had been wrapped about the two long bodies of the slain, so heavy and dreary the rain, so slippery the mud, so terrible the lowering of the sky above the rain (which one sensed was there simply for the re-harrowing of these living res) that the spirit as in the Aeschuylean drama rose above, shouted almost audibly with the elements, <span style="font-style:italic;">the soul, the soul survives</span>. The soul was embodied in two res, man and woman, if that long ungainly creature with the hair whipped about lean, gargoyle face was a woman … like some wan and exquisite Persephone, crying to be buried, dragged in and taken back and back away from human consciousness, like those two others, … But the intention of the story, greater than its mere plot, could not possibly be misread; death and death and death and bad lands and waste and the Aeschuylean lowering of the blank skies (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 126).</p></blockquote>
<p>What such a reading of cinematic images asks after, we might say, is the status of embodiment at the fragile edge of language. Where do the wasted fragments of rain and damaged earth end, and the Aeschuylean drama begin? It is as if, for H. D., the very qualities that detach these images from the film's plot, and which define the material of their visual contours, in fact exacerbate the language of universality that finally  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> sweeps in, overtaking them. Despite her protestations to the contrary, then, it would seem that any reading of film flirts with "misreading," since it must reconstitute the dramatic movements of the screen into a chain of symbols.</p>

<p>The border between visual and textual representation is clearly porous for H. D., though in a different sense than we saw in Shklovsky's theorizing. For H. D., writing and film share precisely what Shklovsky wished to remove from consideration: the image as the element of a work that stands eerily outside of its narrative strategies, thereby challenging any attempt to define art in terms of its "internal laws." The image—in writing as in film—opens the work to an intertextuality that grossly exceeds a particular narrative or set of themes or motifs, for it always exists "outside" of its present usage. Images "belong to no one," as Shklovsky puts it, "they are 'the Lord's.'" For H. D.'s work this statement rings doubly true; in this case, the particularity of the image is what withdraws from the work, as well as what defines it, and H. D.'s articles can be read as an attempt to make representation "mirror" such withdrawal. Film, as it were, becomes the place where writing loses itself in the shared "destiny" of the image. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>H. D.'s criticism on film, it might be said, is always about something else, not about something other than film, but about the "something else" that constitutes film. To understand the uncanny nature of her writing about film, it should be noted that H. D. rarely refers to the most basic analyzable elements of cinematic composition. She doesn't, for example, elaborate on the effects of lighting, or the dynamics of framing or mise-en-scene. For this reason Laura Marcus has observed that H. D.'s writing on film tends to take the form "not [of] retrospective judgment on a film, but a performative running commentary on the processes of spectating which became a form of 'inner speech,' acting as a screen onto which the film images could be projected."<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> This is certainly true, although H. D. is less interested in recounting the waves of emotion and feeling that films might provoke (that is, less interested in using film as a springboard for the stream-of-consciousness model of criticism offered by Dorothy Richardson's "Continuous Performance" column in the same journal) than in describing the impersonal  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> terrain communicated by a film's images. What interests her is how perceptions unite the visible register with something that also exceeds it—a hidden layer of reference and symbolization. In this sense, the model of spectatorship constructed by H. D. is non-subjective, or, if you prefer, it is constituted by a fantasy of non-subjectivity.</p>
<p>Her aggressive style of writing about film, then, becomes a strategy for creating the objectivity of such depersonalization. The act of writing about film is not obliged to help us understand it, she implies, but should make us see in a new way by foregrounding a sense of film's indeterminacy in the act of reception. This may be why H. D.'s essays on film avoid speaking of characters, but describe instead the properties of face or profile, the imposing res cut by the bodies on the screen. Such is her interest in "Edith" from <span style="font-style:italic;">By the Law</span>, who assumes the role of a kind of cipher in place of any fictive personality:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The gestures of this woman are angular, bird-like, claw-like, skeleton-like and hideous. She has a way of standing against a skyline that makes a hieroglyph, that spells almost visibly some message of cryptic symbolism. Her gestures are magnificent. If this is Russian, then I am Russian. Beauty is too facile a word to discuss this; this woman is a sort of bleak young sorceress, vibrant, febrile, neurotic, as I say almost cataleptic … She is skeleton-like and death-like … Her teeth protrude, and her cheek bones are hollow, her skull is picked, so to speak, of its meat by misery and waiting. Her mind is on the raw edge of breaking, her eyes roll in terror and madness and numbness of misery … Her face can be termed beautiful in the same way that dawn can be termed beautiful rising across stench fever of battle … there is no word for such things. Her mind, her soul, her body, her spirit all vibrate, as I say, almost audibly. One is beyond personal discernment. This is psychic, compelling, in a way destructive.

<p class="continued">In passages such as these, the field of visual detail begins to crumble away before a seemingly endless chain of description, analogy and comparison. Once a certain "vibration" is reached, H. D. suggests, cinematic representation begins to push in multiple directions at once, casting light on a "cryptic symbolism."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> This way of reading, she notes, lies "beyond personal discernment," in the domain of myth and sublimity. This perspective no doubt mystifies things, demanding of films nothing less than ecstatic revelation, in which, as she goes on to say, "I can 'witness' almost fanatically the 'truth'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 127); and yet H. D. spiritualizes film precisely by highlighting its most ruined, "skeleton-like," aspect. The dual emphasis on "withered" materiality and symbolic "life" indicates the way in which H. D. universalizes perception, though only at the cost of destroying its objects.</p>
<p>In a sense, H. D. is not far off from Woolf's insight—in her 1926 essay, "The Cinema"—that cinematic perception maintains its effect of presence by presuming the loss of subjective life, presenting only "life as it is when we have no part in it."<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> Here the point is the same, except that for H. D. the recognition of loss does not carry an elegiac force. Rather, the loss of self is seen as the point of departure for an ecstatic vision that promises transcendental elevation. Kuleshov, she writes, "uses the screen almost as a psychic medium, art on the high almost un-natural level of Aeschuylean  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> trilogies" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 127). The beauty offered by such exceptional films, she goes on to say, must of necessity "destroy" the sense of reality as such; "… it was my first Russian film and I have said that it is perhaps destructive. Beauty is that. This sort of raw picked beauty must of necessity destroy the wax and candy-box 'realism' of the so much so-called film art. It must destroy in fact so much that perhaps it does 'go' as one of our party said 'too far'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 127).</p>

<p>But if the film destroys the reality of the world, or—what amounts to the same thing—subsumes the "presentness" of the world in the mythic reach of its symbolic movement, filmic "beauty" (a term she continues to use after signaling its insufficiency) remains irreducible to either visual surface or linguistic abstraction. From the skeleton to the symbol, H. D.'s contradictory aesthetics of the image straddles a heightened materiality.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup></p>
<p>In fact, what might be most distinctive about H. D.'s reading of film is her insistence on the restless antagonism and violence that underwrites cinematic spectatorship. Her essays on film constantly make reference to largely conventional categories of aesthetic judgment—"beauty," "truth," the "classic"—and yet these categories are relentlessly qualified by her description, where "beauty" becomes "dawn … rising across stench and the fever of battle … there is no word for such things," or "skeleton-like … death-like." H. D. employs the language of idealism or spiritualism in order to describe a world that always seems to fall somewhat short of its exalted epithets.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> The importance  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of the iconic detail is that it encrypts a relation that is always "half-finished"—which in turn is "helped" and completed in the act of spectatorship.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>The world of the cinema, the world of ghostly particularity, then, must be reconstructed. H. D.'s film criticism testifies both to the exalted claims for the power of spectatorship to evoke a "universal" community founded on a shared symbolic experience, and to the felt impossibility of sharing symbols whose erratic inscription in the material world makes their common legibility problematic. H. D. certainly subscribed to the utopian understanding of film as a "universal language," and to its ability to reach across national boundaries. "The world of the film to-day," she writes in her review of Russian cinema, "is no longer the world of the film, it is the world. It is only those who are indifferent to the world itself and its fate, who can afford to be indifferent to the fate of the film industry and the fate of the film art … We are no longer nations. We are or should be <span style="font-style:italic;">a</span> nation" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 135–136). If film sustains sociality through the creation of or reference to common memory, this utopian aim can only be ambivalently aided by H. D.'s sense that "classicism" is the name for this shared form of remembrance. The vocabulary of classicism may only be a name for what is most "universal" in cultural memory, but it highlights the naiveté of a desire to consolidate the world in the image of the West. What is powerful about her writing on film, however, is the eloquent imbalance between a language that prioritizes universality—and so turns everything and everyone into symbols—and a language that nevertheless emphasizes the allure of the film's broken details.</p>
<p>H. D.'s film criticism replays this drama of referentiality as the tragic intersection of image and commentary, of verbal and visual representation. The question of what gives the new medium value, what gives it specificity, is constantly displaced by an implicit recognition of the susceptibility of perception to the starker agencies of representation which animate image and text alike. For H. D., the world of film is traversed equally by the names of classical references (Aeschylus, the Eleusinian mysteries, etc.) and by the images which they mime and obscure. What needs to be stressed is that, precisely due to this ambiguity, H. D.'s speculations are grounded in an awareness of the permeability of our overlapping experience of these media in the moment of spectatorship. The act of viewing a film, she implies, involves not just our perception of it but an active process of mutual mediation. If there is a formalism to H. D.'s work, then, it refers not to the advocacy of the virtues of a specific medium, or the "in-itself" of aesthetic experience; rather, it follows from her insight that we cannot escape the loss of history foretold by our means of accessing it.</p>

<p>To look at a star by glances—to view it in a side-long way, by turning toward it the exterior portions of the retina (more susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the interior), is to behold the star distinctly—is to have the best appreciation of its lustre—a lustre which grows dim just in proportion as we turn our vision fully upon it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The language of depersonalized spectatorship with which H. D. analyzes <span style="font-style:italic;">By the Law</span> and other films helped to shape her contemporaneous fiction, which frames cinematic and literary practices in parallel ways. The narrator of <span style="font-style:italic;">HER</span> , for example, anachronistically refers to the "precinematographic conscience" of the young Her Gart, suggesting that the novel's backward-looking perspective into the as yet undeveloped mind of its protagonist is itself predicated on cinematic modes of consciousness.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> In her novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Palimpsest</span> , the palimpsest, as a model of ancient textual history, is repeatedly paired with the cinematic language of superimposition in ways that describe the ecstatic "interwashing" of modernity and the ancient past.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup></p>
<p>The most substantive form of incorporation, however, is not reflected so directly. As I have suggested, H. D. drew less on the rative meanings of film's material mechanisms than on the narrative detachment implied by cinematic spectatorship. In her fiction, H. D. treats characters and events of her own creation as if they were projections from a film, subject to the same fog of reconstruction and remembrance as the images described in her reviews. Her novella, "The Usual Star," (dated 1928, but published 1934) is illustrative in this respect. It concerns the love triangle of a poet and aspiring novelist, Raymonde Ransome, her lover, Daniel, and prospective suitor, Marc. H. D.'s narrator, however, is blithely unconcerned with developing the relationships of the central characters through the action of plot and dramatic scenes. Instead, the novella conjures a constellation of erotic potentialities, which then are viewed abstractly from a series of slightly adjusted comparative viewpoints.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup></p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>It seemed that they were one pin-point … one star-point, to let some sort of outer light into this cumbrous city consciousness.

Daniel felt as she felt (pin-prick of Danielraymonde) saw as she saw.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The novella's reality is reconstituted, not by the characters themselves, but by the voice of the narrator, who hovers behind their statements. Indeed, the narrator of this passage is not a person, per se, but a point in space where images, characters, and phrases erratically intersect.</p>
<p>The organization and construction of this impersonal perspective—or at least the novella's desire for such a perspective—through the "pin-point" or "star-point" in the world's fabric, requires an impersonal way of seeing. Such a form of collative visuality becomes a model for the novella's detachable "subjectivity" which <span style="font-style:italic;">imitates</span>, but doesn't exemplify, traditional omniscience.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>I want to see all sort of things with all sorts of eyes set sideways. I want to see Lila with the eyes of Ermy, I want to see Daniel with the eyes of Marc de Brissaic.

I want all the odd eyes to shuffle about on the table, matching odd eye to odd eye … I wish I had odd eyes that could see the thing as <span style="font-style:italic;">one</span> thing (<span style="font-style:italic;">US</span>, 63–65). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The multiplicity of perspectives that Woolf, for example, realizes in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, is here reduced to a perverse and impossible fantasy. The emphatically material tone of the passage seems meant to disturb precisely the narrative authority that would make such devices as "point-of-view" appear transparent. H. D.'s narrative concerns, among other things, the desire for omniscience, and, in formulating it as an object of desire rather than as a medium of knowledge, she conceives of omniscience as a kind of grossly exaggerated fetish. "That is what it is to be a novelist," the narrator reflects at one point, "isn't that what she [Raymonde] was always after? To see what it is to be. I want to be what Ermy is, see what Ermy sees, be and see with one focus, not this always measuring and weighing and seeing things distorted, themselves and the, so to speak, reflections of themselves, like ghost things seen in water" (<span style="font-style:italic;">US</span>, 53). And yet, novelistic perspective—that elusive synthesis of seeing and being "with one focus"—is precisely what eludes H. D.'s novella, which remains mired in the circuitous distortions described here, "reflections … ghost things seen in water."</p>
<p>In contrast to traditional novelistic omniscience, "The Usual Star" suggests that the perspectival morass of the novella (imagined as the borrowing of eyes) is indebted to cinematic sight, in which vision appears to have been disembodied and made fragmentary. Indeed, the language of film comes to substitute and stand in for the combinatory textuality so relentlessly pursued by H. D. The "palimpsest" style, which turns characters into perpetual conduits for anarchic associations, displays a mixing of mediums, as we might infer from the passage in which the narrator describes the bizarre likeness of her lover, Daniel, to the "Swedish film star" Freda Berling.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup></p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Incandescence of Nordic beauty that was the Swedish film star. Daniel was staring at her … Freda Berling, if Freda Berling had a mind, incandescence of mind, to cauterize the open swan-thing wounded, that her eyes were, would be a sort of Daniel … Freda Berling was a dead swan gilded with garish grease paint.</p>
<p>Snow shrugged snow shoulders, detached triangulated white on white … swan's wings. Freda Berling, was to Raymonde's apprehension, swan wings, beauty that had condescended, chosen the despised screen for its shadow medium. Freda Berling of last night's screen, stayed with her. "I am haunted by the Berling." Daniel was like the Berling. Daniel was like the Berling … if Freda Berling would cauterize, "fix" so to speak the rolling thing her odd inhuman eyes were, she would be a sort of Daniel. "Her eyes look out at nothing." "People criticize, say her eyes look too far inward. They are simply ice-bergs rolling." The eyes of remembered blatant screen wax beauty were projected there before them. The gods choose curious mediums. The gods chose Freda Berling, Daniel, herself and some others. Mediums. They were all sort of mediums. "We're all sort of mediums … the Berling is a doped swan. You're a sort of real one … without grease paint."</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">US</span>, 22–23)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The impersonality of the cinematic "star" provides a crucial comparison for the action of the narrative voice, in which the confusion of interior and exterior speech, dialogue and narration, becomes doubled by the cryptic re of cinematic eyes which appear to "look too far inward" but which in fact "look out at nothing." The eyes of the film star Freda, who is also a kind of Leda here, betray the visitation of some "beauty that had condescended, chosen the despised screen for its shadow medium." The mark  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of this godly visitation, "the open swan-thing wounded" which Raymonde wishes to "cauterize" and "fix," (and which is apparently shared by Daniel as well as the narrator) is that perception has already been, in a way, disembodied. These "odd inhuman" eyes do not lead back to the self, but spread around them a winter of impersonality ("detached triangulated white on white"). Later, the narrator wonders whether her affair with Marc has injured Daniel, asking "Did he feel that? Did his odd eyes in the dusk <span style="font-style:italic;">see</span> or simply <span style="font-style:italic;">was</span> he? Did he resort to some old old Greek trick?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">US</span>, 68). Not being able to tell, the narrator concludes that Daniel is distant, like a star or like a starlet. But if this distance results from being possessed by a "beauty that had condescended," Raymonde's response is not to assume the typical aesthetic stance of disinterestedness. Rather, her erotic attention becomes a textual mirror to his odd withdrawal of personality. Weaving through repetitions between dialogue and interior notations, H. D. emphasizes the materiality of literary representation in order to insist that romance is always a matter of mutual mediation. The story's central relationship—between Raymonde and Daniel—is never fully established, in part because H. D. does not depict characters so much as "mediums," mercurial res of likeness and analogy through which the narrative can offer textual constructions in lieu of erotic resolution.</p>
<p>Daniel (star, eyes, cinema) and Raymonde (poet, narrator) do not meet in any final scene of intimacy, rather the novella posits its own textual agency as a substitute. In "The Usual Star," the meeting of literature and cinema provides the formal conceit for staging this romance. "People and things make patterns on the mind," the narrator writes, "independent of the place, the time, the people, the things themselves. What good then is unity, is cohesion, is time and place, sequence, the brave beginning, the sustained middle, the bold climax and the inevitable end?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">US</span>, 79). "The Usual Star" can make this claim in part because the action of the narrative has been supplanted by a receptive gaze, a mode of discursive reflection that seems to mimic the spectatorial epistemology of H. D.'s writing on film. In this way, the novella's use of cinematic tropes suggests a crucial analogue to the processes by which the story makes claims about the ecstatic "identities" of romance. To desire another person, or to "like" them, we infer, is also to uncover the way in which intimacy is deferred along a chain of likenesses. "The Usual Star" supports this insight in part by exploring the ways in which literary and cinematic representation share modes of reference. But if H. D.'s fiction finds the two "mediums" in a carefully constructed balance, her writing on film often betrays the fact that in many ways such a relation could only ever be partial, and perhaps unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>In a way, the very transferability of H. D.'s notion of cinematic consciousness to literary texts points to its problematic constitution. Indeed, the most remarkable text in her film criticism comes at the moment when she articulates the limits of her identification with film; or more exactly when she indicates an incongruity of sorts between the technical elements of film style and what she consistently identifies as its spiritual potential. As we have seen, the value of the cinema very often consisted in a strange kind of disembodied expression that never quite coincides with film itself. In her critique of Dreyer's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Passion of Joan of Arc</span>, however, this tension or latent incompatibility takes on its most striking formulation; for though H. D. acknowledges the stylistic success of the film and the enormity of its achievement as a purely technical artifact, she cannot admit to enjoying it. Admiring the film while registering a distance from it, H. D. attempts to justify her poetics of spectatorship in a perverse way by articulating the reasons why the film fails to move her despite fitting every criteria which she can name. In this way, H. D. implicitly reasons, her failure to appreciate the film is a necessary consequence of understanding it—and she casts her emotional remove from the film's dramatic world as a fantastic extension of its very logic, so that in seeing the film, and in disliking it, the viewer assumes the role of Joan herself, subject to the impersonal designs of Dreyer's torturing force.</p>
<p>"<span style="font-style:italic;">The Passion and Death of a Saint</span> is a film that has caused me more unrest," H. D. begins her review, "more spiritual forebodings, more intellectual racking, more emotional torment than any I have yet seen" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Close-Up</span>, 130). Commenting on the film some months later, H. D. recalled that "I have written about <span style="font-style:italic;">Jeanne d'Arc</span> a little spitefully and a little unharmoniously. Jeanne d'Arc … set me out of key. It positively bullied me as no film has yet done. I was forced to pity, pity, pity. My affections and credulity were hammered. I was kicked. I was throttled. I was laid upon a torture rack. Quite solemnly I was burned at the stake and lifting eyes to heaven I had forgiven my malefactors. Yes, the magnificent technique of Dreyer did that for me. But was I moved?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 143). The farther away H. D. claims to have been driven from Dreyer's film, the more completely her writing seems to have been drawn into it and permeated by its res. Again and again, she complains of a sense of "claustrophobia" created by the film, an objection precisely inverse to those she makes of other films. For whereas other films fail to create such a compelling sphere of identification, pity or compassion for their characters (which function only as so many moving parts in a great narrative machine), <span style="font-style:italic;">The Passion of Joan of Arc</span> establishes these responses so effectively and indeed so inescapably that one feels trapped within its perfection. "I am shut up in here," H. D. writes, "I want to get out. I want to get out" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 132).</p>
<p>H. D.'s critique of Dreyer's film, however, is mitigated by her sense that it is the total realization of film as an art.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> That is, what she perceives as the purity of the work, its typification of film itself (or as she puts it, the film's "sheer perfection of the medium,") contributes to her perception of its problems (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 143). "The Jeanne d'Arc of the incomparable artist Carl Dreyer is in a class by itself," she writes at the conclusion of her review, "And that is the trouble with it. It shouldn't be" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 133). This is a tricky claim, and perhaps insupportable. Nevertheless, a case can be made for seeing in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> H. D.'s reading of Dreyer's film not simply a general misrecognition of the film's aims,<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> but an inevitable and essential misrecognition of certain consequences of cinematic form. In the end, H. D.'s dislike of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Passion of Joan of Arc</span> may speak less to the film itself, or to any deficiencies which it might contain, than to the instability of H. D.'s reading of film more broadly. What fascinates her about film, at least, is not what defines it <span style="font-style:italic;">as film</span>, or what separates it from other arts. Instead, H. D.'s reviews suggest that film can be read alongside literature, so long as one approaches spectatorship symbolically.</p>
<p>Her aggressively tropological reading of film suggests that, for H. D., the very intensity with which <span style="font-style:italic;">The Passion of Joan of Arc</span> succeeds in creating a significant atmosphere works paradoxically against it. "For being let into the very heart, the very secret of the matter," she writes, "we are let out of … something" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 130). This "something," her review goes on to suggest, is the spiritual side of Joan's character, her visionary essence. Dreyer, on the other hand, depicts only Joan the sufferer, the martyr whose passive grace inspires sympathy, but in a way that leaves off any indication of the presumed divinity of the Joan as prophet. This exaggerated personality—the mystic persona of Joan which had been popularized in the romantic tradition and which H. D. seems to have adopted wholeheartedly—this is what Dreyer failed to convey, reducing both Joan and spectator alike to, in H. D.'s words, a "senseless animal" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 132).</p>

I pay him my greatest compliment. His is one among all films, to be judged differently, to be approached differently, to be viewed as a masterpiece, one of the absolute masterpieces of screencraft.

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Dreyer's "slur on human consciousness," it seems, derives in part from the tragic consequences of any film—that we are unable to act in it, along with it, and that we are reduced to a form of passivity ourselves—"standing aside and watching and watching <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> watching and being able to do nothing." If Dreyer's film depends on this passivity to heighten our sense of her vulnerability, and if he accentuates and attempts to glorify a corresponding helplessness in his portrayal of Joan—who after all was a military as well as visionary re—H. D. seems to suggest that this has something to do with the perfection of the film itself, which leaves nothing of substance to be added by the spectator. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>If the passivity of film viewing never caused H. D. any concern in the past, it is in part because, as we have seen, she openly advocated a method of creative spectatorship. Reading mythological analogues and symbolic likenesses into the texture of films like <span style="font-style:italic;">By the Law</span>, H. D. developed a reading of film that depended on the forms of visionary consciousness that the viewer could bring with them. This spectatorship completes the suggestiveness of film. In this way, H. D. positions Joan of Arc as an inevitable model of the visionary consciousness of film viewing. Just for this reason Dreyer's film would seem to provide an apt example for her film theory in general—or at least this would have been true, if not for the stubborn silence with which Dreyer treats Joan not as a dynamic visionary agent but rather as a re of piety and submission, innocence and suffering.</p>
<p>H. D. sees in Dreyer's film precisely an absence of the ecstatic modes that she desires of film in general, and it is telling that her only moments of allusive embellishment—so characteristic of her criticism in general—come when attempting to note what is missing from the film.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Whether or not Dreyer's film presents Joan's martyrdom without poetry, of course, is open to debate, though even this is not the main claim of H. D.'s criticism. Certainly she does not deny that such poetry exists in the film, although she calls it, a little roughly, "artistry," and tends to imply that that the film is technically proficient but emotionally lacking. This is not the case, however, and H. D.'s rhetoric may only signal the difficulty of identifying and articulating two separate orders of success or failure.</p>
<p>Certainly one could argue that H. D. simply fails to see the complexity with which Dreyer dismantles the very realism for which she critiques him, and that she fails to comprehend the significance of what he called the film's "realized mysticism."<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> The truth, however, is that H. D. understands very well the spirituality of the film, as well as its appeal to subjectivity. The real crux has less to do with the film itself, than with certain inconsistencies in H. D.'s film theory more generally—especially the form of subjectivity it prescribes for film, which always refers to the relational process of a decoding spectator, rather than to the finality of the self-contained drama of the film. In Dreyer's film the very fullness of the vision leaves no place for the viewer. Accordingly, Dreyer's film makes H. D. question the very grounds on which such a visionary consciousness might meet up with the logic of pictorial manifestation. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

The Jeanne d'Arc of the incomparable Dreyer it seems to me was kicked toward the angels. There were not there, nor anywhere, hints of the angelic wing-tip, of the winged sandals and the two-edged sword … Such psychic manifestation I need hardly say, need in no way be indicated by any outside innovation of cross lights or of superimposed shadows. It is something in something, something beyond something. It is something one feels … For all our preparation, we are unprepared. This Jeanne d'Arc is sprung upon us and why should it be?

<p class="continued">How does psychic consciousness manifest itself? By what sign or process of even partial signification may the visionary aspect of Joan's consciousness become palpable, visible? H. D. certainly doesn't call for Joan to become "psychologized" through what she calls an "outside sort of beatific screen craft of heavenly vision"—she does not, in other words, believe that the film's characterization would be improved by "seeing" what Joan saw.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> The soul cannot be reduced to any "outside innovation of cross lights or of superimposed shadows" but rather through the evocation, as she says, of "hints." What is called for, then, is a special form of non-depiction that can only be named as a "link … to human consciousness," something to bridge the "gap" left open by the impoverished reality of cinematic representation. This missing psychic "recompense" would not necessarily be something that is positively registered. Rather we might say that H. D. demands of the film a "sign" in much the same way as do Joan's interrogators. Her purpose, however, is not to guarantee the dogmatic truth of these visions with respect to the Church, but rather to serve as an indication, even if indirect, of the poetic aspect of her consciousness, to signal that it exists behind the material surface of Falconetti's "numb dreary physical state."</p>
<p>In this respect, however, H. D.'s complaint seems especially precarious—since Dreyer deliberately taunts the viewer with tight close-ups of Joan's face, substituting this exterior perception for an approximation of Joan's point-of-view. The viewer, in this way, is emphatically placed outside of her visionary consciousness, even while she is clearly in the throes of ecstasy. Although Dreyer intended Falconetti's face to act as a medium for her faith, a window into her soul, such a strategy clearly threatens to negate the primacy of the viewer, who is held at bay from this drama by the very technique that was to have mediated its proximity. We may long for Falconetti's interiority, or for Joan's, H. D. observes, but we are never satisfied of that desire, and instead of Joan's luminous grace, Dreyer has forced us to accept our own longing sent back to us is amplified form. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Of course, this formal difficulty may be said to arise from the film's structuring principle: namely that rather than provide a fanciful visualization or dramatization of the myth of "the maid," <span style="font-style:italic;">The Passion of Joan of Arc</span> was to take the trial proceedings themselves as the starting place for the film's events (although condensing the timeline from a month into a single day). The film's first shot, fittingly enough, is not of Joan's oracular face, but of the damaged binding of the trial proceedings themselves, as the hands of a narrator-re leafs briskly through the pages as if the existence of the text could prove that such things really happened.<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> There is a mysticism in Joan's face throughout the film, to be sure, but Dreyer makes clear that whatever we can know of her, or of her visions, comes to us through a parallel "miracle," that of the survival of the text of the trial.<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> "At the Bibliotheque de la Chambre des Deputes in Paris resides one of the most extraordinary documents in the history of the world," the film begins, "the record of the trial of Joan of Arc, the trial that ended in her death. The questions of the judges and Joan's responses were recorded with great exactitude. Reading it we discover Joan as she was—not in armor—but simple and human … a young woman who died for her country, and we are witness to an amazing drama: a young, pious woman confronted by a group of orthodox theologians and powerful judges." In this way, <span style="font-style:italic;">Jeanne d'Arc</span> exploits the documentary aspect of cinema in order to play upon our consciousness of the film's textual mediation.</p>

<p>The images are not meant to be fanciful extrapolations, recreations of the epic siege on Orleans or any of Joan's participation in the royal intrigue and affairs of state, such as Cecil B. DeMille's 1917 film contained. In exclusively focusing on what had been recorded of Joan's own speech (or at least its reconstruction by the court scribes), Dreyer suggests that the <span style="font-style:italic;">film</span> itself can testify more forcefully to the story's "simple, human" elements. Further, by making the film an elaboration of the trial, or an elaboration of a text (which is always true of a film's relation to its screenplay), the film asks us to consider the role of mediation as an integral part of the film's dramatic principles.</p>
<p>The relation of the film's main action to the text of the trial is significant, then, because it contextualizes H. D.'s sense that the viewer remains hopelessly outside of the visionary  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> heart of the protagonist. In fact, this distance from the content of Joan's subjectivity is shown to be endemic to the text of the trial itself, in which Joan notoriously refused to make an unqualified oath to tell the truth to the court about her visions, making it clear at the beginning of each day of examination that whatever she told would not be the entire truth. Concerning her revelations, especially, Joan refused to give any details, and those which do emerge are emphatically vague. As Karen Sullivan notes in her study of the interrogations, Joan's unwillingness to give any signs as to the veracity of her claims to divine knowledge all but guaranteed an unfavorable verdict:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The visionary who insists upon her subjective impressions of a spirit, impressions that are by definition inaccessible to others, cannot convince others of what she perceives as its identity, nor can she be convinced by a more expert third party, such as a theologian, that she is mistaken. She remains alone, unjudged and unjudgeable, in her inner perceptions.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">If the text of the trial promises a greater proximity to the reality of Joan's story, it almost ensures a corresponding distance from the "subjective impressions" that constitute the living text of her revelations and visionary consciousness, for this is the one area that she was most protective of, and which therefore the texts illuminate the least. For this reason, the close-ups in the film reflect on this tangled relation all the more acutely. The close-up models the film's reliance on its textual foundation because it arrogates itself as a technique of intimacy and direct address, while showing us with startling clarity the limits of such knowledge and the remoteness of Joan's consciousness. For despite all the time that her face spends at the center of the frame, or just for this reason, the close-up images reveal that her eyes are always looking somewhere else.</p>
<p>H. D.'s sense that the film failed to live up to the "truth" of Joan's visionary personality, then, reflects the insistent incongruity between the film as emotional spectacle and the film as object. This is in part due to the fact that H. D. sees herself as a visionary re, and assumes that a "true" representation of Joan's saga will not only conform to her own understanding of ecstatic consciousness, but will do so by unifying the expectations and emotions of the spectator with the film itself. That is, the form of Dreyer's film posits Joan's subjectivity as dependent on its destruction or its disarticulation. And while the film provides the sympathetic monk Massieu (famously played by Antonin Artaud) as reassurance that something of Joan's character is not entirely lost, H. D. maintains that such a sense of identification is made thoroughly unstable.</p>
<p>Joan, in H. D.'s review, becomes a re for interiority itself, for what cannot be shared without violation or loss, without rendering it unrecognizable. Implicit in her critique of the film is the assertion, odd coming from H. D., that language violates subjectivity less (or perhaps violates it better). This is why Joan's name, which H. D. renders affectionately "<span style="font-style:italic;">Jeanne</span>" (and only once "Johanna," as it exists in the only written document bearing her signature), plays such a heavily repetitive and symptomatic role. Such repetition indicates something of the desperation with which H. D., turning away from the implied absence of cinematic representation, asks language to bear, in the increasingly empty space of a name, the burden of identity. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>I think it is that we all have our Jeanne, each one of us in the secret great cavernous interior of the cathedral (if I may be fantastic) of the subconscious. Now another Jeanne strides in, an incomparable Jeanne, indubitably a more Jeanne-ish Jeanne than our Jeanne but it isn't our Jeanne. Worse than that it is a better, more authentic Jeanne than our Jeanne; scathing realism has gone one better than mere imaginative idealism. We know we are out-witted. This is a real, real, Jeanne (poor Jeanne) little mountain Newfoundland puppy, some staunch and true and incomparably loyal creature … This is Athene stripped of intellect, a Telisila robbed of poetry, it is a Jeanne d'Arc that not only pretends to be real, but that is real, a Jeanne that is going to rob us of our own Jeanne.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The very "authenticity" of Falconetti's mediumistic performance, H. D. argues, negates Jeanne's hidden subjectivity, her own recursive "Jeanneness." The film achieves this, perversely, by convincing the audience that nothing of such interiority remains undepicted. In so doing, the film also negates the subjective structure of cinematic spectatorship in general, replacing the anarchic trail of association and fantasy with the "claustrophobic" unfolding of the film's restricted universe ("This must be right … <span style="font-style:italic;">I</span> must be wrong.") In the face of such "perfection," language seems paralyzed, trapped inside the impotent gesturing of naming.</p>
<p>Joan is, paradigmatically, called "incomparable," in the same way that H. D. refers to the film as a piece of "incomparable art," and to Dreyer as an "incomparable artist." This damaging singularity denies both art and experience, insofar as H. D. understands them according to the ecstatic logic of likeness, metaphor, and comparison. Despite her enthusiasm for the felicitous interrelation between literature and film, H. D.'s layered disavowal of Dreyer's <span style="font-style:italic;">Jeanne d'Arc</span> (in spite of all of the ways in which it is structured by a reconstruction of textual modes) reveals her sense that in its "perfect" expression film <span style="font-style:italic;">needs</span> literary consciousness to restore the "poetry" and "intellect" missing from the bare image. In this respect, H. D.'s reading of <span style="font-style:italic;">Jeanne d'Arc</span> unexpectedly echoes Shklovsky's sense that film cannot be understood outside of a literary grammar. The fiction of "pure" cinematic form, nevertheless, plays a crucial role in H. D.'s theorization of film, as well as in her fictional practice, for it sustains her sense that art thrives on its impurity, and that the truly "incomparable" art denies itself because it denies what is not itself.</p>

Nonetheless, as I hope to show, his comments might also be read in the context of film's influence on the literary culture of the early twentieth century, a context, that is, in which "image" and "technique" increasingly could not be made so discrete.</p></div>

Dianne Chisholm is right to point out that "H.D's is surely a mixed <span style="font-style:italic;">medium</span>, a Freudian-Fenollosan-Eisensteinian medium, and auto-bio-thenato-telepatho-cinemato-graph" (Dianne Chisholm, <span style="font-style:italic;">H.

Indeed, it is  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> indicative of his treatment of cinema that he feels the need to preface his discussion of it by turning first to a catalogue of existing arts, in this case music, painting, and literature. Implicitly then, "art" itself, or the "artfulness" of all art, must be reinterpreted if we are to understand how film operates as a form of expressive representation. This is the conclusion reached by Boris Eikhenbaum in his 1926 essay "Literature and Cinema," where he writes: "One thing is clear: we are going through an era in which literary material is being re-examined from the point of view of film. In the face of cinema, literature must realize its own methods in a new way. The development of film poses anew the ancient problem of the relationship and differentiation of the arts."

The tendency of the individual life is to be static rather than dynamic, and this tendency is made into a propulsion by civilization, where the obvious only is seen, and the unexpected rarely happens. When the unexpected does happen, however, and when it is of sufficiently grave import, the unfit perish.

Eisenstein, of course, also conceptualized film from the vantage point of language, and the "'Japanese ideogram"' in particular, but he took this point of origin in a vastly different direction, seeking to discover in language an archaic justification of the "depictability" of meaning.)

D.'s identification with these fixed cinematic stares as a self-conscious construction of lesbian identity in the image of classical aesthetics. See "H.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f32" href="#f32-text">32. </a>According to Woolf, the objects recorded by the cinema have become "not more beautiful in the sense in which pictures are beautiful, but shall we call it (our vocabulary is miserably insufficient) more real, or real with a different reality from that which we perceive in daily life? We behold them as they are when we are not there. We see life as it is when we have no part in it."

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f33" href="#f33-text">33. </a>The emphasis on this materiality suggests the relevance of Judith Brown's argument about the centrality of sensation, as opposed to cognition, in H. D.'s consideration of film. "<span style="font-style:italic;">Borderline</span>, Sensation, and the Machinery of Expression," <span style="font-style:italic;"></span> 14.4 (Nov. 2007), 687–705. Brown's point that the discourse of sensation offers H. D. "a fantasy of experiencing ourselves without the mediation of technology … as originals rather than copies," is especially appropriate, but can be qualified . For it is precisely through the articulation of this immediacy in her criticism that H. D. constructs the saving power of language to counterbalance sensation; and it is in this construction of a language that the mediation of technology is most active.</p></div>

I am completely out of it. This acting, singing, facial beauty is perfected. This screen projection is not a mask, it is a person, a personality. That is just it. Here is art, high art, but is it our <span style="font-style:italic;">own</span> art? Isn't cinema art a matter (or hasn't it been) of inter-action?"

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f43" href="#f43-text">43. </a>Indeed, many of H. D.'s criticisms of Dreyer's film are in fact in resistance to concepts which she herself advocates, and very often the same language returns almost symptomatically in her critique. Praising a cinema of "stark reality" in the essays on the "Cinema and the Classics," for example, she goes on to criticize Dreyer for fostering a film that is "real, real beyond realism" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 113; 132). And even as she comments that Kuleshov uses the screen "like a psychic medium," H. D. takes issue with various aspects of the performances in Dreyer's film, in which Falconetti is said to have dispatched herself "almost mediumistically" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 127; 130).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f44" href="#f44-text">44. </a>Even Pabst disagreed with H. D.'s assessment of the film. "Herr Pabst, it appeared," she writes of her interview with him, "had just come from the early evening performance of <span style="font-style:italic;">Jeanne d'Arc</span>, or <span style="font-style:italic;">Johanna von Orleans</span>, at the Gloria Palast just round the corner. Well, was that it? <span style="font-style:italic;">That</span>—it appeared to me—was 'nothing to write home about'. Mr. Pabst thought otherwise … He lifted a priestly and solemn hand, he would hear nothing, no, nothing whatever against that film. That film was perfect, such technique, such originality, such grandeur, such 'prickle' (does that mean sparkle or merely stickle?), such strength, such beauty, yes, beauty."

Her identification with Joan is made particularly apparent in the <span style="font-style:italic;">roman à clef Asphodel</span> (1921–1922), when Hermione and Fayne visit Rouen, the site of Joan's execution, and become haunted by the unreality of the scene.
