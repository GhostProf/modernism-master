<p>"In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country. We don't have that in our country. I don't know who has told you that we have it." So, to the amusement and jeers of his audience during an appearance at Columbia University in September 2007, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad responded to a question about the report of executions in Iran of suspected homosexuals—<span style="font-style:italic;">hamajensbaaz</span> is the derogatory term the President used.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> Literary modernism—neither European, British, nor U.S. modernism, but the early twentieth-century literature of Iran—might be able to provide Ahmadinejad with an answer to his bafflement. In the well-known "Aref nameh," a linguistically innovative verse satire that appeared in 1921—one year before the publication of Eliot's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>—Iraj Mirza, an Iranian poet and advocate of the modern Iranian state, makes graphically clear whom he thinks suffers from the curse of male homosexuality, and he does so in wry verses directed against a fellow Iranian poet and boy-lover, Aref-nameh of Qazvin (hence the poem's title):</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Oh Lord, what thing is this pedomania<br>        That plagues Aref and greater Tehrania?<br>Why only in this commonwealth<br>        Does sodomy take place with little stealth?<br>The European with his lofty bearing<br>        Knows not the ins and out of <span style="font-style:italic;">garçon</span>-tearing.</p></div></blockquote>
<p>Reversing the dichotomy that Ahmadinejad's rhetoric sets up by declaring Tehranian "garçon-tearing" foreign to the more <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  high-minded European, Iraj proceeds to make his polemical and political point. As long as Iran holds to archaic customs like the separation of the sexes and allegiance to a decadent monarchy, Persian men will not shed their pederastic predilections and the nation will remain caught in a regressive past, unable to enter the era of modernity that Iraj, like many other advocates of Iranian modernization, associated with Europe's virtues of constitutional government and heterosexual normality.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> Obviously, Ahmadinejad abhors the western values that Iraj, eighty years earlier, embraced in the name of modernity, but the two men <span style="font-style:italic;">do</span> agree on one point: sexuality between men has no place in post-Qajar Iran. The rhetorical difference is that Iraj sees Iranian homosexuality as a local problem in need of eradication; Ahmadinejad labels it a Western phenomenon completely foreign to his "motherland." Such a claim, as several recent historians of Iranian sexuality, including Janet Afary and Afsaneh Njamabadi,<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> have demonstrated, is belied by the rich, centuries-long legacy of source material, written and visual, attesting to the presence of men's homoerotic loves and dalliances in pre-modern Iran (<a name="1-text" href="#1">. 1</a> &amp; <a name="2-text" href="#2">2</a>); it is also contradicted by ongoing efforts to eliminate not-so-foreign manifestations of this "phenomenon" from Iran, as well as neighboring Gulf states, by the harshest means possible (<a name="3-text" href="#3">. 3</a> &amp; <a name="4-text" href="#4">4</a>).<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Behind this tangle of conflicting claims ("we don't have it"/ "yes we do") lies one of the great ironies in the history of relations between Christian Europe and Islamic Middle East, one with political as well as poetical resonances for this essay. For the morally charged language of unnaturalness, vice, addiction, and disease used by European commentators for some 400 years to condemn same-sex practice between men in the Middle East is the identical language now used by Islamic fundamentalists who wish to differentiate their cultures from the sexually decadent West. The implication is that if sex between men occurs in the Muslim and Arab worlds, it is a foreign vice the West has exported to infect and undermine Middle Eastern culture.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The way in which male homoerotic desire has provided the symbolic and embodied terrain over which attributions of unnatural sexuality have been volleyed between Christian and Muslim cultures for centuries is part of a complex history that cannot be reduced to the binaries—"East" and "West," "heterosexuality" and "homosexuality," "self" and "other"—that popular imagination too often summons forth when using aspersions of sex between men to categorize and castigate the unknown or unfamiliar. Likewise, the derision that met Ahmadinejad's proclamation at Columbia, however merited on one level, may reveal as much about the modern West's fantasies and misprisions of Middle Eastern sexuality as it does about Ahmadinejad's myopia. Take the photograph (<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>) that circulated with some frequency on the internet in the wake of the Columbia incident, picturing Ahmadinejad kissing another man. The visual punch line plays on the commonplace that those who most vehemently deny homosexuality may protest too much; simultaneously it allows viewers critical of Ahmadinejad to congratulate themselves for being more open-minded than his ilk. Yet this superiority depends on ignoring the cultural mores that make such kisses a perfectly acceptable expression of non-erotic affection in much of the Middle East. A similar mode of humor operates in the cover illustration of the <span style="font-style:italic;">New Yorker</span> (October 2007), where the image of Ahmadinejad playing footsie in a men's bathroom stall (<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>) riffs on the Senator Larry Craig scandal. However gratifying the exposure of right-wing bigots harboring the desires they condemn, the <span style="font-style:italic;">New Yorker</span> cover also capitalizes on, and perpetuates, an unconscious degree of homophobia by equating closet-cases and foreign threats as equivalent objects of ridicule.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> Such humor elides an element of truth in Ahmadinejad's defiantly obtuse statement, insofar as the historical formation of sexual bonds between men in Iran's past has differed significantly from the West's evolution of sexual</p>

<p class="continued">taxonomies and sexual identities. Ahmadinejad is no social construction theorist, to be sure, but his avowal that homosexuality <span style="font-style:italic;">per se</span> "does not exist" in Iran is, at least historically and linguistically, accurate.</p>
<p>As such instances evince, "re-Orienting" one's understanding of Middle Eastern sexuality proves a task easier said than done. Indeed, the disorienting effects of such attempted reorientations are evident in the varied topographies of early twentieth-century literary and visual culture this essay traverses. Ever since the opening of the Middle East to European diplomacy and trade in the late 1500s (England, for one, chartered the Levant Company in 1589 to negotiate trade within the Ottoman Empire, having appointed its first ambassador to the country in 1583<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup>), an array of western writers, travelers, administrators, diarists, artists, and adventurers has left a vivid record of the specter of sodomy and pederasty that haunts their encounters with Levantine sexuality. Sometimes these encounters have been entirely imaginative, and sometimes based in actual experience; sometimes they have been red as voyeuristic spectacle, and sometimes they've formed the traveler's covert goal. Whether feared or desired, I argue here and elsewhere that the sheer possibility of erotic contact with or between men of the "Arabic Orient" has underwritten much of the appeal and practice of the phenomenon we call Orientalism.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> From 1600 to the present, the imaginings and meanings of this perceived topography of male homoerotic desire has multiplied across regions, countries, eras, and cultures, and it has left its traces in fiction, poetry, diaries, travel literature, erotica, ethnography, artwork both high and low, photography, and film.</p>
<p>This essay narrows that scope, offering insight into the ways in which a handful of innovative early-twentieth artists operating outside the penumbra of high modernism participated in, exploited, and responded to this larger paradigm of Orientalizing erotics. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  The works examined in the following pages encompass some twentieth-century res that many students of modernism may never have encountered, such as English aesthete-mystic Aleister Crowley and Dutch Zionist poet Jacob Israel de Haan, some whose names remain unknown, some like Andre Gide who achieved prominence, and others usually associated with Hellenist rather than Orientalist erotica, like Wilhelm von Gloeden. What all these artists share in common is the extent to which they trafficked in the myth of a homoerotic Middle East—the "nearly" Middle East of my title—where male-male desires repressed in the West might more easily find realization, along with the attendant myth of the availability of beautiful youths within such geographies. This subset of queer modernist practice reveals the convergence of three elements:  the bracing impact of the general modernist rebellion against sexual censorship inspiring these writers to engage in daring, often gleefully graphic descriptions of homosexual activity;  the contexts provided by the burgeoning fields of sexology and anthropology, whose prurient-minded imitators produced innumerable volumes about the "Arabic Orient," forming a genre that İrvin Cemil Schick aptly names "ethnopornography"<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup>; and  the degree to which these writers create self-reflexive, allusive texts that imitate, or pretend to be examples of, centuries-old Arabic, Persian, and Ottoman literary genres in order to give historical authority to their homoerotic imaginings. Additionally, in the case of Gide, we see the modernist transformation of the prior century's European tradition of travel narrative into sensuous lyric prose-poems that share significant affinities with the imitations, forgeries, and borrowings of Middle Eastern genres like the <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazal, şehringez</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">rubba'iyat</span>. Throughout, this essay also analyzes the role played by visual modes of representation, particularly turn-of-the-twentieth-century photography, in promoting this queer strand of Orientalist modernism. The conclusion circles back to the contemporary present—by means of an archive of haunting photographic portraits of Taliban recruits unearthed in Afghanistan—to suggest the continuing resonance of these modernist re-orientations as they play out on an international scale today, especially as homosexuality continues to be a touchstone of intercultural impasse, forcing Eros to reveal its other face as Thanatos.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">I</h1>
<p>The imaginative work of the early twentieth-century res at the heart of this essay is not simply the product, as sometimes assumed, of a hegemonic culture's unidirectional projections onto another culture. It is equally the product of a long, complex, and often fluid history of cross-cultural exchange, one that began in earnest when diplomatic and trade relationships among Christian, Ottoman, and Persian worlds began to flourish in the Early Modern period. From roughly 1550-1850 booksellers in Europe turned out a burgeoning number of travel narratives to feed a widespread fascination with, and at times envy of, the seemingly exotic customs, and more specifically the erotic practices, of what might broadly be described as Arab-Islamic culture. To be sure, the primary sexual curiosities that fascinated these writer-observers were heterosexual—most apparent in their fantasies of the harem. But a surprisingly large number of <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  commentators turned their narrative eye, at least for an instant, to the abundance of male-male desire that they espied—or thought they espied—among other forbidden forms of erotic expression. In contrast to the unseen mysteries of the female harem, these homoerotic forms of sexual expression seemed—to European sensibilities—all too visible, too public, staring the observer right in the eye.</p>
<p>Along with a predictable dose of moral outrage, these early Western travelers express amazement time and again at what seems the relative openness of homoerotic expression in the Middle East and North Africa and at its entrenchment on all levels of society, from coffeehouse culture to sultan's court, from bathhouse to janissary barracks. Michael Baudier, a French traveler to Turkey in the 1620s is shocked to find that this vice "serves as an ordinary subject of entertainment" in men's everyday conversations. Three decades later his countryman, Monsieur de Thevenot, matter-of-factly notes that sodomy "is a very ordinary Vice amongst [the Turks], which they care little to conceal," while John Lithgow claims to "have even seene at mid-day" buggerings in Fez. As for Persia, the late fifteenth-century Venetian ambassador, Josafa Barbaro, comments on the existence of a "public space and school [for] Sodomy" in Tabriz, where customers "pay according to [the students'] beauty." A few decades later Portuguese apothecary, Tomas Piras, notes that "for all their good looks most [Persians] are sodomites," adding "there are even public places where they practice this for money." The seventeenth-century French traveler, Jean Chardin concurs with numerous other Middle Eastern travelers who call public coffee houses (Chardin himself is referring to those of Persia) "nothing else in Reality but Shops for Sodomy."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>While such expressions tend to miss an insider's understanding of the complex social and gendered circumstances in which such apparently flagrant public displays occur, one cannot dismiss these observations, <span style="font-style:italic;">tout court</span>, as simple-minded examples of Orientalizing fantasy, exaggeration, or erotic projection. This point has recently been made clear by the groundbreaking work of a number of sophisticated theorists of sexuality whose fluency in Arabic, Persian, and Ottoman Turkish has enabled them to open up immense archives of hitherto unexamined source material. As two of these, Walter Andrews and Mehmet Kalpakli, put it in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Age of Beloveds</span>, "it was easy for the West to eroticize the relations with the Ottoman East because that East had already eroticized its own social and political relationships," such that the homoerotic "was everywhere available for western scholarship and the Western imagination to discover in the East."<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> On the one hand, this new scholarship is careful not to over-idealize, as did some earlier gay scholars, the sexual mores of Arab-Islamic society; Ottomans, Persians, Arabs, or Egyptians did not, contrary to the impression given in such gay-affirmative criticism, live in ultra-permissive societies that indulged in sodomy with impunity. Rather, this scholarship plots out a complex system of sexual and social mores operating throughout Arab-Islamic geographies that allowed thriving if not always welcome homoerotic subcultures to coexist with other subcultures, including legal and religious ones, in a multilayered society whose constituencies often included overlapping members and whose social structures made room for mutually operative contradictions.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> On the other hand, these scholars also make it clear that up to the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-centuries a flourishing culture of male lovers and beloved youths permeated <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  the highest levels of social and political life in the Ottoman and Persian empires, with homoerotic patronage providing an acceptable path to power for youthful beloveds. Most relevant for our purposes, this phenomenon inspired a vast literary outpouring that celebrated this culture of lovers and beloveds: in poetry, in erotic treatises, in bawdy literature, and in the biographies of the great poets and statesmen.</p>
<p>Central to this literary heritage, and at the heart of the modernist appropriations of this tradition, is its celebration of the beautiful boy or beloved youth. The specialized form of lyric known as the <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazal</span>, emerging in the Arabic Umayyad period, flowering under the 'Abbasid caliphates and in Moorish Spain, then taken up by the Persian and Ottoman poets, was dedicated to extolling the male beloved's breathtaking beauty and petulant bravado.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> The <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazal</span> was perfected by the rambunctiously bisexual medieval Persian-Arab poet, Abū Nuwās, whose ability to combine eroticism and reinvigorate conventional poetic metaphor is apparent, even in translation, in lines such as these:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>From the tangled clothing<br>Whiteness surprises:<br>Above the skyline of his waist<br>The moon suddenly rises!<br>. . . . . . . . .<br>See the moon of his face glow<br>Lit by your lust! Wave, overflow<br>And flood this lovely garden!<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The romantic tropes typifying the <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazal</span> can easily transform from florid encomiums into raunchy jests. Exemplary are the following lines from the verse of an unknown Turkish sixteenth-century poet. First apostrophizing the delicacy of the "satin skin" of his "darling boy"—so delicate that even robes made of "rose-petals" chafe him!—the poet suddenly shifts to the more carnal desires motivating his flowery paean:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>So fragile is your radiant thigh<br>It even gets hurt by the morning breeze.<br>Men have fought fiercely for his legs and thighs.<br>My darling boy's lower half is enough for my eyes.<br>Let his beautiful face belong to the others.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In contrast to Abū Nuwās's metaphor, which res the glowing face of the beloved rising like a moon <span style="font-style:italic;">above</span> the "skyline of his waist," this poet jestingly trades the "beautiful face" of his beloved for the equally moon-shaped delights existing <span style="font-style:italic;">below</span> the belt, on his darling's "lower half" (round white buttocks are repeatedly red as lunar landscapes in this poetry).</p>
<p>Such racy declarations are a staple in the tradition of obscene literature and pornographic erotica that also formed a flourishing genre in the pre-modern Middle East.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> The following lines from sixteenth-century Turkish poet and court administrator Gazali's mock-encomium to the joys of the beloved's anus (<span style="font-style:italic;">kun</span>) anticipates the bawdy explicitness we will see in Aleister Crowley's faux-Oriental poetry: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Sometimes it opens like a smiling rose, oh <span style="font-style:italic;">kun</span>!<br>Sometimes it closes and becomes a rosebud lip in wonder, oh <span style="font-style:italic;">kun</span>!<br>It so appears a silver mug of medicine that<br>Fittingly I call it the cure for all, oh <span style="font-style:italic;">kun</span>!<br>What if cock the dragon always pushes at its edge?<br>It is a secret treasure cave filled with gold and silver, oh <span style="font-style:italic;">kun</span>!<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p>Even closer to the modernist experiments this essay canvases is the poetic pleasure of cataloguing the range and variety of available beautiful youth that drives the Ottoman genre of the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span>, or so-called "city-disturber," of which there are 44 extant manuscripts. Derived from an earlier Persian genre celebrating the attractive craftsmen and shop-boys of a given locale, the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> may either survey the gamut of handsome, rambunctious youth of a specific city—giving a kind of sociological cross-section of urban types and trades in lyric form—or it may provide a catalogue of male beauties from across the globe.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> The first poet to substitute the more complex <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazal</span> for that of the four-line <span style="font-style:italic;">rubba'iyat</span> in this genre and hailed by his contemporaries as a great innovator, Sayfī, vows in his catalogue of 124 <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazals</span> dedicated to the boys of Bukhara to drink prohibited wine so that the handsome policeman with whom he's enamored will haul him off to jail<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup>; another poet, Tahcali Yahya, teases the "brilliant Janissary, with a slender re," whom he's just bedded for being hard to kiss in his <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> to the "heart-ravishers" of Istanbul<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup>; and Ottoman poet, Zati, having just sung the praises of some 53 beauties of Edirne, Turkey, claims his effort has only skimmed the surface:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>I have but limned some droplets from the sea<br>Brought some sun motes to visibility.<br>Cypress bodies throng this city's earth<br>T'would take till Judgment day to tell their worth.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">This technique of serial cataloguing goes global in the work of one late eighteenth-century Ottoman court poet whose <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span>, as the next section reveals, plays a central role in an early-twentieth-century appropriation that strategically "re-orients" this poetic genre for queerly modernist ends.</p>

<p>Fāżil Bey Enderuni's <span style="font-style:italic;">Huban-name</span> (1792-93; "Book of Beautiful Boys") is one of five erotic works by this colorful diplomat, administrator, and poet, four of which he composed in <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> form. Fāżil Bey's origins may have influenced his fascination with detailing the charms of lads across cultures. Like many handsome youths brought to Istanbul to be trained as pages, Fāżil was a spoil of war: his father, of Arabic descent and the governor of the Palestine cities of Acre and Safad, had participated in an unsuccessful insurgency that led to his execution by the Ottoman Porte. The head of the occupying army was so taken with the good looks of young Fāżil and his brother that the two were presented to the Sultan as tribute-slaves. Fāżil rose within the Ottoman <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  bureaucracy to assume various diplomatic and administrative posts, fell out of favor, suffered exile on Rhodes, received a pardon from Selim III, and spent his last years back in Istanbul. His one poetic composition that is not a <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Defter-i aşk</span> (1795; "The Register of Love"), is an "amorous autobiography," in Jan Schmidt's phrase, detailing the four great loves of his life, all male and one of whom, the gypsy Çengi Ismail, was a renowned dancer.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> This profession also sparked Fāżil Bey's creative attention in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Çengi-name</span> (undated; "The Book of Dancers"). Written as a series of <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazals</span> in <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> form, this book includes licentious portraits of the city's 43 most famous <span style="font-style:italic;">koceks</span>, or boy-dancers. In addition to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Huban-name</span>, which surveys beautiful boys around the globe, Fāżil Bey authored a companion volume, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Zenan-name</span> (also illustrated and probably composed in the 1790s), enumerating the beautiful women of the world; its lyric portraits are far less complimentary than those in his catalogue of beautiful males (typical of the male elite's general misogyny).</p>
<p>The premise for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Huban-name</span> is set forth in a frame poem, in which the poet is asked by his lover—metaphorically the "Sultan of the climate of the desolate heart"—to reveal "which nations are filled with the most beautiful countenances of youths, / which have the most beautiful men . . . tell me A to Z!"<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> Fāżil Bey rises to his lover's challenge by writing a series of <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazals</span> that reveal the charms not only of Moroccan boys and Greek rowdies, but of British, French, and even New World youths. The manuscript of this verse catalogue in the Istanbul University Library is interspersed with 39 exquisite miniature paintings of such "beaux" (<a name="7-text" href="#7">. 7-10</a>). Each of these visual portraits reinforces the snapshot-like quality of the verse the miniature illustrates. Tantalizingly, these illustrations also demonstrate that the West's Orientalizing gaze was not a one-way street, revealing a Middle Eastern penchant for the charms of pink-cheeked European youths (<a name="1-text" href="#1">. 11 &amp; 12</a>) as well as lads closer to home.</p>

<p>How did I learn of Fāżil Bey, and how does his <span style="font-style:italic;">Huban-name</span> relate to queer permutations of Orientalizing modernism? My initial source—the only one available in a European language—was a slim volume, published as <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Livre des Beaux</span> in a limited edition of 350 copies in Paris in 1909, then reproduced in 1969. While the introduction claims the text is an accurate translation of Fāżil Bey's Ottoman Turkish to French and gives a brief account of the poet's life, an endnote in the 1969 text mysteriously and contradictorily remarks that "certain people" (unnamed) have attributed the 1909 volume "to Pierre Loti, Pierre Loüys, as well as [to] André Gide . . . [T]his book . . . remains anonymous and has never been reedited."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> Loti, Loüys, and Gide, of course, are late nineteenth-century or early-modernist authors known for their artistic and homoerotic investments in the Middle East or North Africa. Robert Aldrich, a historian who stumbled on this French edition, takes this statement of anonymous authorship at face value in <span style="font-style:italic;">Colonialism and Homosexuality</span> , assuming that Fāżil Bey never existed and that the volume is a hoax, a pornographic "send-up" of Orientalism that self-consciously uses the form of the "lost manuscript"—accompanied by pseudo-scholarly introduction and pompous footnotes—to poke fun at European stereotypes of male love in the Arab-Muslim East.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>As the biographical record indicates, Aldrich is wrong on the latter account—Fāżil Bey <span style="font-style:italic;">was</span>, indeed, a real person, a well-known poet, bureaucrat, and court administrator whose existence is documented in the Turkish record as well as in English accounts of Ottoman poetry. The purported source of <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Livre des Beaux</span>, the Ottoman <span style="font-style:italic;">Hubanname</span>, exists in manuscript form in various rare book collections and in a transliteration into modern Turkish printed in Istanbul in 1945.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> But as a comparison of the Turkish manuscripts and the French "translation" reveals, Aldrich is correct in his surmise that the anonymous editor/translator is an early twentieth century aesthete playing loose and easy with the original. True, this French "translator" occasionally borrows random lines verbatim—thereby revealing a precise knowledge of the original—but he typically bends these borrowings to fit his own poetic conceits, inserting extended riffs and elements of plotting entirely absent in the Ottoman text. The overall result is a series of prose-poems that are far and away the product of his own creative imagination, adding a degree of verisimilitude and erotic immediacy lacking in Fāżil Bey's allusive, generalizing style. While there is absolutely no evidence to support the 1969 edition's suggestion that notables such as Loti, Loüys, or Gide might have been the volume's anonymous author, the publisher's desire to circulate such rumors, if only a ploy to sell more copies, is a testament to the interface between this text's modernist and Orientalist impulses.</p>
<p>The most obvious sign of the French text's modern authorship lies in a comparison of the contents of the French volume and the Turkish manuscript. Notably, the French text creates out of whole cloth a number of portraits of boys of nationalities, countries, and cities not included in the late eighteenth-century Ottoman manuscript. These additions extend its Orientalist reach to include the <span style="font-style:italic;">beaux</span> of Ceylon, Java, Malaysa, China, and Borneo. Even more revealing is the fact that the French volume <span style="font-style:italic;">omits</span> all the portraits of Western youth who re as objects of desire in Fā. zil's taxonomy (including French, Austrian, Dutch, British, Spanish, Russian, and New World lads). Evidently the French author-translator assumed that such Occidental objects of desire were not "foreign" enough to meet the exotic expectations of a select European homophilic readership in quest of Orientalist thrills. Another suspect element is the pseudonym that the modern volume's introduction gives to "<span style="font-style:italic;">notre eminent collaborateur</span>," the purported translator working from the original: <span style="font-style:italic;">Pacha à Trois Queues</span>. Literally, the term refers to Turkish nobles who are allowed to use three rows, or lines ("<span style="font-style:italic;">queues</span>") of horses to draw their equipages. But as Aldrich correctly notes, and as turn-of-the-century French readers would know, this pseudonym puns upon the fact that <span style="font-style:italic;">queue</span> is a vernacular term for "cock." Thus the "third line" or limb of the pasha, dangling as it were between his two other limbs or legs, is his penis.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> The fact that our "Pacha" is said to be a Turkish native living in Paris and a bibliophile who has disguised himself in an array of native costumes to gather information about the "<span style="font-style:italic;">Beaux de toutes les contrées d'Islam</span>" provides another hint that the "Pacha" is a fiction, a front for the knowing author who has no doubt read his Sir Richard Burton.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup></p>
<p>This trail of evidence suggests that the anonymous begetter of <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Livre des Beaux</span> was a European <span style="font-style:italic;">belle lettrist</span> familiar enough with a copy of the actual <span style="font-style:italic;">Huban-name</span> to <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  render a convincing imitation: clearly, he is an erudite Orientalist, knowledgeable in the tropes of <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazal</span> poetry, capable of making sometimes telling distinctions among various Middle Eastern cultures and customs. And he's a fairly talented writer as well, creating impressionistic mood pieces in the form of prose-poems that approximate the metaphoric lyricism and arch knowingness of the verse originals.</p>
<p>The opening lines of "The Beauty of Baghdad" give a sense both of the author's familiarity with prior tradition and his tongue-in-cheek self-consciousness, both of which work to belie the volume's claim to be a faithful reproduction of the work of Fāżil Bey:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>The boy from Baghdad is the Khan of smirks and sugar-sticks.</p>
<p>His cheek surpasses the fresh rose, and his lips new wine. His curls are of hyacinth and his eyebrow of black ermine.</p>
<p>He knows the divine <span style="font-style:italic;">Thousand Nights and a Night</span> by heart, a book which the Turks have the stupidity of scorning.</p>
<p>Alas! Where are the Abbasids and my exhilarating precursor Abu-Nuwas? In that epoch, Baghdad was the paradise of poets, jewelers, striplings, and lovers. Now, it's only a heap of ruins.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">LB</span>, 31)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">While the second line repeats the <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazal</span>'s traditional tropes of male beauty (cheeks like fresh roses, lips like wine, and so forth)—several of which occur in the much longer opening metaphors unfolded by Fāżil Bey—the first line is pure invention, and its sardonic acknowledgment that the city's youngsters are not all hyacinth and roses (nor hardly "Khan[s]"), but adeptly smirking actors, puts the conventional description that follows into rative quotation marks. Likewise, the references to "my exhilarating" (and bisexual) precursor Abū Nuwās and the "divine" <span style="font-style:italic;">Thousand Nights</span> indicate a self-reflexive use of literary history, a deliberate establishment of lineage ("<span style="font-style:italic;">my</span> precursor"), and a retrospective irony typical of modernist aesthetics (modern Baghdad as a "waste land").<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup></p>
<p>The latter image of Baghdad as a bygone paradise now reduced to a heap of ruins is entirely the creation of the modern author. Further, this <span style="font-style:italic;">mise-en-scene</span> provides the springboard for what becomes the persona's highly idiosyncratic portrait of the working-class Baghdad youth he claims as his lover:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>But choice adolescents still flow between the ruins, and mine, for example, a carpet merchant from the bazaar, excelling at the art of putting off till tomorrow things that should be done today, wins more money with his idle buttocks than a miller can produce of flour turning his grist-stone always</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">LB</span>, 31).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The punning analogy between the boy's buttocks and the miller's grist-stone cleverly condenses an anecdote in Fāżil Bey's poem, in which the son of miller who has gone to Baghdad refuses to return home to claim his patrimony because he's found that selling his "ass" in the big city is much more profitable than grinding flour. In fact, this bawdy anecdote is original neither to Fāżil Bey nor his purported translator—a version penned <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  four centuries earlier is included in al-Tīfashi's <span style="font-style:italic;">Delight of Hearts</span>.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> What follows for the rest of the portrait, however—the depiction of a sexual tryst between speaker and the Baghdad boy—is woven whole-cloth from the modern author's imagination:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>We became acquainted with each other, he and I, in a narrow alley: there was, at the front of our impromptu chamber, an old wall without window, scaling and rough; and as we rested, he seemed to see in the protruding stone the outlines of res: there, the beautiful Zummurad, and there, the young jaundiced man, and there the sympathetic adulterer and Princess Nouranhour [characters from <span style="font-style:italic;">Thousand Nights</span>]; and our reverie followed their nighttime steps as they traversed the old capital of Al-Rachid, the wild one; his grand vizier, Giafar, uneasy in his thoughts; and the eunuch Massrour who rolls his white eyes</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">LB</span>, 31-2).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The dream of Baghdad's past grandeur is thus conjured up as a dream itself, a dream shared between sexual partners in a post-coital reverie in a realistically-drawn, debris-strewn alley where the Baghdad boy uses his imagination to create literary magic from a crumbling wall. This nostalgia for vanished greatness is at once a familiar Orientalist trope <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> a sentiment common to the poetry of the 'Abbasids and Abū Nuwās; the existential rue in the 1909 speaker's juxtaposition of ephemerality (the tryst) and timelessness (the immortality of art) strikes a resolutely modernist note. Likewise, the coitus between poet and youth adds a level of erotic immediacy and empathy that, in contrast to Orientalist stereotype, complicates the hierarchies of subject/object. For, in the end, the lyric expression grants the boy an even greater inner life than the speaker—indeed, the last line leaves the reader inside the world of the boy's imagination, in a continuous present where, as the shift in verb tenses indicates, Massrour still "rolls his white eyes."</p>
<p>The climactic portrait in <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Livre des Beaux</span>, describing the Byzantium boy of Istanbul, captures the melding of the stock images of beauty expected of all Middle Eastern love poetry, the realistic grace-notes and glimpses of urban local color typical of the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> genre, and an almost postcolonial understanding of the melancholies of dispossession and the operation of what Homi K. Bahba has called native mimicry.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> In the following lines, the youth—who turns out to be a dancing-boy, a profession associated with sexual availability throughout the Middle East—is following some prospective, lewd "clients" ("<span style="font-style:italic;">Francs lubriques</span>") up the hill of Galata, the Greek and European quarter of Istanbul where, since the establishment of the Ottoman Empire, homosexual trysts between Turks, as well as between Turks and foreigners, most often occurred:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>The Greek boy descended from the Byzantines unites the eternal perfection and precision of form, the grace of ancient times, and a certain modern melancholy.</p>
<p>. . . As this stripling ascends Galata this morning under the splendor of an azure, sun-filled sky, trailing a group of lewd Franks, one of the latter comments that God must have created the boy from a divine blueprint encompassing all the delicacies born of the Mediterranean.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Imitating the traditional genre's mingling of high and low, the text next juxtaposes its universalizing description of this youth's beauty (his "eternal perfection" unites aspects of the entire Mediterranean) with a series of dashes of local color entirely original to the French text designed to evoke his earthy materiality and the immediacy of his daily existence:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Encircled by blockheads, curs, pickpockets, and Effendis in a string, he holds, from one hand, by its tied talons, a living goose and, in the other, he carries to his violet lips a flaky gateau glistening with honey.</p>
<p>. . . He has a delicate flaw in his way of pronunciation, though: he can't pronounce "ch": for <span style="font-style:italic;">Pacha</span> he lisps <span style="font-style:italic;">Passa</span>.</p>
<p>This is a small blemish, one that makes for piquant ambiguities: for <span style="font-style:italic;">chic</span> he says <span style="font-style:italic;">sik</span>; so much the better!"</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">LB</span>, 77-8).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">So much the better, in the writer's opinion, because <span style="font-style:italic;">sik</span> is Arab slang for "cock." This pun is another clue to the portrait's European, modern provenance; for the pun only exists if one is speaking in French ("chic" for "sik").<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup></p>
<p>In a jaunty tone, the narrator assures his reader that, even if the market were to suffer a down-turn, this cocky Byzantium beauty would always be in demand among his admirers, both Ottoman and Franks. But almost immediately the portrait begins to grow darker, as narrator moves into the interior viewpoint of the boy himself:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>With reason, he abhors Turks to the bottom of his heart, but he dissimulates with the ease of a jaded diplomat, and he abides peaceably among their symposia of voluptuaries—those sons of Osman whom he wishes God would banish from Grand Constantinople</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">LB</span>, 78).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The sudden interjection of this boy's hatred of Turks, along with the sardonic reference to the "jaded" profession of diplomacy, permits the narrator cleverly to evoke both the Ottoman Empire by which this descendent of Byzantium feels oppressed <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> the practiced arts of disguise that allow this youth to veil his true feelings about the "sons of Osman" who seek out his sexual services.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> This turn makes for the portrait's final, almost shocking shift in tone:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>If the opportunity were to present itself, he would wrench baby Muslims from the wombs of their mothers: in reality he restrains himself from such ruin, dancing instead in the taverns of Galata for all the bigots of d'Eyoub</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">LB</span>, 78).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The fact that d'Eyoub is a conservative Muslim suburb of Istanbul drives home the point that many of the boy's pleasure-seeking patrons in Galata aren't just "Franks" but are Turks, "sons of Osman." Whatever the overall Orientalising tendencies of this twentieth-century free improvisation on the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> original, its portrait of the Byzantium youth <span style="font-style:italic;">also</span> provides an acute, even poignant analysis of the psychological workings of colonialism, in this case from the point of view of one of the peoples subsumed under Ottoman rule after the conquest of Greek Constantinople in 1453. The <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  lingering resentments of this conquest contribute to the "modern melancholy" (line 1) of contemporary, ethnically diverse Istanbul depicted in this prose-poem (such melancholy, or <span style="font-style:italic;">huzun</span>, is also central to Orhan Pamuk's memoir, <span style="font-style:italic;">Istanbul: Memories and the City</span><sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup>), and the residue of this legacy permeates the ambiguous erotics whereby the Greek dancing boy allows himself to be the erotic darling of Franks and Muslims alike, as a cover for the profound hatred he really feels. In such instances, the modernist self-reflexivity accompanying this text's homoerotic thematics makes for an unexpectedly keen insight that pierces its Orientalist facade.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">III</h1>
<p>The pseudo-scholarly apparatus that accompanies <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Livre des Beaux</span>, including biographical preface and seemingly recondite footnotes, is a trademark of the burgeoning fields of anthropology and sexology from the turn of the century up to the 1930s. Often citing Sir Richard Burton as their inspiration, these texts compose what Schick in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Erotic Margin</span> calls "ethnopornography," a distinctive genre in which citation serves as the pretext for prurient accounts of exotic otherness. The sexual explicitness that characterizes much of literary modernism's rebellion against Victorian prudery gained its traction in part because of the influx of such pseudo-scientific publications into the marketplace, and in part because of those printers and publishers on the Continent interested in profiting from such sexually explicit examples of Orientalist erotica.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> Boasting titles such as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Turkish Art of Love</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Amour aux colonies</span> (1893; translated into English as "Untrodden Fields of Anthropology"), <span style="font-style:italic;">The Plague of Lust</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">Moeurs Orientales: Le Huis-close de l'ethnographie</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthropological and Ethnological Studies in the Strangest Sexual Acts in Modes of Love of All Races</span> , and <span style="font-style:italic;">Darkest Orient</span> , these "studies" anachronistically mix source materials from multiple time periods and cultures in order to create the image of an unchanging, timeless "Oriental sexuality." Significantly for our purposes, this ethnopornography also included numerous hoaxes parading (like <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Livre des Beaux</span>) as original work: purported translations of ancient Eastern erotica, discovered manuscripts, imprints claiming to have been published in Constantinople by non-existent presses to lend authority to their specious accounts, and the like.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> The Orientalist tradition of the faked translation is not new; Montesquieu exploited the format in <span style="font-style:italic;">Lettres persanes</span> , written in the voices of two fictional Persian correspondents traveling throughout Europe; Petit de la Croix produced an entirely fictional "translation" of "Arabic" tales under the title <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Mille et un jours</span>  into order to capitalize on the success of Galland's <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Mille et une nuits</span>. What is new about these early-twentieth-century hoaxes is the degree of their sexual explicitness, which owes both to the war on prudery waged by literary modernists and the expanding field of ethnology. What is also new is the range of visual modes of ethnopornography available to such writers.</p>
<p>From the turn of the twentieth century on, various European entrepreneurs began producing erotic photographic images of North Africa and Middle East. Although such photography often purported to be "scientific," its goal was to cater to Europeans' sexual <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  fantasies of exoticism, as Malek Alloula has demonstrated in his analysis of erotic post-cards in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Colonial Harem</span>.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> Alloula dwells on the proliferation of images of nude women from the Maghreb, linking the scopophilic desire to peek inside the forbidden harem to the colonial imperative to master the colonized other. Less widely known is the thriving commerce in homoerotic images of Egyptian and North African male youth in the decades that Wilde, Forster, and Gide, among others, were seeking, and finding, sexual fulfillment in these regions. Baron Wilhelm Von Gloeden is best known for his vast photographic archive (some 7000 plates) in which boys of Taormina, Sicily, are posed nude and near-nude in what Roland Barthes identifies as kitsch Hellenic trappings in open-air tableaux.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> But Von Gloeden also dabbled in non-Hellenic modes of Orientalist homoerotica, contact sheets of which were mailed to the Baron's discrete homosexual clientele all over Europe. From such visual catalogues, his customers could select the images they wanted to purchase (<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 13</a>). Although such photographs were originally slated for private collectors, Gert Schiff notes that they quickly "found their way into the most respected periodicals dedicated to photography, art, or ethnology," making the Baron a rich man.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup></p>

<p>I want to propose that these contact sheets serve as modern-day, western, <span style="font-style:italic;">visual</span> equivalents of the poetic genre of the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span>, offering a catalogue, in pictorial rather <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  than poetic form, of the supposedly available boys of the Middle East. Each individual image is crafted to intimate a story in which homoerotic desire and foreign otherness reinforce each other. But the mechanisms of representation complicate these portraits in unpredictable ways. In <a name="4-text" href="#4">re 14</a>, from the series "Ahmed 1890-1900," the pensive dark eyes of its subject gaze back at the camera from under an Arabic headdress, soliciting the spectator's gaze. To the degree that the eloquence of the boy's eyes seem to speak for some truth of self, this particular <span style="font-style:italic;">mise-en-scene</span> succeeds in eclipsing the reality lying behind that gaze: the fact is that "Ahmed" is in fact a Sicilian youth dressed up as an Arab—this is the "nearly" Middle East of Orientalist fantasy indeed. No doubt his headdress is one that von Gloeden pulled out of his costume box, given that a similar one appears in the photographer's own self-portrait, titled, ironically enough, "Il Moro" (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 15</a>).<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> In a second re from this series, the same model's robes have</p>

<p class="continued">been parted beneath his neck to convey the suggestion that more warm brown flesh continues below the frame (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 16</a>). In contrast to Sicilian youths dressed up as Arabs, Von Gloeden shot one series, "Junger Araber," on location in Algeria, but the fact that he is using natives as his models on this occasion does not mean the images are any the less aestheticized or posed. These photographs make the most of the handsome features of its subjects, as the artful profile of the mascaraed young man in <a name="7-text" href="#7"> 17</a> and the muscular, raised arm of the turbaned man in <a name="7-text" href="#7"> 18</a> attest. The Orientalist obsession with tropes of veiling and unveiling, associated in the literature with the unseen mysteries of the female harem, is given an explicitly homoerotic, pederastic twist in one photograph in which the transparent "veil" draped over the model's body only emphasizes the fact that his anatomy is fully visible. The combination of Hellenic and Middle Eastern iconography in <a name="7-text" href="#7">re 19</a> creates an aura of sensual languor that could <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  exist anywhere in the southern Mediterranean: such a stripping of cultural specificity is part and parcel of the traditional machinery of Orientalism.</p>

<p>Ethnopornographic photography was also a specialty of the team of Rudolph Lehnert and Ernst Landrock, who established studios in Tunis and Cairo from 1905-30. Revealing a much more discerning eye for nuances of lighting, shadow, frame, and perspective than von Gloeden, photographer Lehnert shot everything from antiquities to nudes to feed a growing European appetite for visual representations of exoticism and difference. The fact that he worked on location, using indigenous models, might seem to give his work a greater stamp of ethnographic authenticity. But his subjects are as staged as those of von Gloeden in order to satisfy the tastes and predetermined fantasies of his audience. Of particular interest are two shots of one model wearing the same head-dress but different robes in different settings (<a name="0-text" href="#0">. 20 and 21</a>). One source labels the first image "Cairo 1910," another labels the second image "1904," yet another identifies the first as "Tunis 1910" and yet two more poses by the same model as "Tunis 1904"—whereas all were obviously photographed in the same time and place (the correct identification is "Tunis 1904"). This discrepancy tells us something about the spatial-temporal transportability of the erotic fantasy of the sexually available <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

The taboo of race rather than age is breached in a series of rare plates titled "La Seduction" (Tunis 1907), where two adult men, one indigenous and one European, engage in erotic couplings in the outdoors; the noticeably darker Tunisian is at the service of his colonial master in each image. Other studios, such as J. Geiser, also circulated postcard images ranging from young boys (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 23</a>) to strikingly handsome Bedouins (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 24</a>). Not unlike the function that <span style="font-style:italic;">sehrengiz</span> verse catalogues filled for an earlier Middle Eastern culture, the genre of the homoerotic photograph catered to the fantasy among its European clientele that a cornucopia of riches in the shape of male beauties awaited for the taking in North Africa and the Middle East.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">IV</h1>
<p>The youthful male object of desire—along with the anxieties that his inconstancy may produce in his admirer—forms the through-line of Aleister Crowley's faux-Persian poem sequence, <span style="font-style:italic;">Bagh-i-Muattar</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">The Scented Garden of Abdulah the Satirist of Shiraz</span>. This pornographic <span style="font-style:italic;">jeu d'esprit</span> appeared in 1910, the same period in which homoerotic postcards such as those produced by Lehnert and Landrock were traversing Europe and England. Notorious in his day as an occultist, experimenter in mind-altering drugs, and proponent of "sex magick," Crowley was also a voluminous writer, producing treatises on mysticism, books of sacred revelations, experimental fiction ("novelissim"), plays, and collections of poetry ranging from the pornographic to the spiritual. Although Crowley is largely forgotten today, aficionados keep his memory alive: the Beatles featured him as one of the cut-outs on the cover of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</span>, and he lives on in various graphic novels and comic books that dabble in the occult. Crowley entered Cambridge in 1895, the year the Wilde trials began, where he was exposed to the Decadent movement in literature, explored his bisexuality, and became involved (like Yeats) in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. While in Egypt in 1904, he had a mystical experience in which his invocation of Horus led to a vision in which the god appeared and dictated the <span style="font-style:italic;">Book of the Law</span>, much of it in numerical cipher, which Crowley made the foundation of his religious philosophy Thelema.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> In Nepal Crowley set about studying the Persian language and Sufi doctrines when he decided to return to England via Iran. As part of his study, he began composing poems in imitation of the classical Persian poets. These efforts inspired the interconnected series of <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazals</span> published in 1910 as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Scented Garden</span>, purported to be the mystic writings of one "Abdullah al Haji" (circa 1600 A.D.).</p>
<p>This ribald collection of homoerotic verse, like other modernist texts whose English authors feared the Home Office's censorship, was typeset in Paris, then made available in England by subscription through the London Orientalist Probsthain and Company in a limited edition of 200. The era was a touchstone for modernist battles against censorship, of course—Joyce's <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> was seized by New York Customs in 1923, Woolf <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and Forster testified at the obscenity trial of Radclyffe Hall's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Well of Loneliness</span> in 1928. The prospectus of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Perfumed Garden</span> bore the teasing disclaimer, "As typical of erotic literature, the circulation will be most strictly confined to bonafide scholars of mysticism, anthropology, and the like"—although it doesn't take much to imagine the clientele to whom "the like" refers (<span style="font-style:italic;">SG</span>, 10). Nor did the winking claim of scholarly intent fool the HM Customs office, which confiscated the volume in 1924, destroying nearly all extant copies in 1926.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup></p>
<p>If <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Livre des Beaux</span> disguises its modernist provenance by claiming to be a straightforward translation of Fāżil Bey, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Scented Garden</span> wears its pretext much more lightly. Purporting on the title page to be the translation of a "rare . . . manuscript by the Late Major Lutiy and Another," the text is self-consciously structured, as Martin P. Starr puts it, as "a series of veils" that can only be penetrated by those readers of "empathetic interests" who possess the keys to unlock its knowledge (<span style="font-style:italic;">SG</span>, 5). The reader's first clue that this is an invention for a homosexual coterie, much in the same spirit as Djuna Barnes's equally genre-defying <span style="font-style:italic;">Ladies Almanack</span> , is the suggestive tone of the dedication that follows the table of contents. Utilizing a series of phallic metaphors, the fictitious translator, Major Lutiy dedicates the book "to those persons whose unbending uprightness, penetration, retentiveness, capacity for hard work, overflowing ability, and inside knowledge have so much enlarged the fundamental basis of my philosophy"—a philosophy literally grounded in the "fundament" or anus of the poems' beloved, a not-altogether-faithful Persian boy named Habib (<span style="font-style:italic;">SG</span>, n.p.). A second clue to the volume's status as a hoax exists in Major Lutiy's name: <span style="font-style:italic;">liwat</span> is Arab for sodomy, and a <span style="font-style:italic;">luti</span> is the active partner in the act of pederasty. A third key emerges in the fictive Lutiy's account of the discovered volume in his introduction. Stationed in "Mohammedan India" (and thereby adding to the colonialist <span style="font-style:italic;">frisson</span>), the Major hires an instructor to teach him Persian—a tutor whose last name is "Tantra," a sly allusion to the Eastern practice in which sexual intercourse leads to the mystical expansion of self.</p>
<p>As Lutiy also reveals in the introduction, his tutor is so impressed that his pupil hasn't, like other exploitative Anglos, peremptorily bid him "procure . . . a fat and fair boy" for his amusement, that he freely gives Lutiy something even better, namely "a sacred and secret" manuscript expressed, as Crowley puts it with a poker face in his autobiography, "in the symbolism of Persian piety."<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> This manuscript, purportedly dating circa 1600 A.D., is titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Bagh-i-Muattar</span> (which translates "The Scented Garden"<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup>). The author of this "manuscript" is Abdullah el Haji—like Lutiy, yet another fictional construct—whose over-the-top poetic name or <span style="font-style:italic;">Takhallus</span>, El Qahar, translates "The Conqueror." The text's 42 <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazals</span> have been shuffled out of order, so Lutiy reports, but soon enough he discovers the key to their arrangement, thereby unlocking a "complete system of philosophy" in which nothing less than pederasty becomes <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> means of attaining transcendent Oneness. Citing his "very handy" knowledge of Burton's writings—a nod to the homosexual cognoscenti for whom Burton was as much a touchstone as Wilde—the fictional Lutiy presents the reader with a "translation" of this mystical text accompanied by scholarly apparatus: footnotes, footnotes within footnotes, the singling out of stanzas <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of spurious authorship (in what is itself a totally spurious text), and—the joke of all jokes—an appended essay by a fictional Anglican clergyman living in Mandalay who pleads in florid language for an understanding of the spiritual excellencies of pederasty (<span style="font-style:italic;">SG</span>, 3). The good clergyman also makes an implicit case for proto-modernist writing when he links artists who care about form and style to homosexual men as equally elect minorities: "A stylist is as direct a miracle of God as a sodomite." The artist's "perfect freemasonry of style and manner" echoes Lutiy's description in his introduction of that "Freemasonry of Paederasts" who recognize each other instinctively, "mak[ing] the formality of introduction superfluous among free companions of the Craft"—a brotherhood that makes sure its "secret" doctrines, such as those revealed in el Haji's sacred text, remain the exclusive "property" of those elected ones "worthy of it" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SG</span>, 30; 12-13). Indeed, Lutiy claims the <span style="font-style:italic;">Bagh-i-Muattar</span> manuscript has only been passed on to him because Tantra has recognized him to be "one of the <span style="font-style:italic;">illuminati</span>," that is, one with whom such contraband knowledge will be safe. The "Craft[s]" of the Artist and Pederast are thus teasingly interwoven in the fictive Lutiy's preemptive defense of the sexually explicit contents of his translation, serving notice to those "notoriously foul-minded Anglo-Saxon[s]" who would dare subject the manuscript's "exquisitely sacred" symbolism to "the prurient jest or prudish reproach."<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup></p>
<p>Halfway through the introduction, Lutiy also reveals that he has teamed up with another scholar (only referred to as "Another" on the title page), whose duty it is "to cover ethnographical, critical, and other interesting points"—a self-reflexive nod to the ethnopornographic traditions described in the prior section, even as the scholarly talents of this collaborator are called into question by his familiarity with those "<span style="font-style:italic;">other</span> interesting points" (which become all the more sexually suggestive for going unnamed) (<span style="font-style:italic;">SG</span>, 10). An even more dizzying play of text, intertext, and countertext is created midway through this introduction when, in a parenthesis, this second personage informs the reader "Lutiy" has died! Thus he has taken over the editorship of the manuscript, adding his own footnotes to Lutiy's. Finally, a bracket at the very end of the introduction informs the reader that the Major's name, "Lutiy," is in fact a <span style="font-style:italic;">nom-de-plume</span> that the current (anonymous) editor has retained in deference to the wishes of the late Major's widow. No ground of origins or authorship remains stable in this <span style="font-style:italic;">jeu d'esprit</span>.</p>
<p>As in a Nabokovian text, the notes are as much part of the text's fun as the poems they gloss. They parody both the kind of note that Burton supplies in his work to add irrelevant but titillating detail and the pseudo-scholarly citation that ethnopornographers use to throw sand in the eyes their readers. They serve, too, to show off the author's depth of Orientalist knowledge as he teases out word-plays in the (non-existent) Persian text by setting calligraphic equivalents next to each other.<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> The notes also parody the esoteric nature and excesses of literary criticism, especially in glosses where Lutiy and the unnamed second Editor assign wildly improbable "allegorical" meanings to sexual passages that are anything but spiritual. The sublimely ridiculous level to which such notes aspire is illustrated in poem 35, where El Qahar boasts of his member rising and falling a thousand times in one night of passion. Fumes "A.L." in the note: "Surely an Oriental exaggeration!" His successor, the second Editor, disagrees in a parenthesis he <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  adds <span style="font-style:italic;">inside</span> Lutiy's note: "Not at all. I do not think El Haji necessarily means separate and distinct emissions; he may mean thrusts." Thereupon he calculates the number of thrusts-per-minute it would take to fulfill this requirement, concluding that El Qahar could have reasonably thrust 1000 times in four hours and ten minutes—a not unreasonable length of time for one practiced in the arts of tantric self-control (<span style="font-style:italic;">SG</span>, 111)!</p>
<p>So much for the notes; what of the poem sequence itself? While the format is evocative of the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span>, Crowley's sequence of <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazals</span> focuses on a single erotic object, El Qahar's fifteen-year-old paramour Habib, rather than on a series of boys. More specifically, the sequence focuses on Habib's anus—or, in Crowley's preferred Latinate term, his podex. However wildly implausible it might seem to dedicate an entire volume to so "fundamental" a subject as the fundament, Crowley succeeds by giving the series of poems an arc reminiscent of the sonnet sequences of Wyatt, Sydney, and Shakespeare. The initial euphoria of all-consuming passion is followed by Habib's sexual betrayals and jealousy-inducing triangulation; El Qahar's torment and dejection yields to the sadistic reassertion of supremacy over his straying beloved. In turn, their reunion reinstates love's necessary illusion, which ironically means El Qahar's maintaining the fiction of the unblemished, rosebud-like delicacy of his beloved's podex after declaring it has been stretched impossibly wide by the boy's wanton behavior.</p>
<p>Crowley's playfulness in mixing the sacred and profane, and in bending traditional Persian and Sufi metaphors to his queer ends, achieves a kind of mastery in poem 6, whose title, "The Curtain," alludes to the hidden mysteries of the Greater Reality. The italicized summary running across the top of the page—"The Impotence of Thought to perceive Reality"—provides a clue to the poem's thematic: the true path to transcendent Reality, the still center of the spinning world, lies not in the mind but in an altogether more "fundamental" realm, one in which achieving potency is no problem at all:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>Thy podex, like a rose, within<br>Thy buttocks, sprays of Jessamine,</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>Buds to my kisses; then the wine<br>Sets this old head of mine a-spin,</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>So that I push thee to thy knees—<br>A worship, darling, not a sin. . . .</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Such mixture of the sacred and profane—worshipping the uplifted buttocks of what could otherwise be a youth kneeling to pray—is typical of the Persian masters that Crowley is imitating; simultaneously it heightens the poem's modernist impulse to shock and titillate. In the immediately following lines, El Qahar bemoans the fact that no matter how deep he plunges, he cannot reach Habib's "Self," the hidden "real," as long as he is consumed by thought. Thereupon he draws the following distinction between reason and feeling: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>So, when I think, I cannot pierce<br>The truth of things; I cannot win</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>Unto the real; life's wheel is kept<br>From turning by its axle-pin.</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>But swing thine hips and smile upon<br>The hideous world's malicious grin!</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>Then when we end, the task is light:<br>Bid El Qahar once more begin!</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SG</span>, 47)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Sex, not thought, is what sets the wheel of life spinning again, just as Habib's podex, the still point at the center of his swinging buttocks, turns out to be the pivot of the spinning world. If continual intercourse with Habib is the true vehicle to transcendent knowledge, all the more reason, the poet implies, to "once more begin!"<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup></p>
<p>For all this sexual bravado, however, Crowley uses the occasion of Habib's infidelities to poke fun at universal male anxieties about prowess, virility, and size. El Qahar's greatest fear is that Habib is attracted to his other suitors because they are better endowed, which makes it all the more imperative that, upon Habib's contrite return, El Qahar re-instate the fantasy of his own phallic supremacy: "It is indeed the fact, O gazelle-eyed boy, that thy podex is excessively wide"—stretched, that is, by all his infidelities—"but my member can fill it . . . !", whereupon El Qahar proceeds to tell his readers why in graphic terms (<span style="font-style:italic;">SG</span>, 70). Once joined together in intercourse, he rhapsodically assures Habib that their identities will dissolve, as in Sufi doctrine, into one greater unity as they enter</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>the glowing rapture of the sphere<br>Where HE is manifestly all; and all is<br>He; where the I and Thou must disappear.<br>We shall not know if thee I sodomize<br>Or if thou sodomizest me, my dear!</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SG</span>, 74)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Ironically, such a blurring of sexual positions becomes the punch-line of the entire 42-poem sequence. Having secured Habib's properly abject devotion, the speaker in poem 41, "The Riddle," reveals that he is ready for Habib to slip <span style="font-style:italic;">his</span> boyish "almond member . . . in the podex of thine El Qahar" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SG</span>, 135). For the first time we learn that this conqueror, hitherto all cock and swagger, also has a podex. His secret desire to be pummeled by his boy provides the key, then, that unlocks the sequence's final sacred mystery, and as such becomes the fitting climax of the volume. "The end" (of the volume), in this case, <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> the "end" (the poet's derriere), the textual and the sexual complementing each other rather perfectly in this odd gem of an eccentrically modernist, playfully punning, obscenely exuberant text. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">V</h1>
<p>Another writer who fits intriguingly into this modernist revision of traditional Middle Eastern erotic verse forms is the Dutch Jewish lawyer, diplomat, novelist, and poet Jacob Israel de Haan (1881-1924), a married gay man and eventual émigré to Palestine. Like Crowley, De Haan was influenced by the Decadent movement in his university years, and, while beginning a career as teacher and journalist, wrote two novels in the first decade of the twentieth century filled with <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> decadence, homoerotic angst, and class rebellion. The first, <span style="font-style:italic;">Pijpelijntjes</span> ("Pipelines" or "Lines from Pjip," 1904), featuring a promiscuous lover of male youth, led to De Haan's dismissal from his teaching position; the title not only puns on the industrial slum of Amsterdam (Pijp) but—in the spirit of Crowley's lewdly modernist word-plays—tropes on the colloquial Dutch term (<span style="font-style:italic;">pijpen</span>) for fellatio. The second novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Pathologieen</span> , plumbs the depths of a sadomasochistic, homosexual relationship. Completing law studies around this time, De Haan began to research the mass imprisonment of Jews in Tsarist Russia, which in turn inaugurated his growing interest in Zionism. Upon emigrating to Palestine in 1919, however, De Haan grew disillusioned with what he perceived as the Zionist party's antagonism to Orthodox Jews and Arabs alike. Shortly thereafter, he became a leading spokesperson for the ultra-Orthodox Haredim, a group whose willingness to broker a reconciliation of Jewish and Arab interests in Mandate Palestine pitted them against the secular and nationalist interests of the Zionist faction.<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup></p>
<p>The consequence was De Haan's political assassination at the age of 43, the year his final volume of poems, <span style="font-style:italic;">Kwatrijnen</span> ("Quatrains"; 1924), appeared. Containing some 900 quatrains written in the Persian <span style="font-style:italic;">rubba'iyat</span> form in Dutch, the volume charts an interior voyage of discovery, one in which a spiritual quest to Palestine unlocks a sensual odyssey in which the <span style="font-style:italic;">rubba'iyat</span>'s celebration of pleasure combines with themes particular to De Haan's psychology: his obsession with fleeting time and the inevitability of death, mood swings between restlessness (<span style="font-style:italic;">onrust</span> is one of his most repeated words) and states of peace, a tendency to masochism, existential despair, and solitude. But what gives this poetic journey of spiritual and sensual revelation its <span style="font-style:italic;">frisson</span> is the frank degree to which De Haan turns the Holy Land into a homosexual cruising grounds where the objects of his desire are literally "others": Arab and Muslim boys from east Jerusalem and the surrounding Palestinian countryside.</p>
<p>"Doubt" is one of many quatrains in which the poet uses self-reflexive irony to foreground the dialectic between homoerotic desire and questions of faith:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>What awaits me in this evening hour,<br>In this City stalked by sleep,<br>Seated on the Temple wall:<br>God, or the Moroccan lad?<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">De Haan's eroticized response to a boy being bathed in "Hassan" inspires an equally jarring collapse of the sacred and profane: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>His mother rid him of his clothes<br>The water ripples in the tiny bath.<br>My heart trembles, in a shunned softening of endearment,<br>Is not Jerusalem God's holy city?<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The modernist shock-effect of such sacrilegious juxtapositions combines with a self-awareness of the traditional tropes of <span style="font-style:italic;">rubba'iyat</span> verse throughout the volume. In "Nederval," for example, "lofty" prayer is abjured for lower pleasures as the poet boasts, "I turn from my lofty prayers / With restlessness burning in my limbs / To wine and pleasure" (<span style="font-style:italic;">K</span>, 157). The words "wine and pleasure" evoke, of course, Omar Khayyam, the twelfth-century master of the <span style="font-style:italic;">rubba'iyat</span> form whom De Haan acknowledges as his great predecessor in several quatrains. The degree to which De Haan is deliberately rewriting Khayyam in a modernist vein is apparent in the strategic replacement of the "women" of "wine, women, and song" with other sensations, as in the phrase "wine, music, and <span style="font-style:italic;">roses</span>" or "roses, <span style="font-style:italic;">thorns</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">blood</span>."<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> This elision clears room for De Haan's male-directed desires to emerge—along with the pained anguish that is never far removed from the momentary pleasures he grasps:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>If we die this night, die from it all,<br>This tender night, would that not be the greatest pleasure of all?<br>What more can we possibly gain from wandering through this life<br>Than a bit more happiness and pain?<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In another quatrain (also titled "Night") the motifs of roses, wine, and pleasure/pain combine with the imagery of probing hands to imbue the lines with an implied phallicism:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>The boldly probing whoredom of your tender hands.<br>The darkness . . . smelling of roses and of wine.<br>Tomorrow will brand us once again with cruel remorse.<br>But for today: blessed pleasure be ours.</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">K</span>, 169)</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Other quatrains forthrightly declare the male gender and youth of the desired object. In "Meeting," the speaker begins, "I ask his years. He smiles shyly and tenderly. / He blushes. Then he says 'fifteen years' . . ." (<span style="font-style:italic;">K</span>, 65). In "Bedouin," the poet watches a group of Arab boys frolicking in the ocean—"They stand naked in their brown fragility, / From head to toe slender built"—and then projects onto them an utter lack of "shame or shamelessness" that transforms their innocence into an implicit statement of his own adult shame as he "contemplat[es]" their nude bodies (<span style="font-style:italic;">K</span>, 103). If such instances of psychological projection and erotic voyeurism are standard features of Orientalism, De Haan's quatrains are also remarkable for his unsentimental acknowledgment of the gap separating himself from his desired objects. "Arab Boys," also from this sequence, shows De Haan's self-critical perception of his ultimate status as the outsider, the "other" who lacks a home both existentially and geographically: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>What do they have except for their nakedness and their clothes,<br>The breadth of the sea and beach?<br>Meanwhile joy and anguish consume my heart,<br>Restlessness propelling me through each and every land.</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">K</span>, 106)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Here, the speaker's inner emotions are "consumed" by the gulf that separates him from these desirable youth—the gulf that, no matter how many trysts he consummates, will always leave <span style="font-style:italic;">him</span> the homeless wanderer, moving with "restlessness" from one "land" to another, alone and unsatisfied.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup></p>
<p>The portraits of desirable boys that are sprinkled throughout the 900 quatrains of the volume form a modern-day <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> of the available youth of Palestine. But like the two portraits from <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Livre des Beaux</span> examined in section II, De Haan's quatrains sometimes brutually critique the Orientalism of his own erotics:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>With Adil I have ridden horses,<br>With Said I've shared the forbidden wine.<br>With Mahmoud . . . with Nasief . . . I stretch out my limbs<br>Restlessly, in cruel agony.</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">K</span>, 187)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The title tells it all: "The Night Ahead." By the third line, the acts shared drop out, only the names remain, then the names cease, since they could go on forever but without filling the void in De Haan's heart. For no matter how many loves he has enjoyed, the boys names ultimately form a chain of interchangeable signifiers beneath which the signified, desire itself, slips away. This absence leaves the poet in an agony of unfulfillment or "restlessness" (<span style="font-style:italic;">onrust</span>)—and, on this particular night, such unrest also leaves him dreading the hours ahead, in which he will either extend his arms to embrace emptiness or—equally daunting—encounter yet another name in an endless chain. A similar logic governs "Suffering," the quatrain that immediately follows:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>With Adil . . .with Mahmoud, driven by lust,<br>With Hassan, with Khalil, drinking together.<br>I've always remained the same, alas:<br>Alone, and just another name.</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">K</span>, 187)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Here, the modernist appropriation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">rubba'iyat</span>'s form and content yields a quintessentially modernist insight: while the boys continually replace one another in this mobile chain of desire, De Haan is doomed to sameness, to imprisonment in his own singular consciousness ("I've always remained the same"). He himself is "just another name," the marker of this doomed identity; yet, inversely and ironically, De Haan too is just one more "name" in the litany of encounters that each of these boys has had, as dispensable to these boys as they are, in fact, <span style="font-style:italic;">in</span>-dispensable to his fantasy of fulfillment. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>For De Haan, as for Crowley and the anonymous imitator of Fā z.il Bey, Middle Eastern poetic forms and literary tropes become the avenue for modernist revision and homoerotic expression. In De Haan's case, this expression is the poetic record of the very real, and often agonizing, dichotomies marking his own personal quest: as a married man who was also homosexual, as a European aesthete who made his ultimate home in the Middle East, as a diplomat attempting to forge alliances between Zionist hopes and Palestine rights, and, ultimately, as an Orthodox Jew finding sexual fulfillment with Arab youths whose physical proximity yet existential distance only increased the ceaseless movement of his soul's <span style="font-style:italic;">onrust</span>.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">VI</h1>
<p>Like De Haan's emigration to Palestine, André Gide's literary record of North Africa as a site of sexual awakening is grounded in experience, not merely fantasy; he traveled to Tunisia and Algeria six times before publishing <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas: A North African Journal</span> in 1906.<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span> consists of four short journals spanning 1899-1904, in the midst of which Gide published the 1902 novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Immoraliste</span>, which discloses a narrative of pederastic awakening beneath a veneer of reticence and veiled allusion. In its way, <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Immoraliste</span> constitutes a <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> in modernist novelistic form, as its narrator, Michel, takes up and discards a series of adolescent local boys while succumbing to the influence of a torrid African landscape that penetrates "the most . . . secret fibers of [his] being."<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup></p>
<p>Gide achieves an equivalent kind of cataloguing, but of a very different aesthetic order, in the intensely lyrical <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span>. Composed of dozens of short, poetic evocations of North African landscapes and cities, this travel journal discloses a voyage of homoerotic awakening and bliss, in spite of the fact that these journal notes are often void of any human re—no parade of interchangeable Arab youth as in <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Immoraliste</span> or De Haan's <span style="font-style:italic;">Kwatrijnen</span>. What Gide seeks to achieve in <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span> is nothing less than a modernist revision of the genre of travel narrative, recasting its realist attempts in lyrical fragments that become the vehicle for intense, if discrete, homoerotic expression. Whereas traditional travel narratives from the seventeenth-century on typically enumerate hundreds of pages of tedious detail in service of the impossible task of "authenticating" its record of the foreign and unfamiliar, Gide embraces, instead, the impressionistic subjectivity of the traveler's sensations, fixing them in lyrical glimpses that read as prose-poems. These poetic meditations draw on the evocative, rather than descriptive, power of language to convey the traveler's intimations of difference and discovery, of mystery and initiation, of losing one's bearings as one nears, without ever quite reaching, the otherness of one's own desires.</p>
<p>Further, Gide's prose in <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span> achieves a kind of photographic stillness, a sense of spots of time frozen in their immediacy, via its temporal structure. Not only are the four journals included in the slim volume arranged to move backwards and forwards in time, but the lyrical effusions of the entries—sometimes only a few lines long, often no more than half a page—weave back and forth in time, recollecting similar moments, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  revisiting old scenes, repeating tableaux from oblique angles of vision. The white gaps on the page separating these short effusions emphasize their discreteness as individual units while suggesting that there is always more that escapes the frame. As distinct from the generic fantasy of the "nearly Middle East" as a timeless space in which nothing ever changes, the slowing down of time for Gide is less Orientalizing than Woolfian: entering these snapshot moments, these verbally evocative pictures, allows a more profound perception of the very foreignness that the tradition of realist travel narrative attempted, but often failed, to capture through the piling on of excessive detail and the attempt to impose a comprehensive wholeness on the observed culture.</p>
<p>This is not to say that Gide doesn't also sometimes fetishize and exoticize difference—as when, for instance, he claims Tunis has lost the "intoxicating flavor of foreignness" that rivaled the "remotest Orient" and "the most secret Africa" a mere two years ago.<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> But in general his projections onto North Africa intertwine with an empathetic perception of, respect for, and openness to the differences he encounters on his travels. For his deliberately unvarnished journal entries—each existing on its own, not reworked into a "<span style="font-style:italic;">more coherent whole</span>"—seek to capture an order of seeing and knowing distinct from that pursued by realism, attuning the reader to a different ontology of being in and interacting with unfamiliar cultures (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 60). What counts for Gide are the small details, the evanescent flashes of perception, the incidental moments that occur in the margins that his style of lyric minimalism, modernist indirection, and allusive suggestiveness works to evoke. "The distended void of the desert teaches the love of detail," he observes in a passage that suggests his artistic goal in <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 146). Listening to a four-noted flute that is the only sign of life in a lonely oasis, Gide reiterates this minimalist aesthetic: "If only, from page to page, evoking four shifting tones, these sentences I am writing here might be for you what that flute was for me, what the desert was for me—of diverse monotony" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 138). "Diverse monotony" is the perfect enunciation of the state that Gide seeks to capture in <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span>: the plentitude that desire, if liberated from the constraints of rational thought, uncovers in a landscape that only <span style="font-style:italic;">seems</span> to be a blank slate.</p>
<p>Gide gilds his aesthetic intentions with a homoerotic frisson through a series of repeating images: half-open doors, glimpses briefly caught through openings, settings on the margins or by the "wayside," dreams of permeable boundaries, closed interiors. The labyrinthine streets, byways, and alleys of the North African medina have served for many European writers and travelers as symbols of the labyrinthine trajectories of the libido seething beneath the surface of consciousness. Similarly, Gide likens his traversal of the covered alleys of the souks of Tunis to entering a "subterranean" realm, "a second city in the city" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 15). The lure of anonymity and losing one's way in such mazes has an especially richly connotative power for the homoerotic male imagination, as the history of gay cruising suggests. This sensibility limns the sense of mystery in the Algerian streetscapes photographed by Gide's contemporary, F. Holland Day (<a name="5-text" href="#5">. 25 &amp; 26</a>), and it resonates in contemporary French-Tunisian artist Michel Giliberti's homoerotic evocation of passageways in Tunis (<a name="7-text" href="#7">. 27-31</a>).<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> So, too, in Gide's lyrical prose, doors, openings, and passages take on a charged libidinal valence, making <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span> an intriguingly sensuous rewriting of the genre of travel narrative. In Gide's <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">imagination, secret turns in a street, concealed niches in cafés, hidden staircases, and unseen exits become eroticized sites that hold the promise of unnamed desires that lie on the other side of such mysteriously alluring thresholds.</p>
<p>A paradigmatic example occurs in Gide's account of an evening stroll in Blida in the last section of <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span>, "Travel Foregone." It is night and Gide is strolling down the street of the Ouled-Naïls or female prostitutes—a locus that allows an acceptable if illicit aura of overt sexuality to enter the narrative. Yet at the very moment "a woman was calling to me," ironically, his attention is diverted <span style="font-style:italic;">elsewhere</span>, to that which appears on the very margins of vision:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>But the loveliest thing I saw that evening (in passing, and in the time it takes to blink . . .) through that open door traversed by my desire in a single bound, was a dark narrow garden I could barely make out . . . and further on, lit from behind, closing off a mysterious threshold, a luminous white curtain</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 99).</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Ignoring the call of the Ouled (and forgoing the salacious details one might find in other travel narratives), Gide responds to a modality of desire that exists "in the time it takes to blink": the fleeting vision of one threshold framed within the other, culminating in the tantalizingly "luminous white curtain" whose translucence intimates an unseen world of life glowing on the other side.</p>
<p>The opening lines of <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span> metaphorically take us across that luminous threshold, as Gide describes coming upon an opening in a craggy range of mountains near the oasis of El Kantara: "Here is the portal; we enter." What he finds on the other side of this "portal" (which is of course also this first page of text) is "a different world . . . alien, motionless, taciturn, . . . at peace." Beyond the sound of a flute and a child's laughter in the distance, Gide finds what he now realizes he has always desired but hitherto feared: "<span style="font-style:italic;">nothing</span>; no misgivings, no thoughts. Not even repose: here nothing ever stirs. It is still" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 3; emphasis added). This is the stillness of a desire in which "diverse monotony" can yield its treasures; it is the "nothing" that exists once the mind lets go of its inhibitions and strictures. A few pages later, on one of his innumerable nightly "prowls," Gide recounts the breaching of a second "entrance," and this passage begins to disclose the sensual recompense that underlies the promise of entering a world of "nothing." "Of all the Arab cafés, I have chosen the darkest, the one most out of the way," he notes, then teasingly asks, "What draws me here? <span style="font-style:italic;">Nothing</span>; the shadows, a graceful body weaving round the room, a song—and not to be seen from outside: the solace of secrecy" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 5; emphasis added). Gide's carefully chosen images reveal, indirectly, the attractions this particular locus holds. For by choosing the café that is "darkest" and "most out of the way," Gide gains, in the first instance, closeted anonymity—"the solace of secrecy," of not being seen "from the outside," as he puts it. If Gide's ostensible answer to his "What draws me here?" is "Nothing," the immediately following phrases reveal that this "Nothing" actually consists of at least two <span style="font-style:italic;">somethings</span>. First, there are "shadows," which in the pages that follow become the text's shorthand for Arab men moving through the night in their white robes; second, the "graceful body weaving round the room" is in fact a boy dancer performing for the café's male clientele. Gide's "nothings" turn out to be pregnant with unspoken but palpable homoeroticism.<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The erotic thrill of discovering such remote places, particularly sites not patronized by other westerners, attains psychodramatic intensity in Gide's impressionistic renderings. In "Wayside Pages"—a section of <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span>—he emphasizes the fact that he always uses "that other entrance, narrow and recessed" to the souk in Tunis, where "dim alleyway[s]" lead to equally "dim café[s]" whose seductive habitués, Sudanese men wearing sprigs of jasmine behind their ears, exude "voluptuous languor" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 17, 18). The French "cannot find such places," Gide writes with a sense of superiority, refashioning himself as the insider who knows how to spot the "low door" leading into the dark cubbyhole where spectators watching the "obscene" Karaghioz puppet show rent shadowy "niches" in the wall that serve as divans (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 19-20). The sexual undertones of such crannies become explicit as Gide describes, "another stall" where, he admits, the puppet "play is merely an excuse for encounters." Here, a "strangely lovely child" plays his bagpipes for an appreciative audience of male admirers whom Gide likens to "suitors" in "a kind of <span style="font-style:italic;">cour d'amour</span>" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 20, 21). Such homoerotic connotations accumulate throughout <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span>. A different Arab town, a different night, a different year: deliberately avoiding the quarter's four or five brightly lit French cafes, Gide discovers a "suspect stairway" that leads to an "upper city" of the town, all darkened and inscrutable, where, following the sound of an Arab guitar, he discerns the "faint glow" of a "scarcely noticeable" Moorish café (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 69). Pausing in the darkness, he ponders, "Shall I go in? What will I see. . . [?]" Opting to stay outside, he calls upon "the night [to] penetrate me, insinuate itself with the music," just as—as if in answer to his desires—an Arab emerges from the café and "moves toward me" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 70).</p>
<p>If the rhetorical questions that the narrator poses—"What draws me here?", "Shall I go in?"—hinge on a fantasy of being penetrated by the worlds of difference imagined to lie beyond these mysterious portals, Gide also knows—and this is where his somber insight, like De Haan's, mitigates his nostalgic Orientalism—that such sentiments are part of an ultimately <span style="font-style:italic;">impossible</span> fantasy of leaving the known self behind and becoming the desired other. This awareness adds a note of melancholy to his yearning: "Oh, to know, when that thick black door opens in front of that Arab, what will welcome him behind it . . . I should like to be that Arab, I should like what awaits him to await me" (Gide's ellipses).<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup> What Gide fantasizes awaiting behind the door is part of an dream of homoerotic jouissance that is at once <span style="font-style:italic;">secret</span>—uncontaminated by western disapproval—and <span style="font-style:italic;">open</span> to his participation, as open as the "gaping garments of the Arabs!" whom he apostrophizes in his last journal entry where, back in France, he dreams of "the desert spring" and the "Companions! Comrades!" he has left behind.</p>
<p>The evocation of desert companions raises the question of the place of actual paramours in Gide's entries. The homoerotic reimaginings of Crowley, De Haan, and the author of <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Livre des Beaux</span>, as we've seen, depend on the explicitly sexualized representation of available youth, often presented serially as interchangeable objects of desire. Every now and then, Gide's entries make mention of various males, but in general sexual corporeality is absent in <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span>—the highly autoerotic passages where Gide communes with nature in orgasmic frenzy are as close to "sex" as the text gets. And this overall <span style="font-style:italic;">absence</span> of embodied objects of desire forms what is most innovative, and <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  interesting, about Gide's modernist reworking of travel narrative for homoerotic ends: his talent lies in being able to make the most insignificant of details or even inanimate objects—the glimpse of a mysterious rear door, the discovery of a room, the description of a lonely oasis—resonate with an unnamed, yet nonetheless pervasive, homoerotic sensibility. Stylistic indirection, fragmentation, and allusion—hallmark traits of literary modernism—work in tandem with Gide's narrative lyricism and episodic structure both to give tacit expression to his own desires <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> to suggest the opaque but nonetheless tangible layers of homoeroticism that pervade North African male culture.</p>
<p>The additive quality of these homoerotic tableaux, moreover, form a modern approximation of the poetic tradition of the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> by capturing, like pictures in an album, snapshot images of desire that may be savored in a future time. But whereas the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> and the camera typically operate by objectifying their subjects, the minimalist aesthetic underlying Gide's prose-poems—staking their claim on life in the margins, on the diversity that exists in seeming monotony—works against blatant appropriations of North Africa and likewise pushes against the European desire to possess the essence of "Oriental" sexuality. To the contrary: Gide intimates that the reader who really wants to understand his message must engage in a textual erotics that res the journal as an extension of Gide's queer body: "Publish [these entries]—for whom?," Gide ponders back in France, "They will be like those resinous secretions which yield their perfume only when warmed by the hand holding them" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 153). The erotics of this text takes two; the reader's warm touch is necessary to the release of Gide's "secreted" meanings, making one an enabling partner on this intimate journey.<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup></p>
<div class="sectionBreak">
<p>How does this particular literary and visual geography of queer modernism transform our understandings of Orientalism and its others? These pages have focused on two venues by which early twentieth-century artists harnessed literary genres and traditions associated with the Middle East to impart often innovative and, for their times, sexually explicit visions of same-sex desire. One venue, embraced by Gide, involves rethinking travel narrative through a modernist lens, in which understated impressionism and lyricism summon up a more visually tactile image of foreignness than does exacting realism's attempt to create "word pictures" through exhaustive detail. The second venue, practiced by the unknown author of <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Livre des Beaux</span>, Aleister Crowley, and Jacob Israel De Haan, involves borrowing from Persian, Ottoman, and Arabic literary traditions, freely improvising on poetic forms like the <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazal, şehrengiz</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">rubba'iyat</span> to convey a modernist <span style="font-style:italic;">ars homoerotica</span>. These latter genre revisions share in common the topos of the beautiful youth, at once a staple in traditional Middle-East literature <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> a marker of Orientalist projections and western desires that sometimes remain blind to their colonializing propensities. This potential to appropriate the other as material for Orientalist fantasy is most obvious in turn-of-the-twentieth-century ethnopornography and erotic photography. The latter's visual catalogues of "nearly" middle eastern boys call to mind, in turn, another trait shared by the genres of travelogue and erotic poetry <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  traced above: the stringing together in serial form of scenarios and/or objects of desire that, like photographs pasted in an album, become mementos of the elusive attempt to fix desire, to remember fleeting moments that have already passed, moments whose framing will always suggest the inadequacy of the effort to bridge otherness.</p>
<p>I don't want to end by giving the impression that the literary borrowings and improvisations of these queerly-inclined modernist artists are simply the esoteric byproducts of a relatively minor offshoot of modernism, to be shelved with other oddities of early twentieth-century literature—although these texts are also just that, "wayside" pieces that exist outside the mainstream. "Minor" as these works individually may be, they participate in a larger phenomenon of Orientalist homoerotics in which issues of visibility and visuality continue to set off minefields in the cultural politics of East and West. Exemplary in this light is a recently unearthed archive of photographs that uncannily recall—with a major difference—the visual <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> produced 100 years before by purveyors of erotic postcards in the Middle East. Published in the volume <span style="font-style:italic;">Taliban</span>, these pensive photographs of young soldiers posing singly and in pairs were found by Thomas Dworzak in a closed-down studio in Kandahar shortly after the Taliban fled the city in 2002.<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup> The eerie continuity and discontinuity between images such as Lehnert's photograph of two boys arm-in-arm and these Taliban youth (<a name="2-text" href="#2">. 32 &amp; 33</a>) exists not only in the subject matter, but in photographic technique, particularly the use of hand-tinted coloration and blatant props.<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup> It is a commonplace that the</p>

<p class="continued">Taliban's young recruits came from the countryside where, despite Taliban condemnation of homosexuality, the tradition of male sexual apprenticeships and relationships was still widely practiced, as Ahmed Rachid notes.<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65">65</a></sup> This historical reality so suffuses these photographs with a palpable if unworldly homoeroticism (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 34</a>) that Dworzak was accused by the Left of demeaning and "othering" these resistance ters by taking these pictures himself (and passing them off as "originals") and then colorizing them in the style of gay artists Gilbert and George in order to turn them into camp aesthetic commodities. But, as Dworzak attests, these "found objects" are exactly that, photographs whose contradictory valences—artillery, narcissism, intimacy—tell stories worth sharing.<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66">66</a></sup> So intent on seeing a narrative of western appropriation, Dworzak's critics failed to see these images for what they are, and in doing so, revealed not only their own latent homophobia but, once again, how easily homosexuality can be used as a political weapon to reinstate a reductive "West-versus-Middle-East" binary. Seeing these images "as they are" does not mean their new viewers will ever know with certainty the precise nature of the desires inspiring these photographs or the relationships they recorded. But it does mean that viewers can open themselves to the "contradictory cultural context of these oddly beautiful photographs," acknowledging the sheer "risk layered into these shots, and the triumph [over risk, over prohibition] they contain," as Jeff McMahonon puts it: "[these images reveal] an intimacy we have trouble interpreting; we know the frame but don't recognize these pictures. These are men who are comrades, and perhaps more. They are also soldiers of a horrifically repressive and puritanical regime. How can one pose with flowers, arm around your buddy, kohl highlighting beautiful young eyes, and yet be a foot soldier for those who would punish you severely for such an abomination?"<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67">67</a></sup></p>

<p>If uncanny similarities of content and style link these images separated by 100 years, there are also equally resonant differences. Unlike Landrock's youthful models, paid to strike provocative poses to cater to a specialized European market, the subjects of the Kandahar photographs participate in a very different economy and erotics of circulation: they are not performing intimacy for some unknown other but for each other, nor are the images intended for public distribution or for profit. Shot furtively (since photographic studios had officially been banned by the Taliban), these images offer silent testimony to the fact that these recruits have chosen to defy their leaders' prohibition on representing the human face. Why? Perhaps out of the desire to memorialize themselves, if only for a frozen instant, before embracing martyrdom and death. Perhaps out of the desire to honor bonds whose actual nature can only be guessed at, but whose intimacy is achingly clear. For early twentieth-century gay writers like Crowley and Gide, Eros is celebrated precisely as a stay against, a deferral of, the inevitability of death; but here, in these twenty-first-century images, Eros readies to become Thanatos with each click of the camera's shutter.</p>

<p>Whatever one's thoughts about the ruthless brutality of the Taliban, the subjects in these photos convey an almost excruciating poignancy as, individually and in couples, they yield themselves to the gaze of the camera, preening in their best turbans and accenting their eyes with kohl, standing against incongruous backdrops of American ranch-style houses and Swiss chalets, holding plastic colored flowers along with their guns (<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 35</a>). The homoerotic genre of the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span>, reaching from sixteenth-century Middle Eastern poetry to the queer modernist revisions analyzed in these pages, is granted an ambivalent but haunting afterlife in this photographic archive—an afterlife that, staring one in the eye (<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 36</a>), forces viewers to resist simplifying the complex, unstable, combustible relation of sexuality and the phenomenon we call Orientalism. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<div class="ack"><p>In transliterating words from Arabic, Persian, and Ottoman Turkish into English, I have attempted to do my best to follow the most current or reliable models for spellings and the use of diacritical marks, both of which vary widely—different scholars in Middle Eastern studies use a range of criteria in determining whether to notate, for instance, long vowels or guttural consonants. Sometimes my choice is dictated by the source-texts I am using, in order to avoid the appearance of misspellings.

Iraj Mirza's tongue-in-cheek vitriol is intriguingly complicated, as noted by Janet Afary, <span style="font-style:italic;">Sexual Politics in Modern Iran</span> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), by the fact that the poet was himself a lover of male youth well-known for his homoerotic <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazals</span> before his political alliance with the Constitutionalist movement "converted" him to heterosexual advocacy (pp. 93-94). Afsaneh Njamabadi, <span style="font-style:italic;">Women with Moustaches and Men without Beards: Gender and Sexual Anxieties of Iranian Modernity</span> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005), comments on the poem in her analysis of the excision of male homoerotic relations entailed by the birth of Iranian feminism .</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f3" href="#f3-text">3. </a>On the recent in-depth accounts of the history of same-sex relations between men in Persia and Iran, see especially Afary, Njamabadi, and, in a less thesis-driven vein, Willem Floor, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Social History of Sexual Relations in Iran</span> (Washington DC: Mage, 2008). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f4" href="#f4-text">4. </a>Although sodomy was criminalized in the Iranian Penal Code in 1925 (article 207), the law had little effect on daily life during the Pahlavi period. Immediately after the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979, Floor reports that "hundreds of political opponents were executed on the grounds of having engaged in sodomy," and the new Penal Code instituted in the early 1990s included articles 108-126 defining the crime and punishment of sodomy in great detail. Ironically, a 1978 decree by the Ayatollah Khomeyni allowed for sex-change surgery, since it is not mentioned in the Koran, as a "remedy" to male homosexuals. See Floor, pp. 352-61; the chart in <a name="4-text" href="#4">re 4</a> appears on p. 360. The hanging in 2005 of the two youths depicted in <a name="3-text" href="#3">re 3</a> has been the source of considerable international protest, as well as ensuing controversy about whether the two minors were executed for consensual sex or for gang-raping a younger boy (the official version), as Jasbir K. Puar notes in <span style="font-style:italic;">Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer Times</span> (Durham: Duke University Press, 2007). While the demonization of Iran as a terrorist enclave obviously contributed to the international attention given this event, western concerns about patterns of increased homophobic violence need not always, or only, translate into "Islamophobia." State sanctioning of homophobic violence is not unique to Iran but part of a growing pattern across the Middle East. In addition to the Queen Boat prosecutions of men patronizing a "gay" nightclub in Cairo, Egypt, explained in note 5 below, see, on Saudi Arabia, "Islam's Loathing and Lust for Homosexuality" (19 October 2007), on the website www.islamicmonitor. org; on Iraq, "Hate Army Beats Gay Students" on the website of Iraqi LGBT, Molly Hennessy-Fiske's "Since Invasion, Gays in Iraq Lead Lives of Constant Fear (<span style="font-style:italic;">Los Angeles Times</span>, August 5, 2007), A6, and Liz Sly's "Gays Being Targeted and Killed in Iraq" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Los Angeles Times</span>, August 18, 2009), A19. The journalist Brian Whittaker enumerates more incidents of government-condoned or sponsored homophobia in <span style="font-style:italic;">Unspeakable Love: Gay and Lesbian Life in the Middle East</span> (London: Saki, 2006).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f5" href="#f5-text">5. </a>The language of homosexuality as a foreign (western) vice was rife in the aftermath of the raid on the nightclub the Queen Boat in Cairo in 2001, during which over 50 men were arrested and accused of being homosexual perverts and Satanists. The headline in <span style="font-style:italic;">Al-Ahram al-Arabi</span> (August 25, 2001) declared, "Be a pervert, and Uncle Sam will approve," and <span style="font-style:italic;">Al-Masa'</span> (May 15, 2001) ran a story, "Confessions of the 'Satinists' in 10 Hours: We Imported the Perverse Ideas from a European Group," claiming the defendants bragged that they had "imported" their "perverse" sexual practices from European subversives.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f6" href="#f6-text">6. </a>See Dan Coleman's speculation on the underlying reasons this particular comment by Ahmadinejad solicited so much mileage among humorists: "Of all the inane comments Ahmadinejad has made . . . it's interesting that the satirists have chosen to focus on this one. Denying the existence of gays in Iran is no more empirically absurd than denying the Holocaust. So why the emphasis on the sexuality comment? . . . <span style="font-style:italic;">[Is] it because sexuality offers an always convenient way to take a political enemy down a peg</span>?" (emphasis added). See Coleman, "Satirizing Ahmadinejad: the <span style="font-style:italic;">New Yorker</span> Picks Up Where <span style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Night Live</span> Left Off" (October 8, 2007), on <a href="http://www.openculture.com" target="_blank">www.openculture.com</a>. The headline's mention of <span style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Night Live</span> refers to a music video that aired on the show, "I-Ran From You," in which a male singer croons a song of unrequited love to Ahmadinejad that verges on xenophobic and homophobic stereotyping when the singer extols the President's "butter pecan thighs" and likens his sexual appeal to that of a "very hairy Jake Gyllenhaal" within which exists a feminine (read: homosexual) inner self we glimpse (via a cross-dressed look-alike) in a red evening dress draping himself over the grand piano while swooning to the vocalist's amorous pleas.</p></div>

In "The Arabic Ghazal: Formal and Thematic Aspects of a Problematic Genre," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ghazal as World Literature II: From a Literary Genre to a Great Tradition: The Ottoman Gazel in Context</span>, ed. Angelika Neuwirth, Michael Hess, Judith Pfeiffer, and Borte Sagaster (Wurzburg: Ergon Verlag, 2006), Thomas Bauerk notes that by the ninth and tenth centuries the beloved is "almost certainly a male youth," as distinct from traditional <span style="font-style:italic;">nasib</span> love poetry where the beloved is a girl. The Arabic <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazal</span> was typically 5-12 lines, with a specific rhyme scheme and the author's penname, or <span style="font-style:italic;">Takhallus</span>, embedded as word-play in the final line; the intent was less to create an original expression but evoke emotions that the audience would recognize and respond to through the manipulation and extension of a standard repertoire of images and situations. Franklin Lewis, "The Transformation of the Persian Ghazal: From Amatory Mood to Fixed Form," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ghazal as World Literature</span>, explains the metrics and thematics traditionally associated with the <span style="font-style:italic;">rubba'iyat</span> and the evolution of the Persian <span style="font-style:italic;">ghazal</span> from the Arabic original.

The basic feature of the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  (<span style="font-style:italic;">sharashub</span> in its Persian form) is its at once humorous and complimentary "representation of the beloved as a youthful artisan or member of another social group having such marked features as to allow a poet to make fanciful allusions to this quality" (Sharma, quoting De Bruijn [1983:7], p.142). Noting that the <span style="font-style:italic;">şehrengiz</span> had been popular in the Ottoman world since the poet Meshi (d. 1513), Jan Schmidt, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Joys of Philology: Studies in Ottoman Literature, History, and Orientalism (1500-1923), Vol. 1: Poetry, Historiography, Biography, and Autobiography</span> (Istanbul: Isis Press, 2002), also points out that a central artistic amusement of such poetry was "the invention of puns on the names of the boys" being celebrated within the verse's metaphors and language, and that by the nineteenth-century, the format was "regularly suppressed by the Ottoman censor" for its homoerotic content (36, 38).</p></div>

(Indeed, the reference to <span style="font-style:italic;">Nights</span> might well be another clue to the European status of the anonymous author, since the work had fallen out of favor in Ottoman court circles for centuries, whereas it had <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  been an overnight sensation in the West since its 1704 translation—the second best-selling book next to the Christian Bible).</p></div>

Compare to Fāżil Bey's text: "What counts here is the ass! Not the mill . . . what do you think the mill can yield compared to ass?" There is no reference to the death of the father or the summons home in Fāżil's version; in his variant, the boy's home is Kufe, a city in Iraq.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f33" href="#f33-text">33. </a>In the original <span style="font-style:italic;">Huban-name</span>, the pun is purely linguistic, for here the boy mispronounces "shin" as "sin" ("sh" is written with three dots in the Arabic script while "s" has none), leading to the quip: "Do not think his pronouncing of shin as sin is a mistake, it is because there is no more place for dots in his mouth" (line 419). In Greek, there is little differentiation between "s" and "sh" sounds, with both represented by the letter <span style="font-style:italic;">sigma</span>; thus Fāżil Bey is subtly playing on ethnic/national difference as well. Thanks to Fatih Kursun for his insights here. In the French text, however, the author makes the same pun on "sik" / penis in the very first portrait, of the beau of the Indies, who is identified as a "Sikh"—a footnote appears on the same page making sure we get the lewd joke. The fact that this portrait does not appear in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Huban-name</span> underlines the degree to which the joke is the work of the modern creator.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f39" href="#f39-text">39. </a>What constitutes Von Gloeden's "kitsch" quality for Barthes is his indiscriminate mixing of codes of antiquity and present-day peasant boys without irony. See Barthes's untitled essay reprinted (orig. 1978) in <span style="font-style:italic;">Taormina: Wilhelm Von Gloeden</span>, ed. Jack Woody (Santa Fe: Twelvetrees, 1997). Other critics, like Bruce Russell, "Wilhelm von Pluschow and Wilhelm von Gloeden: Two Photo Essays," <span style="font-style:italic;">Studies in Visual Communication</span> 9.2 : 57-80, feel Barthes overlooks the degree of intention fueling Von Gloeden's compositional juxtapositions and his rejection of beaux-arts traditions. In celebrating Von Gloeden's queerness, Barthes simultaneously participates in Orientalist fantasies of otherness, fetishizing Sicilian boys' dark, almost "black" skin, "dirty peasant" hands, and (supposedly) "swollen" foreskins. See Russell, p. 62, for an apt critique of this aspect of Barthes' essay.

In all these photos, the seductive lure of the fantasized scenario is accomplished by the self-consciously crafted arrangement of the model's robes to reveal half—and just half—of his upper torso and a single nipple, thereby teasing the spectator to imagine the possibility of further divestiture. <a name="0-text" href="#0"> 20</a> heightens the homoerotic frisson by having the youth gaze directly into the camera, which fosters a fantasy of knowingness and intimacy, while his pose—one arm behind his head and the other cocked on his hip, jasmine blossom behind his ear— connotes a feminine receptivity without compromising his essential masculinity. In <a name="0-text" href="#0"> 21</a>, the way in which the youth looks to the side, rather than into the camera, connotes a daydreaming state of mind that suggests an autoerotic fantasy; in other images, the model stands in front of a dark, grilled exterior, suggesting the mysterious depths from which he has emerged as well as the shadowy recesses in which an amorous encounter may follow.</p></div>

In De Haan's "Admonition" a similar triad of earthly pleasures combines, as in the great tradition of <span style="font-style:italic;">carpe diem</span> lyrics, with the poet's desire to defy the inevitable passage of time and just "be" through love-making:</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f57" href="#f57-text">57. </a>André Gide, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Immoralist</span>, trans. Richard Howard (1902; rpt. NY: Vintage, l970), 52.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f58" href="#f58-text">58. </a>(<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 16) The homoerotics with which Gide imbues North Africa is inseparable from the economic and colonial factors that made Algeria available to Gide. For a reading of the ambivalence in Gide's sexual/colonial politics, see Michael Lucey, <span style="font-style:italic;">Gide's Bent: Sexuality, Politics, Writing</span> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995). Analyzing Gide's account of his euphoric, initiatory sexual experiences in Algeria in the autobiography <span style="font-style:italic;">Si le grain ne muert</span>, Lucey shows how the purity and egalitarianism Gide attributes to these encounters depends on his repressing their colonial underpinnings; the youth with whom he has his first sexual experience, Ali, is his hired servant, Mohammed's "<span style="font-style:italic;">petit corps sauvage</span>" has been procured for Gide with Wilde's money. Certain of these less desirable reminders of the inequities built into the practice of "sexual tourism" are sidestepped, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span>, the choice to homoeroticize sensation and environment rather than specific individuals or bodies; such re-framings forgo the occasion to analyze the socio-economic realities of colonialism, as Gide himself admits three decades later in a self-implicating statement where he confesses he was fully aware of the various social and economic inequities occasioned by colonial rule in the regions covered by <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span> at the time he recorded his impressions, but decided issues like the "devious exportation of small Arab farmers" weren't his "cup of tea. I would have felt that as an artist it was beneath me to turn my pen to such vulgar concerns" (quoted in Lucey, 152). Jonathan Dollimore offers a short reading of <span style="font-style:italic;">Amyntas</span> as a pastoral narrative of loss and self-recovery that veils the extent to which privilege and power facilitate Gide's appropriation of Africa's "otherness" for his artistic emergence in <span style="font-style:italic;">Sexual Dissidence: Augustine to Wilde, Freud to Foucault</span> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), 240-44. For more on sexual tourism and literary enclaves in the Mahgreb, see my "Vacation Cruises; or, The Homoerotics of Orientalism," <span style="font-style:italic;">PMLA</span> 110 : 89-107.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f59" href="#f59-text">59. </a>Day's closeted homosexuality is assumed by art historians. See, for instance, Allen Ellenzwerg's chapter comparing the photographic work of Von Gloeden and Day in chapter 3 of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Homoerotic Photograph: Male Images from Durieu/Delacroix to Mapplethorpe</span> (NY: Columbia University Press, 1992). The talented Giliberti, an openly gay artist of Tunisian heritage who lives in France, is also a novelist. His paintings are reproduced in <span style="font-style:italic;">Voyage Secret: Tunisie</span> (Paris: Bonobo, 2004). My interviews with Giliberti (Paris 2006) confirm his deliberate blending of the homoerotic and indigenous to form a counter-colonialist visual response to Orientalist stereotypes of the "other." Day's homoerotic fascination with Arabic subjects is also apparent in his photographs of the teenaged émigré, Kahlil Gibran, a protégé and the eventual author of the best-selling <span style="font-style:italic;">The Prophet</span> , whose prose-poetic imitations of Sufi poetry align him in interesting ways with "imitators" of the form like Burton and Crowley.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f60" href="#f60-text">60. </a>Such suggestive but simultaneously elliptical wording is similar to the rhetorical device of the <span style="font-style:italic;">anacoluthon</span> that Roland Barthes locates in Loti's <span style="font-style:italic;">Aziyadé</span>, in which ideas are introduced but never finish and "drift away." See Pierre Loti: <span style="font-style:italic;">Aziyadé</span>,» in <span style="font-style:italic;">Le degré zéro de l'écriture suivi de nouveaux essais critiques</span> (Paris: Seuil, 1972), 170-87. Emily Apter also cites this concept in her analysis of Michel's use of incomplete phrases that trail off in <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Immoralist</span>, in which what is left unsaid "<span style="font-style:italic;">pre</span>-res" the "unstated subtext of homoeroticism," in <span style="font-style:italic;">André Gide and the Codes of Homotextuality</span> (Stanford: Stanford French and Italian Studies, 1987), 113-15. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f61" href="#f61-text">61. </a>(<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 106) Giliberti's evocatively titled painting, "L'entrée des contes" ("The threshold to stories"), reproduced as <a name="7-text" href="#7">re 31</a>, might be read as a counter-Orientalizing response by the very "other" that Gide is imagining behind that "black door"—but in Giliberti's version, this re has stepped out front to become a kind of watch-dog or guardian, and his direct gaze at the viewer both simultaneously challenges the Orientalist fantasy of entry and invites us to imagine the <span style="font-style:italic;">contes</span> that unfold to those permitted to enter.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f62" href="#f62-text">62. </a>The legacy of Gide's modernist innovations in travel narrative can be traced in the Moroccan journal Roland Barthes included in his posthumously published volume, <span style="font-style:italic;">Incidents</span>, trans. Richard Howard (Berkeley: Universtiy of California Press, 1992). Like Gide, Barthes renders his impressions in a series of fragmented, brief, verbal "snapshots" meant to evoke as much as describe. But unlike Gide, Barthes interweaves these textual impressions with descriptions of the various Tangier youths who catch his eye. In this regard, his technique recalls the serial erotic catalogues of <span style="font-style:italic;">Livre des Beaux, The Perfumed Garden</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Kwaitrains</span>. In stark contrast to Gide's intensely affective engagement with North Africa, Barthes's narrative voice remains distant, coolly postmodern, as it reduces each boy to a few brushstrokes: each is fair game to be had in the vacation itinerary that traveling in Morocco offers Barthes. To grant these boys textual individuality would rob Barthes of the flaneur's <span style="font-style:italic;">frisson</span> of exotic otherness, and himself of the colonialist's pleasure of enjoyment without guilt.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f63" href="#f63-text">63. </a>Thomas Dworzak, <span style="font-style:italic;">Taliban</span>, with additional text by Jon Anderson and Thomas Reese (London: Trolley, 2003).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f64" href="#f64-text">64. </a>Sigel hypothesizes that in colonial postcards, the use of supplementary color or tints is meant to "accentuate the primitiveness of the scene . . . painted-on, primary colors suggest a primitive, uninhibited gaudiness" . While the idea is interesting, it may be an over-reading, since many turn-of-the-century photographs in America and elsewhere were tinted—some by the photographer, some at home—to "beautify" and "bring to life" the images. In the era of pre-color photography, and in situations where colorized photography is less affordable, tinting may have been a substitute that then became a style unto its own, not simply a "primitive" aesthetic. In the case of the tinted Lehnert and Landrock re pictured above, the colorization certainly adds to the sexualizing of the image by feminizing the boys, rouging their lips and cheeks.</p></div>
<div class="fn">
<p><a name="f65" href="#f65-text">65. </a>Anderson, in the section of <span style="font-style:italic;">Taliban</span> titled "After the Revolution," notes that "Afghans from other regions joke about the high incidence of pederasty among Kandahai men. They say that when the crows fly over Kandahar they clamp one wing over their bottom, just in case" (n.p.). Dworzak, writing of his experience of being routinely approached while on assignment in Afghanistan, writes that "If I had my balls grabbed by the soldiers (considered a neat chat-up line) in the north maybe once a week, in Kandahar it would happen daily. Soldiers there would tickle the palms of my hands; there were furtive caresses in crowds" ("In Downtown Kandahar," n. p.). In a <span style="font-style:italic;">Slate</span> online podcast on Dworzak's project, Ahmed Rachid comments, "There is a very strong homosexual tradition in which an older man will . . . adopt a young man and become lover, become student, and teach him whatever skills he may have." Ironically, Mullah Omar's Taliban movement really caught fire, according to Rachid, when he attacked and killed a local warlord who had kidnapped young boys he was forcing to serve as his concubines. Thence Omar emerged as a kind of Robin Hood re protecting the poor against oppressive warlords. One of first things Mullah Omar did was ban homosexuality, but given long-standing tradition, it continued, albeit very surreptitiously.
