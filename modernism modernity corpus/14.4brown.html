<p>Perhaps the most startling thing, on first viewing the 1930 silent film <i>Borderline</i>, is the image of H. D. (as Astrid), her face worn and gaunt, her frame looming and cadaverous, her hairline reaching precipitously toward the frowsy crown of her head.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Telephone receiver in clenched hand, H.

dehumanized in the film, as critics have noted, his re aligned with the primitive, with stone, with sculpture, but it is a dehumanization of monumental proportion, the sort we demand of our celebrities, the distance we require of the screen image so that we may worship, unencumbered by knowledge of the myriad indignities that attend the human form. His is a command performance, his screen image calm and enduring, befitting a man of his stature, his status on the international stage. H. D. is a lesser celebrity. She is instead writerly, her re twitchy, scratchy like the nib on the page; she clearly thinks too much, and as the film opens, she is agitated at the state of her marriage, her husband having taken up with a new woman. The connection between 

<b></b>

 the two res is forged early in the film, as Astrid telephones Pete, not apparently in a gesture of friendship (confirmed in his refusal to speak to her), but in a shared outsiderness, both at the margins of their relationships, both hoping to break the bond between Pete's wife and Astrid's husband. But none of this is immediately clear. </p>

<p>Narrative opacity is predictable enough, given the film's aesthetic and intellectual interests. <i>Borderline</i> was a production of the Pool group, an avant-garde collective based in Switzerland, funded by the Ellerman family fortune (via Bryher, formerly Winifred Ellerman), and interested in saving the "universal" language of silent film from the new threat of talking pictures. Kenneth Macpherson, the film's writer and director, tried to import the imagery of psychoanalysis into his film scenario, providing what he imagined to be a visual representation of unconscious processes. He also used a readily sensationalized topic—the interracial affair between a black woman and a white man—and complicated it with the furious racism of one jilted spouse (played by H. D.) and the steadfast stoicism of the other (played by Robeson). The critical discourse surrounding <i>Borderline</i> has generally focused on questions raised by the film's racial and sexual politics. Here, rather, I discuss the film's interest in the aesthetics of the unconscious, the phenomenological response to film as sensation, and one recurring motif in the film—the hand—that brings together the Pool group's formal and affective aims. To consider the multiple tiers of the film's aesthetics will, I hope, contribute to the larger claim that the poetics of film functions simultaneously to its belief structures, resisting, undercutting, and complicating, if not altogether breaking free from, its thematic interests. The sensationalism of <i>Borderline</i>'s subject matter is so remarkable, especially in its historical context, that the film's attention to sensation itself has been overlooked. Further, because the narrative is difficult to follow and both demands and claims to repel cognitive effort, many critics have worked explicitly with the film's diegetic events, explaining those events and speaking of the homoerotics of the film's desire and its limitations regarding racial representation.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  I read against the deigetic logic of the film, then, looking to the series of frozen images, the repeated motifs that cut in and against the story of racist bigotry, both in the film's and in today's critical terms. To read the film's formalism is to decenter the primacy of narrative logic, to provide access to its visual and affective dimensions, and to offer an interpretive form that doesn't rely upon and reconstitute the identity categories already problematized by the film's many critics. The film explores sensation through the visual motif of the hand and in so doing comments on the place of film in one's physical apprehension of the world. Rather than look to the structural dynamics that have been read on to the film (white/black, civilized/primitive, etc.), I am interested in where the film's visual imagery undercuts such interpretation and offers a way to read the "interface" between film technology and human subjectivity (which in the early part of the century was coming to be defined by the irrational impulses of the unconscious).<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The film operates as a complicated layering of images, silently profuse, edited with the avant-garde techniques of montage associated in the early part of the century with Russian filmmaking; the familiar faces of the film's celebrities stand in for the familiarity of romantic convention or clear cinematic narrative. <i>Borderline</i>'s narrative logic is 

<b></b>

 notoriously difficult—a libretto was disseminated to aid the comprehension of early audiences, H. D. wrote a 39-page explanatory, and exuberantly hyperbolic, pamphlet, and Macpherson followed up its release with a palpably exasperated editorial in <i>Close Up</i>, the Pool group's film journal, that explained the film to its unimaginative and, he charged, unfeeling, public. The film might be difficult to <i>comprehend</i>, Macpherson conceded, but was it so difficult to <i>feel</i>? The film offered a response to the losses occasioned by modern life, and an attempt to invigorate, even electrify, film audiences, not through cognition, then, but through sensation. Can the viewer be shocked out of a generalized turpitude by film, the Pool group seems to ask, or is film the deadening instrument of its own destruction? These terms are, of course, recognizably Walter Benjamin's and when a title card, late in the film, asks "What do you think?" the fate of film, at least as far as the Pool members were concerned, weighed in the balance. Could film have a future? Certainly not, the group believed, if sound technology and the forces of Hollywood determined its course. By introducing sensation to the most sensationalized of scripts, Macpherson and his collaborators moved to make film not only relevant to modern experience, but also a necessary intervention in the paralysis that accompanied modern life. </p>

<p>Sensation, as a philosophical concept, has been explored throughout the history of enquiry into human consciousness, yet for my purposes here, Bertrand Russell's account most productively offers a reading of the unified experience of matter and mind foregrounded in Macpherson's film and suggests a way to imagine film as a mode of sensational experience. Distinguished from emotion by its recourse to the body and its sensory apprehension of the world, sensation relies on matter, on the surfaces against which the mind reels, moving in relation and reaction to objects and to physical events that might include the wind blowing, water falling, or the ring of a telephone. For Russell, sensation is the effect of both material and mental perception: "I should admit this view as regards sensations: what is heard or seen belongs equally to psychology and to physics," he writes.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Russell's investigations into the shared realms of psychology and physics offer a way to read the film's staging of the unconscious, the space where images are stored without reason, perhaps without access, yet whose unpredictable eruptions offer a method of narrative not based in logic, but in the spatial recombination of images, something akin to montage. In psychoanalytic theory, the unconscious works to destabilize the subject and begins a transition, as Elizabeth Abel puts it, "from transparent to unstable, internally divided, and over-determined identity categories."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Thus opening up a precarious space, a space whose foundations guarantee nothing but foundational collapse, the unconscious fractures any clear lines of subjectivity, and produces a self-difference that may, Abel argues, "open a door to other differences," including those familiar and contested differences based on categories of race, sexuality, and class.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> The unconscious as conceptual space, an underground corridor leading from self-difference to difference: this is the philosophical premise that supports the narrative of <i>Borderline</i> as it plays along the fault lines of the self to mirror a world riven by social categories of identity. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p><i>Borderline</i>, whose title itself suggests the space separating the two mental realms, works to express the unconscious yet takes place not in a dark subterranean space, but well above sea level, in a mountain village that seems, almost, to exist outside of time. Yet, even in the clean mountain air, the depravity—or at least license—of unconscious desire prevails as characters are pictured in fragments, cut up by their desire, as they pursue and react, their activity terminated in each film splice, and reborn in another frame, as another image. Taking as its premise the already sensationalized topic of an interracial and adulterous love affair, <i>Borderline</i> opens up with the image of a train that, we will later understand, brings Pete to the isolated village. (The same image, the train roaring along the tracks, will end the film as it takes Pete away, alone and driven from the village by its xenophobic populace). Pete's purpose is to reclaim Adah (Eslanda Robeson), his lover (or wife—there is some opacity here) who has left him for Thorne (Gavin Arthur). The viewer witnesses the violent end of an argument between Adah and Thorne, and sees Astrid, Thorne's spurned and desperate lover (or wife), in the next room as she reports the demise of the relationship to Pete. The rooms in which Thorne, Astrid, and Adah are staying are located above a small café-bar that employs a butch bar manager (Bryher), a free-spirited barmaid (Charlotte Arthur), and a bejeweled pianist (Robert Herring). As critics have persuasively argued, the bar manager and pianist are unmistakably coded as gay; the barmaid is less overtly readable, however, her joie de vivre and expansive sexuality seem multiply directed as she laughs, smokes, and flirts with most everyone she encounters.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> She is a re of movement in an otherwise static environment: she sings, dances, and laughs and is shown to be someone motivated by pleasure and compassion. The bar serves as a relatively stable common ground where the private dramas of the two couples may be played out, and where the people of the town may appear, bringing with them their culturally-coded antipathies (most explicitly, their racism). The village may seem to exist outside of time, its cobblestoned streets and centuries-old buildings a backdrop to life as it has always been, but its resistance to change itself and its hostility to the racial otherness in the re of Pete place it in historical time and position its townspeople within a larger cultural current of tightening group affiliation. Adah doesn't seem to elicit hostility, her status as black woman, perhaps, rendering her invisible, despite the sexual transgression that sets the narrative moving. </p>

<p>Macpherson's film takes on large "political" questions—the growing fascism of the small mountain village, the racism that signals Astrid's demise—yet its interest is as much in the possibilities of expressing physical emotion, the senses alive (as if galvanized in its original sense of electrically shocked) in the emotional turmoil that the film unfolds (in fact, in her pamphlet H. D. somewhat disingenuously claims that the film is not interested in political questions at all, but wants only to engage its audience "purely" as a work of art, free of the taint of political interest). The members of Pool—notably Macpherson, H. D., and Bryher—wanted to rid the film of the conventions of narrative logic, yet understood that it would not be readily accessible to the average viewer. As noted above, the group carefully guided its public reception with a substantial amount of instructive text (remarkable for a film apparently interested in the opacity of the 

<b></b>

 unconscious). The film was, then, mediated from its first release as prospective audiences were told what they needed to know in order to view it most productively, and most appreciatively. To appreciate <i>Borderline</i> was to give oneself over to its landscape of feeling, to make one's mind passive, to succumb to the images on screen and allow oneself new modes of physical experience. The on-screen representation, Macpherson hoped, would convince even the most phlegmatic Englishman into <i>feeling</i>, promising, then, access to a heretofore unknown realm of sensual experience. Macpherson makes this claim in his defensive explication of his film published in <i>Close Up</i>:  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The Englishman rejects too much of his emotional being, and is embarrassed if he has to be brought face to face with it. His fear of "morbidity" and the neurotic is a race neurosis which sets him at a disadvantage when it comes to emotional, or mental-emotional experience. This attitude is clearly evident among my critics. They reject <i>Borderline</i>, not because it is complex—for its power is its complexity, its "unexplainedness"—like something seen through a window or a keyhole; but because it is a film of sub-conscious reasoning. And if, among the English, the sub-consciousness is ruefully admitted, for some definitely social reason it "is not to be condoned!"<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->




<p class="continued">The inexplicability of the unconscious realm, its obscurity translated into the film medium, allows a secret view, a momentary pleasure associated with voyeurism or a moment at the keyhole. Macpherson understands why the English public may not want to claim its unconscious space, since it is associated with those desires that society demands we censor, yet rails against the failure to face the interpretive uncertainty, the incoherence, and the access to our shared darkness offered by the film. The Englishman's "fear of morbidity," that unwillingness to look at humanity's unwholesome face, marks the failure of film audiences to understand and appreciate <i>Borderline</i>. Yet, as well as the boldness of illicit desire, it is the complexity of its representation—the source of its power—that challenges and inhibits its audience who seem to be unwilling to <i>experience</i> the film on a more visceral, or at least less cognitive, level. Legibility, Macpherson complains, is a borderline across which critics won't stray (as a number of modernists discovered); he vigorously mounts an attack against the pretense of a transparent image easily comprehended and defends obscurity, unreadability, and sensation over the relative straightforward processes of cognition. This is a film of "sub-conscious reasoning," which reasons then unreasonably, and inscribes contradiction and interpretive difficulty as an ideal. It is ironic that the terms of the debate surrounding the critical reception of the film—readability, obscurity, abstraction, and legibility—are the terms that Macpherson himself introduces through his interest in the unconscious; as the director well knew, the unconscious itself is predicated on its impenetrability, its resistance to interpretation, and its endless capacity for generating anxiety about its contents. </p>

<p>The modern world, characterized not just by racial and class division, but also by the numbing effects of urban industrial life, was insensate, unresponsive, and persuasively red by the industrial sky and etherized patient of T. S. Eliot's "Prufrock." While Eliot's conclusion is bleak, the Pool group offered a radical reinterpretation, an alternative 

<b></b>

 response to the losses occasioned by modern life through sensation. <i>Borderline</i>, as an intellectual enterprise, delves into the obscurity and complexity of feeling—the film in fact proposes a new dimension of film affectivity. Its experiment, however, is to visualize the senses shorn of logic in order to visualize the unconscious, where rules of adjacency rather than logic govern, and where the senses reign over sense-making. Agitation, from the Latin <i>agere</i>, refers to a driving force, comprehensible in a post-Freudian world as the drives that motivate and propel us. The film provides a visual record of the drives, and understands itself largely in terms of the unconscious. What lurks there? What scandal? <i>Borderline</i> will give a series of visual fragments in response, fractured, agitated, furious, homicidal, and above all, desiring. </p>

2. Reasoning with the Unconscious 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>Bertrand Russell is also a reader of the unconscious—though more as a cultural force than as a psychological one—and analyzes the ways that Freudian theory presents it to the general public as metaphor. Albeit brief, Russell's focus on psychoanalysis, in his series of lectures collected in <i>The Analysis of Mind</i>, contributes, in interesting ways, to Freud's metaphoric use of spatial topographies and the unspoken desires on which it depends and illuminates, if necessarily dimly, the use of the unconscious in <i>Borderline</i>. Russell reads psychoanalysis as a literary critic might, looking for its mode of fiction-making, stylistic panache, and recurring images or tropes. He eschews what he views as the psychoanalytic tendency toward exaggeration, yet recognizes the usefulness of the conclusions that it frequently draws: "Many psychoanalysts," he writes, "are unduly narrow . . . this, however, does not affect the value of their general theories from the point-of-view of theoretic psychology, [it is] from this point-of-view that their results are important for the analysis of the mind" (<i>AM</i>, 16). Russell particularly criticizes the theory of the unconscious for its unscientific air of mystery, its vagueness, and its failure to describe the contents of unconscious desire, and points to the propensity of psychoanalytic discourse to create images that are more compelling than they are logically convincing. In the following passage, he paints a picture, remarkable for its own descriptive excess, of the unconscious as a dark repository of secret desires: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Thus "the unconscious" becomes a sort of underground prisoner, living in a dungeon, breaking in at long intervals upon our daylight respectability with dark groans and maledictions and strange atavistic lusts. The ordinary reader, almost inevitably, thinks of this underground person as another consciousness, prevented by what Freud calls the "censor" from making his voice heard in company, except on rare and dreadful occasions when he shouts so loud that everyone hears him and there is a scandal. Most of us like the idea that we could be desperately wicked if only we let ourselves go. For this reason, the Freudian "unconscious" has been a consolation to many quiet and well-behaved persons.</p>

</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The prisoner—angry, vituperative, lustful—lives beneath our feet, below ground, out of sight and out of earshot until those momentary breaks into the open air, and then 

<b></b>

 scandal ensues. He is not so much a representation of the unconscious, as one of <i>another</i> consciousness, another subject who exists <i>with</i> rather than within us, a stranger whose strange desires exist just below the floorboards. This is the site of otherness, an alterity startling, fascinating, and weirdly reassuring: despite the potential horror that Russell acknowledges, the untamed animal, the other that threatens to undo our polite facades instead consoles, makes up for the ongoing discomfort afforded those of us who are quiet and well-behaved persons.  </p>

<p>It is not, though, the consolation, or the tapping into our own unknown desires, offered by our encounter with otherness that Russell criticizes, but the image itself of the unconscious as dark repository. It too simply explains, by bifurcation into two separate mental systems, the desires that drive us and that constitute our experiential lives: "What is an unconscious desire?" Russell asks and comments, "we observe that Freud and his followers, though they have demonstrated beyond dispute the immense importance of 'unconscious' desires in determining our actions and beliefs, have not attempted the task of telling us what an 'unconscious' desire actually is, and have thus invested their doctrine with an air of mystery and mythology which forms a large part of its popular attractiveness" (<i>AM</i>, 18). There may be something attractive, or deeply compelling, as Russell asserts, in thinking of ourselves as inherently rebellious, wicked, and devoted to bizarre and secret pleasures despite our pleasant demeanors and professional attitudes; each of us, that is, comprised not just of drives and the rules that govern them, but also of a sensational space, a space from which unruly voices shout extraordinary and shameful things. This space may be a fiction, as Russell contends, yet it is a fiction, he also notes, in which the public wants to believe, a space whose representation as fearful dungeon mollifies with its image of otherness just out of our reach, there and not there, a potential scandal waiting to disrupt our quotidian lives.  </p>

<p>This sensational space, the space of the unconscious as we might imagine it, is thus obscure, chaotic, and cloaked in mystery, a mystery to which, Russell claims, the popular imagination clings. It is this sensational space as a space of terror, chaos, and a liberating otherness that <i>Borderline</i> provides us with a vision of our own feral selves, locked up behind doors with weak hinges. <i>Borderline</i> situates itself at a number of crossings—at those borders that separate social, geographic, and especially psychological realms. Investigating the unconscious, though an impossible project to consummate, might (as Russell seems to believe) allow some understanding of the contents of unconscious desire, the desire that knows no rules, that horrifies the censor, and that yearns (like a separate entity) to make itself heard. The unconscious, of course, is only available as a fantasy, viewed from a perch at an imaginary keyhole; there we might hope to witness something shocking, unfamiliar, terrifying, and altogether fascinating. Macpherson's position behind the camera lens, looking through the viewfinder, frames an unconscious and sensational world for us as he conceives it.   </p>

<p>The word sensation, of course, is not singular in meaning and points in multiple directions, as Russell's definition of sensation "as the intersection of mind and matter" suggests. "Sensation" is an intersection that undoes any easy division between mind and body and connotes instead a <i>shared</i> physical and mental experience: it also, within 

<b></b>

 this broader framework, refers to the multiple realms of the senses, the success of any given person or event, a certain level of excitement, and the "faculty through which the external world is apprehended."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Sensation will be spatialized in Russell's theory, just as Freud's theory of the unconscious famously relies on res of spatial topography: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>. . . different senses have different spaces. The space of sight is quite different from the space of touch: it is only by experience in infancy that we learn to correlate them . . . . The one space into which both kinds of sensations fit is an intellectual construction . . . . And besides touch and sight, there are other kinds of sensation which give other, though less important spaces: these also have to be fitted into the one space by means of experienced correlations.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Sensation follows a logic of correlation, of spatial analogy, one might say, and this is employed as the structuring logic of MacPherson's film. Pete, hoping to convince Adah to come back to him, pursues her through the cobblestoned streets of the village. While Pete nearly catches her before she disappears around a corner or up some stairs, the viewer sees another interspersed action: a kitten toys with a fish caught in a small glass jar, left, presumably by a child, on the street. While the intent to kill isn't obvious, the inevitable outcome for the fish seems bleak as the small paw scoops at the water. Sensation, anatomized through the image of the kitten's wet paw and Pete's hasty pursuit over an uneven path, is fully realized at the moment where Pete and Adah meet under a stone arch and seem to merge with the stone itself; Pete's hand, outstretched, suggests his desire, while both faces betray little expression at their reunion. Simultaneously, or so it seems through the film's editing, a mother appears to discipline a resistant child. It becomes clear that this is social discipline at work, as we see that she is putting shoes on his feet. Through editing, civilized necessity meets instinctual necessity, as the kitten pursues its prey and Pete catches Adah. The kitten and fish, and mother and child scenes only make sense in relation to the pursuit of Adah by Pete. All pursuers, it is worth noting, are poised to succeed: action is rewarded in this segment of film. Social demand (a man must have a loyal wife) and instinctual demand combine through the sequencing of the frames and explain, for the audience, the necessity of Pete's actions. Only through the logic of adjacency does this sequence of scenes acquire any meaning for the viewer.  </p>

<p>Sensation, not immediately representable on film, relies on the image which comes to mediate it and which allows its representation in film. The image acts as filmic corollary to sensation which registers already as a loss—the price paid for modern technologies. Russell meditates on the distinction between sensation and image at length in his lectures and provides a causal explanation for the appearance of the image. An image, in Russell's theory, is not of the world of physics, but is a mental copy, a record of past sensation; it is a mental apprehension of a felt event, what remains of a momentary sensory perception that is filed away as a "copy" to be accessed at a later time: "A sensation," he writes, "fades gradually, passing by continuous gradations to the status of an image" (<i>AM</i>, 105–106). Sensation is copied, recorded, and available only through the mnemic processes as image: it is, therefore, like film, whose visual 

<b></b>

 field is one that relies on copies, and like the unconscious itself acts as a repository of images.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Film can only ever approximate sensation through recourse to the image, or a copy of the image which already is a copy of a copy, and so on. As if to underscore this, Macpherson interjects explicit references to copies throughout his narrative—a gramophone, several photos, a gull whose taxidermized body copies the posture of life, and Astrid's theatrical death-like swoon which will be copied by her murder, though this final homicidal event will take place offscreen. The viewer sees her immobile hand as evidence of her death, and the re of the hand is echoed as Thorne contemplates his own damaged and murderous hands in the following scene. The image then, as it is copied and becomes part of the circulating currency of the unconscious, is an abstraction, removed from its original context, stripped of its conscious accompaniments, and available as an autonomous vehicle of recorded sensation. Through the abstraction, or fragmented detail, a sensory collage emerges that offers an immersion into feeling rather than cognition or the interpretation that was linked, for the film's makers, on a previous generation's model. </p>

<p>An abstraction always involves a "taking away," a reduced field of information, a form that takes shape through the absence around it (also the mode of unconscious organization). Surrounding "matter" disappears, as the abstraction moves, like the image, into another realm undefined by the material world, and easily, one might imagine, into the unconscious. H.

D., <i>imagiste</i>—was very much interested in methods of abstraction that worked to produce a powerfully aestheticized image which might allow its viewer or reader to experience extraordinary intensity in the face of that image. Imagism was constituted by abstraction, by the carefully isolated image that could wield a powerful impact. With cold, clean precision, the imagist poem presented itself as concentrated and exquisitely carved, its excesses pared away so that only the essential image remained, the "radiant node" in Pound's phrase, that produces a sense of vertigo with its rush of related images; though several years past (Pound made his proclamations about imagism in 1912), H. D. sees something similar to the principles of imagism at work in Macpherson's film. In her pamphlet, she champions Macpherson's conceptual methods, and draws a picture of radiant abstraction: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>There are moments, in Mr. Macpherson's sequences, when a flash of white hand or the high lights across the knuckles of a black hand become, you might say, as "sterile" as certain much-vaunted "effects" of sieve, tooth-pick, or cullander. But when Mr. Macpherson plays upon abstraction, it is in reference to some other abstraction. A telephone receiver of usual form and literacy, is dealt with, as abstraction, though it merges to the concrete when applied to succeeding abstraction of a stern chin line. The method of Mr. Macpherson is admittedly an "abstract" method, but he is only satisfied when abstraction coupled with related abstraction makes logical dramatic sequence. A little oil can, for instance (concise modernistic abstraction) relates to a giant negro shoulder. Oil and heat are related to a dark brow, that great head that bends forward, very earth giant.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">The white hand, the black knuckles, the giant negro shoulder: bodies become part of a landscape of objects, equal, H. D. wants to suggest, to the oil can, the sieve, the tooth-pick, the telephone receiver. H. D. removes each fragment from a larger social 

<b></b>

 landscape in which it would acquire more fully determined meaning (although her reliance on racial types and her insistence on embellishing body fragments with adjectives suggests some of the film's many problems with racial representation). Her repetition of the word "abstraction" in the passage suggests something of the significance she attributes to abstraction itself as an aesthetic quality, as a virtue, and as something "new" in the world of film already grown highly conventionalized. H. D. looks to the new relations established by extracting images from a familiar context and reorganizing them on a different plane to yield different effects. Abstraction and related abstraction build upon and copy one another within Macpherson's frame; H. D. comments that he does not simply play upon abstractions, but has each abstraction refer to yet another abstraction, in an endless metonymic chain of images. A Negro shoulder paired with an oil can brings the body into a mechanical and sterile space, or into a realm of line and contour over that of meaning. </p>

<p>Even race itself in the film's narrative stands in for something immaterial, another sort of abstraction over the material difference of skin color. One, of course, might argue that race is always an abstraction, a categorical code rather than an essential difference, even though those codes determine the essential life experience of those who are categorized at the borders, or margins, of white normativity. In <i>Borderline</i>, Paul Robeson's character emblematizes stillness; he is monumentalized, fetishized, made static and calm. In a world of violent and erratic emotions, he is the still point around which obsession violently swirls. As critics have noted, he is a representation of the primitive, but a primitive tamed, given to highly codified romantic desire over the tempests of sexual desire. Pete comes to the mountain village to reclaim Adah, and is thus given a degree of agency that is denied her, yet in the terms of the film's framing, he is always the object. His body is scrutinized in every frame, "sculpted," as H. D. puts it in her pamphlet, from light and, it would seem, from stone.  </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">
3. The Hand in the Machine 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>An early indication of the emphasis on Pete as (erotic) object in the film will be the framing of his hands.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  The film's viewers will, no doubt, note the repeated, one might even say heavy-handed, trope of hands throughout the film. Hands serve as the primary index to the sense of touch, but rendered in visual language, their symbolic range is greater, extending to all the senses. The hand stands (as it were) apart, abstracted from the body, as an indicator of sensation, the combined experience of emotion and the body. Are hands the betrayer of desire or the iconic symbol of our shared humanity? Do hands become the signifiers of all that is concrete, or are they instead abstractions, symbols of something intangible, like the emotions? In thinking about hands in this period, one remembers Wing Biddlebaum, Sherwood Anderson's troubled protagonist whose hands, like hummingbird wings, are barely visible for their movement as they dip and curve and flash through the air, alighting for a bare instant before they are in motion once more. <i>Borderline</i> takes a similar interest in hands, though in the film they seem to be stopped in time, framed, made static, sculptural, concrete, and iconic. 

<b></b>

 Pete's hands are photographed at different angles, in multiple frames, as they hang, unmoving, relaxed, signifying his monumental calm and his phallic power that is both given and denied him by the film's narrative. (. <a href="#3">3</a> and <a href="#4">4</a>) The multiple shots of Pete's hands give the sense that the film is actually slowing down, reflecting something greater than human time, geologic time, perhaps, that transcends the tiny dramas that mark human lives. Yet despite the gravity bestowed upon them by the camera's almost-still photography, the hands also connote sexuality. Pete's hands seem beseeching, masculine, and powerfully determined in their close-up framing: their smooth masculinity will be chosen by Adah who leaves Thorne and returns to her original lover. </p>

<p>Do hands, then, signify origins, originality, a return to something primal, before civilization, before the invention of, say, the moving picture? The repeated emphasis on hands suggests that Macpherson is looking for a way to introduce an authenticity aligned with the primitive and with nature. One might also surmise that Macpherson included so many shots of hands to reassure his own doubts about the reality that film does replace human contact, the hand of the artist, with its cold celluloid frames. This modernist film expresses shock throughout, yet locates itself in the pastoral space of an old-world mountain village, as if to deny any impact of the contemporary urban on its characters. The train as an image of rupture begins and ends the film; yet the film seems aware of the paradox that the representation of nature can only be transmitted by a mechanical invention that operates as its own disturbance. The focus on hands might be read as a step away from the shock technology associated with film as a mechanized medium. Hands will <i>at times</i> re presence, although the medium of film is predicated upon absence, the flickering and insubstantial image constituted by little more than light. The hands, thus, bring the viewer back to the work of art, the hand of the artist, and to a fantasy of desire unmediated by the cold technologies of twentieth-century film. Just as the image of Astrid's hand at the moment of her death signifies both life and life lost, Macpherson deploys the hand as trope to signal the power of human sensation, and its inevitable loss as it transmutes into image, a copy of feeling, that he will once again attempt to inject with vitality.  </p>

<p>The loss of sensation, due to the mechanical world, and to the conversion of felt experience into mental image is most identified with the film's female characters. The hands of Pete and Thorne appear as emblems of their participation in the sensual world, their homoerotic brotherhood sealed in their clasped hands near the end of the film. (<a href="#5"> 5</a>)<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Women's hands seem to have a more complicated role as potential threat, or conveyors of the loss that is red by the mechanics of image. Women's hands may work to erase sexual difference: the bar manager keeps her hands in tight fists, covering her breasts, in a number of shots throughout the film. If her hands cannot signify the phallus as effortlessly as the hands of Pete and Thorne, they will perform another feat of gendering, or cross-gendering. The effect of her motionless and tightly balled fists, however, is to enfeeble the bar manager's otherwise strong, butch presence in the film, making her both aged and child-like at once. The camera also focuses on the hands of the barmaid, as she performs what might be an exotic, or balletic, dance, but aligns more closely to a gull-arm that moves mechanically in an awkwardly executed 

<b></b>

 dance. The hand, fingers touching, mirrors a bird's head, like the stuffed gull that presides over Astrid's room. The women's hands appear less natural somehow, as do Astrid's thin and claw-like hands that clutch the telephone or the edges of her fringed shawl. These images are already at a remove from the natural order; they are atrophied hands, curled, clawed, and unable to signify the broadly felt sensation identified with Pete and Thorne. While Thorne's and Pete's masculinity and sexuality are embodied in their open hands, the cramped and almost mechanical hands of the women remove them from nature and align them instead with the machinery of film.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> </p>

"That face beats through the film like the very swift progress of those wings, doomed it is evident, and already extinguished in this 'borderline' existence."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  This is Astrid's "weathered woman-face" that beats in futility, already marked by death, its progress compared to what H.

H.

<p>Just two years before making <i>Borderline</i>, the Pool group had published a book of early film theory, <i>Anatomy of Motion Picture Art</i>, whose author, Eric Elliott, writes of the general suspicion regarding film and its alignment with a lifeless technology, a technology that turns all before its lens into lifeless objects for our visual consumption: "it may be argued that these devices of the camera are mechanical. The charge of mechanicalness is made against the cinema with mechanical regularity, as if the motion picture alone should stand natural and pure among the arts."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Elliott cites a paradox governing public response to film: audiences could not forgive the motion picture for its inhumanity, its gaze that originated in a mechanical device rather than with the human eye, yet nonetheless required the cinema to disavow its "mechanicalness" and align itself with the natural world. Macpherson draws on this desire to overcome technology and to undo the division that film images depend upon. He cuts nature into his film, especially 

<b></b>

 in his frequently cited "clatter montage" segment where Pete's image is interchanged with the image of a waterfall. The fast montage that, literally, strips Pete, cutting his image into tiny segments of film, suggests self-division, yet it is a self-division healed in the flood of images by the restorative power of nature. Yet on further reflection, one might mount a different argument to the familiar critique of film as ring a loss of humanity: like the charge produced by the surging waters over an electric carbine, Macpherson harnesses the power available to him and produces a rush of images whose effect is like that of a combustible force, not to soothe the audience, but to charge it with the electric shock of sensation, even if that sensation is only available as image, a "faded" form of sensation. Nature, in the montage sequence, provides then a vision of loss rather than one of presence, the nostalgia that characterizes Pete (in his quest to regain Adah's love), and the desire that resides in irreparable loss.  </p>

<p>Loss, in another guise, appears as a gloved hand enters the screen toward the end of the film. Astrid is dead, Thorne has been acquitted of her murder, Adah has left town. The white cloth hand delivers an envelope to the bar manager. Significantly, this hand is ungendered and unraced, its flesh almost entirely hidden from view as it completes its mechanical task. (<a href="#6"> 6</a>)<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  The letter is typed, marked by the machine of industrial society, and its message is equally marked: Pete must leave town. The gloved hand seems to comment on the human inability to feel, as it presents an unfeeling epidermal substitution: the machine delivering the machine-made message. The title card that follows reads, "What do you think?" What can Pete or the bar manager think? What can we think? The film delivers its cold reality. The bar manager apologizes for the town's behavior, this title card ending as she claims "We are like that." The layer of assumption is thick in the statement, that "we" is knowable; that we are like "that," transparent, predictably narrow. But a corroborating card, presumably giving voice to Pete, soon follows and complicates the certainty of the barmaid's assertion: "Yes," Pete agrees, "we are like that". (<a href="#7"> 7</a>) This title card presents us with the affirmation or at least recognition of group identity, an echo, a copy of the earlier statement, a confusion of "we," that now becomes more expansive and inclusive. The barmaid's "we" and Pete's echo leaving the sentence infinitely open: Who is "we"? What is "that"? </p>

<p>When Macpherson writes that film's greatest gift is the obliteration of identity, perhaps this is to what he refers, the obliteration of the "we" as a selective category, as a cohesive pronoun that seeks to repel otherness.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> Instead, as Pete departs, the "we" is put into question through the vehicle of the copy, the repetition that repeats with a difference. As the film ends, Astrid has been wiped out, Adah has disappeared from view, Thorne has been redeemed, and Pete, having served his role in that redemption, is banished. Yet it is for him, that the film mourns. The piano player, whose jewelry alone signals his representational otherness, plays to a photo of a man that appears to be Pete. The image, propped up on the piano, later tucked sadly into a breast pocket, inspires the music; the pianist's desire is channeled through his fingers; his hands mechanical and sensual, in constant movement, seeking and not finding. The photo in the film, the static copy in the midst of the moving frames, best demonstrates the dynamic of desire and its arrest in the film. (<a href="#8"> 8</a>) Pete is the arrested re, available for 

<b></b>

 consumption, but only as image, only via the attention-worn edges of a photographic still. It is Pete that we want—or is it Paul Robeson?—in the illusory fullness of his presence and, ultimately, in the knowledge of his loss? For, in the end, sensation is an illusion, a fantasy of experiencing ourselves without the mediation of technology, of urban industrial life, as originals rather than copies. Astrid, obliterated from the film for her failure to mask the kinetic pace and mechanical postures associated with the loss of sensation, has been forgotten. Pete allows us to hold on to the fantasy a little longer, especially given the terms of his departure. If only he hadn't been driven out of town, we could believe in our humanity—and here it is the most expansive definition of "our"—as our ability to feel. By forcing his removal, paradoxically the film perpetuates its belief in sensation, in a world unmediated by the image. Robeson himself offers the further consolation of celebrity. That is, celebrity emerges as an acceptable form of detachment, a faded form of sensation; it provides the coolness of the image that entreats us, yet gives us nothing.</p>

<p>H. D.'s weathered face offers another image—the aging woman, the loss of beauty, the beating taken from life. The face that Perdita Schaffner, H. D.'s daughter, describes as "very beautiful, quite magical in appearance—tall, gaunt and graceful, with exquisite bone structure and searching grey eyes" is only visible in stark contours. Schaffner goes on to say of H. D. that "she was also very excitable. Her descents into everyday life were an ordeal."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  The winged descent, beating into life, the ordeal and promise of the image itself that contains her remarkable features and the static fervor of her gestures is what <i>Borderline</i> presents and asks us to respond with visceral horror. Astrid doesn't survive the film, yet her death underscores the importance of abstraction, the defining mode of the unconscious that the film investigates. The obliteration of identity—both an effect of film and a description of the unconscious—may be powerfully destabilizing and therefore ultimately enabling for the film viewer. Released from the logics 

<b></b>

 that structure individual lives, audience members may experience not just alternative narratives, but alternative ways of being, of experiencing life itself. The obliteration of identity may be the cinema's greatest gift, yet that doesn't necessarily imply that this will be the gift of comfort. The unconscious as an obscure and obliterating space projected on to the screen will not titillate viewers in any simple voyeuristic sense. Instead the film disturbs viewer expectation, or as Charles Affron puts it, "the comfort of what we recognize."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  <i>Borderline</i> attempts to reposition its viewers, as it were, within their own bodies, within their own sensate spaces, in order to open up new dimensions of affectivity within the confines of a prohibitory culture. </p>

<p>The advertisement that announced the release of <i>Borderline</i> in 1930 declared: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>BORDERLINE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a herald</p>
<p>Borderline&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a promise</p>
<p>BORDERLINE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a sensation<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Reflecting on the advertisement, readers might wonder what exactly it did herald and promise, beyond, that is, a film sensation. <i>Borderline</i>, in the end, wasn't a film sensation—in the sense, at least, of box office return or critical acclaim—although it did offer an investigation into film expressivity and the nature of sensation itself. The Pool film would attempt to externalize the otherness created by the unconscious, that harrowing space which had recently captured the public imagination. <i>Borderline</i> was challenging on a number of fronts: it used an already anachronistic silent film form, created a film rhetoric that was opaque and largely difficult to follow, disrupted the conventions of racial representation in film and, with its attempt to project unconscious desire—whether interracial, same-sex, violent, pecuniary, adulterous, predatory, alcoholic, homicidal, or racist—on to the screen, undermined the familiar codes of popular film narrative. But what the film most insistently presents is a vision of the expressive possibilities of film, the film's machinery of expression: the film image works to create sensation—not the sensation typically associated with the box office hit, but with the body's surface, and with the agitation that might wake an insensate public from its slumber. </p>
