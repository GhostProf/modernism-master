In <i>The Image of the Poet: British Poets and their Portraits,</i> David Piper laments the "decay" of portraiture "through the first half of the twentieth century, when almost all artists of any originality were uninterested in it, pursuing rather Roger Fry's formal values in painting to the brink of abstraction and beyond." He goes on:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
T. S. Eliot is a case in point. There is little of him other than photographs. Wyndham Lewis's portrait of 1938, though odd enough at the time to cause its rejection by the Academy . . . seems now very conventional, inexpressive in characterization, though a tantalizing encapsulation of publisher/critic/poet in the armour uniform of invisible ordinary man. In context with Wyndham Lewis's work it is more informative about that than it is, in context with Eliot's work, about his poetry . . . Eliot, advocate of "extinction of personality," was famous for his rejection of the picturesque poet's garb. Sober-suited.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
My curiosity was piqued by Piper's comments about the decay of portraiture and modern artists' disinterest in it. I thought of Picasso's cubist, abstract, neo-classical, surreal, and expressionist experiments in the art of portraiture, Giacometti's sculptural

<b></b>

portraits with their strange formal distortions, or Francis Bacon's kinetic, deforming faces and res?<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
And what of Piper's claim about the conspicuous absence of other portraits of Eliot? I recalled Theresa Garrett Eliot's pen-sketch of Eliot's face in three-quarter view, made in the 1920s, Wyndham Lewis's numerous pencil, charcoal, ink-and-wash exploratory sketches of him, and Charlotte Eliot Smith's enchanting oil painting (<i>c.</i> 1900) of a twelve-year-old Eliot sitting on a chair, in sculptural side profile, reading a red volume of Shakespeare.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
My interest was further stirred by Piper's invocation of that critical albatross of the twentieth century, Eliot's notion of the "extinction of personality." Yet one recalls a famous photograph of Eliot (with Lady Ottoline Morrell), standing by a grand fireplace, slickly coiffured and white flannel trousered, a Prufrockian re, with his self-consciously fashionable dandyism (<i>LOTSE,</i>  27). (Eliot once wrote to Conrad Aiken to ask him to retrieve a valise with "a blue suit in it" because "I want to be able to look <i>herrlich</i>" (splendid) for Lutheran Herr Pfarrer [<i>LOTSE,</i> 40].) Here indeed is Baudelaire's dandy, striving to create "a <i>personal</i> form of originality," "taking the pleasure of causing surprise," and "never showing <i>anyone oneself.</i>"<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, there was Piper's astonishingly blas&#x000E9; dismissal of a century of photographic portraiture. Yet two of the most striking photographs of the twentieth century are portraits of Eliot; one is by the German &#x000E9;migr&#x000E9; Bill Brandt (hailed as "the Samuel Beckett of photographers" by Cecil Beaton), who captured Eliot's silhouetted re in front of and framed by a Victorian window that makes for a richly monochromic, vigilantly geometrical mise-en-sc&#x000E8;ne.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  The other is by the great American avant-garde photographer Irving Penn, who created an intensely visceral and scrupulously reductionist image of Eliot, with one half of his face dramatically illuminated by a bone-white, electric light, the other absorbed into an obliterating, illegible darkness.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
What Piper seems to be doing is what Seamus Heaney has called "tolling" the "official bell of Faith," re-presenting a familiar narrative and a perfectly tuned formalism cleansed of cultural dissonance.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  As a result he fails to be listening in, or "hearing in" (in Adam Phillips's term), to those more "querulous, outcast melodies" (Heaney) discernible in Eliot's life, art, and times.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Such an approach is the opposite of Walter Benjamin's depiction of the organic contours, auditory coloration, optics, and metaphysical geography of culture and history as ragged, ruinous, polyphonic, a world of "secret affinities," a "magic encyclopedia."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Benjamin's notion that history has a kaleidoscopic and fragmented face that requires attentive scrutiny is one obliquely anticipated more than a century earlier by G. C. Lichtenberg in a comment he made to Goethe about portraiture: "Every moment, we believe that we perceive what we merely infer. It is for this reason that bad portrait painters lay in the entire face all over with pink flesh. They are unable to realise that there could be blue, green, yellow and brown shadows in a human face."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The psychoanalyst Adam Phillips has recently written: "In psychoanalysis life-stories fragment in the telling; in order to be read, interpreted, they have to be unreadable . . . [and] refuse the conventional satisfactions of narrative;" therefore one aim of 

<b></b>

psychoanalysis is to create "a reconstructed life-history that makes the past available as a resource to be thought about, rather than a persecution to be endlessly re-enacted." It is "as much about the making of gaps as about the making of links," its aim being "not to recover the past, but to make recovery of the past possible."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  Much the same might be said of a complex cultural criticism, one that would meld the heritage of Benjamin with the original prescriptions of Phillips.
</p>

<p>
Such a critical style may also be especially apposite to modernism. After all, it was Ernest Fenollosa, in that pioneering and most influential of modernist essays, <i>The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry,</i> who wrote: "The truth is that acts are successive, even continuous; one causes or passes into another. And though we may string never so many clauses into a single compound sentence, motion leaks everywhere, like electricity from an exposed wire."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Indeed, Eliot's own work has been viewed as having analogous properties by the poet John Ashbery, who has remarked that <i>The Waste Land,</i> notwithstanding Eliot's "craft and scholarship," "achieves its effect as a collage of hallucinatory, random fragments . . . Their contiguity is all their meaning, and it is implied that from now on meaning will take into account the randomness and discontinuity of modern experience" and "cannot be truthfully defined as anything else."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  A criticism commensurate with the fierce formal ambitions of Eliot's poem would entail a Benjaminesque "cracking open of natural teleology," with its compositional principle of montage form, its "philosophic play of distances, transitions, and intersections," and "its perpetually shifting contexts and ironic juxtapositions."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  It would require a critical practice analogous to the creative practice on view in the painting <i>Study after Vel&#x000E1;zquez</i> by Francis Bacon, who creates vertical folds in the curtain which cut right through the re standing before it, a painterly technique that Bacon termed "shuttering," saying that "it means that the sensation doesn't come straight at you but slides slowly and gently through the gaps."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  How would a critical technique assimilate the lesson of Bacon's notion of "shuttering" (enigmatically, a term that spans music, painting, photography, architecture) in order to approach the task of writing about Eliot's life, art, and consciousness? Could such narratives "fragment in the telling" thereby becoming "unreadable," and "a resource to be thought about, rather than a persecution to be endlessly re-enacted?" With these questions in view, I began to search for significant clues, gaps, stray fragments, and leakages in Eliot's <i>oeuvre</i> in relation to his iconography in twentieth-century art history, seeking to reconstruct a critique and life-history off the beaten track of scholarship.
</p>

<p>
T. S. Eliot is one of the most pictorially depicted poets of the twentieth century, indeed of any century. I have collected portraits of him by some forty-five major and other distinguished artists who made paintings, drawings, sketches, sculptures, caricatures, cartoons, photographs, etchings, and mosaics of the poet. The eclectic modes encompassed by these portraits include the classical, surreal, expressionist, rative, cubist, abstract, and social-realist. Their varied media range from monochromic and color prints to oil, charcoal, watercolour, pencil, gouache, pen, crayon, wash, chromatic tessera, clay, iron, and ink. And Eliot's portraitists stem from many national traditions&#x02014;Russian, German, English, Italian, New Zelandish, Irish, Romanian, American, and Polish.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Eliot's interest in art history was serious, sustained, and continually formative to his thinking and his artistic consciousness. As a Harvard undergraduate he attended in 1910 a course on Fine Art and wrote detailed responses to individual painters.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  His early letters are littered with perspicacious and enthused remarks on classical and modern art. In 1914, he wrote to Conrad Aiken of the "<i>stunning</i>" paintings of Flanders, the "<i>treasures</i> in Bruges and Antwerp and Brussels! Memling, van Eyck, Matsys, David, Breughel, Rubens," "a wonderful <i>Crucifixion</i> of Antonello of Messina" and "<i>three</i> great <i>St. Sebastians</i>" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 41). His interest was also on show in his 1915 appeal to Pound: "please tell me who Kandinsky is."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  In the same year he wrote to Isabella Stewart Gardner, a prominent Bostonian art collector, to tell her of his new interest in Gaudier-Brzeska, Wyndham Lewis, Jacob Epstein, and Edward Wadsworth (<i>LOTSE,</i> 94). Seven years later, when suggesting to Scofield Thayer possible contributors for the <i>Dial,</i> Eliot urged him to contact the same artists, as well as Walter Sickert. "There are important people in Paris too," he added, "Picasso, Modigliani, Matisse, Marchand etc" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 363). Discussing the soon-to-be published <i>Criterion,</i> he informed Pound, "I am particularly anxious to obtain Picabia, for whom I have much respect" (<i>LOTSE,</i> 508). Eliot was also a frequent and discerning visitor of art exhibitions, as can be seen in his "London Letter" of June 1921, in which he comments extensively on the English tradition of caricature and its pertinence to contemporary exhibitions by H. M. Bateman and Wyndham Lewis.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
However the richest vein to mine for understanding Eliot's views on modern art is portraiture, where Eliot tirelessly explored, consolidated, and interrogated his own image. It is as if Eliot lived an enchanting subterranean life, quietly slipping away from his official duties at the offices of Faber and Faber and stealing precious time from his pressing creative and critical work in order to sit for hours for his portraits, often entrusting his image to the unpredictable hands of artists with soaring ambitions. Intriguingly, Eliot was no mere onlooker in the ongoing drama of his portraiture, but a key player (as we shall see in detail later).
</p>

<p>
In response to an invitation by the legendary Russian mosaicist Boris von Anrep, Eliot wrote on 17 November 1952: "I am most flattered and interested to hear that I am included in your mosaic . . . I shall certainly be most happy to attend the private view at the National Gallery."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Eliot would have seen his portrait in the pavement of the gallery's north vestibule, an allegorical mosaic sequence titled "The Modern Virtues," in which Eliot appears under the theme of "Leisure." Eliot lies on top of a terrace balustrade on an exotic chaise longue decorated with the heads of cats. He appears relaxed but in deep concentration as he contemplates Einstein's formula E = mc<sup>2</sup>. Anrep's famous wit permeates the mosaic: is the poet contemplating problems of the universe or gazing intently on the naked young woman who is mysteriously emerging out of a dark lake? Or is she perhaps a Prufrockian mermaid? Anrep also places symbols of modernist painting, perhaps a Picasso or Braque, and modernist sculpture, to the extreme left of the mosaic.

Wallace Stevens's maxim&#x02014;"The Poet is a god or The young poet is a god. The old poet is a tramp"&#x02014;is illustrated in the four oil portraits of Eliot by the Anglo-Irish artist 

<b></b>

Gerald Kelly, works he painted in the early 1960s and exhibited at the Royal Academy of Art in London.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Eliot was particularly impressed with the first of these and on 29 July 1962 he wrote to Kelly:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

I want to arrive at an agreement with you about my portrait which has been shown at the Academy this year. This is a masterpiece and I shall never have a better portrait even from yourself.

<ol class="decimal">
<li>That you don't touch the head and face again. The face is so good that it cannot be improved. Remember the moral of Balzac's <i>Chef d'&#156;uvre Inconnu.</i></li>

In Balzac's <i>Le Chef-d'oeuvre inconnu</i> (<i>The Unknown Masterpiece</i>), the painter Frenhofer claims, "Mon oeuvre est parfaite" ("My work is perfect"), and the moral and irony of the story is that La Belle Noiseuse may have been perfected out of existence. So Frenhofer cries out: "Ah! Ah! You were not expecting so much perfection. You are in front of a woman, and you are looking for a painting."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  The novelist A. S. Byatt notes, "The adjective in the title is <i>inconnu,</i> unknown, and it is not clear whether the word refers to the historical loss of the work, the contemporary failure to recognise a masterpiece, or simply the disappearance of the recognisable forms of the portrait in the dense surface of the paint."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Eliot had known several of his portraitists (Jacob Epstein, Gerald Kelly, and Wyndham Lewis) as friends and compatriot artists. In an interview of 1949, Eliot referred to the "look of slightly quizzical inscrutability" on the face of his portraitist Wyndham Lewis and jokingly accounted for his many portraits by this great artist: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
There is a good deal to be said for sticking to the same doctor. . . There is the same reason for sticking to the same painter&#x02014;if he is a good painter; he knows the history of one's face as well as the expression assumed for the sitting&#x02014;an expression which is sometimes a defensive or bogus one when exposed to the sustained scrutiny of an unfamiliar pair of eyes on the other side of the easel.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot, however, was also willing to accommodate the newer art and pioneering techniques of less established foreign artists whose work was much less familiar to him. Writing from London in 1939 to the now legendary German-Jewish &#x000E9;migr&#x000E9; in Paris, the social-realist photographer Gis&#x000E8;le Freund, Eliot says:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
I remember, of course, meeting you with Andr&#x000E9; Gide in Paris, and it would be a pleasure to see you again. I am a little alarmed at the prospect of a colour photograph because I do not think that I have a very beautiful colour, and I am always depressed at the sight of my photographs even uncoloured. Nevertheless, if you wish to make a photograph of me and can do it here, I am naturally flattered.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup> <b></b>

<p class="noIndent">
One especially ambitious portfolio of portraits of Eliot is by another then newcomer to the art world, the post-war British abstract painter Patrick Heron. Between 1947 and 1949, Heron made eleven portraits of Eliot in various genres and media (oil, cont&#x000E9; charcoal, blue crayon, chalk), culminating in a final 1949 cubist oil painting with its stereoscopic chromatic diffraction of Eliot's face. Nine are <i>modello</i> studies, or experimental drafts. In a letter of 28 January 1947, Eliot replied to Heron: "I shall be very willing to sit for you, and of course had already been warned of your interest in the possibilities of my features . . . I do not know how you will find my room, the window has a north facing exposure but it is a very small room."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Heron said he "scribble(d) like mad at the sittings" in Eliot's Faber office, trying to capture the "'plastic facts' of Eliot's physiognomy":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Eliot was the most sublime of sitters . . . accommodat[ing] a painter's needs . . . anticipating highly technical requirements . . . once, during one of our sittings . . . he volunteered: "I am now focusing again on the same chimney pot. But that of course does not guarantee the angle of my head." Only a professional model would have had such a conscious awareness of the physical position of his own head. I realised at that moment that Eliot's genius extended far beyond the sphere of the verbal. Obviously he was as aware of the form in space, which was his own body slanted in that tiny room, as a sculptor might have been. I always thought that his comments on pictorial matters had the sort of validity that normally one only encounters in the casual remarks of painters and sculptors themselves.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Indeed, Eliot's spatial intelligence is also evident when he writes about the stage:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Just as photography has influenced the art of portrait painting, in that the aim of the modern portrait painter is likely to be directed to doing what the photographer cannot do . . . On the stage . . . the picture&#x02014;the total scene, the movement, posture <strike>posing</strike> and gesture of each member of the cast&#x02014;should be <strike>presented</strike> calculated with a view to completing the message conveyed by the words.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot's repeated willingness to meet the technical needs and accommodate the temperaments of his portraitists says much about his practical artistic acumen and his sustained interest in his own portraiture. Knowing Wyndham Lewis to be a "highly strung, nervous man . . . conscious of his own abilities . . . sensitive to slight or neglect," he nevertheless sat endlessly for him.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Another portraitist, the pioneering Russian born photographer Ida Kar, was a fastidious perfectionist in her shooting sessions.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Her assistant recalls that during one session for portraits of Eliot in 1956 "there were moments of the most excruciating embarrassment. The way she treated T. S. Eliot."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  And when the noted photographer of the famous and fashionable, Slim Aarons, heard that Eliot was in the Bahamas in 1959, he requested a highly stylized photo session with the poet.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  In an autobiographical <i>aide m&#x000E9;moire</i> he recalled:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
While doing a Holiday Story about Nassau, I was told that T. S. Eliot has arrived on his honeymoon. I had a sudden idea and called him at his hotel . . . and asked if I could come by and explain what I had in mind . . . I didn't want a typical publicity shot taken in the 

<b></b>

hotel lobby or on his balcony&#x02014;it wouldn't do him or my readers justice, as he was too important a man. I told him of a location I had in mind on the far side of the island (a background I had planned for a beautiful-girl shot, aptly named Love Beach). All it had was a palm-front hut on a lonely beach used by romantic swimmers who wanted to get away from the tourists. He understood completely what I was trying to do and agreed to drive out there with me and Mrs Eliot. They both admired the setting, and with good humour fell into the pose. All the while I kept thinking of his famous lines from "Prufrock": "I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk up [<i>sic</i>] the beach / I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each." When we had finished he asked me if I would mind doing him a favour. I said, "Anything, Mr. Eliot, anything."' He asked if I would take a picture of him with his wife . . . he took her hand and looked at her with great tenderness. I remembered how I struggled to follow the sophisticated dialogue of his play <i>The Cocktail Party,</i> which I had seen in New York&#x02014;it was the one play you couldn't sleep through if you wanted to grasp the lines&#x02014;and there he was, the great poet, in love.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<p>
In a Prufrockian mise-en-sc&#x000E8;ne, a tanned Eliot is posed, seated on a white deck chair on a golden beach, clothed in a white shirt and creamy white suit (with rolled trousers), white shoes, and a raffish, ribboned Panama hat. In the background is a mirror-calm sea and a luscious, green palm-tree. The soft pastels of pinks, blues and creams of Aarons's portrait of the poet convey the quintessence of a lifestyle of wealth, ease, and elegance. Yet, beyond this glamorous public image, in a later letter of 1962 addressed to someone else, we glimpse Eliot's more candid view of Nassau's fashionable culture: "This year, after Christmas we . . . return to Nassau where we went three years ago. We do not much like Nassau, but the beach at that hotel is magnificent and swimming in warm sea water is the best exercise in the world for me."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Eliot's portraits are resonant with significance. In their sheer plenitude they give us a visual feast of new and exciting images of this major poet, of which many have remained unpublished and unseen for years. They also unveil a fascinating cache of accompanying manuscript and critical material that relates to Eliot's views on art and the creation of his images, material that also stretches our received understanding of his biography. Letters, journals, autobiographies, mementoes, interviews, and essays in which Eliot's portraitists record their views of their famous sitter reveal the creative processes and tensions entailed in the making of an original portrait. 
</p>

<p>
Intriguingly, what is also revealed is Eliot keenly and consciously self-fashioning his image, a process that casts doubt on any notion of a static, unified human identity and reflects his own passion for metamorphosis. The images of the artistic subject continuously dissolve and re-form, becoming almost a pictorial counterpart to his allusive and protean poetics. From the prolific Polish artist Zdzislaw Czerm&#x000E1;nski's winsomely witty and paradoxical depiction of Eliot as a black-suited, bowler-hatted, Mallaca-caned banker-poet who rides on a white winged Pegasus (cover illustration), to Gis&#x000E8;le Freund's raw, tense, full-face close-up color photograph; from the soft-focussed, stylized, three-quarter face of the 1920s photograph by E. O. Hopp&#x000E9; to Theresa Garrett Eliot's sketch of Eliot asleep on a chaise-longe; from her bright watercolour of the poet writing, alone in a drawing room, to Thomas Derrick's 1932 flowing cartoon-caricature design of Eliot riding a Melvellian whale and surrounded by lamenting mermaids as he leaves 

<b></b>

for America; from the 1948 "reportage portrait" of the black silhouetted re of Eliot walking solitary in a park by the photojournalist Felix Man to Boris Artzybasheff's richly allusive and surreally Daliesque painting: Eliot's image undergoes, in the hands of these artists, many transmutations and metaphorical variations&#x02014;a kind of magical artistic shamanism.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The portraits also have bibliographic pertinence, for they became an occasion for Eliot to make cameo appearances in publications as diverse as <i>Vogue,</i> the <i>Bookman, Harper's Bazaar, Punch,</i> the <i>Sunday Times, Picture Post, Time,</i> the <i>Dial,</i> and <i>Boston Evening Transcript,</i> with cultural contexts and audiences that far exceeded purely literary ones. More important, Eliot's art and image were assimilated by an international group of artists, inscribed into their own aesthetics and absorbed into artistic cross-currents and cross-fires. The making of an Eliot portrait became, more than once, a dramatic mise-en-sc&#x000E8;ne for the artistic manifestos, dialogues, rivalries, and camaraderie between the different portraitists and also their subject, often slipped into remarks obliquely made or outright declaimed. Wyndham Lewis, for instance, competed with fellow artists Patrick Heron and William Rothenstein for possession of Eliot's image; he also wittily sniped at his sitter in December 1938, writing to Ezra Pound: "<u>The Undertaker</u> (as Lady Ott. called 'poor Tom') has been here to sit and I have done a lot of useful work on his face. It is going to be a very good portrait indeed. You will see it in New York, I hope."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  In fact Lewis's controversial 1938 oil painting of Eliot sparked a national debate in England about the nature and direction of modern portraiture, an endless "row in the papers about Wyndham Lewis's rejected portrait of Tom" which Virginia Woolf jotted in her diary entry of 3 May 1938.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, through the prism of these portraits we can see also how numerous women artists (Charlotte Eliot Smith, Theresa Garrett Eliot, Aim&#x000E9;e Lamb, Gis&#x000E8;le Freund, Jean Shepeard, Ida Kar, Kay Bell Reynal, Celia Scott, Katerina Wilczynski, Peggy Bacon, and Milein Cosman) could venture into a predominantly male art world and nurture their portraiture.
</p>

To see the canonized re of Eliot amidst the cross-cultural mises-en-sc&#x000E8;ne of modern art is to see an alphabet scattered, or a dictionary come alive. In his poignant preface to the facsimile of the drafts of <i>The Waste Land,</i> Ezra Pound wrote, "The more we know of Eliot, the better."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  The uncovering of these long-neglected portraits opens just such a prospect.

Indian street musicians, a still life of a flowering bush, St Paul's Cathedral after a bombing, or even "A Ghurka Soldier Transporting a Wounded Man on His Back Through the Jungle, c.1945." Beaton's vast portrait portfolio includes Cole Porter, Marlene Dietrich, Henry Moore, Mick Jagger, Andy Warhol, Francis Bacon, Noel Coward, Pablo Picasso, and Salvador Dali. It captures Aldous Huxley surrealistically poking his head through a vertical slit in a gauze curtain, Edith Sitwell lying on a tomb in ornate garments, Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas in a studio (with studio wires included), Marianne Moore with her "perpetually startled" face, Queen Elizabeth on the day of the Coronation, and Winston Churchill in the cabinet room.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
A member of the <i>grande bourgeoisie,</i> Beaton was born in London, and already when a child he was passionately preoccupied with portraiture; in role-playing and stage-directed shots, he photographed his pretty sisters as renaissance princesses, nymphs, nuns, and stars. Inspired by the romantic portraits of Baron de Meyer, lavish fashion photographs by Edward Steichen, and allegorical photographs of the Edwardian age, Beaton's lens captured not simply his subject but a preconceived milieu, an aesthetic ambience. Rightly, Roy Strong has called Beaton one of the greatest <i>interpreters</i> of human persona in the twentieth century.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  "My intention," Beaton explained, "seemed to be to make the camera do the work of a painter or designer. By placing strong patterns and intricate textures in the background, the sitter was used as part of a decorate scheme thought up beforehand. Sometimes the sitter's identity became subordinate to a decoration of polka dots, palm fronds or cubist patterns."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Reinforcing that description, Truman Capote observed that a sitter for Beaton had "a sense of <i>slightly</i> drifting into space&#x02014;of not being photographed but painted . . . by a casual, barely visible presence" ("I," 13). It was not by chance that Beaton routinely shifted between photography and designing d&#x000E9;cors and costumes for stage, ballets, and films. "I had two careers," he once said, "photography and set designing. They overflowed constantly."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In his <i>Scrapbook,</i> Beaton says: "Photography must always be a representation of what is in front of the lens, at the moment of the exposure, but much of the art of the serious photographer lies in knowing how to simplify for the sake of emphasis," and "retouching will play its part and to visualise the final product."<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  Truman Capote, discussing Beaton's portraiture, made a similar point:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
. . . no one had photographed faces in quite this manner before, surrounded them with such neo-romantic, stylised d&#x000E9;cor (spun glass, masked statues, pastry-moulds, and extravagant costumes: all the appurtenances of Beaton's own surrealism), or lighted them with such lacquered luminosity . . . the timeless quality in these pictures . . . in the series Beaton calls Time Sequences&#x02014;subjects he has had the opportunity to photograph over periods extending as much as four decades . . . how eerie . . . sad . . . exhilarating . . . faces flow through time&#x02014;frozen by sensitively manipulated light and shadow.

Beaton's interest in Eliot was longstanding. Already in 1927 Kyrle Leng, Beaton's friend, had suggested to him: "I think that you had better have a little house of your own and have intimate relations with T. S. Eliot and Virginia Woolf . . . You would probably evolve a style of painting, or writing which would make you famous and 

<b></b>

rich."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Beaton's first encounter with Eliot occured when he was still a student at Cambridge University, where he "attended a talk by T. S. Eliot and longed to stand up and contradict him just to see his reaction."<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  In the <i>Autobiography</i> that he published five years before he took his photographs of Eliot, Beaton recalled his unsuccessful efforts to secure Eliot as a sitter:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Mr Eliot is the only person I can bring to mind who has ever refused to be counted among my sitters. He explained that it would be impossible to decide what sort of collar he should wear for the pictures; a soft one would look untidy . . . Bohemian . . . yet he could not bring himself to be perpetuated in a standard one.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
In 1956, however, Beaton finally persuaded Eliot to allow him to make a reel of forty-three portrait shots; in his description of the poet, Beaton quotes Eliot's lines "How <i>delightful</i> to meet Mr. Eliot, / With his features of clerical cut," and says:<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup> 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Thus does this aquiline poet describe his appearance . . . it is true that with his smoothed silken hair so neatly parted slightly off-centre . . . his parchment complexion . . . pursed lips, he has something of the look of a parson. But the comparison ends there. No parson could have spent so many years in diamond-cutting his experience and literary gifts, offering them to us in a perceptive body of literary criticism, in poetry . . . in plays which have attracted audiences . . . without any intellectual condescension . . . Eliot has variously been accused of being a snob, a conservative, an anti-semitic, authoritarian, oligarchic, a preacher, bloodless, filled with death wishes. Some of these things may perhaps be read into his work. But the greatness of those spare, taut lines that have such evocative power cannot be denied.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>

Indeed Beaton's portrait portfolio of Eliot reflects him both as an eminent critic and imaginative artist with a complex consciousness. From the astonishing style and range of the forty-three pictures he took in 1956 at the Faber offices, I have chosen two shots which reflect Beaton's varying angles on a famous re.
</p>

<p>
One feature that distinguishes many of the photographs is the use that Beaton made of a frosted glass partition that featured in Eliot's Faber and Faber office. Eliot himself commented on this, according to Beaton's biographer: "The prickly poet found the poses somewhat <i>theatrical</i> but wrote&#x02014;'I have had many photographs taken in this particular room, but no one before has thought of making use of the glass partition; and with such astonishingly successful effect.'"<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  Beaton took several highly posed shots of Eliot besides the reflecting pane glass, effectively doubling his image. In one photograph, Beaton closes in on the head and shoulders: Eliot looks up, leaning against the cabinet, while Beaton shoots from below to create a strong refraction of light on the glass of his spectacles, through which, finely, the eyes are just visible (<a href="#1"> 1</a>). In this translative interplay of lenses (camera, glasses, eyes) and perspectives, Beaton enacts Roland Barthes's idea that the spectator "cannot reach into the photograph," can only "sweep it" with a "glance," and it is "precisely in this <i>arrest</i> of interpretation that the photograph's certainty resides."<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>

In another shot, Eliot is red full-length leaning against a book cabinet, one hand on the hip, the other resting on his head (<a href="#2"> 2</a>). Uniquely, this is the only full profile portrait of Eliot and Beaton may perhaps have wanted to capture his tall, sleek, dandified re. Yet historically, full-length portraits were usually reserved for rulers and nobility, and Beaton's witty imagination may be teasing out this idea. In a third photograph, not included here, Beaton also makes a darker, intimate portrait of Eliot sitting in an armchair, half in shadow, with hands gathered and fingers trellised, creating an image of complex introspection. In Barthes's term, the old hands here are the <i>punctum</i> of the photograph, which, he says, is the "sting, speck, cut, little hole&#x02014;and also a cast of the dice. A photograph's <i>punctum</i> is that accident which pricks me (but also bruises me, is poignant to me)" (<i>CL,</i> 27). It reminds us: "Whether or not the subject is already dead . . . every photograph is (a) catastrophe . . . (it) always contains (an) imperious sign of my future death" (<i>CL,</i> 96-7).

<p class="noIndent">
David Low was a New Zealander who became one of the most famous political caricaturists of the twentieth century. At seventeen he became political cartoonist with the Christchurch <i>Spectator</i>; in 1911, he left for Australia to work on the <i>Bulletin,</i> where for the next nine years he produced <i>The Billy Book,</i> a compilation of caricatures of Billy Hughes, Australia's colorful prime minister. Low began his London career in 1919 with the <i>Star,</i> an afternoon daily with Liberal affiliations. In 1927 he began his twenty-three-year association with the <i>Evening Standard</i>: the arch-liberal caricaturist working for an arch-conservative newspaper created a dynamic synergy. Low established a worldwide reputation as a champion of democracy and freedom against the forces of aggression and fascism; his caricatures of Mussolini and Hitler were iconic; he depicted post-war Britannia as a bewildered creature whose trident and shield were a broom and dustpan; and during the same period he created his most famous cartoon character, Colonel Blimp.
</p>

<p>
Over the course of his career Low developed his distinctive views of satire and caricature. "Great caricaturists," wrote Low, are "philosophers, whose pictorial satire [is] the vehicle for interpreting and exhibiting their own passions. The close relation between a draughtsman's hand and mental disposition . . . is the excuse for asserting that caricature, at its highest, can be essence of mind and a great art of vital practice . . . perpetual renewal."<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  "Caricature in its most important practice," he also wrote, "is satirical, and satire is essentially an art of complaint."<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  Some critics, however, have detected limitations in Low's achievement. Clement Greenberg thought his political insight was "liberal with decent instincts . . . a large endowment of common sense humour," but also "without any positive political ideas" and "devoid of political imagination."<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  "Like every first-rate journalist," Greenberg went on, "Low provides us with a proper state of mind, not with truth or information." His skill lay elsewhere. In "almost

any one of his cartoons . . . you will see how little its effect depends on its 'idea' and how much on the drawing and design." In reality he was "a remarkable draftsman, a worthy continuator of the great but still largely unrecognized nineteenth-century English tradition of popular graphic art."<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  Low's art may not possess the serious pessimism of Honor&#x000E9; Daumier, but it was acerbic enough for Wyndham Lewis to write to Low: "Dryden described the satirist as flying over his victims and dropping 'molten iron' upon them. I do not know what the correct image would be for your satire, but it would be far more insidious and equally destructive, I think, by far the fantastic variety&#x02014;like Dyson . . ."<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  And contrary to Greenberg's claim, Low's best art represents a potent synergy between design, drama, and idea, delicately unveiling hidden truths through humour and satire. At the very least it was much appreciated by prominent res who were not professional art critics, writers such as Arthur Koestler, Somerset Maugham, J. B. Priestley, or Bertolt Brecht; British politicians such as Clement Attlee, Stanley Baldwin, Aneurin Bevin, and Michael Foot; actors such as Alec Guinness and Charlie Chaplin; and thinkers as diverse as Bertrand Russell, Sigmund Freud, John Maynard Keynes, and Isaiah Berlin.<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Low made two pencil sketches of Eliot, an undated head-and-shoulders portrait, and a 1945 sketch of the poet seated on a wooden chair (<a href="#3"> 3</a>). Eliot did not sit for his first portrait, but for the 1945 drawing Low hesitantly drafted a note to him, requesting a sitting:

Low's ambition to make a "study in personality with a caricatural emphasis" is palpable in his Eliot sketch. It is not simply <i>outr&#x000E9;</i>, which William Hogarth defines as a caricatural drawing which "signifies nothing more than the exaggerated outline of a re," and does not express a deeper "character."<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>  Eliot's monolithic nose and chin are comically extended and Low captures the famously stooped shoulders, anxious eyes, and pursed mouth. With varying emphasis and restraint Low's pencil creates a detailed hatching in the seated portrait which creates depth and volume. Valerie Eliot wrote to Low on 30 September 1957:
</p>

Low's portraits of Eliot, as Ernst Gombrich says of caricature in general, "make us laugh" and "save a lot of energy" through "this tendency to classify and simplify" the human re, at the same time as they provoke, "in a flash," discoveries "that the new mask can also serve to unmask."<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>  The discomfort one notices in Low's caricatures of Eliot is precisely the discomfort of public fixity; the deeper Prufrockian trauma of "having known":

The typical Elliott and Fry photograph consists of a head-and-shoulders shot customarily taken in the studio interior against a plain backdrop. The subject either looks fully frontally into the lens or is shown in three-quarter profile. Unusually, Elliott &amp; Fry photographed Eliot in a sculptural full side-profile. On 28 February 1939, Eliot wrote to E. McKnight Kauffer, acknowledging photographs that Kauffer had recently taken of him and adding: "OTHERwise [<i>sic</i>] they are a great deal better than Elliott and Fry have done for me."<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>  As chroniclers of the elite of English society, Elliott and Fry portray Eliot as a distinguished man of letters and public re (<a href="#4"> 4</a>). Indeed, the portrait is highly posed and Eliot may have disliked the staid, stony, unimaginative posturing required of him. The black background and black suit is off-set with the aureole of intense silvery studio light directed upon the poet&#x02014;giving his face an opalescent glow and marble-like solidity. In spite of Eliot's dislike of his portrait, the tonal perfectionism of the photograph gives it a texture close to that of an oil painting. The firm was notable for the quality of its prints. Enthused with the novelty of photography, Queen Victoria wrote in 1890 to her daughter: "I send you today some plantinotypes from platino which have been brought to a great perfection by Elliott and Fry."

Augustus John once noted William Rothenstein's "vehement nature, irresponsibility," his "moral intelligence," his "<i>penchant</i> for the dramatic," and "a passionate respect and love for the older masters" that was counterbalanced by a willingness "to greet modern manifestations with sympathy."<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>  Rothenstein believed that artists should confront the reality of the marketplace and in 1940 he wrote to George Bernard Shaw:

Rothenstein studied at the Slade School of Art in London for a year under Alphonse Legros, who was a friend of Rossetti and a disciple of Mantegna, Poussin, and Rembrandt. "We really did <i>draw,</i>" he later recalled, "at a time when elsewhere in England students were rubbing . . . tickling their paper with stump chalk, charcoal and india rubber." Legros "taught us to draw freely with the point, to build up our drawings by observing the broad planes of the model."

He was driven, he later said, by "an unabating urge to draw . . . to make some record of contemporaries whose work has stirred my admirations."<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>  By 1926 his portfolio of eight hundred portraits included Walter Pater, John Singer Sargent, Paul Verlaine, Oscar Wilde, Aubrey Beardsley, Arthur Symons, Henry James, Joseph Conrad, W. B. Yeats, Rabindranath Tagore, Edmond de Goncourt, Algernon Swinburne, George Bernard Shaw, Andr&#x000E9; Gide, Augustus John, Walter de la Mare, Havelock Ellis, David Low, Somerset Maughan, Aldous Huxley, Einstein, and E.M. Forster. "I was possessed," he later said of his early work, "with the faith that if I concerned myself wholly with appearance, something of the mystery of life might creep into my work . . . Through devotion to appearance we may even interpret a reality which is beyond our conscious understanding."<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>

Explaining his portrait technique, Rothenstein wrote:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

I must usually make two, sometimes more attempts, often starting afresh from a tracing from a first drawing, having thus the structure lightly indicated. I do not know whether I acquired this method from Degas; it was one he often used for his studies. Occasionally a drawing happens to come reasonably well within the first hour . . . I prefer the more direct touch of sanguine or chalk to pastel . . . A drawing is like a lyric, a happy pattern of lines, a combination of blitheness and precision, in which luck also plays a part, as do the quality of paper or chalk, the mood of the sitter, or one's own. Each time a portrait is attempted, I pray inwardly that the winged spirit may come into hand and pencil; for the pencil has its own cunning and the hand its wisdom.<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>

Eliot wrote to Rothenstein in October 1928: "If you cared to make a drawing of me, nothing would give me more pleasure . . . Do you prefer your own studio, or my office at Russell Square, or my house? . . . if you choose my house, I should try to include my cat in the picture . . . I should be glad to know also how long a sitting you like; so I can arrange both time and place to suit you, and without interruption."<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In May 1929, Eliot wrote to him again: "Thank you very much for your . . . invitation. I shall do my best to come: partly for the vanity of seeing my own mug in a distinguished exhibition, and because it is a likeness which I consider true and Monro 

<b></b>

considers flattering."<sup><a name="REF79" href="#FOOT79">79</a></sup>  Wyndham Lewis commented on Eliot's portrait in a letter to Rothenstein: "I go primarily for the pattern of the structure of the head and insinuate, rather than stress, the 'psyche.' You, on the contrary, have I think here and there lost yourself a little in your psychology, as witness your T. S. Eliot. I did not even recognise it at first. But how interesting that you should see Tom like that!"<sup><a name="REF80" href="#FOOT80">80</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Vivienne Eliot, according to her biographer, "felt that her husband would be pleased as she hung a large portrait of him by Sir William Rothenstein in the drawing room . . . Her 'altar' to Tom was flanked on each side by two Venetian mirrors" and "on another wall she hung a sketch of Eliot by Wyndham Lewis."<sup><a name="REF81" href="#FOOT81">81</a></sup>  The apparent simplicity of Rothenstein's portrait facing the aesthetic and intellectual complexity of Lewis's portrait is symbolic of the way Eliot would absorb and appreciate aesthetic differences. 
</p>

<p>
Rothenstein's 1929 chalk sketch of Eliot is an intense focus on the head of the poet which is drawn in a three-quarter profile (<a href="#5"> 5</a>). Rothenstein envisages the forty-one year old Eliot as a more youthful re than his years should warrant; the face is full and unlined except for the faint furrow at the brows and Eliot has the distant dreamy look that we see in his 1920s photograph by E. O. Hopp&#x000E9;. Although Rothenstein's portrait is simple, it is also evocative and intricate in its attentiveness to local detail. The eyes and eyebrows are drawn with a certain delicacy, as is the mouth. The portrait is almost sculptural in its boldness of form and profile. Rothenstein's explanation that his portrait art combines blitheness and precision can be seen in his drawing of Eliot which is, in Rothenstein's terms, lyrical. Indeed the drawing reflects Rothenstein's aesthetic motive in portraiture: "It is not likeness, as the sitter who is not an artist may think, but construction, the rhythm of form set down with clear and firm touch which are the concern of the draughtsman."<sup><a name="REF82" href="#FOOT82">82</a></sup>

Beaton remarks that the "numberless possibilities of the mysterious light-sensitive material charmed him. And, to begin with . . . was a camera really necessary?"<sup><a name="REF86" href="#FOOT86">86</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In 1921 he went to Paris where he joined the Dada group and had immediate success with his first exhibition of paintings, photographs, and "rayograms"; he also showed a film, <i>Le Retour de la Raison,</i> assembled out of experimental clips. From 1940 to 1950 he lived in Hollywood and did fashion photography and painting. Explaining his radical aesthetic, he wrote:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

my aims are . . . pursuit of liberty . . . pursuit of pleasure . . . I have a strong revolutionary instinct in me . . . by a drawing . . . painting . . . photograph, or by the object itself in its original materials, it is designed to amuse, bewilder, annoy, or to inspire reflections, but never to arouse admiration through any technical excellence usually sought for in works of art.<sup><a name="REF87" href="#FOOT87">87</a></sup>

Man Ray was an architect, draftsman, painter, photographer, filmmaker, sculptor, writer, and poet.<sup><a name="REF88" href="#FOOT88">88</a></sup>  Henri Cartier-Bresson and Bill Brandt aptly called him "the grand master," and Jed Perl says as a Surrealist he was "sceptical of the idea of artistic specialisations . . . formality . . . professionalisation of a bourgeois society," and his work "reflects with pure Dada <i>esprit</i> the glee of spontaneous discovery."<sup><a name="REF89" href="#FOOT89">89</a></sup>  As a member of the proto-Dada group in New York in 1920, Man Ray was joined by Marcel Duchamps and Francis Picabia. "Mystery," he claimed, "this was the key word close to my heart and mind"; and in a contemporary letter he wrote, "I'm trying to make my photography automatic&#x02014;to use my camera as I would a typewriter."<sup><a name="REF90" href="#FOOT90">90</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Jean-Hubert Martin says that for years Man Ray had been trying to produce an image that would "preserve the ambiguity of objects exposed to the light by including their shadows . . . The play of greys and blacks reveals the presence of the light and the creation of space."<sup><a name="REF91" href="#FOOT91">91</a></sup>  Beaton remarks, "He was a magician in the art of finding new variations and effects" (<i>MI,</i> vii).
</p>

<p>
Man Ray's portraits are uncompromisingly direct; his subjects are exclusively of great artists and include Sch&#x000F6;enberg, Braque, Matisse, L&#x000E9;ger, Miro, Giacometti, Picasso, Ernst, Joyce, Woolf, Balthus, Breton, Cocteau, Pound, and Duchamps. Beaton wrote of Man Ray's aesthetic technique:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Man Ray decided that sharpness of image is not the essential goal, but that it is more important to give the portrait its profound meaning . . . (he) worked with a long focal lens . . . the greater the re who sits for him, the more he effaces himself and remains "neutral." In such cases he seems to confine himself to likenesses that are seemingly innocuous. In reality he achieves definitive portraits . . . Each portrait reflects a unique instant.

light, and his prints have a strong definition, with clear contrast and sitters placed in informal poses; he was influenced by Alfred Stieglitz's dictum "No diffused focus. Just the straight goods" ("I," 9). Perl explains:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Man Ray's photographs have dense, nearly opaque surfaces; we sense a tension between the primary plane of the photographic and the intimations of depth expressed through the lights and shades of the world. The photographer wants us to remember that the world has been caught in a flat surface, that what we see is but a <i>partial portrait</i>. Mysteriously (the) photographs carry a double message . . . we are impressed with a sense of loss&#x02014;the passage of the moment that the photograph has recorded&#x02014;and a sense of gain&#x02014;the perpetuation of that moment . . .

Man Ray made a number of black and white portrait-photographs of Eliot in the 1930s which are some of the most candidly direct images of the poet, yet also possess Man Ray's inimitable panache and delicate romanticism. In his <i>Autobiography</i> Man Ray explained: "Two Americans settled in England, Curtis Moffat, a painter, and Ted McKnight Kauffer, a well-known poster-designer, were very assiduous in sending me sitters from London . . . I photographed the writers&#x02014;T. S. Eliot; Havelock Ellis . . . Aldous Huxley, posed so his bad eye would not show; Virginia Woolf, whose ascetic face was framed in a severe arrangement of her hair."<sup><a name="REF92" href="#FOOT92">92</a></sup>  Eliot wrote to Kauffer: "I think the Man Ray photographs a brilliant piece of work and certainly better than any I have ever had taken."<sup><a name="REF93" href="#FOOT93">93</a></sup>  Man Ray's caption under one of his photographs of Eliot reads: "Interests me just as little as I interest him."<sup><a name="REF94" href="#FOOT94">94</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Man Ray wrote: "The eyes not only receive an outward image but give forth an image of an invisible thought."<sup><a name="REF95" href="#FOOT95">95</a></sup>  In one image of Eliot, Man Ray captures the face in full-frontal, close-up intimacy focussing on his facial expression and especially on the poet's penetrating eyes (<a href="#6"> 6</a>). Barthes writes: "The conventions of photography are replete with signs. A full-face photograph underlines the realistic outlook . . . expresses penetration, gravity, frankness . . . looking squarely at the . . . obstacle, the 'problem.'"<sup><a name="REF96" href="#FOOT96">96</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In another three-quarter face and shoulder image, Eliot frowns and the felt immediacy of Man Ray's print reveals dark shadows under his eyes (<a href="#7"> 7</a>). Barthes comments: "A three-quarter face photograph . . . suggests the tyranny of an ideal: the gaze is lost nobly in the future, it does not confront, it soars, and fertilises some other domain, which is chastely left undefined."<sup><a name="REF97" href="#FOOT97">97</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The backdrop in all the Eliot photographs are a plain white, which does not detract the viewer from the intensity of the face. Man Ray wrote:

when man turns to imitating the processes of nature, he invariably tries to substitute permanence for repetition . . . which does not exist in nature. In the same manner, he carries the confusion even into such comparative human activities as painting and photography, to the extent of imagining that he is making a good drawing, when he is making a poor photograph, or that he is making a work of art with the camera when he makes a good automatic drawing with it . . . Happily, most of the pioneers of the past two generations have freed themselves from these obsessions and the rot of past performances.<sup><a name="REF98" href="#FOOT98">98</a></sup>

Barthes would agree; "I do not believe in 'lifelike' photographs," he wrote (<i>CL,</i> 20). Indeed, Barthes writes: "it was the chemists" who invented photography: "For the <i>noeme</i> 'That-has-been' was possible only on the day when a scientific circumstance (the discovery that silver halogens were sensitive to light) made it possible to recover and print directly the luminous rays emitted by a variously lighted object . . . From a real body, which was there, proceed radiations which ultimately touch me . . . the photograph of the missing being . . . will touch me like the delayed rays of a star" (<i>CL,</i> 80-1).

<p>
Topolski gained fame initially as a caricaturist; he moved to England in 1935, then between 1940 and 1945 served in exile as an official war artist for Poland. In his iconoclastic autobiography <i>Fourteen Letters</i> he recalled himself as "the young foreigner [who], even unpossessed of the language, is in no time acquainted on terms of equality with his neighbours . . . Augustus John . . . Jacob Epstein . . . Nye Bevan, John Rothenstein . . ."<sup><a name="REF101" href="#FOOT101">101</a></sup>  Indeed, Picasso, Prince Philip, Harold Macmillan, and Kenneth Tynan were all to be visitors at Topolski's London studio.
</p>

<p>
In <i>Fourteen Letters,</i> Topolski explains his aesthetic: "Malraux claimed that: 'the fact that the word <i>painting</i> is linked with <i>picture</i> has paralysed us.' This labyrinth, uncurbed, unframed, non-picture painting is my answer to this. A bizarre idea: painting throughout my life the same 'panorama'&#x02014;varying / enlarging / broadening in themes / experience."<sup><a name="REF102" href="#FOOT102">102</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Feliks Topolski is the Walter Benjamin of the art world&#x02014;an obsessive chronicler of a politically unstable and culturally uncontainable world. In 1946 he said: "We need an art of synthesis, painting fed on reality . . . of multitudes on the move, of global oneness, torn by conflicts, and achieved, not by retrogression into 'realism,' but through the formal freedom won by modern art."<sup><a name="REF103" href="#FOOT103">103</a></sup>  In a letter to Bertrand Russell, Topolski would insist on his autonomy: "I am a side-liner; a pictorial recorder of history made by others . . . there is no citizen or revolutionary reformer above my artistic self."<sup><a name="REF104" href="#FOOT104">104</a></sup> 
</p>

In a letter to Harry Ransom of 18 November 1960, Lew David Feldman wrote: "We have . . . written to T. S. Eliot and E. M. Forster requesting their co-operation in lending themselves to Mr. Topolski's portraiture."<sup><a name="REF107" href="#FOOT107">107</a></sup>  Eliot, however, did not sit for the oil portrait that Topolski made of him and instead Topolski drew from his imagination and memory.<sup><a name="REF108" href="#FOOT108">108</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In <i>Fourteen Letters,</i> Topolski recounts his first meeting with Eliot: "almost as awed as the rest of the youngsters round him, I once sat with him at Bertorelli's in Charlotte Street&#x02014;a focal locality of pre-war Bohemia . . . but, not as a worshipper, somewhat distanced from the master-disciples' aura." Topolski also recalls his encounter with Eliot which resulted in the "Rush Hour on the Underground" sketch:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
I chanced on him in the fifties on an underground train and began to sketch at a distance even before realising who was this uncharming, haughty, black-homburged, black-coated city gent, attracted by his obvious rush-hour contrast with the subordinate and indifferent secretarial breed around. This resulted in a largish painting&#x02014;invention of a ceremonially red-robed Eliot in an honour-giving scene.<sup><a name="REF109" href="#FOOT109">109</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In his sketch of Eliot observed while sitting on a London underground train, one sees the rhythmic swirls and broken, flying strokes of Topolski's pencil style, a "bird's nest tangle" as one observer called it (<a href="#8"> 8</a>).<sup><a name="REF110" href="#FOOT110">110</a></sup>  Bernard Denvir has described his technique as "a great explosion of linear exploration, the paper covered with a palpitating mass of lines from which the subject emerges&#x02014;as it does in Giacometti's drawings&#x02014;with an almost sculptural quality."<sup><a name="REF111" href="#FOOT111">111</a></sup>  Or as Harold Acton once described Topolski's form in general, the feeling is "robust, cosmopolitan, mercurial, insatiable, witty," with "a gift for characterisation expressed in a rapid, varied and individual vernacular."<sup><a name="REF112" href="#FOOT112">112</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Eliot's portrait drawing is raw, immediate, and alive, a symphony of spare, precise, fierce, complex lines asking to be understood in concert. The sketch observes and explores human posture and expression, the conration of a head in relation to other heads, the tenseness or slump of a body, the outline of a nose or chin. The sketch reveals also the extreme tension of momentarily contingent discoveries which Topolski's draftsmanship is eternally engaged in.
</p>

<p>
Eliot looks straight ahead (if indeed he looks at all), as the furious, wiry swirls in the eye sockets create graffiti-like, "damned scriggles."<sup><a name="REF113" href="#FOOT113">113</a></sup>  The nose is the classic Eliotic eagle's beak, the mouth prim, the whole demeanor haughtily self-contained, and in a witty, ironic collision with Topolski's irrepressible style. James Laver has written of Topolski:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
his single res are masterly . . . at once as true as a snapshot and as full of content as a hieroglyphic . . . great satirical powers, an extraordinary capacity for seizing upon essential lines of his subjects and representing them with just the right degree of exaggeration 

<b></b>. . . a sheer beauty of draughtsmanship . . . his object is always to study the meaning, the dramatic significance, of what he sees.<sup><a name="REF114" href="#FOOT114">114</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Eliot's likeness is retrieved by the viewing eye though the tangled texture of lines in motion, rather than mimetically affirmed by the artist with an easily assimilated or appropriated static structure of the predicted form of a human face and re. Like Wittgenstein or Wallace Stevens, Topolski reorganizes the grammar of our relation to the world we habitually inhabit.
</p>

<p>
Topolski's visions and explorations are purely pictorial and he resists any expectations for an artist to be tendentious or above humanity, saying: "I am not out to explain anything . . . I try to communicate my problems and solutions, and the mixture is probably as impenetrable as life."<sup><a name="REF115" href="#FOOT115">115</a></sup>

The photographic look has something paradoxical about it which is sometimes to be met with in life . . . One might say that the Photograph separates attention from perception, and yields up only the former, even if it is impossible without the latter; this is that aberrant thing, <i>noesis</i> without <i>noeme,</i> an action of thought without thought, an aim without a target. And it is this scandalous movement which produces the rarest quality of an air. This is the paradox: how can one have an <i>intelligent air</i> without thinking about anything intelligent, just by looking into this piece of black plastic? It is because the look, eliding the vision, seems held back by something interior . . . the Look is always potentially crazy: it is the effect of truth . . . effect of madness.

The mastery in Gay's portrait of Eliot lies in capturing the sober atmosphere and character of a place&#x02014;through the tonal quality of the print, and through significant detail&#x02014;if, in Barthes's terms, there is a <i>punctum</i> in this portrait, which Mark Strand has defined as "something in the photograph, a detail, that stings or pierces the viewer into an emotional reassessment of what he has seen," it is that half-inserted thumb in Eliot's pristine waistcoat pocket, which simultaneously arouses in the viewer a sense of assurance and absence.<sup><a name="REF119" href="#FOOT119">119</a></sup>

The "true" and "specific virtues" of "the etched line," Malcolm Salaman has written, resides in "its freedom . . . vitality . . . imaginative suggestiveness." Salaman emphasizes the etching method's "wonderful possibilities as a medium for pictorial expression," wherein, "it is not the subject that moves you, but the <i>manner</i> in which it has moved the etcher's temperament to expression," so that "the appeal of etching is through the suggestive convention of the bitten line, and this has a specific beauty and significance which differ from the beauty and significance of a graven line, a pen line or any other line."<sup><a name="REF121" href="#FOOT121">121</a></sup>

Explaining Holloway's etching technique, Robert Meyrick writes:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
like other etchers of the 1920s and 1930s Holloway sought antique hand-made paper, using ledgers and the blank end-papers from old books&#x02014;believing no modern mould-made substitute can imitate the subtlety of colour and tone of old papers . . . While there is a wide range of different commercially prepared etching inks available, Holloway prefers to hand grind his own black ink . . . the pigments are mixed with medium strength copper-plate oil to one part Frankfurt Black, one part Heavy French Black and two parts Light French Black. A small quality of burnt umber is added to warm the black&#x02014;the amount dependant on taste and the requirement of the individual print . . . Almost all his pre-war plates were printed on his Kimber press . . . All prints are from copper plates . . . With few exceptions all have been printed by him. Preliminary drawings, mostly to the same size as the intended plate, were prepared for many of the prints.<sup><a name="REF124" href="#FOOT124">124</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
In a letter to the author, Holloway explained the genesis of the pencil drawing that was the basis for his etching of Eliot (<a href="#0"> 10</a>): 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
I made this in 1934&#x02014;about the time of "Murder in the Cathedral." The actual sitting for the preliminary drawing was arranged through Herbert Read whose portrait I had already drawn and etched. The sitting was held in Eliot's office at Faber and Faber in Russell Square. . . . I don't think I had any difficulty with the drawing&#x02014;Eliot was a very good sitter&#x02014;he kept still!<sup><a name="REF125" href="#FOOT125">125</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In conversation, Holloway also said: "I spent the afternoon with Eliot . . . that was not very long . . . I was twenty at the time and at the Slade School of Art . . . Eliot was a very serious man . . . we talked while I was doing the portrait."<sup><a name="REF126" href="#FOOT126">126</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Holloway is as masterful as Rembrandt (who was a great influence on his art) in the fine hatching and stippling he creates for the contours, shadings, and subtle tonal gradations on Eliot's etched face. Here Eliot's mouth, chin, and forehead and eyes attain more expression and temperament&#x02014;and it is specifically the precision of the bitten line which creates the noted gravity of the face in the etched portrait suggesting that Holloway has not etched a <i>subject</i> but a <i>motive</i> (<i>GPE,</i> 5). The innate "vitality, imaginative suggestiveness" and "spiritual" nature of a great etching, in Salaman's terms, are all evident in Eliot's etched portrait. Only in the etching does one feel that the artist has furtively approached the complexity of an individual consciousness obliquely translated through a face&#x02014;as one might observe in a portrait by Rembrandt.
</p>

<p>
Underlying the etched line is the subconscious knowledge that the artist has mastered his craft with enough confidence and restraint to submit his hand to permanence&#x02014;unlike pencil or paint, the etching needle creates non-erasable lines. Through the "suggestive convention of the bitten line," Holloway creates in this portrait of Eliot, a concentration which one sees only in great art, one which reflects a certain aspect of consciousness in the sitter which the artist simultaneously aims to recreate in the viewer. If, as Salaman believed, "the true etcher . . . is always recognizable . . . by the eloquence of his reticence," Holloway may be considered to be a true etcher (<i>GPE,</i> 6).

<p class="noIndent">
"Magic, make-believe, beauty, adventure . . . fun" is how one viewer summarizes the art of Angus McBean.<sup><a name="REF128" href="#FOOT128">128</a></sup>  With his candid dictum, "People want to be beautiful" (<i>AM,</i> 18), he was deemed "a celestial salesman" (<i>AM,</i> 13). McBean says: "everyone wants to look their best in a photograph . . . I never printed or published a picture which [sitters] did not pass.<sup><a name="REF129" href="#FOOT129">129</a></sup>  More acutely, McBean would admit: "The way that a portrait photographer sees his subject has very little to do with truth anyway" (quoted in <i>AM,</i> 12). Adrian Woodhouse sees the "ambition" and "dynamic" of McBean's art as the "power of illusion" and the "desire to cheat . . . trick . . . deceive . . . show off what the camera could do" (<i>AM,</i> 7).
</p>

<p>
His first fame was as a modeller of theatrical masks and props. He became, in his own words, "the number one theatre photographer in one of the great periods of English theatre."<sup><a name="REF130" href="#FOOT130">130</a></sup>  McBean's celebrity sitters include Vivienne Leigh, Marlene Dietrich, Elizabeth Taylor, Lawrence Olivier, and Richard Burton. In the 1950s and 1960s he photographed Tommy Steel, Motown stars, the Beatles, and Maria Callas for record sleeves.
</p>

<p>
Born in Wales, McBean became an assistant in the studio of Hugh Cecil in London in 1934, where he "learned all about negatives . . . Those marvellous 12 x 10 glass plates, specially coated with a matt-surfaced emulsion could be drawn on, like handmade crayon paper, with a ordinary pencil" (quoted in <i>AM,</i> 14).
</p>

<p>
Woodhouse says that McBean's "camera is its own theatre . . . he is in complete control of all its subjects . . . he commands them to act for his cameras and provides them with the sets in which to perform" (<i>AM,</i> 15). McBean's forte was surrealistic portraits of celebrities. In one, Vivien Leigh is posed as the goddess Aurora, encased in a plaster of Paris gown to which he had wired artificial clouds. Magazines like the <i>Tatler</i> commissioned McBean's surreal photographs of stars such as Mae West, Martha Graham, and Katherine Hepburn. McBean explained his own interest in the surreal: "The new romantic movement has touched all the arts . . . Artists, . . . baffled by the illogic of the times in which we live, have been forced beyond realism into the surreal world of the subconscious mind" (quoted in <i>AM,</i> 20).
</p>

<p>
McBean's teasing photograph of Eliot looking intently through a viewer of glass negatives is a play on the relationship between artist, subject, viewer, and the props of photography (<a href="#1"> 11</a>). McBean's prints are made of a dramatic, smooth painterly chiaroscuro of velvety blacks, greys, and white. He refers to the "silver in the paper . . . the richness of the half-tones . . . the warm, rich flesh tones" of the old black-and-white printing paper he used (quoted in <i>AM,</i> 8). Woodhouse observes that he:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
. . . relies on lighting . . . on instinctive understanding of the human head . . . its sculptural possibilities . . . He knows automatically the illusions that can be created by different lighting&#x02014;how to enlarge the eyes, broaden the forehead, reduce the nose, carve away a cheekbone or chin . . . Because he could draw on faces with light and shadow . . . McBean specialised . . . in the close-up; the face as mask or icon.

In McBean's 1953 studio photograph of Eliot (<a href="#2"> 12</a>), the poet smiles faintly, his sixty-five year old face is smoothed with airbrushed away wrinkles and skin a-sheen perfection&#x02014;in Roland Barthe's words on Greta Garbo, what we see here is a "deified" "face-object." Barthes says a <i>mask</i> "is but a sum of lines," and a <i>face</i> "on the contrary, is . . . thematic harmony."<sup><a name="REF131" href="#FOOT131">131</a></sup>  McBean's genius may reside in his fusion of the eternal, archetypal, dramatic with the harmonious&#x02014;indeed, as great poets, philosophers, photographers, and painters have taught us, is not the bright obverse of the word, mirror, mask, lens, and canvas&#x02014;darkness and mortality? Eduardo Cavada says "The conjunction of death and the photographed is the very principle of photographic certitude: the photograph is a cemetery."<sup><a name="REF132" href="#FOOT132">132</a></sup>  Barthes says photography symbolizes a certain horror because it "certifies that the corpse is alive, <i>as corpse</i>: it is the living image of the dead thing" (<i>CL,</i> 78-79).

<p class="noIndent">
"Fluent," "synoptic," and "dramatic" in her style as a portraitist in pastel, pencil, and ink&#x02014;Jean Shepeard was of Romanian origin and raised in England.<sup><a name="REF134" href="#FOOT134">134</a></sup>  She first studied at the Slade School of Fine Art in London, but her life was divided between drawing and theatre. She studied at the <i>Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts</i> in 1925 and performed in plays at leading venues with stars like John Gielgud, Anthony Quayle, Peggy Ashcroft, and Sibyl Thorndike. The first of her many film appearances was in 1939 in <i>Inquest</i> and in 1942 she appeared in <i>Thunder Rock</i> with Michael Redgrave. 
</p>

<p>
The <i>Art Quarterly</i> of 1957 remarked: "Shepeard is not a professional artist in the sense that she has never bothered to earn her living by drawing or painting . . . But always there was the constant use of the sketch-book and cont&#x000E9; chalk."<sup><a name="REF135" href="#FOOT135">135</a></sup>  Many of her portraits are drawn from the theatrical milieu: J.B. Priestly, Peggy Ashcroft, Vanessa Bell, and Jean Marsh. In a review of the play <i>Anna Christie,</i> a critic says that Shepeard gave a "performance notable both for 'sincerity' and 'emotional power'" &#x02014;characteristics which also define the nature of her portrait art.<sup><a name="REF136" href="#FOOT136">136</a></sup>  A reviewer of her 1931 exhibition, referring to "her remarkable portrait heads in chalk," writes: ". . . there is a young artist here, whose work, unfledged though it is, seems to be pointing in the right direction . . . she has urgently something to say and at her best draws with great nervous vigour and amazing emotional power. Her work is alive, sensitive and stimulating."<sup><a name="REF137" href="#FOOT137">137</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Shepeard exhibited drawings and pastels in the painter Francis Bacon's second exhibition in May 1930 in his Queensbury Mews studio where Bacon showed paintings and modernist rugs and furniture; she also made a drawing of Bacon.<sup><a name="REF138" href="#FOOT138">138</a></sup>  Her early experimentations in portrait drawings show an uncanny affinity to the famous, kinetical, blurred style of Bacon's later paintings and, tantalisingly, may suggest Shepeard as a formative influence on Bacon's art. These early experimentations by Shepeard are of unidentified res and Doreen Kern says that she simply drew faces that fascinated her.<sup><a name="REF139" href="#FOOT139">139</a></sup>  A critic wrote that her "drawings of heads show great sensibility and beauty of line and are, in their bold unhesitating treatment full of vigour and character."<sup><a name="REF140" href="#FOOT140">140</a></sup>

In 1928 she had joined the Emotionist Group, founded by Royal Academician, R. O. Dunlop, consisting of painters, musicians, philosophers, poets, and actors.<sup><a name="REF141" href="#FOOT141">141</a></sup>  In the same year she exhibited at the Redfern Gallery with the leading artists Augustus John, Lucian Pissaro, Paul Nash, and Eric Gill. She also exhibited with Vanessa Bell, Ben Nicholson, Jacob Epstein, R. O. Dunlop, and Frank Dobson in Bloomsbury at the Modern Picture Library.<sup><a name="REF142" href="#FOOT142">142</a></sup>  She seems to have given up exhibiting around 1933-1934 when her stage appearances became numerous, but continued to draw and paint in seclusion to the end of her life. 
</p>

<p>
Shepeard's retrospective Primrose Hill Gallery exhibition of 30 October to 12 November 1995 contained drawings of many well-known artists, actors and writers including T. S. Eliot.
</p>

<p>
As in many of her other portrait sketches Shepeard probably did not have her subject Eliot sit for her. As someone on the fringes of Bloomsbury artistic life, she would have been aware of Eliot's literary reputation. Shepeard's drawing of the poet is a black pencil sketch of the head in side profile (<a href="#3"> 13</a>). The strong, bold lines and contours of the head creates a sculptural feel to the portrait&#x02014;the over-sized enclosed fist has the monumental bulk of a Picasso or a Matisse limb. In a pensive or weary posture, Eliot rests his head in his hand. He wears his round black-rimmed glasses and his eyes are closed. The poet's farther eye is absent and the rim of the glasses framing it disembodied which gives Shepeard's drawing an abstract complexity and oriental economy. Shepeard places Eliot in a white collarless shirt that gives the poet the look of a church cleric in deep contemplation. The drawing shows Shepeard's characteristic stylistic features&#x02014;a dramatic, shrewd, vigorous, intensely minimal pencil style which focuses the viewer's eye on the subject's fundamental features and the mind upon a contemplation of deeper nature.

T. S. Eliot, Black &amp; White Photograph, dated: London 1939, King's College Archive, Cambridge.<sup><a name="REF143" href="#FOOT143">143</a></sup>
<!--_/bHead-->
</h4>

<p class="noIndent">
E. McKnight Kauffer was born in Montana where he spent his early years working in factories. He "joined a travelling theatre stock company as an assistant scene painter," then studied at the Art Institute of Chicago for six months but "rebelled against the system of Art education," instead "siding with the Post-Impressionists."<sup><a name="REF144" href="#FOOT144">144</a></sup>  After working for museums in Munich and Paris until the outbreak of war, Kauffer moved to England where he painted until 1921 and became well-known among artists and even national res for his uniquely "modern" poster art. His production of "the first and only Cubist poster design in England&#x02014;a flight of birds" gained him the recognition of Winston Churchill, who approached him to design a new flag for the Royal Air Force.<sup><a name="REF145" href="#FOOT145">145</a></sup>  Kauffer even makes a cameo appearance in Evelyn Waugh's <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>; Charles Ryder's Oxford rooms "proudly" display "a reproduction of Van Gogh's <i>Sunflowers,</i>" "a screen painted by Roger Fry," and "a poster by McKnight Kauffer."<sup><a name="REF146" href="#FOOT146">146</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Writers particularly admired the artistry and modernist innovation of his posters. Aldous Huxley notes Kauffer's rejection of advertising's reliance on "symbols" for "sex and money" in favor of "symbols" that "stand for the particular things which are at the moment under consideration," "thus . . . forms symbolical of space, loneliness and distance . . . advertise a holiday resort where prospects are wide and houses few." He praised Kauffer's "affinity with all artists who ever aimed at expressiveness through simplification, distortion [and] transposition . . . especially with the Post-Impressionists [and] Cubists": his aim was "to render the facts of nature in such a way that the rendering shall be, not a copy, but a simplified, formalised and more expressive symbol of the things represented."<sup><a name="REF147" href="#FOOT147">147</a></sup>  And Marianne Moore's allusions to the "consummate elegance," "compression," and poetic attributes of his poster art recall those aspects of her own poetry: "The language of blacks and grays is color in the sense that Chinese brush masterpieces are color. . . . We have here a poetry of synonyms like 'the immediate meaning and possible meaning' of poetry, as where a Mexican hat has the form of a plane . . . verifying Democritus' axiom, 'Compression is the first grace of style.'"<sup><a name="REF148" href="#FOOT148">148</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Perhaps Kauffer's sensitivity to modern movements in literature as well as art endeared him to modernist writers such as Eliot. On 24 April 1930, Kauffer wrote to Eliot of <i>Ash Wednesday</i>: "I am moved by the power of these magnificent poems . . . an experience that will become an influence."<sup><a name="REF149" href="#FOOT149">149</a></sup>  And Eliot commented of Kauffer's <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> illustrations: "some of them have a quality which reminds me of Chirico."<sup><a name="REF150" href="#FOOT150">150</a></sup>  In June 1959 he wrote to Kauffer's wife that Kauffer's poster work had "made such a deep impression" on his audience and was of "original artistic invention."<sup><a name="REF151" href="#FOOT151">151</a></sup>  Indeed over the course of the late 1920s through the 1940s, Kauffer designed the cover illustration for several of Eliot's "Ariel" poems, "The Journey of the Magi," "A Song for Simeon," "Marina," "Triumphal March," a fragment from the unfinished "Coriolan," and the American edition of <i>Four Quartets.</i> Although Eliot insisted in 1962 that he would "not allow any artist to illustrate [his poems]" because "I want my readers to get their impressions from the words alone and from nothing else," he clearly felt that Kauffer's work profoundly enhanced his aesthetic intentions.<sup><a name="REF152" href="#FOOT152">152</a></sup>  In a speech on Kauffer's poster art to the American Institute of Graphic Art, Eliot described his "mastery of the art of illustration" as "brilliant."<sup><a name="REF153" href="#FOOT153">153</a></sup>  And remarking on an illustration to an edition of the works of Edgar Allan Poe, "including the two terrifying portraits of Poe," Eliot commented: "It is very exceptional for an artist to be able to enlarge our understanding of a poet: I cannot think of a similar instance."<sup><a name="REF154" href="#FOOT154">154</a></sup>  Similarly, Roger Fry congratulated Kauffer on the "tact [and] sensibility" of his illustrations which "manage never to block any of the avenues of the reader's imagination by any too precise image."<sup><a name="REF155" href="#FOOT155">155</a></sup>  And in 1930 Eliot told Kauffer: "Yours is the only kind of illustration that I can endure."<sup><a name="REF156" href="#FOOT156">156</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Kauffer was not a professional photographer but one can also see in his photographs, what Marianne Moore notes in his poster art, an "instinctiveness," a "logic of sensibility," "shadows . . . as arresting as objects," and a "focussing scrutiny" upon the subject.<sup><a name="REF157" href="#FOOT157">157</a></sup>  His subjects include details of haystacks, old abandoned farm machinery, carts in snow, sheep, swans, farmers at work, a hat pinned to a tree, and gnarled tree

Among his still lifes are the cast of the head of Michaelangelo's <i>David</i> donned with sunglasses, painted eyelashes, and a teardrop in the surrealistic style of Man Ray; the butt ends of cigarettes in an ash tray; fragments of a sculptured hand holding a rose; and several disembodied sculpted heads resembling Chirico.

<p>
His portrait photograph of Eliot was taken at his home, as a letter from Eliot to Kauffer of February 1939, suggests:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Thank you very much for the photographs. I think they are excellent . . . the only fault in mine are the Charlie Chaplin moustache (due I suppose, to the lighting) and not having bathed my eyes&#x02014;and the next time you photograph your male guests at 11 <small class="caps">P.M.</small> or so you ought give them [<i>sic</i>] a rub over first with your electric razor, that is, if you use such a powerful lens.<sup><a name="REF158" href="#FOOT158">158</a></sup>

Indeed Kauffer's sharp-focussed powerful lens forces the spectator to scrutinize the intimacies of Eliot's brightly lit face (<a href="#4"> 14</a>). The characteristics of Kauffer's poster art that Marianne Moore noted also distinguish his monochromatic photograph of the poet: "compression," "consummate elegance," "a poetry of synonyms." Further, the portrait demonstrates Kauffer's aesthetic sensibility which, in Huxley's words, "render the facts of nature in such a way that the rendering shall be, not a copy, but a simplified, formalized and more expressive symbol of the things represented." One can say of Kauffer's photography, as he claimed of all good design, that "in spite of the swiftness with which it is made and used, study and experience are needed to make it the genuine art it proves itself to be," and there is, "a principle of rightness about it that only an artist understands."<sup><a name="REF159" href="#FOOT159">159</a></sup>

An American by birth, George Platt Lynes made his first trip to Europe in 1925 where he met such artists as Gertrude Stein, Jean Cocteau, and Russian Surrealist painter, Pavel Tchelitchew in France. He began photographing in 1927, when he also opened a bookshop in New Jersey and published the writings of Stein, Ren&#x000E9; Crevel, and Hemingway, editions that included art illustrations by Cocteau and Tchelitchew. In 1933 Lynes opened a studio in New York, where he became known for portraits of personalities in the arts, erotic imaginative shots of male nudes, and elegant fashion studies for haute couture magazines. Lynes's photographs appeared in the <i>Dada and Surrealism</i> exhibition organized by the New York <i>Museum of Modern Art</i> in 1936. His subjects included Gertude Stein, Jean Cocteau, Edith Sitwell, George Balanchine, W. H. Auden, E. M. Forster, e e cummings, Salvador Dali, Marc Chagall, Colette, Aldous Huxley, Andr&#x000E9; Gide, Igor Stravinsky, and Thomas Mann. 
</p>

<p>
Aesthetically, his photography strove to encompass the dominant French intellectual movements pervading the arts in the 1920s. Art historian Stephen Prokopoff remarks that Lynes's "mythological" photographs "brought together into a completely 

<b></b>

individual amalgam the . . . poetical, symbolical classicism prevalent in France during the 1920s in painting, poetry, music [and] theatre . . . that continued in Balanchine's ballet theatre in the 1930s."<sup><a name="REF161" href="#FOOT161">161</a></sup>  And because Lynes's images were "cleansed of chance incident" and "smoothed into geometric forms that are elements in larger structural conrations," Prokopoff notes, they conveyed the "influence of the magical neoclassicism that dominated the arts in France in the 1920s" ("GPL").
</p>

<p>
Lynes was particularly attentive to lighting. Prokopoff elaborates on "the eloquence of lighting that is fundamental to Lynes' art," one "in which character is defined by contrasting tonalities. Lynes' appreciation of the drama created by light was enhanced by . . . artfully staged emphasis . . . the heightened reality of the theatre . . . seemed to have truly formed Lynes' sense of the expressivity of illumination" ("GPL").
</p>

<p>
Lynes's photographs of Eliot were published in the British <i>Vogue</i> of 1947 and in the American <i>Vogue</i> of 1948, the latter with the caption "T. S. Eliot, Nobel Prize Winner" and the following narrative:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
After thirty-one years of influence in which fame and a little shock were mixed, T. S. Eliot joins the long list of Nobel Prize winners. Scholars and critics for years have written and fought about his poetry, his four plays, his essays with their "magisterial stare" . . . Inevitably he has been a mental pressure on the work of other poets; to many, <i>The Waste Land,</i> with its controversial imagery, was a major power in the search for psychological realism. His poetry, simple in words . . . is profound in meaning and complex in references, often rooted deep in world literature.<sup><a name="REF162" href="#FOOT162">162</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Lynes's portraits of Eliot reflect the key terms of this description: magisterial, mental pressure, psychological realism, simple, profound, complex in reference. Lynes took a series of black and white shots of Eliot in a single sitting in 1947. One photograph places the focus intensely on the subject, situated in a vacant room, containing only an empty table and a chair and a large window which offers no view to the portrait's spectator (<a href="#5"> 15</a>). Eliot is seated by the triangular edge of a table and looks out of the window. The psychological tension in the portrait is palpable. Shielded from the world's attention, Eliot gazes intently out of a window, between his fingers a burning cigarette, photographically frozen in time. This solitary, contained re could be waiting for and contemplating something or nothing; the dazzling light from the window suggests, ambiguously, effacement or spirituality. The use of light in this portrait also illustrates Beaton's point that Lynes had "an extraordinary talent for using spotlights to bring out the incandescent quality of human skin . . . 'He painted with lights'" (<i>MI,</i> 230).
</p>

<p>
Lynes's portrait of Eliot is as fastidious and refined as Eliot's suit, manifesting the precise attitude of decorous self-containment that characterizes Lynes's aesthetic of the photographs and their subject. As Prokopoff comments:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
A characteristic of many of [Lynes's] images is a close, containing environment around the res that forces the spectator to share their space. In these works and in a large number of photographs in which both form and atmosphere are more distanced, Lynes' <b></b>

Further, Lynes's fierce formalism illustrates Barthes's point concerning the verity of the photograph itself: however much the viewer desires to "discover" the "being" of a self, or an "essence" in a photograph, its "air (expression, the look)," is "unanalyzable." It exists purely as "evidence," and to "prove" or "reject" or "decompose" it is to "deviate from the Photograph" (<i>CL,</i> 107).
