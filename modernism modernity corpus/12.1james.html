But all day the impression in my mind has been the serenity, the urbanity of Paris, those wide streets, that air of tranquillity and civilisation, must have a queerly austere and reproving look to an invading army, confused with triumph and exhaustion. It seems to me that the Louvre and the Place de la Concorde, and Notre Dame and the bridges, all so compact together, all, somehow, so much smaller than their renown, must have a look of saying&#x02014;Yes, here we are. Et puis? And the people who remain; I suppose their blank faces would have much the same impression.
<p class="blockquote">
To invade Paris . . . surely it would give the invaders, those who were not too tired, too brutalised, to have lost all perceptions except pavement, food, drink, a hallucination of being a quantity of tourists, tourists with rather unusual equipment and baggage.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>

<p class="noIndent">
Experience, asserts Walter Pater, "seems to bury us under a flood of external objects, pressing upon us with a sharp and importunate reality, calling us out of ourselves in a thousand forms of action."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Warner finds a serene vision of Paris similarly "importunate," pressing in on her own impression of the brute "reality" of that city's invasion. She cannot prevent herself from imagining a place of "tranquillity and civilisation" removed from the context of its invasion; yet with some deliberate effort, Warner refuses in this diary entry to allow that abstract "impression in my mind" to replace what is socially specific, actual, immediate. The emphatic imperative opening her second paragraph is juxtaposed ominously with the fading aposiopesis that follows it. Those trailing ellipses work instantly to fracture the insularity of 

<b></b>

her fleeting aside; they lead off instead from "my mind" to the "people who remain," into the interior minds of others denied by exhaustion any ability to reflect deeply upon the impressions they receive as feared invaders. 
</p>

<p>
Encapsulated in miniature here is a prose dynamic featured throughout Warner's fiction writing too. Tempering her own impressionistic register, rhetorical choices are made accountable to the imaginary individuals she depicts. And with this deliberate denial of imaginative license, she summons a form of authorial depersonalization for purposes that are not merely benevolent but ethical. It is as if narration within this diary format becomes an act of self-requisition, a disclosure of descriptive priorities as responsibilities obligated to the described. She thereby addresses that "impossible task of aesthetic discourse," which Lesley Higgins has described as an attempt to "surmount the actually unbridgeable gap between the realm of sensory and sensuous experience and the domain of philosophical concepts and propositions."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  For by allowing those same imaginary faces to govern the very style in which they are re-imagined, Warner is also allowing them to contravene the prosaic introspection of her diary&#x02014;compromising it as a medium of solitary reflection when the diarist conjures temporally specific impressions of others in a foreign world. 
</p>

<p>
For Warner, though, this kind of reflexive strategy of combining authorial self-erasure with self-implication appeared to be second nature. Her implicit striving for an impartial separation of author from artwork is a quintessential component of her aesthetic aspirations for narrative fiction too. Pivotal in T. S. Eliot's evaluation, the concern with depersonalization assumed a radically new guise for women writers of the 1930s and 1940s who were debating the shaping of fiction as social criticism. And Eliot's famous epigram&#x02014;that "the more perfect the artist, the more completely separate in him will be the man who suffers and the mind which creates"&#x02014;remains but one account of how abstractionist impersonality came to function as a laudable device.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
A marked reconsideration of the novelist's social role as a kind of disinterested commentator, a re whose sensibilities might indeed appear so "self-abstracted" from the work as to give greater priority to critique, had spurred the emergence of a heightened inception of novelistic realism in the 1930s. As Storm Jameson retrospectively described it in 1949, high modernist predecessors preoccupied with formal innovation seemed to have all but retreated from the specific demands of the social. With a disembodied, defensive reconstitution of the literary-aesthetic as a platform from which to ironize the social in objectified form, earlier modernists had, for Jameson, courted an introverted pursuit of what she called "the virtue of originality, to the point where it becomes, in a novelist, vice."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Hers is a warning against literary experiment for which abstraction and insularity go hand in hand in the narcissistic pursuit of aesthetic perfection. Indeed, Tamar Katz even suggests that this quest for the ever more authentically inventive style cultivated in male experimenters an implicitly masculinist fascination with the abstractionist artifice as providing a sort of inoculation: a means of immunizing the creative self against the disruptive vagaries of modern social life. Such writers were, in Katz's frame, liable to reserve "for themselves a professional expertise 

<b></b>

and cultural authority that could distance them from women. They defined mastery of narrative form as a specialized cubistic skill that could exploit women's nature while standing above it."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Sylvia Townsend Warner's passage through late modernism evinced an altogether different relationship with the stylistic pitfalls and potentialities of abstraction, together with the evolving effectiveness of the novel as a platform for political critique. The resurgence and visible reorientation of social realist interventions between the wars actively challenged the assumptions by which high modernism's "new and deeper literary sense <i>abstracts</i>," in David Trotter's phrase, "the unchanging 'element' hidden beneath the appearances so exhaustively registered by nineteenth-century domestic realism."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Warner subverts across her work precisely this reductive presupposition: that novelistic realism has always had a particularly unchanging objective, so passively mimetic of mere surface appearances as to leave it unequipped to analyze the psychological complexities of the human interior. In what follows, I will show how she also seemed well aware of the susceptibility of the novel form to introspection. That is, her work was evidently sensitive to the climate of aesthetic preoccupations out of which "[m]odernism had produced often dazzling works of art," as Andrzej Gasiorek observes, "but had driven fiction so deeply into subjectivism that it had been left with few resources for dealing with social issues."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  What I explore below in <i>Summer Will Show</i>  and <i>After the Death of Don Juan</i> , is how Warner's "late modernist" approach to the mimetic is more than a mere counter-reaction to some received opinion of high modernism's abstractly formalistic priorities. Rather, she set the novel fresh methodological challenges. And in so doing, she sought to implicate her own rhetorical decision-making in that task of conveying political specificities from an immediate world beyond the literary artifact.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Warner's fiction thus offers a point of departure for innovating with technique in these interwar years, and more specifically with the uses of <i>narrative perception</i>. In tracing this particular intervention of hers, my concerns are twofold. Not only do I want to arrive at some estimation of Warner's role in the novel's stylistic development away from the abstract fastidiousness of subjectivist concerns; but also, of how her idiosyncratically <i>impersonal</i> inflection of narratorial perspective reveals that in fact she re-appropriated a poetics of abstraction of sorts so as to develop the activity of representing perception as a critical device for realist fiction.

<p class="noIndent">
"Late modernism" marks a contentious terrain, of course. Only relatively recently has a notional <i>late</i> modernist epoch gained currency. In this account, a hybridity of aesthetic modalities flourished between the wars, coalescing in practices of literary production closely mediated by the political and economic structures in which they were embedded. Tyrus Miller has argued that late modernist style singularly "dramatized the comic fragility of modernist attempts to contain contingency and violence, through literary form." To Miller, this trajectory, "facilitating a more direct, polemical 

<b></b>

engagement with topical and popular discourses," provides us with "an index of a new dispensation, a growing skepticism about modernist sensibility and craft as means of managing the turbulent forces of the day."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Yet his effort to retrieve interwar texts from the wake of the labeled "Men of 1914" soon turns into a performative self-justification of the viability of pursuing "late modernism" as a period for revision in the first place. Miller bemoans the fact that, today, the "majority of the works I discuss in this study are just not read" (<i>LM</i>, 6); but at the same time his paradigm leaves the experiences of many neglected British women novelists who followed on from high modernism entirely unaccounted for.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the space occupied by literary realism itself within this retrospective mapping is far from self-evident. It is perhaps easy to underestimate the practicalities by which literary forms responded to changing polemical accents. This is the case particularly when, as Maroula Joannou has argued, "[t]o systematise a demarcation between traditional and experimental modes of writing is to perpetuate an artificial division more rigidly than many women of the 1920s and 1930s believed to be necessary."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Storm Jameson stressed that, for novelists who turned to a social sphere, "[p]erfection of form, of language, is not what engages them first and insistently when they surrender to the impulse to convey, roughly in the shape of a novel, what they know or have been attentive enough to overhear about the human situation" ("FN," 43). A more contextually nuanced account is needed, therefore, of how Warner re-envisioned the potential of realism and, in so doing, redirected a high modernist commitment to the discursive mastery of form toward fiction's ability to engage with specific social issues of her time. It is perhaps true to say that "the phosphorescence of decay," as Miller suggests, "had illuminated the passageway to a re-emergence of innovative writing after modernism" (<i>LM</i>, 7). But this purely sardonic path to artistic renewal seems far removed from how <i>progressively</i> Warner shaped a realist poetics from the remnants of subjectivist experiment. 
</p>

<p>
For one, Warner appeared to interpret her own literary inheritance in a highly pragmatic fashion, borrowing from the commonsensical view of why aesthetic progressions occur, so devastatingly invoked by Virginia Woolf. In surveying literature's relevance to the demands of a material world "[w]e can only trust our instincts," as Woolf shrewdly puts it: "if one reader desires reality in a novel, and another is satisfied by something, which he calls proportion, each is right and each can pile a card house of theory on top of his opinion as high as he can go."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  And given that descriptive modes move on rapidly in ways inherently as multifaceted and contingent as the empirical reality of the world they describe, then for Woolf "they mean one thing to one person, another thing to another person: they are unintelligible to one generation, plain as a pikestaff to the next. And it is because of this complexity that they survive."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Warner's chameleonic reinvention of her own approach to writing fiction exploits the fact that narrative aesthetics are always modulating, however successfully, in response to an ever evolving life-world. "[L]et us always remember," declares Woolf: "influences are infinitely numerous; writers are infinitely sensitive; each writer has a different sensibility. That is why literature is always changing" ("LT," 160).

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Woolf saw these formal transformations emerging in a dialectic between artistic modes and the demands of women's struggle for political empowerment between the wars: "The change which has turned the English woman from a nondescript influence, fluctuating and vague, to a voter, a wage-earner, a responsible citizen, has given her both in her life and in her art a turn toward the impersonal."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  As such, the woman novelist's "attention is being directed away from the personal centre which engaged it exclusively in the past to the impersonal, and her novels naturally become more critical of society, and less analytical of individual lives" ("WF," 50). Again, I shall be suggesting that Warner, like Woolf, adapted a version of <i>impersonality</i> precisely to surpass the image of formal experiment as a masculinist pursuit whose introversion had compromised the novel's capacity to articulate political critique. 
</p>

<p>
One way she did so was by utilizing narrative perception as a vehicle for examining metafictionally her own deployment of polemic. Certainly, the evolving usage of perspectival narration in the historical and historicizing novel throws up a rich constellation of issues for late modernist writing. But what will occupy me specifically here is the way Warner's austerely reticent prose reveals how this curious retraction from stylistic embellishment became a deliberate strategy. For her, the depersonalization of narratorial voice was set to reinvigorate the placing and execution of social commentary in fiction. 
</p>

<p class="noIndent">
That commitment to aesthetic self-examination signaled outward, too. The thematic diversity of Warner's fiction suggests that she held to a rich notion of modernity itself: as radically multifarious, as a lived actuality spanning diverse contexts, as resisting monolithic assimilation both historically and geographically to any single epoch. And her fiction responds by promoting an inventive dialogue between setting and style. Dramatizing a plurality of cultural situations, her oeuvre in its entirety conveys a sense in which "modernity," as Janet Lyon has pointed out, "is not a seamless temporal entity characterized by period, progress, and development, though its narratives often prefer that plotline. It is, instead, subject to the very discontinuities of time that its narratives seek to disguise: different 'times' co-exist within the same discrete historical moment, just as surely as homologous 'times' exist across centuries."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  A comparable insight into the existence of alternative, divergent modernities certainly informed Warner's own aspirations for how literary practice might respond instrumentally to the social. She used her position, and persona, as a reviewer for the <i>Left Review</i>, to question the interventionary potential of contemporary writing. She called for a reassessment of how, and for whom, "new" literature is operating, if it portends to "an underlying morality, a resolute understanding and intolerance of social conditions."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  And it is in her tensile short story writing, that we find the communication of intolerance being turned into an ethical imperative. Those miniaturist fables reveal a recurrent activity of authorial obligation articulated through depersonalization, while each enunciating their own idiosyncratically astringent manner of reporting atrocity.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Unrelievedly spare and externalist, Warner's stories call into question the kind of interiorized perspectivalism lent sovereignty by the high modernist novel. Yet she also takes this a step further, scrutinizing her own practice. Namely, she highlights how the choice of free-indirect discourse entails certain ethical considerations of its own for the writer posing as documentarian. <i>A Garland of Straw</i> offers a series of set pieces that bring such issues of impersonality and perception into concert. Particularly acute in her depiction of Fascism's covert infiltration of the European imaginary, Warner creates the illusion of impartial reportage on Fascism's psychic effects while retaining the sort of immediacy one might expect from free-indirect style. In practice, this makes for a curious combination, whereby an oblique, self-distancing voice is offset against the lyric intensity of presented perception. But this double-act is enabling. It allows Warner to broach more widespread fears about the proliferation of Nazism as a growing power network, while giving those fears singularity as psychological effects belonging to those who act as her individual character-focalizers. 
</p>

<p>
In "Apprentice," an occupied Poland on the brink of famine is described through the detached fascination of the child Lili, newly arrived under the custodial of a German contingent. The narration assumes her imperious prospect-view from the "small stone summer-house, no bigger than a sentry-box," which enables Major von Kraebeck to "have her out of the way."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Out of sight and mind of the military's adult world, Lili is not out of reach of Fascism's allure. Keeping "house in the gazebo," Lili takes pleasure in her elevation&#x02014;as both viewer and dominant outsider&#x02014;over the impoverished passers-by, for "though Poland was a detestable country, it was rather grand to be in Poland" . Without any kind of commentary, with no recourse to a reassuring <i>paralepsis</i> pre-empting future events, the narrative is bereft of incidental, anticipatory details; instead, it is framed within the morality of a self-indulgent child who reasons through and enjoys her power over the starving Polish children:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Yet to Lili it seemed very nice to feed the starving. It was exciting, it made one feel good. Before they came to Poland she had had a little dog, and she always enjoyed feeding it, throwing a biscuit and seeing him dash after it, holding the bone above his head while he begged and rolled his eyes. It occurred to her that she could feed the starving from her summer-house. She would feed the children; no one could much object to that, for they would be Polish children only, all the Jews had been put away.

Warner's syntax, terse and unadorned, infuses tonally Lili's frank self-certainty. The association with teasing her dog is macabre; a fondly mnemonic moment, it betrays the extent to which unconsciously Lili is fast becoming a prime apprentice for Fascism's self-rationalizing objectification of human life. At the level of depictive style, Warner allows focalizer and narrator to enmesh in formidable unison. Subordinate clauses are displaced by a more appetitive parataxis&#x02014;horrid in their issuing forth a reporting voice now so rhythmically attuned to the excitement with which this cruel scene is being perceived: "she nursed a violent impression of the contrast between them and herself [ . . . ] They all had swelled bellies. It was funny, it made them look greedy and not starving at all" . The remembered pleasure of tempting and treating her dog is 

<b></b>

frustrated when a Polish boy refuses to comply. Lili has learned to combine Fascistic fetishism with economic sense: "It occurred to her that instead of just throwing food it would be much better sport to lower it on a string. For then she could dangle it, lowering it and drawing it up again; and quite a little food would last out as long as a basketful. This was delightful" . In this exchange of gratification (her pleasure for his survival), the boy who forgoes the bait "just as though to tantalise her"  perishes in a final snatch for the dangled bun, and confirms what Lili had disinterestedly anticipated all along: "So it was true, really true. The boy was dead. He had died of cold and hunger before her eyes, just as they said. Dozens of them were dying so; but hearsay is one thing, seeing with one's own eyes another" .
</p>

<p>
Channeling the speculations and sensations of a budding trainee for the Third Reich through the re of a self-justifying child, Warner drives allegory to disturbing new heights. Hers is a disquieting prose persona based on recoil, and in which, as Gillian Beer notes, "the telling is ruthless. The reader flinches but is sustained by the unexpected sequencing of her narratives, which gives an affect of improvisation, of freedom for the reader, even while the characters are pinched."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  This readerly freedom assumes an ominous dimension in "Apprentice," as one is encouraged to become a relatively <i>abstracted</i>co-observer, lacking an authorial guiding hand. What is so "ruthless" about Warner's perspectival mode is that her readers are at once powerless to prevent the seed of Fascism from taking root in the girl, and helpless to prevent their own assumption of and implication in a Fascist perception of human life&#x02014;a perception whose horrific insensibility becomes more and more abstracted from its originary context when given analogical correspondence in the excitement of Lili's game. 
</p>

<p>
Such is the unsparing immediacy of Warner's "realist" focalization: it is brutal and unimpeded when picturing brutal acts as normalized and mundane. Moreover, her glacial tone is not merely used to foreground as a kind of objective report the ethical travesty enacted within the scene. Reader and narrator alike are brought to account by the impersonality through which the horror of events is conveyed and left largely unexamined. Warner's unnerving withdrawal from humane commentary reveals precisely how she renders impassive an exterior perceiver so as to intensify our attention to the inhumanity of events perceived.

</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Compelling in its insensibility, that story is exemplary. The numbness of her register is performative, epitomizing how Warner's work "domesticates estrangement," as Jane Marcus has noted, "and asks us to examine our own complicity in 'othering' even when we think we are working to expand the canon. Master text, master race, master language&#x02014;all define themselves by the other."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Warner's fiction is multivalent in this respect. Readers are implicated at the point at which they become immersed, while the very insinuation of narratorial self-abstraction leaves the perspectival depiction itself accountable, given its partiality, to world-events beyond the mind of its focal character. All this is highly indicative of Warner's campaign. Her prose bears in its 

<b></b>

expressive intensity the urgency of her quest for how late modernist fiction might negotiate between the rigors of stylistic experiment and those of self-interrogation. 
</p>

<p>
If that "turn" to documentarian forms of literary realism in the 1930s was a reorientation toward the specific exigencies of the social over those of the interior, then Warner's writing equally refuses simply to jettison her representation of subjective perception before exterior political issues. Rather, she invites a reciprocal relationship between sense impressions and purposive critique. Her narrative aesthetics face head on the task of conveying individual, sensory intimations of modernity as valuable if not illuminating, while still remaining attuned to the material struggles of communal existence. One way she achieved this reciprocity was by presenting urban scenarios in which interventions of both a personal and collective kind could take place. In these instances, her work invokes that tropology of perception exemplified in the early modernist imaginary by the re of the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i>. This appropriative strategy holds several implications for Warner's resuscitation of narrative mimesis. As John Rignall has argued, "[t]he complex dialectical mode of seeing red in the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> and enacted in the narrative practice of realism is inherently unstable, and the epistemological assumptions of that practice are open to question."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Yet Rignall is taking as his starting point a rather univocal notion of realism itself&#x02014;as concerned only with the evidential, as an unselfconscious re-representation of social typicalities. For it is precisely these assumptions that Warner's late modernist texts interrogate in their use of perceptual detachment as a tool of metatextual self-inspection. By re-appropriating as a narrative language the mode of peripatetic observation exploited by the Baudelairean <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i>, Warner subverts any sense that "a privileged role ascribed to the detached individual vision of the novelist as narrator rests on the premise that seeing is equivalent to knowing."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Hardly so inevitably in Warner's work do moments of visual reception provide total apprehension. 
</p>

<p>
To identify the self-interrogative ways in which the syntax of urban perception could function for late modernist writing, we must recognize the dual nature of <i>fl&#x000E2;nerie</i> as Warner inherited it from early modernism itself. There the ral characteristics of the metropolitan migrant often emerge as both stylistic and structural features literalized over the course of depicted events. Reassessing Woolf's famous vision of female nomadism in "Street Haunting" , Katz concludes (somewhat reticently) that "[u]rban mobility thus seems to offer the possibility that the subject may identify elsewhere, live a variable and speculative life [ . . . ] suggesting the Woolfian <i>fl&#x000E2;neuse '</i>s complementary self-enclosure through economic privilege: identification with others is a luxury much like shopping."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Yet in her vital and important study, Deborah L. Parsons is at pains to assert "that the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i>is not only a historical re but also a critical metaphor for the characteristic perspective of the modern artist. To infer from the socio-historical position of bourgeois women as confined to private realms that it is therefore a priori impossible to conceive of a female aesthetic perspective in terms of the concept of <i>fl&#x000E2;nerie</i> is false."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  
</p>

<p>
Harnessing the possibility of such a definably "female aesthetic perspective," Warner's own free-indirect style appears to align with, only to regale, the scopic positions 

<b></b>

of masculinist <i>fl&#x000E2;nerie</i>: positions implying spectatorial autonomy in surveying and totalizing the particularities of the modern cityscape. And this had a narratological influence upon her work. The fetishistic connotations of visual reception and discrimination that informed an earlier paradigm of literary <i>fl&#x000E2;nerie</i> provided in themselves the means for Warner to mount a symbolic challenge to patriarchal modes of seeing. <i>Summer Will Show</i> extends this trajectory. Within the novel's depersonalized medium of social realist inquiry, the leisured practice of amorous observation is subsumed, replaced by ecstatic encounters of a more assertive kind, and occurring between two women whose experience of marginality at the heart of a metropolis is the catalyst for more purposeful and reparative forms of engagement. 
</p>

<p>
Sophia Willoughby's insatiable will to depart from all she owns and surveys at Blandamer House motivates her flight into a pared-down vision of revolutionary Paris. Abstracted in elemental form, the metropolis affords a turbulent backdrop to Sophia's pursuit of her estranged and "absent" Frederick: a "shadowy creature [ . . . ] dismissed to wander in exile from the real life and centre of life at Blandamer." Intimately described here, Paris emerges imbued with Warner's experience of the communist insurgency in Spain, at first hand with Valentine Ackland.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Warner unveils in her heroine an intuitive sensibility primed for this voyaging inquisition. For even with her children on native soil, "waiting irked her, this waiting for the next cough. She disliked sitting down in the middle of a walk, she disliked any kind of dawdling. A slow and rigid thinker, to sit still and contemplate was an anguish to her. Presently she jumped to her feet, saying, 'Children, I shall walk on'" . 
</p>

<p>
Into the fervor of Paris 1848 she walks, and into the arresting immediacy of a city in seizure. Certainly, it is tempting to approach <i>Summer Will Show</i> as an epitome of novelistic historicization at its most forthright. But this is to reduce the text to a purely mechanical decoding, neglecting the immersing clarity of Warner's period detail as it is relayed directly from the streetscape. Herein, the <i>fl&#x000E2;neuse</i> serves as the narration's principle reflector. Conveying the point at which protean impressions afford critical understanding of newly emerging contexts for collective interaction, Warner allows Sophia's perspective to prevail throughout the novel, mostly precluding authorial intercession so as to sustain the narrative's highly visceral unfoldment. That Warner's commentary remains shrewdly aloof further demonstrates Gillian Beer's point that "empathy is encouraged and then deflected. The process of her novels induces attachment at once sophisticated and infantile. Joy is unforeseen, suddenly present" ("STW," 77). Sophia's initial dilemma of "where to go, being a woman, and alone"  is soon resolved in her pursuit of Minna. For Minna she will rove the city delivering polemical tracts; "to walk and to meditate, and to be peaceful and solitary," is to reinvigorate for Sophia a sense of personal agency by way of elective nomadism&#x02014;appealing to the emancipatory potential of the "no where [ . . . ] I am particularly attracted to" . Indeed, the itinerancy with which Sophia makes physical contact with the city as an ephemeral and dispersing environment not only focalizes the action, but relegates Frederick's whole characterological influence, consigning him to what Terry Castle has called the "subjugated position of the mediator" between the two women's desire 

<b></b>

for each other. For Castle, it is exactly this "kind of subverted triangulation" of the "canonical" triad of the two male suitors with eyes on the same maiden, "or erotic 'counterplotting,' that is in fact characteristic of lesbian novels in general."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  However, this analysis seems to overly schematize the form of erotic intimacy whose gradual evolution Warner explores across the novel's central section, between two women for whom urban space comprises a series of vulnerable sites for sensual proximity and sudden dislocation. Within these new communal environs opening up within a revolutionary Paris, Warner finds in the account of Minna and Sophia's separation and anticipated reunion occasions for rare intrusions of her own. It is as though Sophia's spontaneous quest becomes at once the advertisement for, and demonstration of, Warner's concern with how sense impressions furnish instrumental decisions, and arises from a scenario that beckons a more incisive degree of commentary:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Acts of impulse are of two kinds. Those performed by people of a naturally impulsive character come with the suavity of habit, they are put forth like the tendrils of a vine, and there is time to mediate them a little, to dispose their curvings with grace. However spontaneous, the mind which generates them has done the same sort of thing before, and in the instant between thought and deed there is an unflurried leisure, in which habit and cunning can contrive their adjustments. But when people of slow or cautious disposition act upon impulse, the impulse surprises them even more than it surprises those upon whom it is directed.

In her own surprise, Sophia seems to mature between Warner's two alternatives for embodying impulse. Refusing the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur'</i>s pursuit of "unflurried leisure," Sophia is compelled to shift from the undiscriminating passivity of one "who had no project whatsoever" . Sensory intimations give way to cognitive inferences upon which she must act. She re-interprets precisely that "sensation almost like complacence" as provoking a more determined role, by assuming the vitality of the <i>fl&#x000E2;neuse</i> in a self-reflective "hiatus, a darkness through which her purpose must travel to its expression" . 
</p>

<p>
So after those gnomic insertions about the nature of impulse, Warner stands back once more, allowing the urgent reality of unfolding events to exemplify her point. Sophia develops an interactive, haptical relationship with public space; narrative language itself responds fervently, its momentum now suffused by her "scribbled zig-zag of purpose" . It is a formal showcase of Elaine Scarry's fascinating point that "a mimesis of perceptual acuity cannot take place unaccompanied by that antecedent structure; in other words, by the very thing that perception exists to investigate."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Sophia's own investigative pursuit turns from the introspection wherein it began, outward to restore the impersonal tone in which the quest's climax in physical space is told:

<b></b>

drooping lopsidedly from her shoulders. With this meeting so clear in her mind, her impetus towards it carried her past Minna encountered in the street. The recognition that halted her, stock-still on the pavement, was only at second-sight realised as a recognition of the woman she sought. For the instantaneous, the overwhelming impression was, that for the first time in her life she had seen despair.

That our narrator has maneuvered over the course of the scene from philosophical interjection to a racy external description, complements Sophia's own transition. It points to a distinctly late modernist trait. By the shift in axis from probing subjectivism to depersonalized report, we find that, as Phyllis Lassner notes, the "psychological analysis of female character through introspection or narrative intervention is replaced by women speaking to and through each other, either directly, or in response to the other's character and behaviour."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Subjective upheavals of the interior become exteriorly projected onto those of the city, and Sophia begins to anticipate the way she is implicated in the social experience of what she perceives&#x02014;only then, it seems, is she awarded a new insight into the "recognition of the woman she sought."

<p>
The <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> may well remain one of those flourishing "heroes of modernity" who, as Janet Wolff reminds us, "share the possibility and the prospect of lone travel, of voluntary up-rooting, of anonymous arrival at a new place. They are, of course, all men."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  However, it does appear that Warner consciously pitted her women characters against the city gent as "objects of his 'botanizing.'"<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  And at the same time, she meticulously undercut the psychosexual hierarchy that the masculinist version of <i>fl&#x000E2;nerie</i> sought to consolidate through the visual objectification of women among the crowd.
</p>

<p>
"A Red Carnation," from <i>A Garland of Straw</i>, associates a more touristic set of sensibilities with the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> as focalizer for purposes of describing the Fascist's sinister "liberation" of communist Spain. This Warner portrays as a blithe exercise in military tourism that denies any humanitarian responsibility for the confined Spanish regions through which it passes. She depicts the journey of a German contingent as a parading of their romantic preconceptions about Spain's rural landscape. She shadows Kurt Winkler's documentation of his passage through the back streets of an anonymous city:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
<i>In Spain</i>, he was now in Spain. It must be Spain, for they had passed through the Straits of Gibraltar. It was a pity that they had not been allowed to arrive by day. Still, the city was awake. In Spain gay life persists all night long, and presently he would be riding past caf&#x000E9;s and flood-lit fountains, and girls would throw flowers from balconies, and he would catch a red carnation and hold it between his teeth.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Repeated like a yearning mantra, the word "Spain" becomes emblematic of all Kurt wistfully imagines, losing its substance with each repetition. Kurt's anticipation of being "in Spain" offsets the thrill of his proximity to a cultural landscape within which he is alien: "Looking at the cypresses and the fantastic silhouettes of the balconied and turreted villas Kurt felt that at last he was in Spain" . His excitement is short-lived, however; making actual contact with the terrain deflates his imaginary Spain. 

<b></b>

Out on foot now, his dreamed impression of what the country promises is shattered by the reality that a fellow contingent has preceded them. His image is defiled in advance: "Analysing his discontent, he told himself that he was bored and frustrated, that nothing short of the noblest could satisfy him, and that having come to Spain to root out Marxism he could not be happy till he was doing it. Meanwhile there were other small rubs and annoyances. The relation between his detachment and the earlier arrivals was not good" .
</p>

<p>
What Warner does is to utilize his "detachment" as a cipher for her own distanced scrutiny. We enter a faceless enclave which, as Kurt's group nears the station, turns out to be "pretty much like any other town" . The closer its narrow vistas become for Kurt, the more opaque their relation to the way "[a]ll the stories, all the movies, stressed the romance of Spain" . It is in this uncompromising documentation of Spain becoming "a battlefield merely, a preliminary battlefield [ . . . ] wherever the red menace shows itself" , that Warner critiques Kurt's point of view through a perversion of the universalized, nineteenth-century trope of the nonchalant <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i> loitering in relative immunity from the terrain. Casual observations throw up the unexpected, ironizing Kurt's attempt to assimilate all he perceives into the romanticized prediction of what he assumes any visitor should perceive in Spain. Unable thus to connect up perception with prior expectation, he leaves his officers' siesta and is enveloped by the town. And it is here that Warner constructs an account of Kurt's failing position as foreign "liberator" as a premise for her impersonal analysis. Patently grave, she reveals how the voluntarity with which he occupies public space is soon the cause of his entrapment: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

He looked about, and saw, opening out of the street, a passage, and beyond the passage a little square. He waited till someone else turned down the passage, and then followed.
<p class="blockquote">
The square had arcades all round. It was like a cloister, but it also looked Moorish, as of course, it should do. In the middle was a small fountain. The jet of water was feeble and intermittent, it seemed as though something might be blocking the feed. But still, it was a fountain.

<p class="noIndent">
Threateningly framed by arcades, the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur's</i> meditative solipsism suddenly meets its match in built form, literalized in this deserted square. Kurt wavers in assigning his own military purpose to such a liminal place, as the "fountain" sustains his gaze and adds to his nostalgic taxonomy of this provincial surround. His hesitation is fatal, occurring late here, too, chronologically in the narrative&#x02014;his decision to linger is punished almost schematically by Warner's ferociously abrupt close. The townspeople return his stare with "blank faces" as he tries to visualize triumphantly their "glorious efficient future" under Fascist rule. Warner leaves him stranded in an ominous epiphany "that in coming to Spain to t he might also have come to Spain to die" . 
</p>

<p>
The underlying impulse of this sparse, exiguous fable thus emerges when events are brought to fruition. Within the most enclosed of urban settings, Warner has deliberately <i>adopted</i> a perspective aspiring to what Susan Buck-Morss calls the <i>fl&#x000E2;neur</i>'s "combination of distracted observation and dream-like reverie," but in a faltering guise 

<b></b>

that radically <i>adapts</i> its rhetorical purpose in this secluded context.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  In such a way as to invite scrutiny from an impartial narrator, Kurt is halted at the heart of that village to dissect his imminent fate; and in so doing, Warner captures in this "corner of old Spain"  a microclimate for staging wider changes in the spatial and visual economy of modernity at large. For in her account, that Ur-man re of the displaced, intoxicated observer can no longer entertain the possibility that totalizing observations are comparable to categorical knowing&#x02014;he is a once imperious re for whom the indulgence of impressionistic speculation has here become redundant, affording scarce understanding of others staring back, only outwardly observed.

<p class="noIndent">
The austerity of Warner's repose here is evidence of a significantly subversive act of appropriation. As a point of departure for realist representation, she actively recuperated one of the darlings of high modernist aesthetics&#x02014;authorial impersonality. "What has been happening in the last decades," argued Storm Jameson as the 1940s came to a close, "is something more than a change in direction": "It is not wholly that so many of the more serious novelists have been swayed, by the strength of the undersea current running against humanism, against tradition, to give their greater effort to releasing in their work the little jet of their own personality [ . . . ] The change is also towards a detachment from the world, a withdrawal" ("FN," 58).
</p>

<p>
Jameson highlights a double component to fiction's subjectivist turn. That is, the propensity for the novelist to exploit a heightened conception of interior subjectivity for the aesthetic enrichment of literary representation, while simultaneously offering themselves a retreat from immediate social inquiry into the artifice, into the egocentric task of solitary perfectionism. For Jameson, this kind of aestheticized "withdrawal" has had dire consequences for the novel's continued political relevancy, simply because "[l]ife, at the level on which the great novelist must approach it, is so full of impurities. The pure novelist, intent on easing the bulges out of his form, is forced to exclude too much, and without being able to achieve the evocative precision and concentration of the poem. The writer becomes too important, the novel etiolated and narrow" ("FN," 61).
</p>

<p>
It sounds like an unsparing criticism of the more insular, self-appreciative aspects of high modernist innovation. Yet more subtly, Jameson exposes the irony that experimentalist impersonality in the novel can operate paradoxically and in spite of itself&#x02014;the higher the level of aesthetically pure abstraction, the more visible the writer's aesthetic sensibilities become. 
</p>

<p>
More progressively, though, Jameson was campaigning for an overhaul of artistic impersonalism. It marks a critical attention to authorial persona, which, as I have been suggesting, remains central to Warner's use of perspectival form. Her own approach refused the self-interiorizing vanities of stylistic abstraction, privileging instead a mode of <i>oratio oblique .</i> This expanded the tonal possibilities for narrative voice. Rather than resort to overt intervention, Warner reserved as implicit and embedded with a given 

<b></b>

fictional world her communication of social critique. As another world war loomed, Warner would retain her scrupulous engagement with the uses of depersonalizing, writerly detachment, just as Jameson argued the case for a novelistic equivalent of disinterested documentary film-making.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, Jameson's warning against the experimental novel whose creator "becomes too important" thoroughly complements Warner's view of a definably female tradition of impersonality, one stretching back to the Bront&#x000EB;s and George Eliot. She would assert in a lecture given to the Royal Society of Arts in 1959 that "[w]omen as writers seem to be remarkably adept at vanishing out of their writing so that the quality of immediacy replaces them."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  Conceiving of "immediacy" as Percy Lubbock did of Jamesian aesthetics, Warner supports an implicit privileging of the <i>showing</i> over the <i>telling</i>, of character-consciousness over <i>heterodiegetic</i> statement&#x02014;a diffusion of provenance in which the implied author is pronouncing less in order to picture more.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Bellicose propaganda, of course, is what drowns out the elderly lady whose"voice was hardly audible" at Speaker's Corner in <i>The Years</i>.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  And as Woolf herself reiterated in <i>Three Guineas</i>, strategies of depersonalization are crucial for a pacifist collective: a resistance that chooses "not to incite their brothers to t, or to dissuade them, but to maintain an attitude of complete indifference."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Heeding Woolf's caution that this "[i]ndifference in the first place must be given a firm rooting upon fact," Warner displays a similar strain of discretion when she dissects war's capacity to hold the psyche in thrall.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  She is <i>un</i>interested in the more insidious motivations for battle, just as she registers with critical disinterest the way time and again the horrific ramifications of conflict cannot dissuade nations from renewed warfare: "So perish all warlike heroism: for it is undoubtedly heroic to go out on bombing raids, it is even more dangerous than going out on horse to kill foxes. If more deeds of heroism could just fall flat there would be more hope for humanity. It is interesting how almost all working class people seem to know this without having to bother to hold it as a theory."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Despite the opinions Woolf and Warner share about warfare's futile masculinism, there are, nevertheless, clear distinctions to be made between the idea (and idealism) of a politically disinterested standpoint and the politics of an aesthetic disinterestedness as they respectively practiced it. "What one has to bear in mind" too, argues Anne Fernihough, "is the way in which, during this period, democracy above all was red as a process of <i>abstraction</i>, abstraction of the uniqueness of the individual into a mere cipher or statistic."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Even though their priorities are not always comparable, Warner and Woolf both forged an important feminist idiom from techniques of depersonalization. This idiom proved a practical tool, implementing by and through their revivification of narrative mimesis an urgently needed historicizing critique of contemporary social oppression.
</p>

<p>
In her rereading of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's <i>Aurora Leigh</i> , Woolf seeks to recuperate a prolific tradition of stylistic impersonality. In doing so she draws not on Eliot, but on the nineteenth-century realists, women who dared to inhabit their genre detachedly in order to subvert the novelistic expectations of them <i>as</i> women writers. Among them, Browning desired to undertake a "sort of novel-poem [ . . . ] running 

<b></b>

into the midst of our conventions."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  For Jameson, meanwhile, the "weakness of the poetic novel" was that it failed to be impersonal <i>enough</i>. "[I]t can so easily be made to seem clumsy by the greater concision and concentration of the poet," inasmuch as a "single phrase says more, says it better, rousing more echoes, than a page, pages, of careful (delicate, sensitive) description by Virginia Woolf" ("FN," 53). But note Jameson's use of the word "better" here; framed in a qualifying clause, it posits tentatively&#x02014;so as to differentiate qualitatively between&#x02014;the general <i>aesthetic</i> attribute of narrational "concision" (of being able to say profoundly "more," by doing less), and the particular <i>stylistic</i> skill of being able to say it "better." Jameson underestimates how much in command of the "single phrase" the later Woolf was, and like Warner, how far she controlled its <i>immediacy</i>. 
</p>

<p>
For Woolf also understood what a multifaceted thing impersonalism was for the woman writer. Not merely a rhetorical strategy for the greater good of narrative aesthetics, the impersonal was already an aspect of lived experience itself, to be forcefully redeployed in aesthetic practice: "The greater impersonality of women's lives will encourage the poetic spirit, and it is in poetry that women's fiction is still weakest" ("WF," 51). Indeed, she concludes of <i>Aurora Leigh</i>that "whatever Mrs Browning's faults," her account of social relations shows how she uses impersonality to intensify the creative (and ultimately critical) efficacy of women's formal experiment. "[S]he was one of those rare writers who risk themselves adventurously and disinterestedly in an imaginative life which is independent of their private lives and demands to be considered apart from personalities."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Browning's risk was to exploit a disinterested aesthetic rather than a wholly aestheticizing disinterestedness. The former marked a creative proliferation of forms of authorial agency open to the woman writer, as opposed to the narcissistic creation of a transcendent authorial genius secured in a legacy to artistic perfectionism. 
</p>

<p>
It is this very activity of writing <i>apart from</i> personality, rather than with a possessive and impersonally detached sense of objectivity, that Jameson herself saw as the future function for authorial standpoint in literary reportage. As she outlined it in the journal <i>Fact</i>: "The first thing a socialist writer has to realize is that there is no value in the emotions, the spiritual writhings, started in him by the sight, smell, and touch of poverty. The emotions are no doubt unavoidable. There is no need to record them" ("D," 11).<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  To take the words of Eliot himself (albeit to the opposite end of the political spectrum), for Jameson the most radical documentary is ideally "only a medium and not a personality," which, handled with a sort of self-abstracting discipline, may even offer "an escape from personality."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  An authorial practice of distancing oneself from that which must be conveyed and critiqued is <i>the</i> ethical imperative for Jameson's "well-placed novelist": 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

As the photographer does, so must the writer keep himself out of the picture while working ceaselessly to present the <i>fact</i> from a striking (poignant, ironic, penetrating, significant) angle.

Her typology for the "detailed and accurate presentment, rather than representation, of this moment, and this society," emphasized precisely that "seizing of the significant" as a mode for finding opportunities to intervene in workaday life; and by advocating exilic models of detachment from the viewed oppressions of that life as "conduits for a feeling which is not personal, nor static" ("D," 13). This is crucial for understanding how Warner too developed a lexicon of impersonality to find meaning in the everyday. It was surely that possibility of retrieving significance from the fabric of mundane experience that Warner pondered when writing to Paul Nordoff in summer 1940: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
[H]ow extraordinary it is that one feels this profound difference between things like bombs, which one can only partially assimilate to one's experience, and things like a cloudy moonlit sky and the naked boughs of an apple tree, which are commonplaces, and are part of one's ordinary being. [ . . . ] In fact, I shouldn't be surprised if in the last analysis it turns out that the horror of war is tantamount to the horror of boredom; it is the repugnance one feels to being compelled to attend to things that don't interest one.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
The taciturnity of Warner's persona in her fictional prose eases here, attenuating into the form of an insistent self-inquisition whose tone is far more confessionary, elliptical, personal. The "horror of boredom" is not so much a result of shrewd disinterest; it is more a reaction to sentiments that seem alien or intrusive upon the importance of commonplace immediacies&#x02014;those everyday occurrences that, to Warner, are often valuable precisely for piquing one's sensate self into awareness of a wider spectrum of political and ethical entailments. It was "alongside that severe conviction," as Beer puts it, of perceiving "a longer compass in the struggle between Fascism and Socialism" that Warner forever "registered through into extreme old age the tumbling pleasures of the ordinary moment" ("STW," 85). These two levels of seeing the world were inseparable, necessary, instrumental, however frustratingly those valuable pleasures retained something of the elusiveness of Woolf's epiphanic moments-of-being. Visions of the wider possibilities for social transformation appeared for Warner always inextricable from the hidden imperatives and perseverance entailed in inhabiting the everyday.
</p>

<p>
Warner's letter reveals a rigorous awareness of the cognitive significance of ordinary sensations that is richly evident throughout her fiction. She again echoes Pater's belief that felt experience need not bury our capacity for action. For what she finds is that stimuli from a quotidian world draw attention to the social field against which they hold a seemingly "profound difference." <i>After the Death of Don Juan</i> elaborates the stylistic implications of her insights, dramatizing as events of critical illumination moments in which sensory experience stresses the self's imminent entailment in the social. 
</p>

<p>
As in <i>Summer Will Show</i>, she sustains in the novel an interanimation of distanced description and fleeting intervention, while at the same time drawing out the ethical implications of writerly detachment. <i>After the Death of Don Juan</i> demonstrates how indeed Warner negotiated between impressionism and realism, lyrical interiority and 

<b></b>

outward projection. On occasion this kind of formal self-scrutinizing is made explicit. It is with a quizzical documentary concision that Warner pictures Don Saturno under impending siege; her inquisition arrives unsparingly from the position of an overseer whose provenance is indeterminate, left abstractly placed: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The water. The eviction of the tenants when the irrigation was completed. Do as he would, they were to be betrayed. Do as he would, they would never believe that he was betrayed with them. As long as a child's child lived in Tenorio Viejo he would be called Saturno the Cheat.
<p class="blockquote">
He walked to the window and looked through the chinks of the shutters. There they were. He looked at the landscape he had known all his life, at the place he called his. There was the river-bed, the poplar-trees, the speckled olive-yards, the green bands of the maize, the road. He saw something compact that moved at a steady pace along the road. A cloud of dust moved with it, and out of the dust flashed sharp prickles of light.
<p class="blockquote">
"They march well. But it's too fast." The sentence rose in his mind, deliberate as a bubble rising. It exploded into meaning. He remained for some time at the window, swallowing, and driving the nails into the palms of his hands. The truth was, he was afraid to go downstairs and face the two men there.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Those first two paragraphs work in tandem. It is as though Warner's reportorial terseness throughout the first condemns the impressionistic tone following on from it, when that second paragraph slides into the panoramic view of an entire landscape inflected by Saturno's nostalgia. Indeed, Warner's cataphoric phrases ("Do as he would") resound like a solemn descant, chiming testaments to the futility of Saturno's imagined hope of removing himself from implication once his temporary stronghold is besieged. That notion here of removal works in a double-pronged way, of course. A gesture of self-abstraction seems as applicable to our narrator's poise as an austere inquisitor as it is to Saturno who, holing up in this castle, thinks even now he can find consolation by escaping from the present into maudlin reminiscence. Warner's own self-distantiation as an implied and impersonal commentator thus highlights the distance her character can no longer preserve between a weakening nobility and the incensed population of a region he has forgone. 
</p>

<p>
Thanks to this very act of self-erasure on Warner's part, her voice-over remains impartial to benefit the presentation of regional place. As Wendy Mulford takes care to highlight in her 1989 introduction: "Warner's peasants are not sanctified, or seen as embryo social-realist heroes, for all her admiration for the USSR at that time. All are held up to her level, humorous and scrutinising gaze. But this detachment is permeated by an immediacy, a vivid life in the writing that more than compensates for the lack of individuation" (x). If <i>After the Death</i> works to historicize the empowerment of Franco's government, it never allows this tactic to impinge stylistically upon the limpid realization of Tenorio Viejo across the narrative. 
</p>

<p>
In Tenorio Viejo itself, of course, Warner had again adopted another remote and provincial setting. Yet this backdrop is far from restrictive as an idiom for political allegory. I would agree with Jane Marcus when she notes that "[i]n rescuing archaic forms from their exile in genre limbo," Warner "transforms the fantastic into a kind of 

<b></b>

superrealism." And it is that system of attentive revaluation which "deconstructs a norm of socialist realism as a vehicle for the expression of both ethics and otherness."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Contrapuntal and episodic, <i>After the Death</i> is alive to the subtle registers by which a feminist historical novel could "trespass freely and fearlessly" ("LT," 178), as Woolf had aspired. In <i>After the Death</i>"realist representation," to adapt Miller's phrase here, implements a "progressive de-realization of the social world." Guileful, denatured, the novel's portrait "seizes on that world in all its uncanniness, while satiric fantasy portrays the simulated reality of spectacle more truly than a more conventional 'realism' could" (<i>LM</i>, 97). Characteristic of the novel's proposal of an alternative mode of "ironic realism," the depiction of Tenorio Viejo's slide into divisive uprising after the fabled death of its tyrannical heir Don Juan, as Janet Montefiore finds, "allegorically represents the discomfiture of the Spanish ruling class by the election of a Popular Front government in February 1936."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  Warner's radical appropriation of the historicizing tradition, however, is more complex than a polemicized striking of parallels between a divided and dilapidated eighteenth-century village and contemporary Spain under the gathering storm of Fascism. Montefiore worries that, through Warner's recourse to "free indirect narration, using little or no authorial commentary," the resulting insularity compromises the potential scope of her socialist critique to leave feminist contentions unvoiced&#x02014;factors which "make the novel's humanism look a little narrowly defined."<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  But this fails to acknowledge how narrative refraction can be deployed as a symbolic tool; it underestimates the extent to which Warner could balance registers between character and critique, place and polemic, so as to prevent a proscription of rights from intruding didactically upon the description of embodied experience.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Narrative perception and narratorial persona: dual concepts, then, furnishing in Warner's fiction an extensive ethical vocabulary. These two elements of narration, working in concert, convey that threshold point at which sight provokes insight, where protean sensations yield political illuminations. Affecting syntax and structure alike, Warner's striking impersonality, issued from a stance in cool detachment, insists we attend not only to the repose in which she voices her polemic, but also to the repose as judicial witness that her readers are themselves invited to assume. 
</p>

<p>
Miller has indeed claimed that a consistent trait of "late modernist" narration is the considered erasure of any stable or accountable provenance, thereby subverting in turn the "basis of the novel as an anthropomorphic genre." For "[o]utside the norms of realism, voices may come from no apparent body, a single body may be occupied by multiple voices, or one body may be given the voice of another" (<i>LM</i>, 101, 102). This destabilizing of the enunciatory origin and execution of so-called "persona-mediated" perspective <i>is</i> indeed a distinctive trait in Warner's work; her honed impersonality, though, carries another dimension. With regard to her narrators' self-usurpations, a certain ambiguity is never diffused. And it is precisely because she gives this ethical weighting to the task of reshaping the very purpose of perspectival realism that her novelistic approach succeeds. 
</p>

<p>
Storm Jameson conceded that documentary's "criticism of social values" will always be "confronted by the extreme difficulty of finding phrases which are at once compressed 

<b></b>

and highly suggestive" ("D," 17). Warner's fictional enterprise succeeded in doing just that: describing sensorially abstract moments of supreme detachment that reconcile "the frightful difficulty," as Jameson saw it, "of expressing, in such a way that they are at once seen to be intimately connected, the relations between things (men, acts) widely separated in space or in the social complex" ("D," 18). Though Warner's fiction formally "abutts the Modernist," as Beer maintains, equally with that curious mix of syntactic brevity and lyric intensity it remains "pellucid, determined and mischievous" ("STW," 77). For Warner marks a commitment to the varied implications of considering mimetic narrative less as a functional remedy, than as a reflexive method. She inhabited "late modernism" with a resolute poetics, generating versions of modernity, and women's mobility within it, that radically challenge current understandings of realism and what a realist aesthetic is capable of achieving in its historical moment.

Keith Williams finds in the documentary realism of the 1930s "a reaction against modernism's imploding preoccupation with self-analysis and experiment, but without merely regressing to nineteenth-century Naturalism's unproblematised mimesis." This reaction constituted a politically-charged "acknowledgement that modernism's linguistic self-consciousness, together with new media technology, had transformed categories of realistic representation irrevocably" ("Post/Modern Documentary: Orwell, Agee, and the New Reportage," in Keith Williams and Steven Matthews, eds. <i>Rewriting the Thirties: Modernism and After</i> [London and New York: Longman, 1997], 165).

Elizabeth Bowen, Storm Jameson, Naomi Mitchison, and Rebecca West might spring to mind. Miller acknowledges this "problem of selection" and suggests that ultimately it is up to his readers "to judge whether they find compelling the reasons I offer for preferring a 'bad new' modernist canon, stood up on still-tottering feet, over a 'good old' one, squatly resting on a plinth of tacit beliefs and received ideas" (<i>LM</i>, 21). When situating Sylvia Townsend Warner's explicit reformulation of fiction's critical efficacy, I would argue that a singular version of "late modernism" is too monolithic for the purposes of re-evaluating the return of realist aesthetics in British women's writing leading up to <i>and</i> spanning World War II.

Virginia Woolf, <i>The Years</i> (1937; London: Penguin, 1998), 176. Abandoning the novel-essay format of <i>The Pargiters</i>,Woolf engaged rigorously with the stylistic pitfalls and potentialities of engineering polemical components to her aesthetic. In so doing she mirrored contemporary debate concerning the motivations for achieving in art a facility for social criticism. Edgell Rickword maintained 

<b></b>

that "[i]t is a platitude surely, that art and culture, especially through our centralized education system, are powerful instruments of class domination," going on to point out that the "social environment" out of which radical artistic interventions have been produced remains internally heterogeneous, and that "literature as a whole shows that the oppressed classes have never (again, we must add, till to-day) been without their own specific forms of artistic expression" ("Art and Propaganda," review of <i>Prefaces</i>,by Bernard Shaw, and <i>Mammonart</i>, by Upton Sinclair, <i>Left Review</i> 1.2 [November 1934], 44, 45).

Compare Jameson's criticism of writers who recruit a kind of emotional heroism in an effort to depict working class squalor: "He must not, he ought not to indulge himself in self-analysis, since that is to nail himself inside his own small ego at a moment when what is individual to each man is less real, less actual, than that which he shares with every other man [ . . . ] if he goes for his own sake, for some fanciful spiritual advantage to be got from the experience, he had better stay at home."

With a comparably reticent diagnosis that connects Warner's susceptibility to thematic parochialism with her retreat into rural Dorset, Alan Munton worries that "Warner's considerable literary skills cannot overcome the intrinsic limitations of the countryside as a topic," inasmuch as "it is difficult for a political writer to tell stories of rural conflict which have more than a limited or local resonance" ("Rural Radical," review of <i>The Diaries of Sylvia Townsend Warner</i>, ed. Claire Harman, <i>The Cambridge Quarterly</i> 28.2 [June 1999], 172).
