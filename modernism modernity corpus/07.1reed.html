Hart Crane had an infuriating way of writing a poem. Typically, after
drinking copiously, he would put a 78 on a hand-cranked Victrola and play
it "a dozen, two dozen, three dozen times" while alternately banging away
on a typewriter and loudly declaiming the same line of verse repeatedly.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 To his friends' horror, the Victrola was indispensable--Crane claimed
 it gave him "intimacy with la Muse"--and he peremptorily refused
 every polite request to change his habits or at least to confine his
 cacophonous writing sessions to daylight hours (<I>V</I>, 173). Quite
 the contrary. He forced those around him to adapt. While a house
 guest of Harry Crosby's in France, for instance, he one day greeted
 his reluctant patron with an ukase. "Columbia, loud! ! !" he snapped,
 presuming that the millionaire Crosby would instantly go fetch him new
 phonograph needles (<I>V</I>, 584).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hart Crane's phonograph fetish has received only passing attention from
his many critics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 This oversight is unsurprising. In his day, Crane was infamous for such
 antisocial eccentricities as throwing typewriters out of windows and
 brawling with taxi drivers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 The anecdotes about Crane and his Victrola that appear in such places
 as Harry Crosby's diaries may be vivid, but they vie for a reader's
 attention with a host of other memorable incidents featuring Crane's
 wild, dissipated antics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Indeed, Crane's self-destructive behavior (he ultimately committed
 suicide in 1932 at the age of thirty-two) has secured him

<B></B>

the popular reputation of an American <I>po&egrave;te maudit</I>, as
notable for his biography as for the quality of his verse. R. W. B. Lewis
long ago pointed out that this reputation has tempted unwary critics to
misconstrue Crane's intent and accomplishments; since Lewis's magisterial
1967 monograph on Crane, scholars have been loath to dwell upon the
details of Crane's life without carefully justifying their introduction
of such material.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Lewis's cautions would seem apropos in the case of Crane's Victrola. Why
 should Crane's gramophone obsession matter any more than his other
 striking but ultimately rather trivial habits, such as cossack dancing
 at parties or cruising waterfront gay bars under the name Christopher
 Marlowe?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Over the last decade, thanks in large part to a number of influential
scholarly works dating from the early 1990s, academics have become
increasingly aware of the complex relationship between innovative acoustic
technologies--such as radio, the telephone, and the phonograph--and
gradual but profound shifts in sound's role in modern literature.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Specialists in twentieth-century poetry have displayed particular
 interest in this emergent branch of scholarship since it offers an
 appealing, historically grounded alternative to the many, aridly
 formalist treatments of sound in poetry currently available. Several
 recent studies have gone so far as to posit that the "aurality" of
 a poem is not an ahistorical characteristic that can be adequately
 or exhaustively described by traditional schemes for scanning
 verse. Instead, aurality ought to be understood as an attribute that
 undergoes constant modification in its nature and function from period
 to period and from writer to writer.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 In other words, such stock-in-trade formulas as "anapestic,"
 "alliteration," and "slant rhyme" should be seen as revealing little
 about a given poem unless one has first established the precise place
 that sound occupies in its author's poetics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
When viewed in the light of these developments in the study of poetry,
the fact that Hart Crane, a self-styled "Pindar of our machine age,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 invariably wrote to the accompaniment of a "machine that sings"
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 suddenly appears much more significant than heretofore
 appreciated. Indeed, I will be arguing that Crane's singing machine, the
 Victrola, left a profound mark on all aspects of his poetry, that is,
 on everything from the microtexture of his verse to its transcendental
 aspirations. Moreover, insofar as most secondary literature treating
 the links between literary experimentation and innovations in acoustic
 technology has concentrated on the impact of radio,
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 this article, by singling out Crane's writing ritual for commentary, will
 demonstrate the need to consider the influence of <I>all</I> aural media
 if we are ever fully to understand modernism, that curious interlude
 in American letters that occurs after the invention of the phonograph
 but prior to the widespread availability of television and the LP.

Hart Crane did not write poems in a linear fashion. He wrote them
piecemeal, "pell-mell" (<I>V</I>, 363). While "intimate with la Muse"
he composed individual phrases that, only afterwards, when sober, would
he slowly, with great difficulty, begin to

<B></B>

assemble into discrete lyrics. Malcolm Cowley recalls a moment during
the gestation period for what would eventually become the opening lines
of Crane's lyric "Passage." During a Fourth of July party at his friend
Slater Brown's, Crane

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
sat by the lilacs in the dooryard, meditatively pouring a box of salt
on the phonograph. . . . One of the wives, pregnant and stark sober,
heard him repeating time and time again: "Where the cedar leaf divides
the sky . . . I was promised an improved infancy."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Crane would sometimes hang on to a gem of a phrase for months before
finding a home for it, or multiple homes, as in the case of a phrase like
"The everlasting eyes of Pierrot, / Or, of Gargantua the laughter," which
appears in both "The Bridge of Estador" (<I>CP</I>, 175) and "Praise
for an Urn" (<I>CP</I>, 8). Although these particular phrases may have
transparently literary origins, Emerson and Rabelais respectively, more
often than not, according to Crane's biographer John Unterecker, the
inspiration was the very music Crane listened to while writing.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Sometimes critics have been alert to this fact, as in the case of Crane's
 poem "Virginia," which reworks the 1920s hit "What Do You Do Sunday,
 Mary?" from the musical <I>Poppy</I>, but no one has systematically
 tried to unearth possible connections between Crane's known favorite
 recordings and his published verse.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What would such an investigation teach us? We would have a better sense of
Crane's indebtedness to particular sources as well as an improved sense
of how Crane went about transforming such source material into lyric
poetry. Kenneth Rexroth, for instance, reports that while living in the
basement at 45 Grove Street, in an apartment immediately below Crane's,
the poet drove him nearly to distraction by playing Bert Williams's
campy Prohibition satire "The Moon Shines on the Moonshine" nonstop.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 The song contrasts a dusty, abandoned brewery to the industrious activity
 of moonshiners outside of town:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While listening to "The Moon Shines on the Moonshine," Rexroth informs
us, Crane wrote the opening lines of his poem "Lachrymae Christi":

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Crane has reproduced the distillery scene from the song's chorus,
albeit oddly inflected. Knowing that he has reworked Bert Williams's
tune, we have a valuable opportunity, through a close comparison, to
reconstruct Crane's involuted thought process much more fully than usually
possible. (Such opportunities are rare because of Crane's characteristic
compression, intensity, and obliquity. Although Crane once claimed that
his poetry operated by a consistent "logic of metaphor," Lee Edelman
has shown that this "logic" in practice results in a thicket of poetic
tropes so snarled, so dense that one can despair of ever comprehensively
analyzing its purpose and function.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While listening to Williams, Crane seems to have fixated upon the
words "the moon shines on the moonshine." That line's wordplay hinges
upon breaking one word, "moonshine," back down into its components,
"moon" and "shine." Alternatively, one could say that a compound word
"dissolves" into its constituent elements--an especially apt metaphor,
given that "moonshine," or distilled alcohol, is itself a solvent
(like "benzine"). In his poem Crane reflects this notion thematically
by describing the world outside the "mills" as a world "dissolved"
by moonlight. He further pursues this train of thought by mimicking
the linguistic process of "dissolution" evident in the song. That is,
taking his cue from the line "the cobwebs cob" in his source text, he
juxtaposes words so as to suggest that the larger ones are decaying
into smaller ones: "whitely" loses the <I>t</I> and <I>y</I> to become
"while"; "dissolve" drops its fore and aft phonemes leaving simply the
word "all"; "machinery" is distilled down to the word "sure."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One might say that the shining, liquid moonlight that opens "Lachrymae
Christi" signals a poetic process of decreation in which words lose their
integrity and begin to operate otherwise than as "sure machinery." Words
are thereby restored to a kind of virginal purity (a "whiteness"), or
rather, an uncontaminated, raw materiality subject to the poet's artful
rearrangements or reconstitution.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 This poetic fantasy of escape from conventional restrictions on
 language use, red as standing outside industrial "mills" in a
 nighttime landscape of word-magic, finds its license and inspiration in
 Bert Williams's song. That is, while listening to "Moon Shines on the
 Moonshine," Crane discovered a bundle of age-old poetic <I>topoi</I>
 deployed in a thought-provoking fashion: inebriation, metamorphosis,
 escape from regulation ("far from . . . cops"), and the dream of
 the blank slate. He then elaborated, baroquely, upon these implicit
 ideas. Much like Joyce throughout the Sirens episode of <I>Ulysses</I>,
 Crane seizes upon an ephemeral product of mass culture and, sensing
 beneath its glossy surface a wealth of expressive possibilities, lovingly
 transforms it to suit his own ends.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This example suggests that if one knew when Crane listened to which 78s
and if one could then match that playlist with a detailed chronology of
when he was writing which lyrics, the result would undoubtedly be a much
better explanation of why he wrote what he did. Would such a large-scale
project be feasible, however? We do have a general sense of his musical
preferences for his all-night writing frenzies. On

<B></B>

the one hand, he favored grand, even bombastic, classical music: excerpts
from Richard Wagner, C&eacute;sar Franck's <I>Variations symphoniques</I>,
and Antonin Dvor&#157; &aacute;k's <I>New World Symphony</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 On the other hand, he listened to popular songs from musicals like
 <I>Hit the Deck</I> or by stars like Sophie Tucker.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 He was particularly fond of "torch songs."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 His supreme vamp-goddess was Marlene Dietrich, whom he thought had a
 voice "straight from Tutankhamen's tomb."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Apparently, much of the final draft of his long poem and masterpiece
 <I>The Bridge</I> was prepared while listening to her music, and in
 his last, most dissolute days in Mexico City, he would play individual
 records of hers over and over at such volume that visitors were unable
 to carry on conversations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Unfortunately, we lack the necessary, precise timelines to link these
various artists, composers, and pieces with particular Crane poems. Hard
evidence, as in Rexroth's account, is scarce. Moreover, since Crane
wrote only disconnected verses while listening to his Victrola, not
entire poems, the prodigious archival work required would likely yield
only scattered insights and further, local close readings. There would be
cumulative benefits, of course, insofar as we would learn more about the
various ways in which Crane's verse operates, but there is no guarantee
that we would be able to arrive at global interpretations of complete
Crane lyrics, let alone of his poetry <I>in toto</I>. "Lachrymae Christi,"
for instance, after the lines that I have been analyzing, veers into
a macabre description of flowers on a hillside that bears little or no
obvious relation to "The Moon Shines on the Moonshine":

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One can detect hints here of a musical subtext. The adjective "Twanged"
and the possible pun on "trilling" in the awkward phrase "Are trillion"
might indicate that Crane is attempting a synaesthetic experiment in which
the image of a profusion of red flowers represents a visual equivalent
to a vivid, brassy passage in a musical piece. What that piece might
be, though, is anyone's guess. Even if we knew what it was, we would be
only a small step closer to understanding one of Crane's most recondite
poems. Thirty further lines remain, including such inscrutable statements
as "Let sphinxes from the ripe / Borage of death have cleared my tongue"
(<I>CP</I>, 19). However fascinating the direct connections between
Crane's poems and the specific songs or compositions to which he listened
while writing them, a different starting point than the purely inductive
is necessary if we are to understand why recorded music mattered so much
to Crane and, in turn, how it affected all, not some, of his verse. Absent
the raw data necessary for genetic criticism of the kind that has proved

<B></B>

so informative in the study of <I>Finnegans Wake</I>, we will have to
take a more roundabout approach.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What does Hart Crane himself have to say on the subject of music and
poetry? He not only frequently expressed a desire to model his poetry
on the most advanced music of his day, he was also given to describing
his verse in musical terms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 For instance, he labels his early lyric "The Marriage of Faustus and
 Helen" a "pseudo-symphonic construction toward an absolute beauty"
 (<I>OM</I>, 93), his long poem <I>The Bridge</I> "a symphony with an
 epic theme" (<I>CPSL</I>, 254), "Harbor Dawn" "a legato" (<I>CPSL</I>,
 249), and "Cutty Sark" a "fugue" (<I>CPSL</I>, 252). Such tags had real
 force and knowledge behind them--as Samuel Delany and Michael Sharp
 have shown, Crane was not merely using them to pay lip service to the
 Paterian tenet that all poetry aspires to the condition of music.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 We even know where and when he first involved himself seriously in study
 of the art form. While living in Cleveland after his first stint in
 New York (1920-23), Crane's chief connection to the international
 avant-garde was via the Cleveland Orchestra, then under the direction
 of the world-famous conductor Ernest Bloch. From Bloch, Crane learned
 to relish the latest in European music.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 He became an ardent admirer of such composers as Vincent d'Indy, Erik
 Satie, Aleksandr Scriabin, and Igor Stravinsky. Later in life, wherever
 he traveled, Crane continued to seek out innovative music of whatever
 kind, whether it be Times Square jazz or the microtonal, percussive
 compositions of Edgar Var&egrave;se.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 From his Cleveland days onward--that is, during his poetic maturity,
 during the years in which he wrote the bulk of the poetry for which he
 is remembered--modern music remained a constant touchstone for Crane's
 achievements in his own medium, verse.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given this background, one can conclude that Crane had definite reasons
for insisting upon writing with a Victrola's accompaniment. Moreover,
those reasons are likely to be found by looking beyond his usual
playlist. In the 1920s, recordings of avant-garde music were
difficult to purchase commercially. Despite his intense admiration
for contemporary experimental composers, when Crane sat down to write
poetry, he usually had to settle for less esoteric fare. The repetitive
playing of a 78, <I>any</I> 78, seems to have been the <I>sine qua
non</I> of his writing ritual. If he had to forego the delights of,
say, Var&egrave;se's <I>Ionisation</I> in favor of "Moon Shines on the
Moonshine," so be it. (This does not mean, of course, that Crane chose
78s indiscriminately. As we have already seen, he displayed a marked
preference for certain genres. Rather, he simply selected the most
promising 78s from the pool of available options at a given location.)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To establish why Crane needed a gramophone in order to write poetry,
the best procedure might be to hunt for something of a paradox: a 78 by
one of Crane's favorite innovative, contemporary composers that would
nonetheless have been readily obtainable during his lifetime. Such a
78 might permit us to appreciate both what Crane saw in modern music
and how it could be adapted for his own, writerly purposes. In the
next section of this article, I concentrate on a unique case that fills
this bill, Maurice Ravel's popular but somewhat bizarre orchestral work
<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>. I examine both <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> itself as well
as how it would have been altered as Crane

<B></B>

"performed" it on his Victrola. We will thereby begin to distinguish what
attracted Crane to certain kinds of music as well as how he endeavored
to isolate and accentuate those qualities. We will also begin to discern
that Crane's madness had a method, that he played selected music in a
particular way so as to promote definite poetic ends.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Late in Hart Crane's career, Maurice Ravel's <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> seems
to have become one of his favorite accompaniments for his poetry-writing
marathons.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 Crane believed that it provided him with the raw stuff of
 inspiration. "At times dear Gorham," he wrote his friend Gorham Munson,
 "I feel an enormous power in me--that seems almost supernatural. . . . I
 can say this now with perfect equanimity because I am notoriously
 drunk and the Victrola is still going with that glorious 'Bolero'"
 (<I>OM</I>, 92).
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> has an undeserved reputation for being nothing
more than an expression of mounting excitement as one nears the
climactic moment of orgasm/death. Crane, one might conjecture, loved
<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> for no better reason than that it conjured up
images of lithe toreadors engaged in the kind of life-or-death athletic
struggles that he found powerfully erotic. He was, after all, the sort
of man who went to boxing matches not because of sport--he considered
the game itself often rather "boresome"--but because the spectacle of
"sublime machines of human muscle-play" got him "very heated" (<I>OM</I>,
35). Ravel, however, is not a simple composer, and, as I have said,
Crane had extensive, intimate knowledge of contemporary European music.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> is a fifteen-minute orchestral piece written in
3/4 time. It consists of eighteen repetitions of an initial theme and
countertheme, gradually and steadily increasing in volume from barely
audible to deafening. Two measures of percussion interrupt the melody
after every second countertheme. Ravel signals the impending conclusion
of the piece by suddenly modulating the tonality. The last countertheme
segues into a thunderous, dissonant crescendo.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his classic analysis of <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>, Claude
L&eacute;vi-Strauss argues that it attempts to work through a basic
opposition between symmetry and asymmetry. The rhythm is ternary, but its
melodic structure of theme and countertheme is binary. L&eacute;vi-Strauss
lays out the intricate, subtle ways in which, over the course of
<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>, both its rhythm and melody endeavor to bridge that
gap. There is no need to recapitulate L&eacute;vi-Strauss's structural
analysis here beyond noting that he successfully demonstrates that every
strategy intended to camouflage ternaries as binaries (and vice versa)
produces further, often higher-order oppositions between asymmetry and
symmetry, which must then, in turn, be overcome. Caught in this sand trap,
<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> cannot progress but only repeat itself, futilely
intensifying its efforts with every iteration. L&eacute;vi-Strauss argues
that the final modulation and crescendo represent a "mythic" solution
to the piece's fundamental self-contradictions. That is, instead of
"reconciling" the contraries, they are "cast out," like a scapegoat. The
silence that follows their

<B></B>

abrupt banishment only <I>feels</I> satisfying to an audience, as
if the quiet were "consecrated to a task well done," when in reality
<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> is more or less conceding defeat.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
L&eacute;vi-Strauss's account of <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> depends upon one
fundamental assumption: that its audience listen to the piece continuously
from beginning to end. Hart Crane, however, would not have been able to
listen to <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> in this manner while writing. A ten-inch
78 played on a Victrola lasts no more than five minutes. When Decca
released <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>, they had to put it onto two separate
disks. To simulate a live performance of Ravel's piece, Crane would have
to have stood over his Victrola and been poised to flip or switch the 78s
as necessary. But we know that he did nothing of the sort. In the heat
of composing a poem, he always played "the same record grinding over
and over through its five-minute cycles" (<I>V</I>, 253). Crane would,
therefore, have listened to <I>one part</I> of <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>
incessantly, most likely the final third, but not necessarily.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Played in this way, Crane's <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> would have been
very different from the harshly linear work that L&eacute;vi-Strauss
explicates. Instead, Crane's suspended, ever-repeated, partial
<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> would have approached the condition of such
1960s minimalist works as Philip Glass's <I>Music in Fifths</I>
and Terry Riley's <I>In C</I>. That is, the original teleology
of <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> would, as in minimalist music, have become
degraded, or irrelevant. Like Glass and Riley, in his "performance" of
<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>, Crane aims not for a single, completed musical
gesture but a continuous auditory environment. Under these circumstances,
<I>Bol&eacute;ro's</I> crescendo would have had much less "mythic"
impact than in a concert hall--how could it be otherwise, after three
dozen or more repetitions? Crane seems to have sought out, and prolonged
indefinitely, the tension, or "oscillation" as L&eacute;vi-Strauss puts
it, between ternary and binary, asymmetry and symmetry, in Ravel's work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The resulting variant on <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> was, again like a
minimalist work, something of a closed system, or, more grandly, an
attempt at instantiating a timeless, utopian space. Within the endless
loop of Crane's <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>, the melody would have remained
powerfully expressive and the pronounced martial rhythm viscerally
stirring, but they also would have remained untainted by the strong
narrative impulse subtending earlier romantic uses of such devices in,
say, Tschaikovsky's <I>1812 Overture</I> or Beethoven's <I>Eroica</I>. The
music thereby marks out a "time" that is "timeless" in the sense that
"What next?" never becomes an issue. One of the most famous pieces of
minimalist music is John Adams's whimsically titled <I>Short Ride in a
Fast Machine</I>. Crane, in constructing his <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>-world,
seems to have pined after a <I>Perpetual Ride in a Fast Machine</I>:
symmetry and asymmetry forever in dynamic imbalance; the volume
downshifting only to return to the same level, again and again; a listener
caught up in a perpetual driver's high with no Hegelian synthesis or
transformative epiphany possible. A joyride into eternity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This ride would also have required Crane's active, physical
involvement. Victrolas were spring-operated. A user had to hand-crank
them every once in a while to keep the turntable rotating. According to
Gorham Munson, Crane periodically had to "race" to wind his up so as to
keep constant the musical accompaniment to his writing

marathons (<I>V</I>, 252-3). Crane's <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>-world was
both mechanical and muscle-powered, the product of human and machine
labor. Moreover, as I have already pointed out, when not cranking
away, Crane would have been sitting at a table, pounding away at a
manual typewriter, or going through "loud trial readings" of a line
and all its possible variants (<I>V</I>, 253). Poet-with-typewriter and
poet-with-gramophone were structural equivalents for Crane. Both brought
audible art into being. And those heady sounds, repeated, created the
utopian space that sustained the human will and drive required to produce
yet more sound--again, we discover a (theoretically) closed system. In
his poem "Cutty Sark" Crane writes apocalyptically of a "white machine
that sings" (<I>CP</I>, 72). The phrase could be a kenning for typewriter,
Victrola, and poet alike.

Before I can go further, I must again concede that <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>
is only one of many 78s Crane played when, to quote Robert Browning,
"a palace of music [he] reared."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
Yet all of Crane's preferred 78s--whether Dietrich-style torch songs
or bombastic classical music--seem to have shared one fundamental
trait. They exhibit Eros in its most theatrical guises, ranging
from aggressive triumph to jaded melancholy. And, as in the case of
<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>, Crane, by playing these emotional roller coasters
nonstop, would have stripped the music of implied teleologies, whether
narrative, psychological, or otherwise. Crane would have prolonged
indefinitely seduction's dramatic tension. At the start of my discussion
of <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>, I set aside the question of Eros because I
did not want to broach the subject prematurely. Now, however, we can
address that issue with greater sophistication, and we can use it as a
launching pad for moving toward a broader understanding of how Crane's
verse functions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Crane's compositional regimen bears all the hallmarks of a libidinal
ritual. He insisted that things be just so and that they stay that way. He
fantasizes a physical fusion of man and machine that releases a flood of
creative energy. An early poem, "Episode of Hands," shows us the erotic
charge that this fantasy held for Crane. He retells an incident in his
father's candy factory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 An unnamed machine injures a worker's hand. Amidst "factory sounds and
 factory thoughts," "the factory owner's son" takes the worker's hurt hand
 into his own and studies it before bandaging it. "The gash was bleeding,
 and a shaft of sun / That glittered in and out among the wheels, / Fell
 lightly, warmly, down into the wound" (<I>CP</I>, 173). Significantly,
 the speaker here so identifies with another man's violated flesh that
 he imagines that he becomes the other person, able to feel the "warmth"
 of the sunlight in the "gash." Celestial light washes indifferent across
 machine and men, transring them, sanctifying their erotic communion,
 removing them from time and space.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Crane's later poem, "Cape Hatteras," dispenses with the autobiographical
frame of "Episode of Hands" but makes much the same statement.

Crane projects bestial, blind, raw Eros onto machinery in a factory. This
libidinal energy ("glee") is both constrained ("confined") and permitted,
frictionless ("oilrinsed"), to expend itself with abandon ("whirl"). The
male bodies left (nominally) integral in "Episode of Hands" here dissolve,
like Osiris, into partial objects that pursue their circumscribed yet
blissful course. In both these poems, note, Crane's symbol for this
mechanical-eternal <I>jouissance</I> is the turning wheel ("wheels,"
"whirl," "axle," "oilrinsed circles"). I would argue that these symbols
thematize the very real turning wheel, the Victrola turntable, that
preexists them and that as a material precondition for their existence
as poetry can even be said to bring them into being. Poems like "Episode
of Hands" and "Cape Hatteras" are, forgive the pun, <I>records</I> of a
utopian, Dionysian-Bacchic state that Crane induces through a precise
blend of repetitious music, alcohol, frenzied physical activity, and
noisy machinery.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Inserting machinery into his scene of desire by insisting upon a
<I>mechanized</I> variant of the poet's divinest madness, Crane clearly
participates in what Caroline Jones, in <I>The Machine in the Studio</I>,
calls "the technological sublime."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 Whereas Edmund Burke's classic definition of the sublime emphasizes
 encounters with the natural world, for many twentieth-century artists,
 Jones argues, "Machines, not nature . . . provide the terrible forces to
 be encountered, engulfed by, and transcended in the studio" (<I>MS</I>,
 203-4). Yes, "in the studio"--Jones has in mind not poets but
 postwar visual artists like Robert Rauschenberg, Robert Smithson, and
 Andy Warhol, who grapple with how to integrate machines, the mechanical,
 and the mechanistic into their artistic processes. As Jones sees it,
 that wrestling match puts the artist's very humanity at risk. I would
 argue that Crane's writing ritual depended upon the creation of a similar
 arena, a space of a Jacob-and-the-angel erotic combat between the human
 and the non- or superhuman.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Jones credits the "technological sublime" to an implicit analogy between
an artist's work space and industrial production. The artist encounters,
then battles or submits to, the titanic, impersonal forces propelling the
march of capitalism. In essence, Jones is extending Fredric Jameson's
argument that "euphoria" results when a subject "consumes" a (false,
ideological) image of the capitalist market as a totality, omnipresent
and omnipotent.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 Jones builds on Jameson by investigating some of the practical,
 artistic consequences of that "euphoria" or feeling of sublimity. As
 "Episode of Hands" and the factory passage from "Cape Hatteras" have
 demonstrated, Crane, like Jones's Warhol and Rauschenberg, finds
 "euphoria" in contemplating the

<B></B>

loss of self as mechanical processes supplant, or rend, the integrity of
the individual. While living in Akron--an industrial boomtown in 1919,
famous as the birthplace of the rubber tire--Crane told an interviewer,
"living as we do in an age of the most violent commercialism the world
has ever known, the artist cannot remain aloof from the welters without
losing the essential, imminent vitality of his vision."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
Capitalism, for Crane, is orphic. In its "violence," its "welters," one
beholds raw power. In the factory, not the sanctuary, one undergoes
a theophany: "Power's script,--wound, bobbin-bound, refined-- / Is
stropped to the slap of belts on booming spools, spurred / Into the
bulging bouillon, harnessed jelly of the stars" (<I>CP</I>, 79).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Caroline Jones criticizes Andy Warhol for too readily identifying his
artistic procedures with the logic of an assembly line.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 One could make a similar statement about Crane. In 1918 Crane
 worked at a munitions plant in Cleveland. His job was tightening
 bolts on machine parts. He "watched a seemingly endless procession
 of objects pass before him on a conveyer belt" (<I>V</I>, 113). His
 writing utopia would later reproduce the essentials of this wartime
 labor: repetition, mechanization, timelessness, circularity, the
 production of interchangeable parts. One could validly claim that
 Crane shares the industrial capitalist's dream of production by
 rote, ad infinitum. Moreover, his individual phrases are like parts
 manufactured in one place--<I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>-land--and then shipped
 elsewhere--Sobriety City--for assembly into functioning wholes. Crane's
 reliance on the "technological sublime" in his poetry and his proclivity
 for references to factories and machines seem to prere Warhol's
 compromises with the capitalist market.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But Crane enters his "writing factory" for artistic, not economic,
reasons. Unlike Warhol, he would never confuse Business and Art.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 The sublime in its technological guise remains for him "the highest order
 of <I>aesthetic</I> experience" (<I>MS</I>, 20, emphasis added). How
 could it have been otherwise? Crane associated capitalism at its
 crudest with his father Chester Arthur, the candy magnate who invented
 Life Savers&#153; yet forced his son to work for his keep as a manual
 laborer or lowly salesclerk.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Crane's choice to be a poet was a calculated rejection of his father's
 world and worldview. He dropped his given name Harold and adopted in
 its stead his mother's maiden name, Hart. And he quite proudly wrote
 his mother that he would have to endure poverty and hardship:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

I expect I'll always have to drudge for my living, and I'm quite willing

sort of poetry that is my intensest and deepest component in life--then
it all means very little to me, and then I might as well tie myself up
to some smug ambition and "success" (the common idol that every Tom Dick
and Harry is bowing to everywhere) [<I>OM</I>, 174].

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given the potent confluence of oedipal and economic protests that these
gestures imply, it is hardly surprising that Crane's conception of the
poet-as-writing-machine

<B></B>

is no more than a strategic, partial capitulation to the dehumanizing
tendencies of capitalism. By singling out one portion of the capitalist
mind-set--the open-ended desire to produce--and utterly rejecting
another--the desire to reap profit from production--Crane consciously sets
himself against the economic "machinery" of his day. He takes technologies
devised by big business for use in the office (the Remington) and for
passive entertainment (the Victrola) and perversely employs them toward
idiosyncratic, noncapitalist ends. Crane is thereby able to liberate
and redeploy the raw, libidinal <I>energy</I> bound up in the nation's
collective drive to industrialize, to produce.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 This redirected Eros is then free to power Crane's incomparably
 high-voltage verse.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I wish to draw this section to a close with a simple observation. Hart
Crane has begun to sound strangely "prepostmodern" as I have explored the
ramifications of "his" <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>. An astute reader is likely to
be thinking of a range of intertexts: J. G. Ballard's <I>Crash</I>; Gilles
Deleuze and F&eacute;lix Guattari on psychoanalysis and capitalism; Paul
Gilroy on hip hop DJs' manipulations of LPs; Katherine Hayles's <I>How
We Became Post-Human</I>; etc.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Crane's poetry has never before kept such company. More often than
 not he has been read as a belated romantic whose closest affinities
 are with such res as William Blake, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and
 Walt Whitman. In the next section of this article, I will undertake a
 reading of Crane's poem sequence "Voyages" in order to demonstrate the
 practical consequences that stem from my proposed new approach to his
 verse as well as to bring out more distinctly the "prepostmodern" side
 of Crane's poetics.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The prose is <I>echt</I> Crane. He blends mysticism ("Word made Flesh")
with sentimentality ("tears"), "ecstasy" with melodrama ("never with
another"). He throws out trite phrases ("most beautiful in the world"). He
abuses metaphors ("dances I have walked"). He even touches genius:
"sex was beaten out"--a resonant phrase, summoning thoughts of drumming,
annealing, and pummeling. It is, in other words, an appropriately orphic
triad of music, metallurgy, and masochism that complicates the passage's
seeming Platonism. Crane speaks of so indulging in "sex" that it becomes

<B></B>

something other, its physicality <I>preserved</I>, not abandoned, as one
moves "upward" on the Platonic ladder. Crane, naturally, consecrates this
(un)holy, clunky, glorious love story by setting it smack in the middle of
the Machine, here represented by Washington Roebling's Brooklyn Bridge,
whose "cables enclos[e]" the lovers and lift them out of themselves
into rapture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Two months later, in June of 1924, Crane writes the poet Jean Toomer
to tell him, too, about Opffer. To give a sense of his "exaltation,"
Crane includes a draft of a poem that he tentatively christens "Voyages"
(<I>OM</I>, 193). He also tries to explain that his poetry is an "effort
to describe God." "Only the effort," he hastens to add, "limitless and
yet forever incomplete" (<I>OM</I>, 192). In the April letter to Frank,
Crane was already happily confusing Opffer and Christ. By June, Crane's
gleeful idolatry was producing its own Gospel.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The one poetic "Voyage" that Crane sent Toomer soon grew into a sequence
of five. Crane then took an old piece of his, "The Bottom of the Sea Is
Cruel" , prefixed it to the others as a kind of proem and declared
the set of six lyrics a single work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Crane would later give pride of place to "Voyages" in his first book,
 <I>White Buildings</I> . It delivers the final, knockout punch,
 coming after two oft-anthologized works, "For the Marriage of Faustus
 and Helen" and "At Melville's Tomb."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Voyages" exhibits an eerie blend of the familiar and the strange. There
is no doubt after the magnificent <I>volta</I> of the "And yet" that
opens "Voyages" II that we are reading love poetry of the most venerable,
ornate sort, albeit a somewhat perverse variety.

On the one hand, an educated reader immediately recognizes the rolling
pentameter, archaic diction, and near-manic use of consonance ("samite
sheeted processioned"). These tried-and-true devices announce that
"our love" is worthy of the Grand Style. On the other hand, words such
as "wrapt," "wink," and "leewardings" fail to yield straightforward
sense. "Wrapt inflections"? "Wrapt" as in "wrapped"--if so, by
what? "Wrapt" as in "rapt attention"? Or as in "rapture"? In what sense is
the ocean a "wink of eternity"? Are we to imagine the waters of the globe
as God's closed eye? If so, why does Crane almost immediately proceed to
speak instead of the ocean's "vast belly"? "Voyages" II somehow manages
to be rhetorically effective, sweeping a reader, giddy, onto glorious
terrain, even though (or perhaps <I>because</I>) its semantic meaning
remains indeterminate.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Crane's implicit model for his oddly potent rhetoric is the Elizabethan
sonnet sequence. Throughout "Voyages," Crane's imagery, like that of
Renaissance love

poets, is Petrarchan, featuring storms, tropic heat, arctic cold, ships,
pirates, and dreams. So, too, is his rhetorical topos, an enamored
poet's tone that veers unpredictably between despair and ecstasy as
he uses the occasion of his love to express himself in increasingly
convoluted res.

Crane's achievement in "Voyages" lies in his having "made new" the
Elizabethan legacy. Many modernist writers, of course, shared similar
aims, among them Djuna Barnes, T. S. Eliot, and James Joyce. What marks
Crane, and "Voyages," as unique is Crane's belief that reviving the
Renaissance's rhetorical grandeur would serve <I>musical</I> ends. More
precisely, he held that poetry, if it wished to equal or surpass the
achievements of contemporary composers, would have to find original
ways of deploying the heaviest armaments available in the English
literary tradition. In one of his letters he speaks of the need to
"<I>ransack</I> the vocabularies of Shakespeare, Jonson, Webster
(for theirs were the richest)" if he is to be a "modern artist" on the
order of "Strauss, Ravel, Scriabine [sic], and Block [sic]" (OM, 137;
emphasis in original). "Voyages" is exhibit A of what Crane means by
"ransacking." Not only does it echo Renaissance verse, as I have already
asserted, but, as Lee Edelman has shown, it borrows pell-mell

<B></B>

from Renaissance texts. "Voyages" VI, for instance, shamelessly includes
phrases lifted from <I>The Tempest</I>, <I>Richard II</I>, and Milton's
<I>Samson Agonistes</I>.

 Throughout "Voyages," Crane so packs his verse with Elizabethan-esque
 diction, tone, and phrasing that, in passages such as the
 following, one seems to be reading a reckless cento of sixteenth- and
 seventeenth-century verse: "Shall they not stem and close in our own
 steps / Bright staves of flowers and quills today as I / Must first be
 lost in fatal tides to tell?" (<I>CP</I>, 37)

In lines such as these, the stylistic anachronisms come so thick and
fast that one is left uncertain whether to categorize these lyrics as
homage, parody, or pastiche. Crane seems to have in mind now one text,
now another, freely "ransacking" their vocabulary to craft his own idiom.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Voyages" does not aim to bring its Elizabethan crazy quilt into a
finished form. Instead, it delights in its half-intelligibility and its
inconsistencies. "Voyages" I, V, and VI appear to describe seaside scenes
whereas "Voyages" II-IV seem to describe actions taking place in or
under the open sea. The setting for the final two lyrics, however, is
too vague, too changeable for a critic confidently to characterize the
sequence as a circular narrative of journey out and return. The first
lyric, written in 1921, does offer a relatively straightforward Blakean
song of experience--it describes innocent children gamboling beside an
ocean symbolizing sexuality and death--but the next five "Voyages,"
all from 1924, are not so easily paraphrased. They recount hermetic
anecdotes about a visionary "I" and a sometimes-living, sometimes-dead
"you." This pair journeys among, or to, islands across, or within, a
"sceptered" goddess-ocean (<I>CP</I>, 35). Along the way, the pair seems
to consummate their passion twice ("Voyages" III, IV) as well as quarrel
("Voyages" V). These uncertain actions are submerged beneath a wildly
lush, recalcitrant linguistic surface:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From "region" to "wreathe," from "our" to "hour," from "portending"
to "port" to "portion," Crane's poetry slides associatively from one
aural echo into another. The verse can thus be said to progress "Madly
. . . logically," satisfying a reader's intuition, perhaps, but rarely
satisfying her or his rage for order.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Mystified by how to speak in generalities about such a disparate,
confusing, yet compelling compendium of lyrics, some critics, such as
R. W. B. Lewis, have thrown up their hands. Crane, Lewis writes in a
Pyrrhic retreat, gives us access to a "poetic utopia," "some boundless
domain of splendid un-reason where opposites consort and nameless forces
or disembodied pulsations dance out their uninterpretable allegory"
(<I>PHC</I>, 151). A few recent critics, like Lee Edelman and Eric
Selinger, have persevered, Edelman undertaking a deconstructive analysis
and Selinger a Kristevan reading.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Indeed, the language of "Voyages" II-VI is so inflated, so
 quintessentially, so memorably Crane at his best and worst, that the
 poetry does indeed invite readings that focus on the violence and
 queerness of its tropes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I would argue that, however fascinating the results, the recent
theoretically informed readings of "Voyages" have erred in presuming
that the lyrics follow a linear progression, that is, that they work
toward the solution of a philosophical, rhetorical, or generic problem.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 If, however, Crane deliberately avoids teleology and favors the creation
 of a timeless, ecstatic state, then "Voyages" VI should not be given
 greater weight than any of the other five lyrics. Each "Voyage" presents
 a window onto eternity. The circumstances, intensities, affect, and means
 of expression might vary, but the ultimate referent remains constant.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The love story everywhere perceptible in "Voyages," like that in John
Ashbery's <I>Three Poems</I> or in Roland Barthes's <I>Fragments d'un
discours amoureux</I>, has been broken up, rered, and transred
in such a way that one cannot say "it begins here" or that "it ends
here," let alone who the lovers are. Love is no longer an episode in
a biography but an ahistorical state and a way of speaking into which
the poet enters at will. He or she utters an "And yet!," as Crane does
to begin "Voyages" II, and escapes into a realm of artifice insulated
against the sound of time's chariot. In the workaday world Crane did,
of course, eventually break with Emil Opffer. That lover's plot played
itself out rather predictably, including a final round of betrayals and
angry recriminations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 <I>In the poem</I>, however, that love, purified of any specifics,
 persists, untainted by nostalgia or history, rendered as a procession
 of intensities that one can reexperience with each perusal. Crane
 treats his romance with Opffer in the same manner that he treated
 <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>. He could play selected bits <I>ad infinitum</I>
 and never fall prey to the deadening incursions of narrative.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The poem as an escape from time is an old idea. "And yet to times in
hope my verse shall stand / Praising thy worth, despite [time's] cruel
hand," Shakespeare concludes his sixtieth sonnet.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 Also old is the impulse to purify and elevate a particular

<B></B>

love into art by ridding it of any historical specificity. "One form shall
rise above the wreck / One name, Ianthe, shall not die," Walter Landor
writes in "Past Ruined Ilion," lines of verse whose fame and pathos in
no way depend upon concrete details about Ianthe's identity or physical
"form."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 What marks "Voyages" as new is the <I>way Crane writes</I>, which is
 recognizably the product of his mechanized/eroticized writing regimen. I
 will demonstrate this fact by looking closely at the grammar and lyrical
 texture of the most commented-upon of the "Voyages," the third.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Voyages" III perceptibly breaks down into fourteen discrete units, which,
following the precedent of classical oratory, I will call cola. The
logical and grammatical connections among Crane's cola vary widely in
stability and in coherency. I would divide the lyric according to the
following scheme.

Other divisions are possible. For instance, one could claim that two and
three or five and six ought to be considered indissoluble units; what
matters for my purposes is to make visible the process of <I>suturing</I>
that Crane has applied to relatively distinct statements treating a common
topic. Consider the second and third verse paragraphs. Cola 7 to 13 are
punctuated as if they were part of a cohesive sentence, yet this unity
is an illusion. Colon 7 is a participial phrase expressing completed
action. Colon 8 is a prepositional phrase giving a location. Cola 9
and 10 are parallel noun absolutes. Eleven is a subordinate clause, and
twelve, like seven, is a participial

<B></B>

phrase. Thirteen is another trailing noun absolute, unless, perhaps, one
construes "transmemberment" as the subject of this unwieldy sentence, with
an "is" elided. If so, anacoluthon seems to have occurred since colon
7. That is, "admitted" would seem, logically, to require the "I" from
colon 4 as its subject, not "transmemberment," in colon 13--although,
it must be conceded, one can hardly apply spatial or temporal logic
to a neologism like "transmemberment" since we can have only a vague,
contextual sense of what it means in the first place. Given these mounting
ambiguities, one must conclude that Crane has used punctuation marks
such as dashes and commas not to indicate cumulative development either
of syntax or argument but rather to <I>substitute</I> visual stitchery
for such progress.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The many gaps in the poem's syntax coexist with a remarkable degree of
self-sufficiency on the part of the individual cola. Colon 9--"Light
wrestling there incessantly with light"--is a particularly good
example. The phrase is rich in consonance (l's) and assonance (short e's
and i's). The caesura occurs naturally between the second and third feet,
but it also symmetrically divides the line into two three-word units.

<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG SRC="symbols/7.1reed01.gif">

<BR>
The same word, "light," begins and ends the colon, a classic gesture of
completion. Moreover, Crane concisely indicates time ("incessantly"),
place ("there"), agent ("light"), and action ("wrestle"). Colon 9 of
"Voyages" III possesses the inevitability of a hexameter by Racine. Each
of the other cola in the lyric likewise, if not so transparently, conveys
the impression of a self-contained rhetorical gesture, partly through
internal sound-play and partly by establishing enough coordinates (who,
what, when, where, why) that one feels confident projecting a context
within which the fragmentary utterance could belong. Each colon possesses
what R. W. B. Lewis calls Crane's "quality of encompassing finality"
(<I>PHC</I>, 404 n. 16).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Oddly, despite its "bad" grammar and its imperfect suturing of well-turned
phrases, "Voyages" III does not <I>feel</I> disjunctive. We have a general
sense of a maritime scene (even if the action seems to oscillate between
the surface of the sea and the ocean floor). Barely concealed literary
subtexts--Milton's "Lycidas" and Ariel's song "Full Fathom Five" from
<I>The Tempest</I>--provide some narrative purchase, too. We can guess
that "you" are undergoing a sea change, a "transmemberment," through the
agency of love and song. We can also conjecture that "I," like Orpheus or
Odysseus, have traveled through chthonic portals ("black swollen gates")
to witness this moment wondrous and strange. (We won't dwell on the fact
that "I" and "you," when last glimpsed in stanza one, seem to have been
swimming side by side.) Two formal features of the stanza reinforce these
impressions of the setting and dramatic action. First, the constant iambic
pentameter works as a catena that cuts across the syntactical ambiguities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 Second, the rich sound-play evident in each individual period spills
 across the sutures dividing them. Colon 9, for example, does not carry
 on the heavy alliteration of p's in colon 8, but it does seem to echo
 the stressed short e of "pediment," even as "lithe" reappears in a new
 guise, as "light." Crane's second, "sober," phase of poetry composition,
 during which he painstakingly revised and knit

<B></B>

together isolated phrases written during his "ecstatic" phase, results in
verse that <I>does</I> possess linkages and continuities, but these links
are haphazard, partial, nonlinear, and unpredictable, only half-obedient
to decorum and logic.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Yvor Winters first noted Crane's uncanny ability to appear to be writing
coherent verse when under inspection those verses would dissolve into
a sequence of unrelated, nonsensical assertions. Winters labeled this
feature of Crane's writing "pseudo-reference."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 It merits a less pejorative, more precise label that takes into
 account the <I>grammatical</I> basis for Crane's slipperiness. Much
 poetry criticism since Hugh Kenner's <I>The Pound</I> <I>Era</I> has
 explored the fact that the dominant mode of modernist experimentation
 with syntax is <I>paratactic</I>, that is, investigating the use of
 "and" or asyndeton to link successive clauses or other linguistic units.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 By juxtaposing disparate materials without logical or hierarchical
 connectives, parataxis increases writerly economy, semantic
 indeterminacy, and textual heterogeneity. Achieving results comparable
 to collage in the visual arts, the parataxis in works such as the
 <I>Cantos</I>, <I>Paterson</I>, and <I>The Maximus Poems</I> tends
 to break down generic distinctions by introducing nonpoetic, even
 nonliterary, material in a relatively nonprejudicial fashion. Crane's
 starkly different mode of syntactical experimentation could more
 properly be called attenuated hypotaxis. His cola in "Voyages" III are
 not discrete collage-nuggets nor are they items in a catalog strung
 together by conjunctions. Instead, "Voyages" III is made up of tenuously
 interconnected clauses (3, 4, 6, 11); participial phrases (5, 7, 12);
 prepositional phrases ; and noun absolutes (9, 10). Here as elsewhere,
 most everything in a Crane poem can be construed hypotactically, that
 is, as a series of grammatical units (cola) possessing some relation of
 subordination to another element. But Crane also blurs those connections
 and inhibits the formation of clear, neat, larger units. For example,
 in "Voyages" III the only two grammatically complete sentences (as
 opposed to faux-sentences indicated by punctuation) are cola 1 and 14,
 which serve primarily as bookends for the disorienting grammar-play
 between. Crane's verse explores the wide-open poetic terrain between
 complete disjunction and crystalline order.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The strangely centrifugal, disorderly syntax in "Voyages" was largely
unprecedented when <I>White Buildings</I> was first published. To such
contemporaries as Yvor Winters, Crane understandably appeared error-prone
and given to thoughtless gush.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 Experimental poetry since 1970, however, has proved Crane
 prescient. Among the many writers who have employed Crane-like attenuated
 hypotaxis are Robert Creeley, Larry Eigner, Lyn Hejinian, Tom Raworth,
 and Rosmarie Waldrop. Perhaps the poet whose anomalous syntax most
 resembles Crane's is John Ashbery. Ashbery habitually writes sentences
 that, like Crane's, refuse to add up linearly even as they convey the
 impression of "concatenation":

Although the verse texture here is somewhat smoother than Crane's--as
one might expect of a poet writing in the age of videotape and word
processors--Ashbery, in this extract from "A Wave," has employed a
process of suturing noticeably similar to Crane's.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 The "as" between cola 1 and 2 creates a link that violates the sequence
 of tenses ("you look" does not agree with "Would refresh"). Cola 3
 and 4 contain contradictory adverbial similes ("Like sliding up" and
 "like a bubble") modifying the same verb ("bursts"). Colon 6 is an
 ambiguous participle, perhaps a dangling modifier of "Toys," perhaps
 a modifier of "books." Colon 7 contains a pronomial subject, "this,"
 with no clear antecedent. Seven also switches to "us / All," after
 colon 2 had addressed "you," and colon 6 had mentioned "my hip." The
 cumulative effect of these connected-yet-disjunct phrases is readerly
 disorientation. Can I, you, or we all find stability in the swiftly
 altering landscape? Or do we accept flux itself as the grounds of "our"
 (non)identity?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The poet-critic Charles Bernstein has provided a name for the general
composition strategy evident in Crane and Ashbery: "dysraphism," the
Frankensteinian stitching together of disparate "embryonic" elements in
order to see if a viable poem develops.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 Dysraphic poets are dissatisfied with the limitations imposed by
 the rigors of collage. They do not wish to constrain their artistic
 activities to selecting, categorizing, and arranging found texts. They
 permit themselves to invent, borrow, rework, and suture whatever
 materials they wish, however they desire. They delight in asymmetry,
 non sequiturs, and shifts in tone. They are less interested in global
 features of a poem than in its local ones: the way specific statements
 connect (or fail to), the way certain series of sounds hit the ear,
 the way one feels rough and smooth textures as lines and phrases segue
 one into the other. Witnessing the procession of words, rent or whole,
 conveys much of the work's "meaning." Referentiality is secondary to
 the spectacle of what T. S. Eliot, writing about A. C. Swinburne, once
 called the spectacle of "language, uprooted."

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The world of Swinburne does not depend upon some other world which
it simulates; it has the necessary completeness and self-sufficiency
for justification and permanence. . . . [T]he object has ceased to
exist, because the meaning is merely the hallucination of meaning,
because language, uprooted, has adapted itself to an independent life
of atmospheric nourishment. . . . Only a man of genius could dwell so
exclusively and consistently among words as Swinburne.
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Eliot rightly downplays Swinburne's agency, an insight that applies
equally to the poets whom I have been discussing. "Language" and "words,"
not the writers in

<B></B>

question, possess "an independent life" within a "self-sufficient
world." These poets merely "dwell" in this "hallucinatory" linguistic
utopia. Poetry, for Swinburne's dysraphic descendants, opens out into an
"independent," that is, autonomous, realm that the poet, like a reader,
inhabits.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ashbery refers to this exploratory venture into the world of words by
using phrases like "just walking around," "skating," and, above all else,
"flow."
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 He implies that he, and the reader, must be ready to set aside
 predetermined goals in order to perceive the actuality and value of
 the verse as it ebbs and flows, courses and floods, in accordance with
 rhythms and laws that far exceed the compass of one person's reason or
 imagination. Crane, too, speaks of the deliberate cession of control
 that must precede the creation of poetry, and, like Ashbery, he uses a
 marine metaphor: "One must be drenched in words, literally soaked with
 them to have the right ones form themselves into the proper pattern at
 the right moment. When they come . . . they come as things in themselves;
 it is a matter of felicitous juggling!; and no amount of will or emotion
 can help the thing a bit" (<I>OM</I>, 72). Immersed in the currents
 of language as in the sea, the poet is ready to cede "will" and let
 "words come" and shape themselves "into the proper pattern." About
 "Voyages," Crane would later write, "the sea has thrown itself upon me
 and been answered" (<I>OM</I>, 187). These poets' persistent urge is
 to escape from the autonomous self into the free play of language. They
 drown so as to undergo "the silken skilled transmemberment of song."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The result is a synecdochal poetry. Its forms and verses are broken,
dismembered, unraveling, incomplete. We are to read each poem as a
maimed piece of an absent, ungraspable whole. Crane would call that whole
God. Ashbery, like most postmodern writers, is more circumspect in naming
this totality. He has used many words, each tested, then discarded. Among
his favorites have been "weather" and "diagram."
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 Regardless, in the variegated, uneven texture of a poem's
 phrase-suturing, in what Ashbery calls its "architecture of desire," a
 reader senses the dynamic gaps, leaps, and twists in grammar that lead
 not into the mind of a poet but outward, into possibility, into language.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 "Language has built towers and bridges," Hart Crane writes, "but itself
 inevitably is as fluid as always" (<I>CPSL</I>, 223). The "gates,"
 "pillars," and "pediments" that form in and from the sea in "Voyages"
 III are like Crane's verses, artifice brought forth from the "fluid,"
 indefinable reaches of the non-, in-, and superhuman potentiality of
 the word.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I began by stating that, as a consequence of the pioneering scholarship
of the 1990s, scholars of poetry would have to be much more careful about
discussing the aural dimension of a writer's work. My analysis of Crane
permits us to see why this is the case. In his otherwise brilliant piece
"Hart Crane and Poetry," for instance,

<B></B>

Allen Grossman makes the seemingly reasonable assumption that although
Crane's content and diction are insistently up-to-date, his rhetoric and
form are patently "antimodernist," indeed, "not fundamentally different
from those of Keats, Patmore, and Swinburne."
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 Grossman is surely correct that, at first glance, Crane's form does
 appear rather conservative for the 1920s. Instead of <I>vers libre</I>,
 he writes poetry with predictable accentual-syllabic meter, usually
 iambic tetrameter or pentameter. When not writing blank verse, he turns
 out orderly stanzas, often complete with end rhymes. One can sit down
 with a Crane poem and scan it just as one would a poem by Alexander
 Pope or Christopher Marlowe.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As we have seen, however, simple prosodic analysis cannot begin to
account for the role that sound plays in Crane's poetics nor can it be
relied upon to judge the "modernity" of his poetic form. Crane's basic
aural unit is not so much the foot or line as it is what I have been
calling a "colon," an individually composed, lapidary phrase. Regular
meter becomes a tool for mechanically stitching together disparate cola,
a centripetal force to counter the centrifugal force of the fractured
syntax. The result is, as Crane once put it, a "long-scattered score /
Of broken intervals" (<I>CP</I>, 160). When held up against the writers
that Grossman cites--John Keats, Coventry Patmore, Algernon
Charles Swinburne--Crane's "broken" verse <I>does</I> appear qualitatively
different. It often reads as if Keats's odes or Swinburne's paeans to the
Lady of Pain had been excerpted randomly, pared down, and strung together
with little regard to organic wholes or integral gestures. Which is, of
course, how Crane would have played Richard Wagner, C&eacute;sar Franck,
and his other nineteenth-century favorites on his Victrola: the choicest
excerpts strung together or repeated at whim.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
True, Crane's literary aspirations were somewhat <I>retardaire</I>
in comparison with the goals of such other American modernists as
Gertrude Stein and William Carlos Williams. Crane's quest to reveal
God in verse, for instance, deserves to be read in the context of the
<I>longue dur&eacute;e</I> of the lyric poem where one can compare
him to William Blake, Emily Dickinson, and Henry Vaughan, instead of
juxtaposing him with his more skeptical contemporaries. Crane's faith
that repetitious sound could lead one into mystic and physical transport
is positively shamanic, with many analogues in traditional oral poetries
practiced around the globe. The Victrola nonetheless inflected these
enduring themes in such a way that Crane's verse is indelibly a product
of a particular era, post-Edison but pre-LP. The Victrola therefore
marked every aspect of Crane's poetry as "modern": how he wrote, what
he wrote, and why he wrote. Crane's form <I>is</I> "modernist" insofar
as it represents an innovative transformation of older poetic models to
accord with 1920s realities.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I would like to close with a thought experiment: How might "Voyages"
differ if Crane had had access to a CD player and digitally remastered
works by his preferred composers? Would pushing buttons instead
of turning a Victrola's crank have changed his attitude toward the
materiality of poetry? Would being able to repeat <I>entire</I> pieces of
classical music have persuaded him to think differently about narrative
teleology? Alternatively, what if Crane had had access to music more in
line with his tenuously sustained <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I>-utopia, perhaps
1990s industrial and house music

<B></B>

with their ambient textural overlays, driving rhythms, and complete
disregard for melodic progression? I pose these questions because,
as I implied above by pairing "Voyages" with John Ashbery's "A Wave,"
Crane's strategies and style remain important touchstones for evaluating
contemporary writing. Many of the last few decades' most impressive long
poems--among them A. R. Ammons's <I>Sphere</I>, John Ashbery's <I>Flow
Chart</I>, Amiri Baraka's <I>Wise Why's Y's</I>, and Susan Howe's
<I>Articulation of Sound Forms in Time</I>--resemble Crane's <I>The
Bridge</I> in their epic ambition to transre American history. Such
digital-age efforts at poeticizing the United States deserve to be
thought through, as I have "Voyages," as historically specific responses
to their contemporary soundscape. Poets, after all, listen to the world
around them. Their verse records not only what they hear but how they
hear it. The job of the critic is to unpack the interdependency of that
"what" and "how" in the name of achieving a more accurate account of
the poetry, its genesis, and its significance.

Crane wrote this letter in 1922. Ravel's <I>Bol&eacute;ro</I> is from

would justify my use of Crane's quotation despite this anachronism 
because of its aptness (I believe, given his enthusiasm for Ravel's

One bit of support for this equation between these artists' "studios"
and Crane's working environment: in the early 1960s Andy Warhol hit upon
a painting regimen reminiscent of Crane's Victrola-sessions. "I had this
routine of painting with rock and roll blasting the same song, a 45 rpm,
over and over all day long--songs like . . . 'I Saw Linda Yesterday' by
Dickie Lee. The music blasting cleared my head out and left me working
on instinct alone" (Andy Warhol and Pat Hackett, <I>POPism: The Warhol

In thinking about the "energy" coursing through America's industrial
heartland in these years, contemplate the fact that Akron, in the year
before Crane moved there, had increased industrial output by twenty-five
percent. Crane's Ohio years coincide with one of the biggest industrial
expansions in world history--the kind of regional transformation that
would have made Soviet planners in the 1930s giddy to contemplate; see

Crane, significantly, anticipates by six decades the DJ revolt
of the 1980s and 1990s that Paul Gilroy analyzes in <I>The Black
Atlantic</I>. Like a hip hop DJ, Crane takes "the basic units of
commercial consumption in which music is fast frozen," and, through
"supplementary creative input," "transres" them, reasserting
individual aesthetic agency in the age of mechanical reproduction (Paul
Gilroy, <I>The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness</I>

beloved ("you," the ideal reader) toward a more general romance with
