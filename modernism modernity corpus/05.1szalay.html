When many millions of people all over the world demand security and
a state that must guarantee it, that's one thing. But when bowlers or
batsmen, responsible for an activity essentially artistic and individual,
are dominated by the same principles, then the result is what we have.

--C. L. R. James, "The Welfare State of Mind"
<!--_/attribution-->

<P>
In his State of the Union address of 1935, Franklin Roosevelt reaffirmed
his commitment before Congress and the American people to make it his
"first and continuing task" to provide for the "security of the men,
women and children of the nation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
Later that year, as he
signed the Social Security Act into law, he explained that the legislation
was a necessary response to the facts of the modern industrial world. A
national insurance plan like Social Security, designed to provide some
minimal form of protection from adverse contingencies that individuals
could neither anticipate nor control, was needed because "the civilization
of the past hundred years, with its startling industrial changes, has
tended more and more to make life insecure."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Acknowledging
that it was impossible to "insure one hundred percent of the population
against one hundred percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life,"
he nonetheless expressed the hope that Social Security would give "some
measure of protection to the average citizen."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>


<P>
Two years later, in his essay "Insurance and Social Change," Wallace
Stevens defended the Social Security Administration to his coworkers at
the Hartford Fire and Indemnity Company, 
<B></B> 
rebutting the claim that the
welfare-state incursion into insurance practice would fragment an already
diminished market. Stressing the fact that the private industry looked
to offer "insurance for everything," as opposed to the government's
"insurance for all," Stevens argued that federal insurance, far from
competing with private insurance, provided the precondition for the
latter's efforts to "perfect" insurance coverage. "To be certain of a
regular income, as in the case of social security," reasoned Stevens,
"is not the same thing as to be able to repair any damage, or to meet any
emergency."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Indeed it is only when Americans were certain of
a regular income that they could afford the "insurance for everything"
offered by the private industry.

<P>
Social Security was seen in this way to offer one solution to the
depression specter of "underconsumption," the notion that the nation's
economic troubles were traceable less to excessive industrial production
than to the failure of Americans to consume what was produced. "Insurance
and Social Change," however, also suggests a more literary solution to
the problem of underconsumption. According to Stevens, nothing stimulated
demand more than representing a product in its perfected form. Stevens
reasons, for example, that "it helps us to see [the value of] insurance
in the midst of social change to imagine a world in which insurance has
been made perfect" ("ISC," 234). He goes on to observe that H. G. Wells
revitalized the field of mechanical science in this manner, coyly noting
that "If Mr. Wells has preferred the machine to insurance as his field,
he has only left insurance to others" ("ISC," 234). Thus Wallace Stevens,
poet, makes his bid to be the H. G. Wells of insurance. But Stevens goes
farther still. In "Adagia" (1934-37), he claims not simply that
poetry might usefully represent the workings of perfect insurance, but
that it can actually perform them. "Poetry," he writes, "is a purging
of the world's poverty and change and evil and death."
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 This
statement doubles the assertion in "Insurance and Social Change" that
perfect insurance brings about "a world in which nothing unpleasant can
happen" and where "all our wishes . . . come true" ("ISC," 234). Indeed
given these criteria, one might reasonably argue that perfect insurance
could be found <I>only</I> in poetry: where else but in a poem could a
wish eliminate evil and death?

<P>
The suggestion that poetry might somehow "eliminate" evil and death,
however, was more likely to consign it to social irrelevance than
establish it as an active force in the mitigation of insecurity. Nothing
was more common throughout the 1930s, and more potentially damning, than
the claim that poetry provided a safe haven from the withering realities
of the depression, a place as insulated from want and suffering as the
shimmering worlds projected in the nation's movie theaters. Speaking
from a proto-Popular Front Left in the 1935 <I>New Masses,</I>
Stanley Burnshaw makes the scathing observation that "contemporary poets
. . . have all tramped off to some escapist limbo where they are joyously
gathering moonshine."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 At the other end of the political
spectrum, the southern Agrarian John Crowe Ransom in 1938 derides the
poet who invents "a private world where . . . injustice cannot be and
enjoy it as men enjoy their dream."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Bread lines called for
more than fantastical worlds, and Burnshaw and Ransom were just two
of many who felt that the depression made 
<B></B> 
unavoidable the differences
between security of an imaginative and a substantive financial kind.

<P>
Yet condemnations of inexcusably "private" retreats into the poetic
imagination do not so much undermine the analogy between Stevens's poetry
and insurance as explain why that relationship is constructed through a
defense of Social Security. It is in this respect crucial that Stevens
defends Social Security in "Insurance and Social Change" by insisting that
"perfect insurance" needed to take an unmistakably public form. Stevens
asks, for example, that we "Compare the man who, as an individual, insures
his dwelling against fire with that personality of the first plane who, at
a stroke, insures all dwellings against fire; and who, without stopping
to think about it, insures not only the lives of all those that live in
the dwellings, but insures all people against all happenings" ("ISC,"
234). The identity of this personality is left suggestively nebulous;
he seems at once Roosevelt, God, and a messianic poet turned insurance
provider. But whoever or whatever it is, Stevens's personality does
not retreat from the world into a private imagination. In fact, the
office this personality performs seems public precisely because it is
opposed to thought of any kind. Stevens's poetic corpus of the 1930s
and early 1940s opposes "stopping to think" to public action in just
this manner. Stevens's poetry persistently stages the substitution of
thought with the "impersonal" representation of social relationships;
hence his aphorism "People take the place of thoughts" ("A," 198). For
Stevens, then, insurance and poetry both supervene at the limits of
intentional agency; in his conception of both insurance and poetry, the
objectification of social relationships compensates for the fact that
no premeditated plan can ever make the future sufficiently secure.

<P>
"Insurance and Social Change" therefore marks the moment at which Stevens
comes to understand poetry as being importantly related to the necessarily
public activities of America's first welfare state, in particular to
the federal "insurance for all," Social Security, that has emerged as
the New Deal's most sacrosanct legacy. "We feel threatened," Stevens
notes at his first public lecture in 1936; "[w]e look from an uncertain
present toward a more uncertain future. One feels the desire to collect
oneself against all this in poetry as well as in politics."
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

Roosevelt would of course "collect" against the future in a strictly
economic sense: "We must begin now to make provisions for the future," he
declared during a Fireside Chat on 28 April 1935.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Nonetheless,
poetry and politics alike would after 1935 address themselves at a much
deeper level to structures of agency defined in relation to necessarily
imaginative invocations of the future.

<P>
"Relatively to a given human being," reasons Oliver Wendell Holmes in
<I>The Common Law,</I> "anything is accident which he could not fairly
have been expected to contemplate as possible . . . ."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>

Accidents have meaning, Holmes makes clear, only to the extent that
they mark a transgression of our imaginative capacities, our ability
to envision future states. It is in this context hardly surprising
that a poet as concerned with the imagination as Stevens would work in
close orbit to a government committed to providing for the future. The
suggestion that accidents are defined 
<B></B> 
only in relation to what cannot
be anticipated might lead to the conclusion that shoring up individual
agency meant expanding the individual's imaginative capacities such
that he could be able to anticipate all future contingency. Yet this
suggestion just as plausibly leads to the opposite conclusion, namely,
that individuals could protect themselves only by renouncing the value
of the imagination per se. Stevens, I have already suggested, reached
the latter conclusion. Thus his project of affixing the poetic to the
rising star of an increasingly interventionist government did not call for
the integration of life and art, nor did it make claims for the literal
outcomes poetry might effect. Far from a self-confident activism, the
insistence on the provision of security instead marked the outer limits
of federal as well as poetic agency; after 1935, welfare government and
poetry both would work to compensate, after the fact, for all they could
not imagine, for all they could not prevent.

<P>
Michael Denning notes in <I>The Cultural Front</I> that "the public
cultural apparatus was virtually invented by the New Deal."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

He explains, "The state sponsorship of writers, artists, theaters, and
musicians that began in the spring of 1935 under the Works Progress
Administration as relief from the present crisis became an attempt to
redefine American culture and to create a 'culture of democracy' by
establishing a bureaucracy that would provide 'culture' for the people"
(<I>CF,</I> 44). This culture of democracy is not Denning's primary
concern. Far from it; his book is instead devoted to demonstrating
the existence of a broadly conceived "cultural front" that was "not
simply New Deal liberalism" (<I>CF,</I> xvii). The Left during the New
Deal, he claims with equal anxiousness, was not simply "the product
of the new cultural apparatuses of the state and industry" (<I>CF,</I>
96). Thus <I>The Cultural Front</I> sets out to recover a substrata of
working-class radicalism, a "laboring of American culture" that remained
distinct from, and ultimately survived, New Deal liberalism. But beyond
the fact that he uses it as a foil for cultural-front radicalism, it
remains entirely unclear throughout what exactly Denning means by New
Deal liberalism. Denning's refusal to reveal the criteria that might
distinguish New Deal liberalism from a capaciously defined cultural
front turns out seriously to compromise his ability to understand the
public cultural apparatus the New Deal did in fact invent.

<P>
In what follows, I will insist that insofar as there was a coherent
New Deal liberalism, it was organized around not a nebulously conceived
culture of democracy, but what Roosevelt termed his "security legislation"
(<I>FDR,</I> 86). The Social Security Administration and the Works
Progress Administration in particular formed what he called a "new order
of things," of which "every major legislative enactment of . . . Congress
should be a component part" (<I>FDR,</I> 82, 83). The Federal Writers'
Project--part of this new order--supported more than seven thousand
writers at its peak in 1937. More importantly, by 1937, the project's
commitment to security had 
<B></B> 
produced an entirely new set of answers to
what John Dos Passos, writing on the nature of literary professionalism,
called "the whole question of what writing is."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>


<P>
The official New Deal answer to Dos Passos was implicit in the wage
structure that the Writers' Project offered: according to Harry
Alsberg, director of the project, writing could be secured from
economic contingency only when it was more a public activity subject
to regulation than a privately owned product. The weekly salary paid
writers for producing material they would never own and never have to
sell (usually between $20 and $30) made this unmistakably clear. Thus
when Richard Wright notes in "How Bigger Was Born" that "just as a man
rises in the morning to dig ditches for his bread, so I'd work daily
[writing <I>Native</I> <I>Son</I>]," his invocation of labor carries
a literal force that a phrase like "the laboring of American culture"
does not: Wright was working for a Writers' Project wage when he started
writing <I>Native Son,</I> a novel that would "strive to heighten the
consciousness of the [petty bourgeoisie] to all those progressive forces
making for security in American life."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Wright in fact was
on the federal payroll even <I>as</I> he was writing it, for he was a
member of the elite Creative Writers' Project, a unit of the Writers'
Project that paid writers to work on their own material (in this case
material that would comprise <I>Native Son</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>


<P>
Moreover, the rise of New Deal patronage led a broad contingent of
writers--including those who had not themselves been made "clients"
of the New Deal by working on the projects and those who were at best
ambivalently associated with the Left--to theorize the relation between
the specific modes of support used to enable writing and the aesthetic
criteria used to justify that support. Robert Frost's pre-New Deal
claim in "Build Soil, A Political Pastoral"  that "Thought product
and food product are to me / nothing compared to the producing of them"
left Burnshaw unsure of the poet's political affiliations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

The political commitment to writing as labor and the concomitant
generality of the antimarket sentiment that the lines convey could
not then be specified with any kind of accuracy.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 By 1935,
however, Ernest Hemingway's antithetical and quintessentially modernist
claim that his writing was something "round and whole and solid" could
be understood as inseparable from his often scathing criticism of the WPA
and the salary it provided its workers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Hemingway's relation
to the New Deal can be most successfully elaborated through his aesthetic
convictions; Hemingway would repeatedly make clear that his writing was
above all else an artifact, and in "The Snows of Kilimanjaro" and <I>To
Have and Have Not</I> this artifact is shown not only to be impervious
to the woundings that plague the characters, but finally to be more
resilient to unexpected change than any person putatively secured by
the New Deal.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>


<P>
But even Frost's "Build Soil," first delivered during the primaries
for the 1932 presidential election, provides a compelling example of
how "security legislation" ideas inflected, <I>avant la lettre,</I>
modernist efforts at poetic self-definition. Modeled on Virgil's "First
Eclogue," the poem takes as its subject the social obligations incurred
with different forms of literary patronage: should the poet Tityrus,
the poem asks, somehow address in his poetry the impoverishment of his
peer 
<B></B> 
Meliboeus, who is struggling at self-employment? Unlike Meliboeus,
both Virgil's and Frost's Tityrus draw their respective wages from
public institutions meant to secure them from the market: Virgil's
from the Roman state, and Frost's from a university poets-in-residence
program (presumably like the one at which Frost himself was then
employed).
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>


<P>
In both Virgil's and Frost's pastorals, Tityrus is asked for help by
the farmer Meliboeus; in both he refuses the plea for assistance. In
"Build Soil," Tityrus tells the suffering farmer that the only revolution
available is a "one man revolution":

<P>
Thus even though Frost seems to champion something like Social Security
when he writes elsewhere that it is "Better to go down dignified / With
boughten friendship at your side / Than none at all," Tityrus claims
that poetry is most valuable in its ability to counterbalance the
forms of interpersonal association that programs like Social Security
demanded.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 "We're too unseparate out among each other" insists
Tityrus, and we are meant to believe that poetry, imagined as a private
form of nonmarketed labor, compensates for this fact ("BS," 324).

<P>
It is of course not clear how this advice helps Meliboeus, particularly
because Tityrus's refusal to take his thought product to market is
not private in any clear sense--on the contrary, it is underwritten
by a salary unavailable to Meliboeus. Meliboeus therefore concludes
the poem by ironically paraphrasing Tityrus's incoherence, stating that
"going home / From company means coming to our senses" ("BS," 325). If a
reassuring poetic retreat from a threatening reality is a familiar theme
in pastoral, then so is the pronominal oscillation that here confuses the
isolate with the collective.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 What does it mean, for instance,
that "we" come to "our" senses only when "we" are most alone? In what
respect does the often conflicted movement to collective pronouns that
marks pastoral generally and Frost's poem specifically alter Tityrus's
claim that poetry is the last bastion against the eroding of private and
autonomous experience? These questions point to what recent critics have
seen as the defining problematic in New Deal writing. One critic argues
that James Agee's <I>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</I> (the preeminent New
Deal pastoral) "is a product of the Great Depression, which," he insists,
"still occupies a mythic place as the moment when irrepressible private
suffering publicly marked a faltering of capitalism." This critic then
goes on to note how the work "replicate[s] the antinomies of private
and public as a tension between artistic independence and corporate
patronage."
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 In this account independence seems to mean
privacy, and we are meant to understand that the history of art since
the New Deal has been the history of art's 
<B></B> 
betrayal at the hands of
government and corporate modes of patronage antithetical to that privacy.

<P>
This kind of nostalgia for "artistic independence" misses entirely the
significance of those formal and stylistic developments brought about by
the rise of both state and corporate patronage--misses, in other words,
the transformations undergone by American modernism as it impacted with
the New Deal. Stevens's poetry in particular does not dramatize the
<I>antagonism</I> between private independence and public support so much
as it demonstrates how the rise of corporate patronage facilitated and
was perfectly consistent with a relocation of poetic interest, already in
progress, from the private "I" to the public "we." Stevens will show what
is implicit in Frost's poem, namely that valuing literary labor at the
expense of the literary artifact is significant not because it enables a
private retreat from the market but because it relocates the poetic domain
from private experience to public paradigms that authenticate experience
in the process of making it reproducible. Alsberg would proudly declare
that his project provided writers with a form of collective and impersonal
artistic labor unavailable since the late Middle Ages, suggesting in
this way a necessary relation between the project's employment structure
(writers would punch a clock on group projects that rarely bore their
names) and the value of the work it produced. Modernist impersonality
would loom large in Stevens's work as well; he declares in "Adagia" that
"Poetry is not a personal matter" ("A," 189), and would use his own
source of income--the insurance company--to understand the ways in which
the regulation of objectified social relationships enabled rather than
threatened the sanctity and security of the individual, both in poetry
and business.

<P>
All insurance practice, private or public, poetic or political, aggregates
social relationships. Before any insurance practice becomes concerned
with the ways it will sell its product to individual persons, it works
to understand those persons in terms of population groups. The category
of risk in particular identifies the frequency with which a given
outcome will occur in a generalized target group. Actuarial science in
this manner calculates the probability of specific outcomes occurring
in specific populations. But in fact, risk is not predictive for the
individual at all, for while it might make sense to say, based upon past
calculations, that thirty percent of all adult males in a given test
group will be in at least one automobile accident before they are forty
years old, it does not make sense to say that there is a thirty-percent
risk that a given adult male within that group will have an automobile
accident before that age. "Risk is collective," explains Fran&ccedil;ois
Ewald. "Whereas an accident, as damage, misfortune and suffering, is
always individual, striking at one and not another, a risk of accident
affects a population. Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as an
individual risk."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>


<P>
The point here is that an insurance practice is able to order and
systematize what seem to be random events by studying those events as
they occur in population groups. In "The Vice of Gambling and the Virtue
of Insurance" , George Bernard Shaw asks, "how is it possible to
budget for solvency in dealing with matters of chance? The answer is that
when dealt with in sufficient numbers, matters of 
<B></B> 
chance become matters of certainty."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 As Shaw goes on to explain, insurance is used
to account for events in their most public and generalizable form, and
as such is relatively uninterested in the irreducibly private dimensions
of personal experience. This is why, for example, insurance is of such
interest to a thinker like Michel Foucault. Foucault sees insurance as
insistently, almost coercively, collective and consequently identifies it
as one of the principle mechanisms through which the modern state manages
population groups.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 It is crucial to insurance practice
that it "secure" the population group more than any one individual
within it. Insurance cannot guarantee that individuals do not experience
accidents, and the indemnification it offers is never an exact substitute
for the loss incurred in any given experience. Instead, insurance
guarantees that one person's experiences will not be transferred to others
as a loss (when, for example, an insured individual is able to continue to
meet his financial obligations after a work-stopping injury). Insurance
underwrites, as Stevens puts it, "a world in which nothing unpleasant
can happen," not by somehow insulating private experience from public
reality, but by relocating the social significance of experience from
the private and the subjective to the public and the transferable.

<P>
Frost's phrase "boughten friendship" is useful here, for it exemplifies
how insurance transforms relations once thought to be the product of a
private proclivity into generalizable economic relations newly dependent
upon the "interpersonal" nexus Frost's Tityrus so despises. Stevens's
third-person lyric achieves this same interpersonality, for it shifts
poetic identification from inner experience to objectifications of
the social never reducible to any one person's experience. Indeed
Stevens brings to the fore the actuarial nature of his poetry in a poem
explicitly about the transition from a first-person voice committed to
the "private" imagination to a more scientific means of representing
public relationships.

<P>
Reviewing Stevens's <I>Ideas of Order,</I> Burnshaw claims in 1935 that
in "The Idea of Order at Key West," "contradictory notions" produce
a poem in which "uncertainties are unavoidable."
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 When
later asked the perceived source of that uncertainty, Burnshaw answered
that the middle-class and politically unaffiliated Stevens was "unable
to make alliance with what we considered to be the forces that would
make things better."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 But Stevens does very specifically
refer to a compensatory mechanism designed to "make things better"
(insurance) when he insists to his editor just after this review that
"in 'The Idea of Order at Key West' life has ceased to be a matter of
chance."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Stevens explains his comment by noting, "it may
be that every man introduces his own order into the life about him and
that the idea of order is simply what Bishop Berkeley might have called
a fortuitous concourse of personal orders. But still there is order"
(<I>L,</I> 293).

<P>
It is not immediately clear what it means for chance to be replaced by a
"<I>fortuitous</I> concourse of personal orders." If the elimination
of chance is "fortuitous"--and not the result of the personal agency
gestured to in the phrase "every man introduces"--then in what respect
has chance been eliminated? Stevens's comment, however, 
<B></B> 
makes perfect sense in the context of the actuarial science just discussed: to recall
Shaw, "when dealt with in sufficient numbers, matters of chance become
matters of certainty." What appears fortuitous to one person is, from
a more totalized perspective, part of a predictable pattern; as one
economist explains insurance, whereas "individuals may face uncertainty
. . . society can face approximate certainty."
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 As I will
show below, "The Idea of Order" depends upon this move from the isolated
individual to the population group, which is why Stevens can explain
the elimination of chance in that poem with the simple but authoritative
assertion, "But still there is order": chance becomes probability--becomes
calculable--the moment that a set of what at first seem to be discrete
accidental events takes on a recognizable pattern if viewed at the level
of an entire population. Paradoxically, life becomes a matter of risk
when it "ceases to be a matter of chance." Stevens's desire to collect
oneself against uncertainty consequently emerges here with a literal
force: uncertainty is eliminated when individuals are "collected" into
population groups impersonal enough to turn chance into probability,
impersonal enough to warrant Stevens's third-person lyric. That Frost,
committed as he was to the inviolate privacy of the poetic experience,
should write to Burnshaw at this time that "it was chance when the right
subject matter and the right words came together" is in this context
not surprising:
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 looking "inside in," a poetic devoted to
the private will invariably experience as accidental those events that,
seen from a totalizing perspective, constitute the most perfect of orders.

<P>
If Frost had reason to associate his job at a university writing program
with more overt modes of government employment, Stevens, who had been
made vice president of Hartford Fire and Indemnity in 1934, had even
more reason to believe he was working for a corporation that was in
many respects indistinguishable from the New Deal. This was viable in
part because by 1935 Roosevelt had made the New Deal stand or fall on
its ability to provide security. More importantly, the modes of social
organization intrinsic to insurance provided the pattern for many of
the New Deal's economic and social programs. Long before the New Deal,
the insurance company had offered the preeminent model for what would
come to be called the welfare state: Oliver Wendell Holmes remarks in
1881, for instance, that "[t]he state might conceivably make itself a
mutual insurance company against accidents, and distribute the burden
of its citizens' mishaps among all its members. There might be a pension
for paralytics, and state aid for those who suffered in person or estate
from tempest or wild beasts."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 However fanciful this proposal
might have seemed to Holmes, it usefully demonstrates how easily private
insurance practice did in fact become public. Indeed by 1939, a novelist
like Josephine Herbst refused to distinguish between private and public
forms of insurance: she writes that the New Deal had entered into a
"conspiracy" with the insurance company; "as long as <I>this government
<B></B> 
exists,</I>" a character exclaims in her <I>Rope of Gold,</I> insurance
is the one basic reliable investment."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>


<P>
For Herbst, to be committed to insurance was in some sense already to
be committed to the New Deal. Just as the private insurance industry
promised security in its ability to extend to its clients an artificial
and financially defined family, Roosevelt's security legislation promised
a form of "boughten friendship" as a function of American citizenship
itself. To the extent that modern life left the individual unable to plan
or effect his future, Roosevelt offered him security by facilitating and
regulating his access to those resources at the disposal of an officially
sanctioned national-population group. "A million persons organized as a
state can do things that cannot be dared by private individuals," notes
Shaw, things that "no private company can do."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>


<P>
In the years leading up to the establishment of the Social Security
Administration and the WPA, however, it seemed that an interventionist
state might do more than simply provide for individual security. At
first, the acknowledgment that the individual is unable to cause or even
foresee the conditions of his economic existence led to the hope that
government might secure for itself the agency unavailable to individual
persons. During the early years of the New Deal (1933-35), public
opinion overwhelmingly supported the pooling of more than financial
resources; it supported, that is, a form of national planning that
would locate in government the capacity for intentional agency that the
uncertainty of modern life was seen to threaten. The desire for economic
centralization, which gave the state the power not to ameliorate the
effects of economic downturns but to direct the course of the economy
such that there would be no downturns, resulted in what Frank Warren has
called "an apotheosis of the idea of planning, in which planning became
almost synonymous with liberalism."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>


<P>
Thus whereas Soviet and German economies--both committed to national
planning--turned to an increasingly authoritarian centrism, the New
Deal's "associational" economy, orchestrated by the National Recovery
Administration (NRA), was sold as the culmination of democratic
representation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 "There is nothing complicated about it,"
Roosevelt declared of the NRA during a Fireside Chat. "It goes back to
the basic idea of society and of the nation itself that people acting
in a group can accomplish things which no individual acting alone could
even hope to bring about" (<I>FDR,</I> 65). But the NRA was seen to
articulate and organize more than collective accomplishments, more even
than collective hopes. "The social will," noted Rexford Tugwell while
presenting his case for what would shortly thereafter become the NRA,
"is a vague and elusive thing, difficult to apprehend, more difficult
to pin down to specific issues."
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 "Governments," however,
"presumably, are expressions of [the] social will. That is their excuse
for being."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Thus the plans formulated by the NRA were sold
as the product of a national collectivity: Roosevelt would describe the
NRA as a brain trust of macro-economic proportions. During the years
leading up to the dismantling of the NRA in 1935, Roosevelt described
the New Deal as "the public's government" because it articulated nothing
less than the public will (<I>FDR,</I> 128). <B></B>

<P>
According to Walter Lippmann, any endeavor like the NRA was doomed from
the start, not because Roosevelt's economic council would ignore the
public's will, but because the public did not have a will. In <I>The
Phantom Public</I> , Lippmann, responding in large part to
Herbert Hoover's repeated corporate-liberal invocations of the public
interest, insisted that a public was not a person, and that there was
no meaningful sense in which a public could be said to have interests,
let alone intentional agency. Intentional agency dissolved during the
move from the individual to the public; there was, he claimed, only a
virtual and impersonal public, one that by definition could not formulate
designs. "A mere phantom," "an abstraction," the public was not "a fixed
body of individuals," and therefore could never "direct . . . the course
of events."
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>


<P>
Lippmann's claim that a collective entity like the public could
only mistakenly be conceived of as an agent would become recast as a
central criticism of the welfare state in the hands of a laissez-faire
conservative like Ayn Rand. In <I>Atlas Shrugged</I> , her
libertarian <I>&Uuml;bermensch</I> John Galt hijacks a radio broadcast
from a band of aging New Dealers and speaks to a captive audience: "The
good, say the mystics of muscle, is Society--a thing which they define as
an organism that possesses no physical form, a super-being embodied in no
one in particular and everyone in general except yourself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

But as Rand would insist again and again, "Mankind is not an entity,
an organism, or a coral bush."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 There was no sense in
which one could attribute intention of any kind to a collective. Howard
Roark, the modernist hero of <I>The Fountainhead</I> , Rand's most
explicitly anti-New Deal polemic, puts this most simply during the
trial at the close of the novel. Roark stands accused of blowing up a
government housing project that he designed, but that has been altered
by others. "The mind is an attribute of the individual," Roark explains:

<P>
For Roark, as well as for Rand, the welfare state rested on the faulty
premise that public, collective groups could perform those functions
reserved for private, necessarily singular persons. In this instance,
Rand's caricature was not without its basis. In <I>Liberalism and
Social Action</I> , a defense of an "organized social control of
economic forces," John Dewey claimed that the state "has to assume the
responsibility for making it clear that intelligence is a social asset,
and is clothed with a function as public as its origin."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>


<P>
On the other hand, John Maynard Keynes's <I>General Theory of Employment,
Interest, and Money</I> , perhaps the most important influence on
the future of the American welfare state, made clear in economic terms
that intelligence was not a social asset, particularly in the case of
nationally planned economies. National planning, 
<B></B> 
Keynes reasoned, had
embraced the faulty proposition that the state's involvement in the
economy needed to proceed by refining technologies of representation,
by deciding how successfully to personify and so represent collective
agency, by deciding how a board, a president, or even an entire government
might think and plan for the larger totalities they represented. Keynes,
however, argued that there had been "a fundamental misunderstanding of
how . . . the economy in which we live actually works," and maintained
that personifying groups did not address the fact that there was no way
for groups, or the persons they were made to resemble, to intend the
economies they comprised.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>


<P>
Moreover, Keynes maintained that like individual persons and
collectivities, government had no significant intentional agency in
matters of economy.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 The organic complexity of economies
meant that no government plan, however comprehensive, could anticipate or
account for economic contingencies as they developed. Keynes would argue,
for example, that a traditional actuarial calculus could never accurately
measure probability in questions of macro-economics--the government,
for example, could never foresee exactly how many unemployed would
need each month to claim unemployment benefits from the Social Security
Administration.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Thus he argued that continual regulation of
fiscal and monetary policy was necessary because the international nature
of the modern economy guaranteed that government could never anticipate
or stabilize the contexts in which it would execute its plans. In fact,
Keynes saw the controlled circulation of money as the consummate means of
addressing the inherently uncertain nature of modern economies, writing
with emphasis that <I>"the importance of money essentially flows from
its being a link between the present and the future"</I> (<I>GT,</I>
293). Thus while governments did not know what was done with the money
they regulated, money remained one of the only traceable lineaments
connecting governmental actions and their outcomes.

<P>
The legislators of the world, acknowledged and unacknowledged both, were
retrenching, for the 1930s and 1940s would find Stevens fascinated with
these same issues, such that he could claim, for example, to be interested
in what he called "up to date capitalism" (<I>L,</I> 292), a claim that
might begin to explain his famously cryptic proclamation that "Money is
a kind of poetry" ("A," 191).
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 This assertion seems to find
Keynesian explanation in "The Pleasures of Merely Circulating," as well
as in <I>Owl's Clover,</I> where the injunction "To live incessantly
in change" is enabled by the command "turn / Your backs upon the vivid
statue."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Stevens would in fact take this opposition into
the concluding cantos of "Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction" , where
he contrasts the civic aggressions of an architect and sculptor who
"builds capitols" and "establishes statues of reasonable men" to the
intrinsically poetic song of a robin.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Whereas the sculptor
attempts to impose an artifactual order of his own making on a public
world, the robin produces art in the simple process of singing. In this
way the public circulation of money that funds the sculptor is transformed
into a poetic commitment to circulation as such, for the robin's songs

<P>
Here, then, is one context in which to understand the poem's edict
"It Must Change" ("NT," 389). Poetry--like an act of establishing, but
unlike the statue that is finally established--is thus conceived of as
"[a]n occupation, an exercise, a work."

<P>
The idea that circulation could itself become an aesthetic value was
far from the mind of a writer like Anzia Yezierska when she declared
of her experience on the Federal Writers' Project that "every day it
became harder to blind ourselves to the cold fact that we, like the
privy-builders and road-makers of other public projects, were being paid,
not for what we did, but to put money into circulation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>

Yezierska, the author of successful novels that had become still more
lucrative when they were made into films, refused to imagine herself a
wage laborer. Stevens, however, would cannily suggest that the commitment
to producing a literary artifact (as opposed to simply circulating)
opened one up to precisely the uncertainty both he and the Writers'
Project were committed to protecting against. <I>Owl's Clover,</I>
for example, does more than simply relocate poetic value from the
artifact to a process of making--it associates the fixity of the statue
with the inevitable uncertainty of how others respond to it. Richard
Wright, veteran of the Writers' Project, claims that he doesn't care
if either critics or consumers decide whether "<I>Native Son</I> is a
good book or a bad book" because "the mere writing of it will be more
fun and a deeper satisfaction than any praise or blame from anybody"
(<I>N,</I> 540). Hence Wright, dubbing writing "a significant kind of
living" (<I>N,</I> 535), absolves writing from the unpredictability of
consumption in much the same way that Keynesian theory, committed to the
ongoing regulation of monetary and fiscal policy, absolves governments
from having to anticipate future economic contingencies. Indeed neither
author nor government could anticipate the whims of the consumer. Thus
whereas the second stanza of <I>Owl's Clover</I> begins, "So much the
sculptor had foreseen," the third stanza represents a consumer of the
statue that the sculptor "had not foreseen," in this way explaining why
poetry might want to hypostatize the regulated circulation of money and
commit to the trope of continuous labor.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>


<P>
But Keynesian economics provides more than an homology for Stevens's
substitution of a "going round // And round and round" for artifactual
art, for Keynes would argue as early as 1936 that government
spending on the arts was an ideal way 
<B></B> 
to put federal money into public
circulation. Keynes was in fact the first head of Britain's Council for
the Encouragement of Music and Arts, established in 1941, and later
founded and ran the British Arts Council. Like the New Deal's Arts
Projects, both organizations would work to implement his claim, made in
1936, that the performative arts in particular were ideal recipients of
government spending. In "Art and the State," Keynes reasons that

It was of course the aim of Keynesian economics to demonstrate that this
hypothetical common man could not meaningfully imagine himself part of
a community able to affect the economy. But if collective agency was
dead, the common man might receive art in its stead. The artist, Keynes
reasons, in need of "economic security and enough income" ("AS," 372),
would thus become the "servant of the public" ("AS," 372), an expressive
vehicle for what by his own account cited above was a mostly fictive
"spirit" ("AS," 374), when his art was at its most "ephemeral" ("AS,"
374). Artists, as well as "architects and engineers," might in this way
"embody the various imagination . . . of peaceful and satisfied spirits"
("AS," 374). The reflexive and placating moment of performance, he
declared, was "an immortal function of the state, an art of government
regarded at most times as essential" ("AS," 373).

"Whose spirit is this?" asks the speaker of "The Idea of Order at Key
West" as he and a companion observe a singing woman walking by the side
of a raging sea, and become interested in the relation between her song
and the sea's motions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 Does the singer orchestrate the sea
with her voice, or is she a more passive poetic device, an objective
correlative meant to "embody the various imagination . . . of peaceful
and satisfied spirits"? Or is the raging sea an entirely natural force,
beyond the control of any imagination?

<P>
However these questions are answered, it is clear that the poem, in its
relentless quest to locate the origins of order and in its opposition,
fundamental to modern political theory, between the natural and the
social, speaks in potentially expansive registers. "Order has to be
created," Keynes insisted, "It is not natural."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 There was,
he maintained, no systemic genius; laissez-faire could in the end lead
only to what "The Idea of Order at Key West"--seeming to compare waves
to stockmarkets--will call "meaningless plungings" ("IO," 129). Stevens
raises the possibility of such analogies when he notes on the jacket
cover of <I>Ideas of Order</I> that "We think of changes 
<B></B> 
occurring
today as economic changes, involving political and social changes. Such
changes raise questions of political and social order." "[I]t is
inevitable" he continues, "that a poet should be concerned with such
questions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>


<P>
If <I>Ideas of Order</I> reveals this concern, then the poem "The Idea
of Order at Key West" does so even more pointedly. The year Stevens
wrote the poem, 1934, saw the high-water mark in a federal and state
publicity campaign that held Key West up as the perfect encapsulation
of the early New Deal. The Roosevelt Administration lauded Key West as
"an illustration" and "model" of the goals of its work-relief programs;
the town was declared "New Deal Town" as newspapers across the country
followed Roosevelt's lead in associating the isolated island with the
possibilities of a federally orchestrated economic recovery.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>

Liberal intellectuals were just as sanguine. "In that isolated microcosm
you could study the whole issue of disinterested collective planning
versus interested private enterprise," writes Elmer Davis of Key West in
1935. This leads him to conclude with grandeur that Key West had become
nothing less than "the New Deal in miniature."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>


<P>
This was the case, Davis reasoned, because "City and county had
surrendered their powers, via the Governor, to experts from Washington
backed by Federal funds" in their efforts to rebuild Key West after it was
devastated by a hurricane in 1934 ("NW," 641). By July 1934, Julius Stone,
the ranking Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) officer in
Florida, had assumed control of the town and began disbursing the $935,000
the FERA would spend on the now-stranded island in its first year alone.

<P>
But for Davis, Federal Relief had done more than save Key West; it had
transformed it into something of an intellectual hot-house: "It was
Greenwich Village, Montparnasse, Provincetown--on a little tropical
island" ("NW," 648). The hot topics, however, were not those that had
characterized other centers of modernist bohemia; Davis claims that
"groups of men and women" would sit up "till two A. M. discussing problems
of administrative technique, and having as good a time as they would
have had at the nightclubs" ("NW," 649). "The dominant interest," Davis
explains of these discussions, was "the application--however hampered
and unsuccessful--of the trained and disinterested intelligence to
the problems of collective welfare" ("NW," 649). This celebration of
"administrative technique" and those "disinterested intelligences" who
would perfect it is cause for suspicion as well as for marvel, for Davis
laments that if the New Deal "had got started earlier, the rehabilitation
of Key West would have been a really collective enterprise; now it cannot
help looking to many people like something imposed by outside authority"
("NW," 650). Thus we are left, Davis concludes, with "a picture of a
group of intelligent men and women applying their intelligence (under
whatever handicaps, with however limited success) to the problems of a
community which could not save itself" ("NW," 652).

<P>
The imposition of order "by outside authority" on a "community which could
not save itself" speaks directly to "The Idea of Order at Key West"'s
organizing question--"Whose spirit is this?" But it is the opposition
Davis sets up between the civic planning of administrative experts and
a planning that might "have been a really collective 
<B></B> 
enterprise" that
speaks most directly to the poem, which is meant precisely to moot the
opposition between these two alternatives, both of which presume that
human agents impose order on the world through constructive imaginative
acts. Key West was the New Deal in miniature for Stevens as well as for
Davis, but the insurance executive saw what the future head of the Office
of War Information did not, namely that welfare government would be felt
most powerfully not in the worlds it built, but in the provisions it
made for its inevitable failure to secure those worlds from the hazards
of the unforeseen.

<P>
"The Idea of Order" is most explicitly about the difficulty of discerning,
let alone controlling, the causes of events. The lines of influence
between woman and sea are next to impossible to discern, as when the
speaker notes that "The song and water were not medleyed sound / Even if
what she sang was what she heard, / Since what she sang was uttered word
by word" ("IO," 128). Amid the qualification, the words seem to utter
themselves, lending force to the ambiguous phrase at the beginning of
the stanza, "No more was she" ("IO," 128).

<P>
But if this phrase suggests the irrelevance of the individual agent
in the face of sublime, natural forces, the speaker's desire to know
"Whose spirit is this?" continually searches for an intentional agent as
the source of what he sees. The relentless personification in the poem
is perhaps the most telling sign of the speaker's efforts to locate this
agency. The sea is produced as a personification ("the ever-hooded, tragic
gestured sea" ["IO," 129] has a "genius" ["IO," 128], a "body" ["IO,"
128], "sleeves" ["IO," 128], and a "dark voice"["IO," 129]) precisely
so the speaker can treat it as a potentially intentional agent equal to
the singer. Genius and body, however, are not interchangeable aspects
of personhood; rather, the former designates the capacity to control and
direct the latter. Thus the sea is least like an intentional agent when
the speaker notes that "the water never formed to mind or voice, / Like
a body wholly body" ("IO," 128).

<P>
Similar mind-body dualisms pervade Stevens's writing: the possibility
that a genius or spirit--like Lippmann's phantom or Rand's society, an
"organism that possesses no physical form"--might transcend and intend an
otherwise inhibiting physical world is wholly consonant with the utopic
vision in "Insurance and Social Change" of a "perfect insurance" under
whose aegis all wishes instantly become reality. More specifically, in
"Surety and Fidelity Claims" , his only other surviving essay on
insurance, Stevens imagines an insurance agent whose body vanishes into
his work as a result of his ability to guarantee plans: the surety agent,
who provides bonds guaranteeing the fulfillment of contracts, "finds it
difficult sometimes to distinguish himself from the papers he handles
and comes almost to believe that he and his papers constitute a single
creature, consisting principally of hands and eyes: lots of hands and
lots of eyes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 As pure interpersonal, communicative facility
(with hands, eyes, and a body of text), Stevens's agent guarantees the
elimination of chance and the fulfillment of contract by dispossessing
himself of the bulk of his body. This is the panacea of national planning:
a vision of the private imagination gone public, 
<B></B> 
the beginnings of a
truly collective agency enabled by minds acting and thinking together
in spite of all physical demarcation.

<P>
It is, however, a panacea "The Idea of Order" will dismiss. The fourth
stanza in particular makes clear that the difficulty of the question
"Whose spirit is this?" is that bodies and voices designate the only
recognizable markers of human identity and agency. Lippmann's public
and Keynes's spirits are in the end impotently passive precisely because
they are abstract entities. Likewise for Stevens, if spirit is completely
disembodied, it becomes invisible and potentially manifold, difficult to
identify and understand as a coherent intentional force. In the fourth
stanza the speaker is thus unable to locate any origin for the cacophony
of voices he hears--without any one body, spirit seems to transcend the
sum of its sources:

efforts to imagine one mind capable of serving as a cause for the tumult
before him.

What follows at first seems a typical compensatory gesture designed
to consolidate the autonomy and cognitive powers of the isolate and
intentional mind. Almost inexplicably, the speaker now appears to accord

At first glance, these assertions seem successfully to mitigate the
sublime excess to which the speaker just bore witness. Yet this is at
best an ambivalent moment of compensation, 
<B></B> 
for it insists upon the
necessarily hermetic nature of the imaginative powers conceded the
singer. The seemingly definitive claim "She was the single artificer
of the world" is qualified by the enjambed phrase "In which she sang,"
suggesting that the world in which the singer sings is not necessarily
the same as the world in which the speaker moves. The claim made in the
stanza's final two lines similarly allows a world-constructing agency at
the moment that it signals the singer's potential alienation by qualifying
the parameters of her world. Indeed the qualifying "for her" looms large
in a line that sets off the claim for world-making with the assertion
of the social "we" speaking the poem: "Then <I>we,</I> / As <I>we</I>
beheld her striding there alone, / Knew" (emphasis added).

Still searching for an agent--still, that is, unable to answer the
question "Whose spirit is this?"--the speaker tentatively attributes
agency to synthetic as opposed to natural phenomena, such that "the lights
in the fishing boats" have "Mastered the night and portioned out the sea."

<P>
The rationalized and geometric nature of the civic displaces as well an
expressive privacy that stands in opposition to the public of two that
observes the singer. Subject to the sustained critical observation of
two male viewers, it is her mind, not her body, that most forcefully
registers the singer's isolation from the social, and her concomitant
intimacy with the natural. Throughout the 1930s Stevens would dissociate
the intentional mind from public order--he writes in "Adagia" that "The
poet represents the mind in the act of defending <I>us</I> against itself"
("A," 199; emphasis added). After noting that "The mind is not equal to
the demands of oratory, poetry etc." ("A," 200), he goes on to declare
that "Poetry is a cure of the mind" ("A," 201). Hence the prevalent
critical conviction that in Stevens the mind is most suspect when it
seeks to realize itself in a publicly apprehensible reality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>

Poetry did not, as Frost's Tityrus suggests it should, rescue the private
imagination from the public sphere so much as it rescued collective
groups of persons existing in a public sphere from their commitment to
the private imagination, and from their corollary belief that they could
make life secure by somehow realizing in a social domain the worlds they
collectively imagined.

<P>
The fifth stanza therefore concludes by confirming the incompatibility of
the singer's song with the world to which the speaker and his companion
return in the 
<B></B> 
last stanza of the poem, a public world in which lights
on fishing boats are the only identifiable traces of an agency that now,
more than ever, seems to have no identifiable source. "Turning," in what
looks to promise a quintessentially modernist act of poetic conversion,
"Toward the town" ("IO," 130), the speaker turns toward a public sphere
dominated by bodies open to experience but unable to direct the course
of their world. Rather than getting rid of bodies, Stevens gets rid
of minds; here too "People take the place of thoughts." It is not
until the cryptic emergence of "ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds"
("IO," 130) in the poem's last line that we begin to understand what
this conversion promises.

In his landmark essay "The Relation of Habitual Thought and Behavior to
Language" , the linguist Benjamin Whorf proposes that hearing is the
most notable of those "nonspatial" perceptions that are rendered "spatial"
by "linguistic metaphorical system[s]."
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 This linguistic
production of order is at times a risky business, for it contributes to
"behavior evincing a false sense of security or an assumption that all
will always go smoothly, and a lack of foreseeing and protecting ourselves
against hazards" (<I>LT,</I> 154). The "indifference to the unexpectedness
of life" (<I>LT,</I> 154) built into Standard Average European language
groups motivates the essay, committed as it is to demonstrating that
specified language patterns form the bedrock upon which individuals build
their perceptual abilities and ultimately their behavior.
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>


<P>
Whorf's first ideas on this topic were formed, he claimed, while working
"in a field usually considered remote from linguistics" (<I>LT,</I>
135). That field was insurance, and the insurance company for which Whorf
worked was Stevens's, the Hartford Fire and Indemnity Company. Whorf
consequently published the findings that formed the basis for "The
Relation of Habitual Thought and Behavior to Language" in <I>The Hartford
Agent,</I> the house journal that first carried Stevens's "Insurance
and Social Change." In fact, it was while Stevens was vice president of
Hartford that Whorf conducted experiments in how different phrases on
fire-warning labels enabled individuals to perceive danger. Individuals
anticipated future danger, Whorf insisted, through language, specifically
through highly specified language patterns. Correctly phrased labels,
reasoned Whorf, might thus key the individual into a perceptual
mode adequate to the situation at hand, a mode meant to register the
ghostly presence of risks that are themselves only fictions of the
potential, inductions from past events. The warning label, then, was
seen to function in a manner strikingly similar to the way the insurance
company's proliferation of risk groups keyed individuals into potential
dangers of which they were previously unaware; a person informed he is
part of a given risk group, for example, will discover danger in actions
and behaviors once thought to be harmless.

<P>
If warning labels represented one way specialized language systems
enabled individuals to discover hazard in the world around them, Whorf
reasoned that poetry was 
<B></B> 
another (<I>LT,</I> 260). Stevens--still
Whorf's boss when he made this suggestion--was of course himself
concerned throughout his poetic career with how poetic language enabled
individuals to refine their perceptions of an impersonal world they
could not control. "Esth&eacute;tique du Mal" , for example, is
an attempt to generate an apparatus of perception for danger and pain
in a world that has come to think of both in abstract and impersonal
terms. "Life is a bitter aspic," the poem insists. "We are not at the
center of a diamond."
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 Thus the third-person conditional
claim in the poem "That he might suffer or that / He might die" is met
with the compensatory suggestion that poetry might do more than simply
smooth the edges of looming suffering and death.
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 Poetry,
Stevens would claim in poem after poem, addressed the reality of pain and
suffering by enhancing empirical perception; it was, he claimed in "The
Man with the Blue Guitar" , "A composing of senses."
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>


<P>
"The Idea of Order" ends with just such a composing of senses, with
the cryptic emergence of "ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds" from
"[t]he maker's rage to order words of the sea" ("IO," 130). That the
poem's demarcations have been ghostly throughout hardly needs reinforcing;
moving from sea to town, the speaker remains unable to distinguish cause
from effect. What is significant, however, is the insistence that "keener
sounds" emerge precisely in his inability to distinguish between the
two. Only in giving up the search for the origin and source of effects,
the line suggests, do individuals begin to experience these same effects
with heightened acuity, with an enhanced ability to distinguish, to
refine, to classify. "Keener sounds" is in this respect the poem's true
compensatory offering, a tendering of Whorfian logic--that poems, like
all language systems, guard against chance by producing the awareness
of risks--in the wake of the speaker's realization that he cannot locate
the ultimate source of any order, either natural or synthetic.

<P>
But then who creates the order that does organize the town at the close
of "The Idea of Order at Key West"? Who is the maker of which the final
stanza speaks? Is he or she what Stevens calls elsewhere "a separate
author, a different poet, / An accretion from ourselves, intelligent /
Beyond intelligence, an artificial man"?
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 Is this "separate
author" the "personality of the first plane" Stevens speaks of in
"Insurance and Social Change"? Whorf would refer the ability of this
personality to act "without stopping to think"--Stevens's essay is
published in the company journal just two years earlier--to his efforts
to personify language as a mass mind that legislated the actions of
individuals. "It is as if the personal mind," he argues, "which selects
words but is largely oblivious to pattern, were in the grip of a higher,
far more intellectual mind, which has very little notion of houses and
beds and soup kettles, but can systematize and mathematize on a scale
and scope that no mathematician of the schools ever remotely approached"
(<I>LT,</I> 257).

<P>
What matters most in "The Idea of Order" however is the simple fact
that no human being within the poem can be this kind of separate author
or different poet. Most of all, the author of the poem itself does
not qualify. "[T]here are words / Better without an author, without a
poet," Stevens writes in "The Creations of Sounds" 
<B></B> 
.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>

Throughout his career Stevens would suggest that--like the solitary singer
who cannot definitively be said to order her world--not even the poet
could experience the meaning of the poem as willed or intended. Stevens
notes in "Adagia" at this time that "a poem is like a natural object"
("A," 205) and that "It is not every day that the world arranges itself in
a poem" ("A," 191). Thus Stevens invents the quintessential mystification
of poetic authority, a mystification that formalizes the refusal of
intentional agency thematized in "The Idea of Order" itself. "Poetry
has to be something more than a conception of the mind," he writes;
"It has to be a revelation of nature" ("A," 191).
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>


<P>
By the seventh stanza of the poem, then, the frames collapse even the poet
into an all-inclusive population marked by the impotency of the mind: "the
maker's rage to order words of the sea" offers knowledge "of ourselves
and of our origins" ("IO," 130) at the precise moment that the referent
for "ourselves" and "maker" is expansively inclusive. The speaker, like
those around him, like the poet himself, does not personally intend or
otherwise cause the aggregation of this collectivity; in "Notes Toward a
Supreme Fiction," Stevens, in the process of rejecting public statuary
in favor of continuous song, explains that this is the gift of public
experience, "To discover an order . . . to find, / Not to impose, not to
have reasoned at all" ("NT," 404). Indeed membership in this population
group is defined by all those things individuals <I>cannot</I> impose
upon the future, and by these criteria, the reader, like the author, is
as much a member as any character in the poem.

<P>
But what exactly does it mean to claim that the poem itself has no
maker? Stevens's poetry after the New Deal, as well as the New Critical
theory his poetry was so influential in establishing, would answer this
question head-on. His poetry staged the incapacity of intentional agency,
and he maintained that their making and reception rehearsed the same:
"The basis of criticism is not . . . the hidden intention of the writer"
(<I>L,</I> 390), he writes in 1941. It would remain for the New Critics
to theorize this quintessentially New Deal disavowal: "The poem is not
the critic's own and not the author's," note W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe
C. Beardsley in "The Intentional Fallacy"; "it is detached from the author
at birth and goes about the world beyond his power to intend about it or
control it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 Here again we see the insistence that poetry
and criticism address themselves to the abdication of control, to the
fatuity of the intentional.
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
 Control and intention certainly
are not recouped in Wimsatt and Beardsley's "The Affective Fallacy,"
where the two make clear that the reader does not determine or cause the
poem any more than the poet or critic. This seems to leave a vacuum:
exactly who does intend or control the poem; exactly who is the maker
of a poem? Having disqualified all the individual sources of agency that
might make claim to that office, Wimsatt and Beardsley move, in a by now
familiar fashion, to the necessarily impersonal mechanism of the public
itself, claiming that "the poem belongs to the public."
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>

What that public could finally be, and how a poem could actually belong
to it, remains a concern, a question of literary theory on the one hand,
and federal funding for the arts on the other. <B></B>

John Crowe Ransom, <I>The World's Body</I> (New York: Scribners,

at least the publication of <I>Harmonium</I> : in 1925 Gorham
Munson argued that Stevens's poetry ignored the disturbing side of
life, prering a line of criticism given its strongest expression
in Yvor Winters, who sees Stevens's poetry as prim and hedonistic, an
esthete's imaginative haven from the prosaic vagaries of life. Ransom,
Munson, and Winters in this manner each deride a poetry fundamentally
antagonistic to the social and the civic, and grant Stevens his poetic
security only by sequestering his poetry from the reality that groups of
persons collectively shared. See Gorham Munson, "The Dandyism of Wallace

and Money,</I> vol. 7 of <I>The Collected Writings of John Maynard
Keynes</I> (1936; Cambridge, U. K.: Macmillan, 1973), 13; hereafter
abbreviated <I>GT.</I> From Keynes's perspective, national planning
picked up on a faulty premise central to classical economics, namely that
personified collectivities directed the course of the economy by entering
into contracts with each other. Whereas classical economy was based on the
idea that individual agents could never control the consequences of their
actions on the economy as a whole, it had nonetheless relocated their
agency to abstractions seen to possess the contract-making potential of
persons. Thus while individual workers, and even individual unions, might
never have the power to set their own wage levels, classical economy
nonetheless held that there was a source of collective and intentional
agency implicit in an aggregate of individual actions. "Labor" did in
fact determine its wages, for the actions of every worker and union
constituted the contract into which the abstract personification "labor"
was invariably seen to enter. Keynes argued that there was no way to exert
this kind of agency in the economy, however the agents themselves were
conceived. He insisted that "there may exist no expedient by which labour
as a whole can reduce its <I>real</I> wage to a given re by making
revised <I>money</I> bargains with the entrepreneurs" (<I>GT,</I> 13).

Alan Brinkley explains that the introduction of Keynesian economics
into the New Deal led to the belief that "the industrial economy was too
large, too complex, too diverse; no single plan could encompass it all"
(Alan Brinkley, "The New Deal and the Idea of the State," in <I>The Rise
and Fall of the New Deal Order, 1930-1980,</I> ed. Stephen Fraser
and Gary Gerstle, 1989 [Princeton, N. J.: Princeton University Press],
93). The welfare state emerges most clearly in its contrast with the
planned economy; as Robert E. Goddin points out,

The point of welfare state interventions is to remedy unplanned
and unwelcome outcomes. The welfare state strives to produce a
post-fisc[al] distribution of certain goods and services that is
preferable to the pre-fisc[al] one. In a planned economy, by contrast,
all outcomes are the outcomes of planning. Not all are necessarily
intended or welcome outcomes, to be sure. But correcting planning
errors is surely qualitatively different from correcting the market's
unplanned perversities [Robert E. Goddin, "Reasons for Welfare: Economic,
Sociological, and Political--but Ultimately Moral," in <I>Responsibility,
Rights, and Welfare: The Theory of the Welfare State,</I> ed. J. Donald
Moon (Boulder: Westview Press, 1988), 21].

Burnshaw was suspicious of the poem for exactly this reason, and notes
that before he wrote his infamous review he began to wonder "which world"
it was that the singer actually made ("Interview with Stanley Burnshaw,"
124). Harold Bloom sees the song as evidence of Stevens's interest in a
transcendental order that is "not our own," but can be located "nowhere
else" but in ourselves (Harold Bloom, <I>Wallace Stevens: The Poems of
Our Climate</I> [Ithaca, N. Y.: Cornell University Press], 101). Despite
his avowed interest in the topographical, J. Hillis Miller, like Bloom,
has recently located the poem's order in the romantic imagination and
voice of the singer, and not in the town toward which the speaker turns
(<I>Topographies</I> [Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press,
1995], 288. For a detailed analysis of Stevens's often hostile interest
in romanticism during the 1930s, see Filreis, <I>Modernism from Right

Citing his mentor Edward Sapir, Whorf claims that "the cue to a
certain line of behavior is often given by the analogies of the linguistic
formula in which the situation is spoken of, and by which to some degree
it is analyzed, classified, and allotted its place in that world which
is 'to a large extent unconsciously built up on the language habits of
the group'" (<I>LT,</I> 136). This claim would find its way into college
textbooks during the second half of the century, as anthropologists and
psychologists debated the validity of a debased "Whorfian Hypothesis,"
most often simplified into the claim that Eskimos could see distinctions
between different kinds of snow that English-language speakers could not,
because Eskimos used more words to describe snow. Hence the notoriously
post-structuralist conclusion always lurking in Whorf's work: reality is
in the end a linguistic construct. In its most simplified version, then,
the Whorfian Hypothesis suggests a striking similarity to a simplified
but nonetheless critically popular version of Stevens, one that sees the
poet committed to the proposition that reality, far from being a fixed
constant, is instead constructed by imaginative paradigms hammered out
in the forge of poetry.

It is therefore Stevens's proto-New Critical dogma, and not
his job at Hartford, that leads Gerald Graff to claim that Stevens's
poetry protects itself from "referential liabilities," the "risks of
assertion" (Gerald Graff, <I>Poetic Statement and Critical Dogma</I>
