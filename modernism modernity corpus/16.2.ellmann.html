<p>"Ineluctable modality of the visible": when Margaret Anderson first read these opening words in Joyce's manuscript of "Proteus," she cried, "This is the most beautiful thing we'll ever have."<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Even newcomers to <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, fearful of those big words that make us so unhappy, find the music of these fourteen syllables entrancing. The opening paragraphs of "Proteus" encompass Stephen's famous philosophical experiment, in which he closes his eyelids to test whether the world continues to exist when he cannot see it. "Shut your eyes and see," he tells himself, perhaps in reminiscence of Tiresias, the prophet who could see more clearly for being blind.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> Stephen's feet provide the answer to his metaphysical doubts: "Stephen closed his eyes to hear his feet crush crackling wrack and shells" (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 3:10–11). Although Stephen's eyelids possess the power to blink the visible away, he has no earlids to resist the "crackling" of the audible. Is sound therefore more ineluctable than sight?</p>
<p>Many critics argue that the ear predominates over the eye in Joyce's work, although Sara Danius has recently contended that sight prevails over the other senses in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> This critical debate re-enacts a struggle waged in Joyce's works themselves, in which the rival modalities of ear and eye are constantly competing for supremacy. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> this struggle is played out by Stephen and Bloom, who tend to be aligned with sound and sight respectively. Stephen's ears are sharper than his eyes, whereas Bloom takes refuge in the realm of sight in order to escape the din of Irish masculinity. My contribution to "The Sounds of Joyce" examines how Joyce, in both <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span>, plays with the opposition between voice and writing, sight and sound. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  In particular, Joyce draws our attention to the noises of language, the acoustic detritus that cannot be assimilated into meaning or intention.</p>
<p>Returning to the opening words of "Proteus," note that it is not the visible as such, but its modality, its form or structure, which Stephen describes as "ineluctable." The visible, he muses, is "thought through my eyes" (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 3:1–2). In this context "thought" could be understood as either a noun or a past participle, which opens up a range of possible interpretations: I think with my eyes; my eyes think; or thought enters through my eyes. In any case Stephen endorses the Kantian premise that seeing is predicated on thinking, specifically on the mental forms of time and space. "My eyes do not see it: they think it rather than see," Joyce wrote in the earliest extant version of the passage.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Yet Stephen must also be aware that Aristotle attributes the capacity for thought to the ear rather than the eye. Vision is the superior sense for "the primary wants of life," Aristotle affirms, but hearing "contributes most to the growth of intelligence."</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>For rational discourse is a cause of instruction in virtue of its being audible . . . since it is composed of words, and each word is a thought-symbol. Accordingly, of persons destitute from birth of either sense, the blind are more intelligent than the deaf and dumb.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Putting this premise to the test, Stephen shuts his eyes to find out if he is smarter in the dark.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is un-Aristotelian of Stephen to salute the visible before he even begins to contemplate the audible. In the sequence of his reverie, seeing precedes hearing as lightning precedes thunder, and it is only when his eyes are shut that the ear begins to reassert its claims. This sequence associates the audible with the wake, the afterwards, the echoes that reverberate with each of Stephen's belated, quotation-laden thoughts. Thus the audible is relegated to the second sense; but it is worth remembering that the modality of the visible must be painfully obscure to the myopic Stephen. There is no mention of his spectacles in "Proteus," and without them he is liable to be pandied by every obstruction in his path, to knock his sconce against unseen impediments. Stephen's ashplant "sword," like Joyce's walking-stick, is more than a dandyish accoutrement; it works as an antenna to ascertain the ground beneath his feet. "Tap with it; they do," Stephen counsels himself as he shuts his eyes, thinking of the blind who tap their way with canes, "getting on nicely in the dark" (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 3:16–17). For Joyce himself, growing blinder with every year, the modality of the visible was far from ineluctable.</p>
<p>While Stephen hears better than he sees, Bloom enlists the visible as a defense against the audible. Throughout Bloom's odyssey, the world of sound is monopolized by noisy men: the songsters of "Sirens," the orators of "Aeolus," the hectoring Citizen of "Cyclops" with his snarling cur and foulmouthed commentator.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Time and again Bloom is lured to shipwreck by the sirensong of Dublin's drunken vainglorious louts, who are already drowning in noise and alcohol. In "Sirens," the male barflies indulge in a singing contest, their voices "soaring high, high resplendent, aflame, crowned, high in the effulgence symbolistic." Ben Dollard's "base barreltone" voice earns the notorious <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  tribute from Simon Dedalus: "Sure, you'd burst the tympanum of her ear, man . . . with an organ like yours."<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> While the singers in "Sirens" compete for vocal prowess, the newsmen in "Aeolus" compete for the heights of rhetoric, culminating in John F. Taylor's high-flown account of Moses's ascent of "Sinai's mountaintop" (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 11:747–8; 7:867). Incidentally it was this oration that Joyce chose for his own performance of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, recorded in 1924.</p>
<p>In both "Aeolus" and "Sirens," Bloom resists the phallic temptations of the rising voice by resorting to the modality of the visible, specifically by fixing his attention on the alphabet. In "Sirens" he eludes the voices of the singers by writing a letter to Martha Clifford, in which he signs his pseudonym Henry Flower with inaudible Greek E's. In "Aeolus" Bloom's thoughts turn "orthographical" as he watches the typesetter lining up the letters backwards on the printing press, the action reminding Bloom of his Jewish father reading Hebrew right to left (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 7:164; 203–7). In the noisy world of Dublin journalism, Bloom's reverie of reading backwards offers an escape-route from the forward thrust of the phallic voice.</p>
<p>By choosing writing over voice, Bloom behaves like a deconstructionist <span style="font-style:italic;">avant la lettre</span>, his silent Greek E's anticipating the inaudible "a" that Derrida interpolates in "<span style="font-style:italic;">differance</span>." Bloom resists the singers' "fiddlefaddle about notes," which he discounts as a failed "attempt to talk," by championing words over music (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 11:1195–6). But the heroic fart with which he crowns his getaway subverts the opposition between voice and writing, since the fart is itself a kind of voice, the voice of "peristalsis," whose rude noises alert us to the flatulence of speech itself.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Transliterated as "Pprrpffrrppfff," the fart reminds us of the puffing, spitting, wheezing, spluttering obscenity of voice, the slurp, gurgle, smack of breath, lips, tongue, teeth, saliva (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 1292).</p>
<p>Such noises represent the bodily remainder of the voice that cannot be assimilated into speech or song; they neither make sense nor gratify the ear, nor do they "go up in smoke" when the message or the music has been taken in.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Bloom's fart exposes the stuff that voice is made of, the visceral noise that both facilitates and interferes with the communicative function of speech. That noise is the "dangerous supplement" of speech, the excess that conceals the "gap" or lack implicit in the voice itself. In a characteristic ruse of self-defense, Bloom projects this gap onto women's voices: "Gap in their voices. . . Fill me. I'm warm, dark, open. . . Play on her. . . Body of white woman, a flute alive. . . Three holes, all women."<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>"Three holes," however, is an understatement in "Sirens," given the chapter's fascination with the unprotected portals of the ear, two orifices that raise the score of holes from three to five. Of mermaids Bloom wonders, "Why do they hide their ears with seaweed hair?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 11:941). Perhaps they do so to protect these holes against the voice that bursts the tympanum of the ear. This voice creates gaps by deflowering the channels of the ear, and it also issues from a gap—the warm, dark, open cavity of the mouth. This is the gap that gapes in Caravaggio's open-mouthed <span style="font-style:italic;">Medusa</span>, Munch's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Scream</span>, or Francis Bacon's screaming popes, paintings in which terrifying oral cavities threaten to swallow the spectator. Furthermore, the voice hollows out a gap between speaker and speech, severing the latter from its source. Speech and speaker <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  never fully coincide: there is always an element of ventriloquism in the voice that we hear ourselves uttering.</p>
<p>This disjunction between voice and speaker is exaggerated in the cinema, which splits narrative into visible image and audible soundtrack, thus deepening the gap between these two modalities. Film theorist Michel Chion uses the term "acousmatic" to describe the voice whose source one cannot see, a voice whose cinematic paradigm is the dead mother's voice in Hitchcock's <span style="font-style:italic;">Psycho</span>. Similarly, the Old Testament God manifests himself as an acousmatic voice; a trait he shares with many other deities, for the voice that comes from nowhere seems to come from everywhere, conferring omnipotence on its unseen source (Dolar, 60–6). In the "Nestor" episode Stephen confirms this link between the acousmatic voice and the divine when he defines God as "a shout in the street"—but with the caveat that Stephen is alluding to the offstage voices of schoolchildren at play; a demotic rejoinder to Jehovah's acousmatic monologue (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 2:386).</p>
<p>When the sacred voice is "disacousmatized," as Chion puts it, or pinned down in a body, the deity loses his charisma. Witness the Wizard of Oz, whose voice is disacousmatized when Toto knocks over the screen, revealing a little old man with a bald head and a wrinkled face, begging Dorothy and her companions not to hurt him. Chion describes disacousmatization as a vocal striptease that culminates in the revelation of the orifice from which the voice proceeds, the open mouth. Yet the voice that emanates from this black hole cannot be assigned to the lips, tongue, teeth, or oral cavity; or to the hidden organs of the larynx or the lungs; or even to the sea-surge of the blood that Bloom contemplates in "Sirens."<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> The voice, as Mladen Dolar has contended, "ties language to the body, but the nature of this tie is paradoxical: <span style="font-style:italic;">the voice does not belong to either</span>" (Dolar, 72). Munch's painted scream, which silences the voice and thereby deafens the spectator, reveals the poignant truth that the scream cannot be answered because we never really know where it is coming from.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> Bloom's odyssey begins with Molly's disembodied sleepy grunt, an acousmatic "Mn" emanating from an unseen bedroom. Just before this noise is registered, Bloom overhears his own voice as if it belonged to someone else:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>He said softly in the bare hall:<br>—I'm going round the corner. Be back in a minute.<br>And when he had heard his voice say it he added:<br>—You don't want anything for breakfast?<br>A sleepy soft grunt answered:<br>—Mn.</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 4:52–7)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Molly's "Mn" is only reunited with her "full lips" after Bloom returns from the butcher with his kidney (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 4:315). Her last words in "Calypso," when she welcomes the cat (as opposed to her husband) into bed, are also presented acousmatically: "Listening, [Bloom] heard her voice:—Come, come, pussy. Come" (<span style="font-style:italic;">U</span> 4:471–2). On first reading, "her" voice seems to belong to the cat, rather than to Molly, since this female cat has <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  just been mewing plaintively at Bloom. The pronominal confusion underscores the ghostly independence of acousmatic voices from their speakers.</p>
<p>A propos of cats, an intriguing exploration of the acousmatic voice may be found in May Swenson's poem "The Secret in the Cat" , in which the speaker takes her cat apart to see what makes him purr.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Stanza by stanza she opens up his throat, chest, skull, and belly, to find the source of the elusive sound, but finds no wire, humming throttle, whisk or rattle. In Kleinian terms, the cat's dismemberment could be interpreted as a rampage on the mother's body in search of the treasures it contains, specifically the maternal voice, a voice whose source the infant cannot see, and hence "the mother of all acousmatic voices" (Dolar, 66). When Swenson cannot find the purr inside the cat, she wonders if the sound is coming from outside, the cat vibrating like "a tuning fork?—amplifier?—telegraph?" and picking up "some radar code" or unseen frequency.</p>
<p>The same questions pertain to the human voice. Does it come from inside or outside? Is it secreted from the body, or is it poured into the channels of the ear? Is the body nothing but an empty vessel resounding with the words of others? "Empty vessels make most noise," Bloom quips in "Sirens."<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> The answer to these questions is that the voice is both too inside and too outside: too inside, because it erupts out of the viscous depths of corporeality, like the voice of the corpse in Poe's 1845 story "The Facts of the Case of Monsieur Valdemar" ("the voice seemed to reach our ears . . . from a vast distance, or from some deep cavern within the earth . . . it impressed me . . . as gelatinous or glutinous matters impress the sense of touch"); but also too outside, because the voice ventriloquizes the body rather than belonging to it.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Thus the voice is doubly obscene: not only is it belched out of the entrails, but it signifies "a hidden intimacy to the Other," exposing our consenting violation by the voice that bursts the tympanum of our ears (Dolar, 80).</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span>, the modalities of the audible and the visible are personified by the brothers Shem and Shaun. These brothers are forever morphing into other twins, including the Ondt and the Gracehoper, insects aligned with the eye-world and the ear-world respectively. The ballad of the Ondt and the Gracehoper is Joyce's riposte to Wyndham Lewis, who lumped Joyce together with Pound, Eliot, and Gertrude Stein as "revolutionary simpletons" besotted by Bergson's time-cult, with its celebration of "<span style="font-style:italic;">elapse</span>" over "<span style="font-style:italic;">extense</span>," of duration in time over extension in space.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Despite their rivalry, however, Ondt and Gracehoper remain inseparable:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>A locus to loue, a term it t'embarrass,<br><span style="font-style:italic;">These twain are the twins that tick</span> Homo Vulgaris.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">A locus (locust) of space, a term (termite) of time; these are the ticks that make man tick, his clockwork set in motion by the vulgar tongue. Among a bewildering array of denotations, the verb "to tick" may mean to click, to tap, to mark, to scold, to anger, to run up debts, or to deliver a telegram by ticking. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The Ondt and the Gracehoper, together with swarms of other insects in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wake</span>, embody what the French call "parasitage," the interference or frustration endemic to audiovisual technology.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> In English the term "parasitic oscillations" is used in electronics to refer to "strays" or "atmospherics," such as the ticks in a telephone receiver, which usually involve a loss of energy. In linguistics the term "parasite" designates an intrusive sound or letter not originally present in a word, but added to or developed from an existing phonetic element. Examples given by the <span style="font-style:italic;">OED</span> include the "e" in flower and the "d" in thunder. (With regard to thunder, Joyce was not content with the addition of a single parasitic "d"; instead he renders thunder—the acousmatic voice of God as well as a celestial fart—with neologisms of a hundred letters.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a>) The Ondt and the Gracehoper, as "<span style="font-style:italic;">the twins that tic</span> Homo Vulgaris," represent the parasites (ticks) that disrupt any direct communication of the message, creating ticks like those in the telephone receiver, or verbal tics like HCE's incriminating stammer. The very pun on "tic" demonstrates the principle of <span style="font-style:italic;">parasitage</span>, the interference with the message by the medium.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span> these ticks besiege the hero's ear: "Ear! Ear! Weakear!" Earwicker's weak, defenseless ear is constantly pierced by <span style="font-style:italic;">perce-oreilles</span>, the earwigs and earworms of modern audiotechnology.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Unlike the eye, the ear is always open, and hearing therefore tends to be characterized as a passive sense, in contrast to the supposedly active, penetrative sense of vision. In hearing, the world bears in upon the self; we cannot "listen away," nor can the ear blink to defend itself from violation. To make matters worse, human beings do not hear well compared to many so-called lesser species. In particular Homo Vulgaris has difficulty judging the distance and location of the source of sound, a defect one feels acutely when hearing the crescendo of a siren without knowing where the police are coming from.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> For this reason, sound is "a ringing, clanging scandal," according to Emmanuel Levinas. "Whereas, in vision, form is wedded to content . . . in sound the perceptible quality overflows so that the form can no longer contain its content. A real rent is produced in the world . . ."<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>This rent produces "schizophonia," the separation of sound from source, which Murray Shaffer identifies as the distinctive feature of the modern soundscape, with all its mechanical extensions of the voice: the radio, the soundtrack, the hifi, the PC.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> This rampant schizophonia means that ventriloquism—in which the voice appears to emanate from somewhere other than its source—is the precondition of modern life, rather than a trivial, amusing sideshow. Derrida has emphasized the loss of origin inherent in the act of writing, but ventriloquism demonstrates that speech is equally susceptible to dispossession. As soon as we hear ourselves speak, we split into two warring twins, a speaker and a hearer, and it is the hearer who puts words into the speaker's mouth, as a ventriloquist projects a voice into a dummy.</p>
<p>Ventriloquism goes back to the beginning of Joyce's writing: it features, for example, in the phenomenon that Kenner calls "the Uncle Charles principle," or free indirect discourse, in which the narrative voice is hijacked by the voices of the characters.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> The most spectacular example of ventriloquism occurs in "Circe," where voices ricochet from every surface of Bella Cohen's brothel, as well as from parental ghosts, abstractions, <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  and hypotheticals such as "The End of the World." The "Circe" episode could be seen as a trial run for the pan-ventriloquism of <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span>, in which voices emanate from rocks and stones and trees, as well as from the hitherandthithering waters of the Liffey. Joyce's professed intention in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wake</span> to "liberate all sounds from their servile, contemptible role" implies that the sounds become the masters rather than the servants of the speakers, while the speakers are transformed into the dummies of the sounds.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>During the years that Joyce was writing <span style="font-style:italic;">Work-in-Progress</span>, as James Connor has pointed out, "radio air was full of noises, wandering signals, high altitude skips, and super-heterodyne screeches, and [those] who listened to it had to gradually attune themselves to a cacophony of voices all speaking at once." Many voices require many readers: it is difficult to read the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wake</span> alone, and by demanding group reading the novel resurrects the oral tradition of group listening. The familiar image of a 1930s family gathered around a massive radio, struggling to decipher sense from noise, preres the reading groups that now assemble around the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wake</span>, readers having discovered that four ears are better than two, not to mention several hundred eyes, for navigating these uncharted waters.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Joyce's writings restage Stephen's philosophical experiment in "Proteus" by pitting the visible against the audible. The visible is the modality of space and writing, whereas the audible is the modality of time and voice. While writing necessarily escapes the writer to embark on independent odysseys, like the verbal flotsam that meanders down the River Liffey in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, speech tends to be regarded as inseparable from the speaker. Joyce, however, fractures speech from speaker, song from singer, by drawing our attention to the noises in the voice, the parasitic interference in the utterance. As we have seen, the voice that erupts out of the body cannot be identified with any of its organs—tongue, teeth, mouth, lungs, vocal cords—although these organs taint the voice with burps and slurps and other viscous intimations of mortality. Nor can the body protect the voice from the incursions of ventriloquism, or from the strays and atmospherics of the modern soundscape. In the schizophonic racket of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wake</span>, the voice functions as a radio-receiver, transmitting ticks from all the imagined corners of the globe. As readers, we become gracehopers, channel-hopping between sight and sound in search of a stable frequency amidst the noise.</p>
