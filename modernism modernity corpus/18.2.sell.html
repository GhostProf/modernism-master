<h1 class="sec-headA">The emergence of the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span>
</h1>
<p>A month after nineteen men crashed four jet airliners into Manhattan's World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a clod-strewn field in Western Pennsylvania, and only hours after the U.S. military invaded Afghanistan, Al Jazeera television, the most-watched network in the Arab world, broadcast a video recording it had received through secret channels. On it, Osama bin Laden, charismatic leader of the international terrorist network Al Qaeda, condemned the invasion and praised the hijackers, glorifying them as "a blessed group of vanguard Muslims, the forefront of Islam."<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>As someone who had studied the art, history, and theory of the avant-garde for some time, my curiosity was piqued, but I was also deeply skeptical. U.S. news organizations were scrambling to find reliable translators, and cultural misunderstandings were obviously prevalent across U.S. culture. It was hard not to come to the conclusion that the transcript was a murky cocktail of sloppy translation and the uncritical, ahistorical sense of "vanguard" so common in scholarly literature, the popular press, and online marketing. Or, even if I were to presume that the translation was on target, what bin Laden was invoking was that "other" avant-garde, the military/political one of Bolsheviks and hinterland guerrillas, the kind of vanguard that we generally assume has little pertinence to the kinds of questions those in avant-garde studies generally ask. A curiosity, nothing more—a tidbit for the clippings file.</p>
<p>Or so I thought. I have learned since that "vanguard" is a perfectly suitable translation of the Arabic word <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> (sometimes  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> transliterated <span style="font-style:italic;">taliyaah</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">talihah</span>).<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> The term is used in the Arab world today with the same promiscuity as it is elsewhere and scholars study it with the same fervor. Further, as one perceptive reader of this essay noted, there is a common strain of prophetic theology and violent activism that binds East and West for centuries. Add to that the research I've been doing on the role of Saint-Simonian ideology in the colonization of Algeria and the persistent Orientalism that shaped the avant-garde into a cultural (as opposed to merely technocratic) tendency, and it's hard not to come to the conclusion that bin Laden's encomium is only the most recent artifact from a history of material, social, ideological, and cultural exchange that has intertwined vanguards across the U.S., Western Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Fair enough, but what benefits are there to bringing Islamist vanguards such as Al Qaeda into the scholarly fold? First, the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> suggests that the line drawn by most scholars between the "two avant-gardes," as Renato Poggioli puts it,<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> between the artistic and the military/political, is hampering our ability to comprehend the history of the avant-garde more generally. While some scholars enthusiastically embrace a concept of the avant-garde that brings together the military, culinary, religious, and other traditions of cultural resistance and revolt, that number is still surprisingly low. However, as Richard Schechner writes in a recent <span style="font-style:italic;">PMLA</span> article, "Aestheticizing and ritualizing violence, not as representations (as in the visual arts, theater, or other media), but as actual acts performed in the here and now, are widespread."<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> He further notes that "the West and the jihadists occupy very separate spheres from the point of view of values while sharing the same global system from the point of view of techniques."<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> Indeed, the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> reminds us that the distinctions among these varied spheres are always culturally and historically specific.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> presses us to develop a more encompassing definition of the avant-garde, one that subsumes art and aesthetic dissidence under a broader rubric of <span style="font-style:italic;">culture</span>. While many scholars of the avant-garde have moved into a full-on cultural studies mode (Raymond Williams, Barrett Watten, and Richard Schechner coming most quickly to mind<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup>), the field as a whole still privileges aesthetic analysis over historical and ideological analysis, if only by dint of its unwavering, unquestioning commitment to the arts. A broader concept of cultural activism does not mean the end of arts-based analysis, but it does enable us not only to consider a wider range of actions and positions, but, in doing so, adds needed nuance to our understanding of aesthetic politics. Pace Schechner, we should not let values block critical analysis.</p>
<p>Finally, the tale of the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> affirms James Harding's assertion that the avant-garde is not an essentially "European" tendency, but a "fundamentally global cultural phenomenon" that has emerged in diverse forms and places . The <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> is an exemplary "rough edge," to recall Harding's metaphor, evidence that the avant-garde is a mutable, site-specific product of negotiation, struggle, and mutual transformation rather than a monolithic, linear tendency within European modernity. It is across such rough edges that the most astonishing effects of bringing the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> into the story of the avant-garde come into view. Andrea Flores Khalil, one of the few critics who has studied the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> (at least one part of it), suggests exactly how confusing things can get. The <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span>, she writes, possesses "a strange, circular, temporal effect …, always returning and moving  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> ahead at the same time."<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> Richard Schechner considers this one of the more interesting tendencies in avant-garde art over the last few decades, asserting that</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>there is no area, be it Micronesia, the Pacific Rim, West Africa, the Circumpolar Region, or wherever, which does not have artists actively trying to use, appropriate, reconcile, come to terms with, exploit, understand—the words and political tone vary, but the substance doesn't—the relationships between local cultures in their extreme, particular historical development and the increasingly complex and multiple contacts and interactions not only among various cultures locally and regionally, but on a global and interspecific scale.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">While not all artists and movements who do this are avant-garde, it is certainly true of the avant-garde that Khalil writes about and the one I'll explore in the following pages. Very much in the vein of Schechner's "tradition-seeking avant-garde," the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> paradoxically <span style="font-style:italic;">follows and precedes</span> European modernity, and doing so within a sociocultural "rough edge," it is both an influence on and a creature of European modernity. The <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span>, a rough-edge, tradition-seeking avant-garde, is further evidence that it is time for scholars to abandon conventional, linear history and embrace instead a genealogical approach <span style="font-style:italic;">à la</span> Foucault, one in which the avant-garde is not a substantive, unitary agent that follows a linear, developmental story, but is, instead, deployed as a critical concept, a marker that identifies and links situated domains of knowledge whose relationship to each other is motile and mercurial.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Fortunately, Khalil is not entirely alone in recognizing the importance of the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span>. The relationship between Surrealism and the Arab world, especially the French Surrealist group's public support for the Rif rebellion in Morocco, has been the subject of fairly extensive scholarship.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> The impact of the Arab world on the Black Arts Movement has been mapped by Melani McAlister. Of particular importance, she shows how the Nation of Islam, changed feelings about Israel sparked by the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, and Pan-Arab nationalism were touchstones for Black Arts Movement vanguardists Amiri Baraka, Ishmael Reed, Sonia Sanchez, Larry Neal, and others.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Paul Berman's 2003 article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times Magazine</span> on Egyptian theologian Sayyid Qutb first alerted me to the widespread presence of vanguard models within radical Islam.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> Historians Gilles Kepel and Adnan Musallam provide a textured sense of the avant-garde as both rhetorical trope and socio-political strategy for Islamic vanguards.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> In an essay on avant-garde drama in the Middle East, Marvin Carlson inveighs against "two widespread and erroneous assumptions"; one, that the Middle East lacks a strong tradition of drama and, two, that European drama is the predominant influence on modern Middle Eastern playwrights and theater artists. Carlson cites Peter J. Chelkowski's work on Iranian performance, which shows that avant-garde drama in the Middle East is most prominent in popular forms such as religious celebrations, dramatic narratives, and festival processions. For Chelkowski, what is avant-garde about these things is, in Carlson's words, "its mixing of materials from history, legend, popular culture, and everyday life; its casual use of found material and space; its frank acknowledge of the apparatus of production; and its breaking down of the barrier between performance and audience."<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>But Khalil's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Arab Avant-Garde: Experiments in North African Art and Literature</span> stands apart in its understanding of the historiographical implications of the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span>. Investigating experimental literature in North Africa, mostly written in French, Khalil positions it within "the recent and still partial emergence of minority literatures and marginalized voices into an international, global discourse," especially as it relates to the "tensions between local and global, traditional and modern, authentic and general …"<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> In line with Schechner, she shows poets such as Abdelwahab Meddeb evincing a "desire to draw new relations between their past and their future." Meddeb's writings demonstrate the ways a "minor literature" can upset local conrations of cultural authority without abiding strictly within the contours of European modernism.</p>
<p>This is why chronology gets so tangled; to understand the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> (not a term Khalil uses), we must approach it "through a multiple genealogy and not just … a singular origin."<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> Meddeb understood "cultural modernity" as a "cyclical recommencing: French being inhabited by its colonial relationship with the Maghreb, and Arabic likewise speaking through the vocabularies of European thinkers."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> The implications of this are profound. "This decentering on a worldwide scale," Khalil concludes, "produces a critical transformation, one disturbing the Western canon, the other dismantling the value systems of traditional cultures from which writers and artists originated and have dispersed."<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> Both sides are changed; they are mutual influences.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Al Qaeda, Sayyid Qutb, and the "first" avant-garde</h1>
<p>To recall, when I read Osama bin Laden praising the 9/11 hijackers as "a blessed group of vanguard Muslims, the forefront of Islam," I was both dubious and curious. Post-9/11 paranoia, the revelation of sleeper cells in London and Madrid, the insurgencies in Afghanistan and Iraq, the maneuverings of Hamas in Israel/Palestine, the camps of Peshawar—these pushed me to find out more. But there was another reason for doing research on Al Qaeda and Islamic militancy more generally. I'd been thinking about whether avant-garde theory could be applied to non-art subjects such as the U.S. Christian evangelical movement or counterinsurgency operations. That effort was proving fruitful, but there was a limit to it in that none of the groups and movements I was studying explicitly claimed the title "avant-garde." They were, as Matei Calinescu would put it, "unconscious avant-gardes."<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup></p>
<p>This is definitely not the case with radical Islamism. Many Islamist organizations and intellectuals take the vanguard title consciously, and many of those have a fully developed theory of cultural power and social organization, two pillars of any avant-garde theory. The Egyptian Hassan al Banna, for one, modeled the Muslim Brotherhood after the Russian Bolsheviks and the fascist Phalangists of Spain. That said, Brotherhood chapters are typically reformist, grassroots organizations rather than vanguard parties. It is true that in Egypt a hardcore underground organization was formed in the 1960s when the party found itself under intense repression by the Nasser regime, and accusations of terrorist support and sympathy continue to follow chapters across the Islamic world. Regardless, one would be on slippery ground to call the Brotherhood an "avant-garde."<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>A fuller and more mature conception of the Islamic avant-garde is evident in the writings of Maulana Sayyid Abdul Ala Maududi of Pakistan, founder of <span style="font-style:italic;">Jamaat-e-Islami</span>. For him, vanguardism was both an organizational and ethical model for breaking with a corrupt society. It also perfectly fit the contours of Islamic history. Maududi's vision of the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> was modeled on the <span style="font-style:italic;">hijra</span>, the exile and insurgency of Mohammad and his followers. Gilles Kepel notes that, in a number of texts written in the 1930s and 40s, "Maududi made explicit references to the 'vanguard' of the earliest Muslims, who gathered around the Prophet in 622 during the <span style="font-style:italic;">hijra</span>, broke with the idolatrous people of Mecca, and departed to found the Islamic state of Medina. His own party was intended to follow a similar course."<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> Maududi was not the first to do this; Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (1838–97) and Mohammad 'Abduh (1849–1905) also did so. However, those two viewed it as an example rather than an organizational or strategic model, as Maududi did. However, as close as Maududi came to considering the <span style="font-style:italic;">hijra</span> an indigenous model of vanguard activism, he ultimately proved unfaithful to the concept. Though he called for a break with <span style="font-style:italic;">jahiliyya</span> society (a term I'll discuss in more detail shortly), he never broke with the political establishment in Pakistan and never advocated violence. Keppel writes, "Maududi's holy war to build an Islamic state found expression through full participation in the political system of Pakistan, rather than radical opposition to it."<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>A more literal reading of the <span style="font-style:italic;">hijra</span> as "instruction to be translated into action," is found in the work of Egyptian theologian Sayyid Qutb, rightly considered the most important influence on radical Islamism today. (His brother Mohammad was one of Osama bin Laden's teachers.) In his highly influential 1964 book <span style="font-style:italic;">Milestones</span>, Qutb urges "the callers to Islam in every country and in every period [to] give thought to one particular aspect of the history of Islam and … ponder over it deeply"; specifically, "the generation of the Companions of the Prophet, may God be pleased with them."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> The <span style="font-style:italic;">hijra</span>, Qutb asserts, is more than metaphor and example; it is a model for action, a concept of historical agency, and an ethos. In sum, Qutb viewed the <span style="font-style:italic;">hijra</span> as the most effective means to manifest the differences between the community of true believers and the disbelieving majority culture, known as <span style="font-style:italic;">jahiliyya</span>.</p>
<p>As John Voll notes, "Before Qutb, the word <span style="font-style:italic;">jahiliyya</span> simply refered to the period before the time of the Prophet Mohammad or to those people at the time of Mohammad who did not know about him. However, Qutb used the term inclusively, extending it to all who rebelled willfully against God's rule."<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Reflecting his abiding (though ambivalent) contempt for European modernity, Qutb calls both for a break between "present and his past" and with the "<span style="font-style:italic;">jahiliyya</span> environment, its customs and traditions, its ideas and concepts." The vanguard, Qutb writes, "which sets out … and then keeps walking on the path … should keep itself somewhat aloof from this all-encompassing <span style="font-style:italic;">jahiliyya</span>…"<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> The vanguard, in Qutb's view, enacts a rupture both within time and community. Though he doesn't deny that some ties with this fallen society should be maintained out of necessity, Qutb proclaims that "we will not change our own values and concepts either more or less to make a bargain with this <span style="font-style:italic;">jahiliyya</span> society. Never! We and it are on different roads, and if we take even one step in its company, we will lose our goal entirely and lose our way as well."<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Two readings, two histories</h1>
<p>What can we make of such language, which is so clearly indebted to Western worldviews, both long-lived and recent? As I've considered this, I've developed two very different readings of this "rough edge." The first would characterize Qutb's <span style="font-style:italic;">hijra</span> rhetoric as a cynical ploy, a hypocritical hanging of Islamic window dressing on an essentially European concept. There's good evidence to support this reading. In addition to not having to admit the European pedigree of his strategy, Qutb can neatly sweep under the rug the influence on his thinking of the liberal-constitutional Wafd Party, which Qutb damned as <span style="font-style:italic;">jahiliya</span> only upon his break with it in the late 1940s.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> This wouldn't be the first time Qutb altered history to fit ideology. In 1952, he proposed that Egyptian history textbooks be revised in order to "to correct the distortions … which failed to give an appropriate place to the Islamic renaissance as represented by the Wahhabiyah and the Mahdiyah movements" of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, which predated the major wave of European colonization and the dissemination of Western thought.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup></p>
<p>In support of such a reading, Voll writes, "It is clear that the Islamic resurgence is not primarily the accomplishment of those with little experience with, or knowledge of, the modern West. Indeed, those who constitute the hard core of the current Islamist wave have had intensive and unprecedented exposure to the technologies, educational systems and philosophies, political processes, cultural values, and lifestyles of the West."<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> That was definitely true of Qutb, who was educated in a modern primary school rather than a traditional Qura'nic school (i.e., a <span style="font-style:italic;">kuttab</span>) and felt perfectly at ease making fun of those educated in such places. He was an accomplished scholar of European romantic poetry and a good poet himself, favoring the romantic mode. Qutb was drawn to other aspects of European modernity, too. According to Voll, Qutb admired the "major rationalist modernists of the 1920s and 1930s."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup></p>
<p>He wasn't alone in this regard. Western modernists have enjoyed high regard in the Arab world since at least the reign of Mohammad 'Ali (1769–1849), who, inspired by Napoleon, "began a program of rapid modernization of the Egyptian military, government, and economy using Western European advisers and models."<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> And though the modernists could not avoid being challenged by those who "called for a return to the example of the pious ancestors, the companions of the Prophet … Islamic modernism provided fundamentalism with a sophisticated modern vocabulary for the defense of Islam"; specifically, a "focus on secularism and materialism as problems at the core of the modern experience."<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> In sum, rather than viewing Qutb as anti-European and anti-American, as most have, we should follow Musallam's lead and consider him the result of "conflicting forces of tradition and modernity in Egyptian society which were working to shape his personality and world view."<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> The <span style="font-style:italic;">hijra</span> rhetoric is something of a red herring—radical Islamism replicates the worst features of Eurocentrism: violence, intolerance, elitism.</p>
<p>But this is not the only way to interpret the data. A second interpretation of Qutb's use of the <span style="font-style:italic;">hjijra</span> myth puts the sleight of hand to the Europeans, artist and scholar alike.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> There is an extensive body of scholarship that shows Islam to be a deep and significant influence on romanticism.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> Naji B. Ouejian writes,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>To the romantics, the East was a model world of exoticism, and what helped popularize such an image of the East was a very old Western tradition which started way before politics and trade had forced the Orient on the attention of the Western peoples; it started with the Westerners' amazement that the East, and not the West, should have been the birthplace of almost all ancient civilizations and of heavenly religions, particularly Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">And, of course, romanticism was a deep and significant influence on the avant-garde. As Renato Poggioli pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Theory of the Avant-Garde</span> (Italian, 1962), the avant-garde is inconceivable without romanticism, and "[m]any historians and critics have affirmed the continuity … between romanticism and avant-gardism." However, he continues, "almost always, this involves rightists, often polemicists, already hostile to romanticism, who attack the avant-garde as an extreme case of what they call the 'disease of romanticism.'"<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> Perhaps this hostility to romanticism is the reason why scholars have mostly ignored the influence of Islam on the avant-garde (or is it the reverse, hostility to Islam amplifying a predisposition against romanticism?). Qutb's affinity with the tendency would only provide one more reason to ignore him.</p>
<p>The metaphor may be part of the problem, too. The military connotations of "avant-garde" obscure other paradigms that are just as useful for imagining small-group cultural radicalism: the cenacle, the rhizome, the think tank, or, of particular interest here, the mystical pilgrimage. The mystical pilgrimage was a common chronotope for romantic poets, as Oueijan points out:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>It is difficult to read extensively in the works of the romantics without coming away with the feeling that there emanates from their writings a sense of determination to explore the mysteries of existing yet obscure realities. Their insistence on a voyage or a pilgrimage away from conventional civilization manifested itself in two forms: a physical (Byron's <span style="font-style:italic;">Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</span>) and/or a mental (Coleridge's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ancient Mariner</span>) quest toward the exotic and mysterious.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Examples of romantic literature in which Islam res prominently are numerous. Shelley, Byron, William Beckford, and Goethe—just to cite the big names—all tried their hands at it. Though it would be incorrect to remove such poets and their work from the broader, demeaning Orientalist treatment of the Arab world that prevailed, some romantics approached Islam with seriousness and respect.</p>
<p>Dan White has drawn my attention to a particularly interesting example of a poem that demonstrates such respect, Robert Southey and Coleridge's "Mohammed."<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> Begun in 1799 by Southey, the poem languished for a few years before being picked up again when Coleridge offered to help out, but the collaboration didn't get too far. In the fragment, Mohammad's brother Ali disguises himself as the Prophet in order to deceive their enemies, enabling Mohammad to escape and hide in a warren of caves.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> That disguise is cloaked in yet another: Ali is "restless and full of fear, yet semblant of one that is sleeping." Upon discovery, the disguise causes further confusion. The substitution of one brother for another befuddles the enemies of Islam and goads them into a panicky, disordered chase across Arabia and North Africa. The scene then shifts to a cave in which Mohammad and one of his Companions hide, passing "expectant hours," their hope giving to "the sound of the wind … its tone" and to the Prophet the promise that "God will confound" the plots of his enemies. The fragment contains a cluster of tried-and-true vanguard themes: self-imposed exile, moralistic interpretation of space and history, sensory and intellectual sensitivity granted by dissidence, the world-historical significance of contrarian attitudes and action, and performance. Incidentally, it also invokes the kinds of ambiguity, performativity, and exotic self-fashioning that are typical of "rough edge" vanguard groupings and that continually baffle scholars commited to linear, Eurocentric models of avant-garde history.</p>
<p>Returning to Qutb, then, I think we find that the issue of influence is more complicated than either interpretation allows on its own. Indeed, there's no way to finally and firmly decide which of the two interpretations of Qutb's <span style="font-style:italic;">hijra</span> rhetoric is more valid. Both Qutb and the historians of the avant-garde have some answering to do. Again, as Musallam puts it, Qutb fashioned himself within "conflicting forces of tradition and modernity in Egyptian society which were working to shape his personality and world view."<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> Thus, I personally find it most suitable to read Qutb's theology as the protean creature of a turbulent rough edge between Europe and the Arab world, a boundary comprised of multiple negotiations, discourses, and performances. Rather than arguing whether Qutb's <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> is authentic or hypocritical, it is more productive and far more interesting to consider it as "both/and."</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Though Al Qaeda is only a small part of its history, I think it suggests the benefits of bringing the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> into the historiographical fold. The kinds of questions scholars who study the avant-garde have begun asking about race, gender, the state and its institutions, colonialism, and other matters come into sharper focus as a consequence—and also different focus. For too long, we've assumed that these issues are distinctively European; they are that, no doubt, but they are also informed by other places, other histories. Avant-garde theory, in turn, provides a remarkably solvent discursive framework for us to comparatively study numerous sites and moments where the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> appears, places like bohemian ballets and novels, the heated debates of Henri de Saint-Simon and his disciples, the polished corridors of the École de Médecine (where doctors debated the best way to aid the colonial project in Algeria), the dusty roads travelled by Frantz Fanon, Gamal Nasser's dungeons, the Islamic sleeper cells of 9/11, and the restive youth of Paris's suburban ghettos. Understood as a complex historical and geopolitical contact zone, the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span>—a term I now view as synonymous with "avant-garde" or "vanguard"—allows us to think about the avant-garde in a more nuanced, global, and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> richly textured way. Understood as an exemplary rough edge, as a place where linear history must give way to the situational analyses of Foucault-style genealogy, the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> inspires us to understand better the kinds of interventions into hierarchies and power flows that have been and might be carried out by avant-gardes. Most importantly, it restores the issue of terror to rightful prominence within avant-garde studies. The <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> is implicated in the deepest violence: the violence of colonization and its countermovements; the violence of ethnocentrism, both the direct violence of punch and insult and the indirect violence of hopelessness; and the violence of culture shock; and the fires of terrorism. More than towers and airplanes fell on 9/11—with them fell a story about the avant-garde that has long denied its roots, its continuing relevance, and its complex entwinement with racial, sexual, religious, and colonial power.</p>
