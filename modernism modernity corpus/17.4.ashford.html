	Beneath the pavement, sunk in the earth, hollow drains lined with yellow light for ever conveyed them this way and that, and large letters upon enamel plates represented in the underworld the parks, squares, and circuses of the upper. “Marble Arch—Shepherd’s Bush”—to the majority the Arch and the Bush are eternally white letters upon a blue ground. Only at one point—it may be Acton, Holloway, Kensal Rise, Caledonian Road—does the name mean shops where you buy things, and houses, in one of which, down to the right, where the pollard trees grow out of the paving stones, there is a square curtained window, and a bedroom.

	  Eric Hobsbawm once made the startling claim that the most original work of avant-garde art produced in Britain between the wars was Harry Beck’s Tube Map.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> In an essay published in the book <span style="font-style:italic;">Imagined Londons</span>, David L. Pike has examined the basis for this polemical assertion and concluded that “By simplifying the complex network of urban railway lines into a visually pleasing and easily legible map bearing little or no relation to either the experiential or the physical metropolis of London, Beck codified a particularly modernist conception of space.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> In Pike’s view, the Tube Map fits into a genealogy of modernist space that originated in the mid-nineteenth century with the blue, red, and yellow lines Baron Haussmann imposed upon a map of Paris. “Such projects undertook, in the physical space of Paris, to control the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> chaotic, ungraspable reality of the modern city through color-coding, straight lines, and diagonal cuts.” (Pike 104–105) Beck’s Map achieved this same goal but in a manner symptomatic of the history of such schemes in London, through its impact upon the representational, rather than physical, space of London. The tangle of sub-surface railways, tube railways, and light railways, built at multiple times and at various levels, had been flattened out and homogenised in a totalising vision of what French sociologist Henri Lefebvre termed <span style="font-style:italic;">abstract space</span>, that is to say, the conception of space as a coherent, homogenous whole, which can consequently be bought and exchanged in the same manner as any other commodity: “Abstract space is a planned and organised space, thought rather than lived, and known conceptually rather than directly experienced.” (Pike, 107) But while modernist space is typically understood to have had no place for the individual, everyday contingency of the city dweller, the Tube Map can be seen to have perpetuated the possibility of individual reverie even as it constrained its limits—and according to Pike it is to this factor that the phenomenal popularity of the Tube Map is to be attributed.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> “While it makes the tube into a closed system, the map also retains the possibility of such an infinite journey through an alternate London space”(Pike, 112). In concluding, Pike speculates that this freedom was facilitated by the primary feature borrowed from its failed predecessors: the bright colours that remain a Victorian trace in Beck’s modernist work of art. Pike continues:

	    Thus, in Pike’s analysis, the Tube Map owes its success to a variation on mainstream modernist practice—the conservation of an oneiric pleasure in an otherwise abstract, rationally organised space. But the Tube Map is, of course, merely one artefact among many to result from the history of modernist innovation in relation to the London Underground, opening up the possibility that the synthesis embodied by Beck’s Map might represent the culmination of a specifically London-based modernist aesthetic. The patronage of postimpressionist artists in the interwar years by the Underground is now common knowledge, having featured in many beautiful, profusely illustrated books published by Capital Transport. Yet there is surprisingly little criticism on the English avant-garde’s intense interaction with the tube-network. Richard Cork provided only a brief overview in an essay on Eduardo Paolozzi’s mosaics at Tottenham Court Road; and, though Michael Saler has produced a remarkable and comprehensive reassessment of the extent of the modernist achievement in England, the focus in his work is very much on the personality of Frank Pick, the executive officer of the Underground and the man behind the company’s innovative design and publicity between the First and Second World Wars. This top-down approach tends to perpetuate the fixed ideas about modernism that Pike has shown to occlude alternative approaches to modern urban space. The specific aesthetic that persuaded artists and architects to channel their energies into the transformation of the London Underground is subsumed into that totalising vision pursued by Frank Pick, who was in any case prepared to take up any product, modernist or not, if it proved to be conducive to the unity of the tube-network. In the following essay, I will establish what the English avant-garde hoped to achieve in participating in the creation of Pick’s Earthly Paradise. I will show that their involvement in this project resulted from a commitment to refashioning the non-places of modernity on a pattern, like that of their continental counterparts, that would impose order on the modern age, but which would preserve that spirit of euphoric reverie that is missing from the schemes of Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe. In so doing, I reveal common ground for future consideration of the fissiparous modernisms that occupied London at this time, facilitating the ongoing re-appraisal of this collective achievement in relation to the international mainstream centred in Paris.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Mapping the Futurist City</h1>
<p>
	      “I travelled by a tube train yesterday,” enthused F.T. Marinetti in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Evening News</span> in March 1912. “I got what I wanted—not enjoyment, but a totally new idea of motion, of speed.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Since the thought that the Tube might excite such a sensation seems somewhat ridiculous today, these remarks should be put in their historical context. The deep-level tube-railways were for the most part less than six years old in 1912,<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> were excavated not with the tried-and-tested “cut-and-cover” technique, whereby a street was uprooted, the railway put in and covered over and the street replaced (the technique used to build the Paris Metro), but with an innovative mechanical shield that forced the tunnels right through the London clay in a vigorous manner that might have been calculated to please a Futurist. (“I had, of course, travelled by tube [sic] in Paris,” remarked Marinetti, “but it was not the same sensation at all.”<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a>) In 1912, the tube-railway was simply the last word in urban transit. Powered by the largest electricalplant in the world at Lots Road, Marinetti’s tube-car would have rattled and swerved through narrow tunnels far below London: the same ecstatic sensation of power and speed he had taken from automobiles, imparted to the Futurist through a mechanism that constituted an entire urban environment!
	    </p>
<p>
	      In Marinetti’s view these new sensations were a reproof to the artists of England. “Turner once painted an engine, but it was a dead engine, just its outside appearance, not its soul, the soul of power and speed.”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> They had failed to capture the spirit of the modern that Marinetti perceived in the tube-railways and in the brilliant-hued motorbuses and in the enormous glaring posters. “London itself is a Futurist City!,”<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Marinetti declared, and the Futurist aesthetic was therefore perfectly adaptable to English conditions. Marinetti himself claimed to be preparing a picture that would show what an English Futurism might look like: “I have an idea which may be developed by one of our artists. But I cannot tell you any more about it yet.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> It is entirely possible that this cryptic remark referred to a painting that has since been lost called <span style="font-style:italic;">The Non-Stop</span> by C.R.W. Nevinson, shown at the London Group exhibition in March 1914. Although no visual record of the work has survived, Richard Cork has observed that contemporary reviews indicate that the piece was a literal fulfilment of Marinetti’s exhortation to the artists of England two years before in <span style="font-style:italic;">Evening News</span>. The critic Frank Rutter recalled that the piece was “a circular picture of the interior of a compartment in a ‘Tube’ in which the vibration of seated res and strap-hangers was kaleidoscopically expressed in vivid bright colours.”<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> According to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Westminster Gazette</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Non-Stop</span> was a “mixture of streaks of light, and fragments of advertisements, and curves, and colour, with lines that suggest straphangers here and there.”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> And with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Non-Stop</span> in mind, P.G. Konody in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Observer</span> declared of C.R.W. Nevinson that
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		He is obsessed with the idea of speed, devotes himself to conveying by pictorial means the sensation of speed in railway trains, and other means of movement by displacing objects, making them penetrate each other, in fact, making several movements simultaneous.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      Having garnered more newspaper attention than any other work at the London Group exhibition, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Non-Stop</span> had established the Tube as a key symbol of that spirit of modernity that the English avant-garde would have to engage with if they were to take up the challenge posed by Marinetti.
	    </p>
<p>
	      But such a straightforward application of Futurist theory to English material was untypical. In fact, the single instance in which the Tube is used as a symbol for a Futurist vision of urban modernity occurs in a story by Russian science-fiction novelist  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Yevgeny Zamyatin, written in 1917, shortly after his sojourn in the UK. In “The Fisher of Men” the Tube is the sweltering belly to an urban-organism brimming over with physical vitality, wherein “the frenzied blood pulsated and sped more frantically along the resounding concrete tubes.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> When London is subjected to aerial bombardment, it is to the white tiled catacombs of the Tube that the city’s inhabitants retreat:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		They clung on to the footboards and then with a roar sped along the tubes, without caring where they were going and got off without caring where they were. They crowded together in the delirious underground world with its concrete sky hanging over them, its confusion of caves, staircases, suns, kiosks, vending machines.
	      </p>
<div class="attrib">

	      </div>
</blockquote>
<p>
		The English avant-garde were to take up the challenge of Marinetti very much on their own terms. In fact, Nevinson’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Non-Stop</span> only seems to have received so much press-coverage because it was already considered to be relatively intelligible, compared to the latest work shown at the London Group exhibition by artists such as Wyndham Lewis and David Bomberg, who were moving towards the new aesthetic that was soon to be called Vorticism. Lewis believed that Futurism had its points, but as he explained to the incredulous Marinetti in a water-closet one day: “We’ve had machines here in England for a donkey’s years. They’re no novelty to <span style="font-style:italic;">us</span>.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> In Lewis’s view the Futurist’s ecstasy at tube-railways and automobiles could only appear naïve or romantic or even absurd in England, where the impressionism of speed had been memorably expressed some years earlier, in that decidedly un-modernist text, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wind In The Willows</span> , by Mr. Toad of Toad Hall: “Here to-day—in next week to-morrow! Villages skipped, towns and cities jumped—always somebody else’s horizon! O bliss! O poop-poop! O my! O my!”<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Marinetti’s rapturous response to the Tube is precisely a case in point. The Italian had perceived merely a new idea of motion and speed. His English counterparts would have been better informed.
	      </p>
<p>
		The creation of the Tube represented a particularly traumatic event in the socioeconomic history of the UK. The earliest tube-railways had been widely considered symptomatic of the threat posed by American innovation and investment to British technological, economic, and political supremacy. The introduction of open-plan American <span style="font-style:italic;">cars</span>, for instance, and a uniform fare, was often seen with horror to impose a foreign vision of social equality upon London.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> And this anxiety on the part of the English toward their new tube-railways had become outright hostility when two American financial tycoons—Charles Tyson Yerkes and J. Pierpont Morgan—began to buy up the rights to construct lines under London, battling it out amongst themselves as each struggled to control the capital’s transport infrastructure. American business methods had provoked outrage at every level of national life, from the pages of the satirical magazine Punch to the floor of the House of Commons. The new idea of motion that Marinetti perceived in the Tube would thus be hard for English writers and artists to embrace without reservation, entangled as it was with the ruthless capitalism that had forced the tunnels through the London clay. In fact, with its enormous glaring posters and tiled stations, built to a formulaic pattern in a prescient attempt at  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> corporate branding, the Tube continued to present Londoners with an overwhelmingly Americanised environment, which anticipated by many years the chief characteristics of those international spaces spawned by Late Capitalism such as motorways, airports, or supermarkets, which Marc Augé has since christened Non-place: a virtual environment that seems to be everywhere and nowhere, entirely cut off from local topography and re-presented to the passenger-consumer through the medium of maps, images, and texts.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>
		English artists seem to have held few illusions regarding the political significance of the Tube. In his mural for the Omega Workshop project <span style="font-style:italic;">Scenes of Contemporary London Life</span> (1916–1917), Roger Fry depicted the Underground as the polar opposite of everything that Marinetti had celebrated. The mural shows a weary woman slogging up the steps of a tube-station under the company’s roundel. Excessively large and oppressive, the scarlet circle presses down upon the woman’s hat, the angular border pushing into her face. Far from being caught up in a new idea of speed the woman-passenger is hampered by the bleak confluence of angular planes produced by wall and stair-rail. And on the blocked-up doorway in the room’s wall, Fry painted a railway bookstall, fitted out with newspapers and publicity material (including an advertisement for the Omega Workshop!), reinforcing the corporate connotations carried by the roundel, and reflecting the fact that the Tube is a heavily mediated space produced by a new global brand of consumer-capitalism.
	      </p>
<p>
		If the English avant-garde were to successfully capture the spirit of the modern world they would first have to take into account their own problematic perception of the space picked out by Marinetti as its embodiment. This struggle surfaces in a cluster of Imagist poems published shortly before WWI, reproduced by Andrew Thacker in his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Moving Through Modernity</span> . As Thacker notes, Marinetti may have influenced the Imagists, but the latter group never quite eulogised machinery in the manner of the Futurists: “For Imagism transport represented a modern world redolent with anxieties as well as mechanical delights.”<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> F.S. Flint’s lyric “Tube” was first published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Egoist</span> in January 1914, and presents an unspoken address to a second person who examines his or her fellow passengers in vain for a sign, for a light in their eyes. But the passengers are said to sit stolid, lulled by the roar of the train in the tube, content with the electric light, assured, comfortable, warm: “this is the mass, inert; / intent on being the mass, / unalarmed, undisturbed.”<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> The speaker’s despair is momentarily alleviated by the reflection that he and his companion are a “spirit that moves.” The phrase possesses a Futurist flavour, and this suspicion is confirmed by the subsequent lines in which the speaker claims that this spirit of movement is imbued with a transformative potential: “we leaven the mass, / and it changes; / we sweeten the mass, / or the world / would stink in the ether.” The new idea of motion and speed celebrated by the Italian is re-situated in the re of the intellectual—providing him with the means to humanise <span style="font-style:italic;">non-place</span>. The Underground is depicted by Flint as a psychopathological space that might be rendered a habitat through something rather like Marinetti’s urban aestheticism.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
		Thacker is therefore not entirely correct in saying that “What Imagist poetry celebrated in the machinery of the Underground was not necessarily speed, but rather its ability to stage a poetic encounter which could stress fixity amid the vertiginous bustle of modernity.” (Thacker, 86). On the contrary, Flint’s Tube is rather like Marinetti’s “dead engine”: a technological space that has to be transformed into a <span style="font-style:italic;">metaphor—</span>a vehicle for movement—through the moving spirit of the artist. According to the Imagist Richard Aldington what is new in Flint’s poetry is not the objective so much as the rigour of the form through which the poet seeks to reconcile us to a forced existence in a “gloomy-market-prison-metropolis.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> In an article published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Egoist</span> in May 1915, Aldington writes, “The escape is not to be found in chanting of abstract chimneys and racing automobiles, in ecstatic sentimentalizing over super-aeroplanes and turbines, and such-like romantic balderdash.” Instead,
	      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		  there is an escape from artificiality and sentimentality in poetry, and that is by rendering the moods, the emotions, the impressions of a single, sensitized personality confronted by the phenomena of modern life, and by expressing these moods accurately, in concrete, precise, racy language.
		</p>
<div class="attrib">
		  
		</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		  And in a poem printed in that same issue, Aldington proceeded to show exactly what he meant. “In the Tube” begins with the poet-protagonist stumbling into a tube-car and surveying

<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>

<p class="continued">
		  These faces once again lack the spirit of movement; and this phenomenon is heightened by their juxtaposition with a material environment so dynamic it even serves to lend these apparitions the illusion of vitality. But where Flint’s passengers were merely inert, Aldington’s express their antipathy to the poet through their very fixity.

<p>
		  As well as an Imagist, Aldington was a signatory of the Vorticist Manifesto published in the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">BLAST</span> in June 1914, and his poem could be interpreted as a polemical illustration of the variation in the Futurist and Vorticist response to the mediated spaces of the modern world. The opposition between the inert passengers content to be carried by the mechanical means of conveyance laid on by their market-prisonmetropolis, and that moving spirit of the artist, which re-fashions modern life in concrete, precise and racy language, is set out in the following passage by Ezra Pound, when he contrasts those who think of man “as the TOY of circumstance, as the plastic substance RECEIVING impressions” with people like himself who “think of him as DIRECTING a certain fluid force against circumstance, as CONCEIVING instead of merely observing and reflecting.”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> As Rod Mengham has demonstrated, this is in fact the fundamental difference between Futurism and Vorticism:
		</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		    an antithesis that might help to differentiate between two very different artistic enthusiasms for the machine, the one accompanied by a zest for adrenalin, the other by a respect for order; between the Futurist embrace of sheer dynamism and what we might now think of as the kinematic priorities of Vorticism.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p>
		  Rather than submitting in awe to the new idea of motion and speed embodied by the Tube, the Vorticists followed Flint in situating the moving spirit of the modern world within the artist: “In a Vorticist Universe we don’t get excited at what we have invented,” Wyndham Lewis, ringleader of the Great English Vortex, declared in <span style="font-style:italic;">BLAST</span>; “If we did it would look as though it had been a fluke.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Thus, in Lewis’s highly experimental play, “Enemy of the Stars,” the spirit of movement in the Tube is a symbol for the creativity possessed by the Artist. The play is set just south of the Arctic Circle, where the characters Hanp and Arghol live together in a hut at the bottom of a pit. Arghol is the Artist: he has fled from the city to the wilderness, where he dwells in abject poverty, and is beaten regularly by Hanp, who stands for the hateful mass of humanity that both envies and despises the Artist. The Tube is referred to in the Stage Arrangements: “A GUST, SUCH AS IS MET IN THE CORRIDORS OF THE TUBE, MAKES THEIR CLOTHES SHIVER OR FLAP, AND BLARES UP THEIR VOICES.”<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> In addition to reinforcing the bleakness of the locality, this reference to the unseen forces at work in the Tube evokes Arghol’s “underworld of energy and rebellious muscles” , which ultimately initiates the action of the play. And the Tube was to do so again in Lewis’s work; providing a locus for the violent but potentially redemptive force of the modern artist in a short sketch published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Egoist</span> in March 1916 which depicts a young soldier in the Tube:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		    This young man was strung to a proud discipline. He was a youthful favourite of Death’s something like a sparring partner. He had the equivalent of chewing-gum, too, in the cynical glitter of his face, and his lazy posing.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		  Lewis compares the “profound and sinister business” of the soldier to the “functional existence” of the woman, and concludes that our vigorous world would “certainly maul the Constellation of Hercules if that misguided organisation should come in our direction” . Given the polemical stance taken by <span style="font-style:italic;">BLAST 2</span> against the German Empire, it seems likely that this militant constellation is a symbol for the Kaiser, and the playful, aggressive, disciplined force of the soldier (problematic in the notorious short-story “Cantleman’s Spring-Mate”) is here a straightforward paradigm for the Vorticist.

		  But the clearest expression of the Vorticist response to the forces at work in the new urban spaces exemplified by the Tube is to be found in Lewis’s short-story collection <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wild Body</span> , in an essay called “The Meaning of the Wild Body.” Seeking to explain his theory of the comic, Lewis remembers how, one day in the Underground, as the train was moving out of the station, “I and those around me saw a fat but active man run along, and deftly project himself between the sliding doors, which he pushed to behind him.”<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Although there was nothing especially funny about his face or general appearance, “his running, neat, deliberate, but clumsy embarkation, <span style="font-style:italic;">combined with the coolness of his eye</span>, had a ludicrous effect, to which several of us responded.”<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> According to Lewis it was <span style="font-style:italic;">the eye</span> that was the key to the absurdity of the effect:
		</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		    It seemed to say, as he propelled his sack of potatoes—that is himself—along the platform, and as he successfully landed the sack in the carriage:—‘I’ve not much “power”, I may just manage it:—yes just!’ Then in response to our gazing eyes, ‘Yes, that’s me! That was not so bad, was it? When you run a line of potatoes like ME, you get the knack of them: but they take a bit of moving.’
		  </p>
<div class="attrib">
		    
		  </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		    This incident perfectly illustrates Lewis’s view that the root of the comic is to be found in detachment. The new idea of motion that Marinetti experienced in the Tube was less marvellous than the fact that sacks of potatoes like ourselves should move of our own will at all. The Tube can only reinforce our sense of ourselves as fundamentally material objects: and this can result either in the slavish response of Marinetti and Aldington’s passengers, or in the liberating detachment of the fat man who has not made the mistake of identifying “himself with his machine” . The modern urban space of the Underground therefore possessed, in Lewis’s view, potential for profound human comedy: where Aldington’s precise language had tried to neutralise a threat, the polished sides of the Great English Vortex would instead celebrate its comic mastery of the material-world.

<p> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p class="continued">
		  The result was a highly cartographic art:—one has only to flick through the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">BLAST</span> to see that this re-ordering of the forces at work in the space of the modern world increasingly came to resemble the two-dimensional format of the map or schematic plan. The process is incomplete in the first issue, where the image that best illustrates this tendency is Lewis’s “Plan of War,” but by July 1915 “The Island of Laputa” and “Atlantic City” by H. Sanders, “Hyde Park” by Frederick Etchells, “Design for ‘Red Duet’” by Lewis, and “Rotterdam” by Edward Wadsworth (that is, every image of a modern landscape featured in the second issue) can be seen to evoke the form of the map or diagram. In this respect, the Vorticist Aesthetic rather recalls the urban redevelopment projects of the modernist mainstream—which, it will be remembered, set out “to control the chaotic, ungraspable reality of the modern city through color-coding, straight lines, and diagonal cuts” (Pike, 104–105). In fact, the momentous introduction of Le Corbusier’s architectural theories to the English-speaking world might have been a consequence of their perceived resemblance to the Vorticist Aesthetic. The English translation of <span style="font-style:italic;">Vers Une Architecture</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Urbanisme</span> were both undertaken by the Vorticist Frederick Etchells, who believed that the main thesis of the book translated as <span style="font-style:italic;">The City of To-morrow and Its Planning</span> , “is that such a vast and complicated machine as the modern great city can only be made adequately to function on the basis of a strict order.”<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Le Corbusier had denied that his theories indulged the mere fancy of some neurotic passion for speed, noting that speed is now a brutal necessity and that western cities must reorganise these mechanical forces on an orderly rational plan, like that for a “City of Three Million Inhabitants”. “This is no dangerous futurism, a sort of literary dynamite flung violently at the spectator,” Le Corbusier explained. “It is a spectacle organized by an Architecture which uses plastic resources for the modulation of forms seen in light” . It must have seemed that Le Corbusier was fulfilling in the field of town-planning what the Vorticists had hoped to achieve in graphic art. Etchells’s eagerness to re-situate Le Corbusier’s thought within the framework of the English discourse of the London Underground is signalled by his curious decision to change the word “metro” to “tube” throughout and to reproduce a full-page sectional image of the rebuilt Piccadilly Circus Tube Station in his introduction, as an illustration of the menace posed by mechanised forces lacking in organisation.
		</p>
<p>
		  But having pointed out this shared emphasis on mapping one should note that the effect the Vorticist hoped to achieve was rather different to that for which Le Corbusier was striving with his “City of Three Million Inhabitants.” For if the Vorticists rejected the Futurism of Marinetti, they were equally unsatisfied with the lifeless formalism of the Cubism that had inspired Le Corbusier: “Picasso’s structures are not ENERGETIC ones, in the sense that they are very static dwelling houses,” wrote Lewis. “They are inappropriate in the construction of a man, where however rigid the form may be, there should be at least the suggestions of life and displacement that you get in a machine.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> As Andrzej Gasiorek observes (in an essay that contrasts Lewis’s views on the role modernist architecture should play in regenerating society with Le Corbusier’s), if Lewis argues in favour of re-ordering and regulating life he also fears that the process of rationalisation may have dystopian consequences, speculating that  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> society “might become as mechanical as a tremendous insect world, all our awakened reason entirely disappeared,” and that we might finally be “overpowered by our creation”. <a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> In contrast, as Paul Edwards notes, the typical Vorticist design was not directly transferable to architecture:
		</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		    To be true to the two-dimensional multivalency of the pictures, the architecture would need its own form of three-dimensional multivalency, preserving the pictures’ suggestion of multiplying life’s possibilities instead of imposing on the user of the building a univalent experience.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		  Where the International Style was solemn, uniform, and closed, a Lewisian architecture would have been zestful, pluralistic, and open, “would have as its aim to increase gusto and belief in life, to use our inventions to enjoy all the possibilities of organic life experienced by other species without being reduced to animal or mechanical functionalism” . In calling for the forces that constitute the modern metropolis to be reorganised in line with the brash, colourful, open-ended forms developed by the Vorticists, in <span style="font-style:italic;">BLAST</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Caliph’s Design</span> , Lewis’s primary objective was to enhance the oneiric urban pleasures celebrated by Marinetti, which would turn out to have no place in the functional International Style.
		</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Sets for a Movie about Babylon</h1>
<p>
		  Lewis believed the Vorticist movement should aim for nothing short of a physical reordering of the visible part of the modern world. He noted in his journal <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tryo:</span></p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		    A man might be unacquainted with the very existence of a certain movement in art, and yet his life would be modified directly if the street he walked down took a certain shape, at the dictates of an architect under the spell of that movement, whatever it were.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		  He continued, “To take a small example, the posters on the hoardings and in the tubes to-day [1922] would not be quite what they are [ . . . ] if painters and draughtsmen in their studios had not done paintings [ . . . ] of a certain type, during the last ten years”. In Lewis’s opinion this program of renewal would do well to begin with the reinvention of commercial art, particularly the commercial art that appeared in the Tube:
		</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		    [ . . . ] if Tube Posters, Magazine Covers, Advertisement and Commercial Art generally, were ABSTRACT, in the sense that our paintings at present are, they would be far less harmful to the EYE, and thence to the minds, of the Public.
		  </p>
<div class="attrib">
		    (Lewis, <span style="font-style:italic;">Blast 2</span>, 47)
		  </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		    Lewis had intuitively understood that our day-to-day experience of modernity is heavily mediated by corporate images and text, and believed that, in imposing their orderly aesthetic upon the medium of the advert, the Vorticists could move very far very quickly toward the production of a space conducive to cultural revolution.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
		    His choice of the Tube as a starting point was no coincidence. As shown in the previous section, the London Underground possessed a peculiar symbolic resonance for the Vorticist. Its reordering would constitute a final victory over the vision of the Futurist City in the very space that Marinetti had declared to be a paradigm of the modern world. By the time Lewis published <span style="font-style:italic;">The Caliph’s Design</span>, the Tube’s status as such in the discourse of the English avant-garde had been confirmed time and time again by those writers who wished to express their own view on the proper relationship that should exist between the space of modernity and the art of the moderns. Perhaps the most notable instance occurs in T.S. Eliot’s famous review of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sacre du Printemps</span>, published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Dial</span> in 1921. Eliot was careful to include the “roar of the underground railway” among the “barbaric cries of modern life” that Igor Stravinsky had related to the rhythm of the steppes and transformed into music. Since this emphasis on “interpenetration and metamorphosis” has been interpreted as an important preliminary to the mythic method of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>, it is interesting to note that in praising this reorganisation of modern barbarity into a formally-ordered composition Eliot is echoing a central element in the Vorticist Aesthetic.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>
		    In fact, the symbolic resonance of the Tube for self-consciously modern writers and artists had become such a commonplace that it even became the subject of satire in Aldous Huxley’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Crome Yellow</span> . In this novel, the monstrous intellectual Mr. Scogan explains that he prefers the modern style of painting because he likes to see pictures from which nature has been completely banished—exclusively the product of the human mind—and that this is why he always chooses to travels by Tube:
		  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		      For, travelling by bus, one can’t avoid seeing, even in London, a few stray works of God— the sky, for example, an occasional tree, the flowers in the window-boxes. But travel by Tube and you see nothing but the works of man—iron riveted into geometrical forms, straight lines of concrete, patterned expanses of tiles. All is human and the product of friendly and comprehensible minds. All philosophies and all religions—what are they but spiritual Tubes bored through the universe! Through these narrow tunnels, where all is recognizably human, one travels comfortable and secure, contriving to forget that all round and below and above them stretches the blind mass of earth, endless and unexplored. Yes, give me the Tube and Cubismus every time

</blockquote>
<p>
			But it must have appeared far from probable in the early twenties that the Vorticists would in fact have the chance to make-over this richly resonant space in line with their aesthetic. Frank Pick, the Publicity Manager for the Underground Group, had certainly achieved something of a reputation for innovative design. Frank Pick had commissioned the radical sans-serif type-face and the roundel for the station-signs (which subsequently became one of the earliest corporate logos) from typographer Edward Johnston. He had ventured into the hitherto disreputable poster-industry, commissioning posters from E. McKnight Kauffer and F. Gregory Brown. But, prior to the inter-war period, Pick’s interest in modern art had hitherto extended no further than the Impressionists. Moreover, the vast bulk of the pictorial material he had commissioned up to this point had been in exactly that tired style of poster-art (by Frank Brangwyn and his ilk)  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that Lewis had attacked in <span style="font-style:italic;">BLAST</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Caliph’s Design</span>: “the sugary couple on the walls of the Tube, that utter their melancholy joke and lure you to the saloons of the Hackney Furnishing Company” (Lewis, <span style="font-style:italic;">Caliph</span>, 132).
		      </p>
<p>
			But, set aside for one moment, the style in which such early posters were produced and one can see much the same preoccupation with movement, modernity and mapping that had so preoccupied the avant-garde. The emphasis upon movement and modernity is particularly evident in two posters by Charles Sharland: <span style="font-style:italic;">Light, Power and Speed</span>  depicts new trains brought into use following the electrification of the system in 1905, while <span style="font-style:italic;">Paddington New Station</span>  presents a sectional image of the first moving-staircase in the UK, introduced at Earl’s Court Station in 1911.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> Furthermore, a need, like that of the Vorticists, to refashion the spaces of urban modernity emerges in a series of posters, such as the famous image by John Hassall in which an elderly couple ask their way of a policeman who silently jerks a thumb to a map of the system on the wall of a tube-station.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> As Michael T. Saler shows, Pick believed London was a terrifying sprawl, and sought to promote a public image of the tube-network as an integrated entity, in order to achieve in microcosm that organic unity he had failed to find in urban modernity.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>
			Pick’s objectives thus had much in common with those of the Vorticist Aesthetic. Perhaps Pick realised this when he saw an image by Nevinson, on a poster to advertise an exhibition of war-paintings in the Tube in 1918. In this image Nevinson’s fluid Futurism had hardened into the angular energy that is such a marked characteristic of Vorticist Art. The arresting impact of this poster is reflected in the prominent reference to the artist in Walter Bayes’s painting of exhausted Londoners sheltering from aerial bombardment, in the station at Elephant &amp; Castle, called <span style="font-style:italic;">The Underworld</span> . However this may be, soon after the appearance of this poster Pick began to commission posters from E. McKnight Kauffer that reflected that artist’s intense involvement in the Vorticist Movement.
		      </p>
<p>
			McKnight Kauffer came to England in 1914, and found work with the Underground Group through the commercial-artist John Hassall, producing posters that depict rural landscapes near London in a style that combines elements from Van Gogh, Fauvism, and Art Nouveau. Kauffer’s engagement with the Vorticist Movement first became evident in 1917, following the creation of a striking image called <span style="font-style:italic;">Flight</span> (subsequently converted into the poster that launched the <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Herald</span> in March 1919). The first version of this image is in the form of a woodcut, a vehicle favoured by several Vorticist artists, such as Edward Wadsworth and David Bomberg, and the final version perfectly exemplifies the incorporation of the Futurist impressionism of speed into a formal geometric pattern that serves to amplify the sensation of movement.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>
			In that same spring Kauffer became Secretary to the London Group and produced posters for their exhibitions and for commercial clients that reflected his increasing fascination with Vorticism, such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Winter Sale at Derry &amp; Toms</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Vigil the Pure Silk</span> for Walkers Brothers, and was instrumental in encouraging Wyndham Lewis to resurrect the English Vortex as X Group in 1920 . According to Mark Haworth-Booth, the X Group exhibition was “the last flourish of Vorticism,” but while the failure of X  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Group certainly marks the end of the Great English Vortex as an organisation, it also heralded the period in which the peculiar aesthetic developed by the Vorticists enjoyed its greatest popularity . In fact, some of the most brilliant, and by far and away the most influential, plastic art in the style came in the years following the fall of X Group, as Pick permitted former Vorticists to realise their ambitions for the reordering of the metropolis in projects commissioned by the Underground Group. Not least among these belated works of art were the striking posters in which Kauffer found an outlet for his interest in the Vorticist Aesthetic. As Lewis later remarked, Kauffer “disappeared as it were belowground, and the tunnels of the ‘Tube’ became thenceforth his subterranean picture galleries” (Lewis, <span style="font-style:italic;">Blasting,</span> 212).
		      </p>
<p>
			Kauffer’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Winter Sales are best reached Underground</span>  was the first produced for Pick in the Vorticist style, and was described by Roger Fry as a “fascinating silhouette of dark forms to begin with, and out of these forms gradually disengage themselves hints of the flutter of mackintoshes blown by a gusty wind, of the straining forms pushing diagonally across the driving rain.”<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> According to Fry, this poster marked a move toward abstract form: “the familiar shapes of such a scene are taken as the bricks to build up a most intriguing pattern”.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> Kauffer’s Vorticism soon manifested itself again in a series to promote various museums commissioned by the Underground Group between 1922 and 1923. Angular patterns convey the inorganic growth of crystal in the poster for the <span style="font-style:italic;">London Museum of Practical Geology</span>, and recall images produced by Lewis shortly before WWI. And as Haworth-Booth observes, the spectacular stylised flames that evoke the Great Fire of London in the poster <span style="font-style:italic;">London History at the London Museum</span> are almost certainly derived from Edward Wadsworth’s woodcut <span style="font-style:italic;">Black Country, Blast Furnace</span>  (34, 6). But the final poster with the title <span style="font-style:italic;">Winter Sales are best reached by Underground</span>  is by far the most successful application of the Vorticist Aesthetic to the commercial medium of poster-art.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> Inessentials are stripped from bold blocks of colour held in a tense network of forces. Two female shapes barely sheltered by umbrellas swept about like the folds of their coats move between bars of rain that are slanted to strike them, but are sustained by curves of warm brown and red that move the eye on to the entrance of a tube-station. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Winter Sales,</span> Kauffer perfectly captures the spirit of movement embodied by the metropolis in a brilliant two-dimensional plan thereby enhancing, through the change posters effected in the semiotic space through which the passenger moved, the element of reverie in travelling by Underground.
		      </p>
<p>
			Inevitably these experiments provoked a ferocious backlash from reactionaries. Following the appearance of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Winter Sales</span>, the Advertising Manager at <span style="font-style:italic;">Pear’s</span>, took Kauffer to task in an attack that seems to have extended to the artist’s earlier work.

			The hostility rumbled on throughout Kauffer’s Vorticist Period, culminating in the coinage of the term “McKnightmare” in a trade journal in 1924 . This constant criticism may have provoked Kauffer’s retreat into a tamer style. Though it is impossible to tell whether this retreat took place at Pick’s instigation or on the artist’s own initiative, it is certainly the case that some years were to pass before Kauffer again produced posters in as strident a modernist style as that employed in <span style="font-style:italic;">Winter Sales</span>.

<p>
			Fortunately, the Advertising Manager at <span style="font-style:italic;">Pear’s</span> was correct in at least one respect. Kauffer’s Vorticist Period had indeed proven very popular with the “higher thought.” The wry tone in which Evelyn Waugh’s Charles Ryder confesses to hanging Kauffer posters on his college wall in <span style="font-style:italic;">Brideshead Revisited</span> may even suggest that in the early twenties Kauffer possessed something like the highly paradoxical combination of mass-popularity and counter-cultural cool currently enjoyed by the street-artist Banksy.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> And this support may well have encouraged Kauffer to work back toward a modernist style in the posters he produced for the Underground Group from the late twenties—a style more rigorously oriented to the medium than his early efforts, but which retained that peculiar fusion of mapping and movement that characterised the Vorticist Aesthetic.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> The most perfect example of this new style is <span style="font-style:italic;">Power—the Nerve Centre of London’s Underground</span> .<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> In this poster, text and image are integrated into a design wherein a rudimentary representation of the power-station that generated electricity for the network is shown superimposed upon what seems a swirling dynamo about the corporate logo, from which lashes out sinuous and sinewy a black and blue-veined fore-arm and fist that strikes a bolt of jagged energy at the word “Underground.”
		      </p>
<p>
			The triumph of the Vorticist Aesthetic in the Tube opened the medium of the poster to other members of the avant-garde in England. Clive Gardiner, C.R.W. Nevinson, Edward Bawden, Eric Ravilious, and Edward Wadsworth, and leading res with an international profile, such as Man Ray, Zero (Hans Schleger), and Lazslo Moholy-Nagy, were all commissioned to produce posters for the London Underground.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> And soon other corporations, such as Cunard and Shell-Mex, began to emulate the Underground Group’s success, commissioning innovative poster-art from Kauffer throughout the thirties.<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> Through Kauffer’s tube-posters Vorticism achieved an immeasurable impact on the field of commercial art, and on the mediated spaces that are such an important component in the non-places of the modern world more generally. Without the example of Kauffer, Beck’s Tube Map, with its bright colours and orderly abstraction, would have been unthinkable, and such schematic maps have, of course, become an integral element what Augé termed the non-place.
		      </p>
<p>
			Kauffer’s success also paved the way for the reordering of the physical space of the metropolis in line with the Vorticist Aesthetic—as Pick sought to apply the modernist principles Kauffer exemplified in poster-art to the architectural composition of the city itself. The most highly publicised instance of this process was the fateful decision to commission sculpture from Jacob Epstein, for the Underground Group’s Headquarters Building at 55 Broadway, in 1928. Epstein had been a leading member of the Vorticist Movement. As Cork has noted, the sculptor had in fact been instrumental in persuading Ezra Pound that a new initiative in modern British art was worth supporting: “So far as I am concerned,” Pound wrote, “Jacob Epstein was the first person who came talking about ‘form, not the <span style="font-style:italic;">form of anything’.</span>”<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
<p>
			Epstein’s sculptures for the Underground Group were to achieve an international exposure unlike that previously accorded to any other piece of modernist art produced in the United Kingdom. As Henry Moore later observed, “he took the brickbats, he took the insults, he faced the howls of derision … and as far as sculpture in this century is concerned, he took them first”.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> The unveiling of <span style="font-style:italic;">Night</span> on May 24 and <span style="font-style:italic;">Day</span> on July 1, 1929 provoked a barrage of philistinism and xenophobia that was immediate and ferocious. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Daily Telegraph</span>, for instance, described <span style="font-style:italic;">Night</span> as “a great coarse object in debased Indo-Chinese style, representing a creature half-Buddha, half mummy, bearing on its knees a corpse-like child of enormous proportions,”<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> and this report was reprinted in newspapers as far away as Melbourne in Australia and Christchurch in New Zealand. The sculpture <span style="font-style:italic;">Day</span> was too extreme even for Pick. “I have only seen pictures of it, and in these I must say it looks awful,” Pick confessed in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Evening Standard</span>; “But you cannot get the right perspective by taking it by itself. It must be judged in relation to the whole building, and then I think people will not find fault  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>
			Epstein’s two monumental sculptures closely echo the stepped form of 55 Broadway. <a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> Each group features a seated re whose legs suggest the pillars on either side of the door beneath and the first tier of the building, behind which loom the high-rise blocks set back from the street. The seated re in <span style="font-style:italic;">Night</span> is a mother re, remote and sombre, who supports the head of a male re lying in her lap, over whom she passes a huge and powerful hand. The seated re in <span style="font-style:italic;">Day</span> is a father re with a flat fierce face that stares implacably out, who shelters—and seems about to raise—a male child, its head improbably but expressively twisted to face the father, its crotch pushing controversially out at the street, as though rising with the father’s massive hands. Contrary to what Holden believed, each sculpture is responsive to the possibilities presented by its environment. <span style="font-style:italic;">Day</span> is flattened toward the front to take full advantage of the noon sun: the res stand apart from the façade, the effect of their mass amplified by the light, the outline unbroken by shadow. The rounded back serves to emphasise the volume, the latent power of the father re, when the sculpture is viewed from an angle. Combined with the child’s recessive chest, and the forward thrust of the father’s arms, the sculpture seems to have swollen open to the sun, as though the father re’s back were some tremendously thick, stony husk. <span style="font-style:italic;">Night</span> is also very well suited to its situation: positioned on the north side, banished from sunlight, the sculpture is now stained with streaks of moisture and is tarnished with patches of moss and lichen that lend the piece a fitting atmosphere of human neglect and inhuman vitality. To have “stuck” any group on 55 Broadway that paid no regard to Holden’s design would have produced “a very restless effect,” Epstein explained to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Manchester Guardian</span>.<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> Epstein’s sculptures therefore interpret the purpose of the Headquarters Building for the Underground Group—and what they show are elemental godlike res that rouse and lay to rest. Epstein revealed that he had first considered representing the traffic moving in and out of stations, and his final work clearly conveys the powerful, pervasive, and parental control the Underground Group had assumed in the life of the capital.

<p>
			The sculptures of the Four Winds by Eric Gill, Eric Aumonier and Henry Moore, high above <span style="font-style:italic;">Day</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Night</span> serve to reinforce this message. Facing the four points of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the compass, the res emphasise the totalising cathedral-like element in the Headquarters Quarters Building, which, with its cruciform plan, immediately opposite Westminster Abbey, is at once in continuity and in conflict with that embodiment of English history. Though Holden later claimed that the cruciform plan was purely functional, permitting the pedestrian to cut across the site, the monumentality was surely a factor—as Sir William Holford observed—or why the masonry cladding when he might have chosen to highlight his functional steel-frame with glass curtain-walls?<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> With the Headquarters Building Holden re-enacted the cultural <span style="font-style:italic;">tour-de-force</span> effected by the English Cathedral, but through an architecture of horizontal bands and small vertical setbacks that evoked the Babylonian Ziggurat or the bristling energy of the New York skyline: the <span style="font-style:italic;">Evening News</span>, for instance, thought 55 Broadway “perhaps the nearest approach to a skyscraper in London.”<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a> Similarly, while Holden commissioned avant-garde sculptors who would celebrate the Tube’s modernity, power, and speed, he insisted that Epstein carve directly onto the building after the practice in the Middle Ages. 55 Broadway is thus the culmination of an astonishing, London-based variation on the modernist aesthetic. The cathedral skyscraper embossed with the four winds, with day and night, is expressive of a harmonious totality, of a mastery of time and space, even as it evokes the Futuristic City praised by Marinetti and the atavistic urban fantasy Lewis had sought to capture in his plans for a city that would have looked like “sets for a movie about Babylon.”<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>

			Charles Holden had come as close as conceivably possible to realising Lewis’s call for a transformation of the architectural space of modernity in a style congruent with  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the Vorticist Aesthetic. Holden had worked with Epstein when the two collaborated on the building for the British Medical Association: he would therefore have been aware of his colleague’s involvement with the Vorticist Movement, and must have read its pronouncements on the future of architecture with interest. However that may be, it is clear that Holden evolved a singular architectural style that seems rather more closely related to the spirit of Kauffer’s poster-art, for instance, than to the constructions of the Bauhaus. Though his stations on the Morden extension are in the International Style previously little known in England, they possess a historical and topographical resonance absent from the universalist designs of the European mainstream. The folding screens that bear the corporate logo are framed by façades built not in concrete but Portland Stone, a building material with strong historic associations with London. And the station-buildings on the extensions to Cockfosters and Uxbridge follow a similar procedure. These functional box-like structures with their enormous square windows might have been created by Le Corbusier had they not been constructed in the beautiful brick common to southern England. This humane modern architecture is probably inspired by the fusion of German Bauhaus and American Organic Architecture practiced by the Dutch Modernist Willem Dudok; but other elements in these stations remain hard to explain. Holden’s supposedly functional station-architecture is invested with the historically resonant and the futuristically fantastical. Mediaeval stained-glass, wheels with leaf-springs, narrow fin-like towers, a spire like an electrical tesla coil, and the re of an archer like a car’s hood-ornament by Eric Aumonier: Each emphasises the magic of the machine-age metropolis, in a manner that evokes a specifically Vorticist Aesthetic.<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

			This fantastical functionalism found full expression in the re-built Piccadilly Circus. Though entirely practical, facilitating passenger-flow by opening out cramped passages into a single circular space, Holden’s subsurface interchange still fires the imagination. The futuristic ambulatory is plated in Travertine marble, the building material synonymous with Rome; over the escalators a map of the world, painted by Stephen Bone, highlighted the territories controlled by the British Empire; and a clock showing the time at various places about the globe was later installed.<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times</span> declared that the renovated space had been “utterly transformed by modern architecture and modern art into a scene that would make a perfect setting for the finale, or indeed, the opening chorus of an opera.”<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a> With this triumphant reordering of an architectural space at the heart of the metropolis, in a form that combined functional and fantastical, Holden had, in fact, fulfilled the final objective in the Vorticist Manifesto:

<p>
			By the mid-thirties the English avant-garde had transformed the London Underground into Europe’s pre-eminent modernist space, avoiding the pitfalls that awaited the grand plans of Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe, at a time when these, for the most part, remained on the drawing-board. The brightly-coloured but rational map, the fanciful but forceful commercial art, the playful but functional architecture: according to any criteria the Vorticist Project in the Tube must be considered a success that put the achievement of the Parisian Purists at that point in time into the shade. According to any criteria, that is, other than that of the movement itself. The Vorticists had really believed that the revolution of material reality would bring about a cultural revolution, transforming the way in which the public perceived and interacted with the modern world. As Lewis himself later acknowledged, in this they had not been correct. “Though one Kauffer does not make an Underground summer, poster art is somewhat more alive than it was, and a few shop-fronts, here and there, give a ‘modern’ flavour,” he remarked, in an influential review of the Vorticist achievement in the UK:

			  the element of utopian reverie that found no place in the International Style, Vorticist art had still lacked sufficient sensual appeal, resulting in interiors “obviously designed for a particularly puritanic athlete of robotic tastes, with an itch for the rigours of the anchorite, and a sentimental passion for metal as opposed to wood.”<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> But, as Andrzej Gasiorek has convincingly argued, the real fault is surely that, in spite of its sane and humane aesthetic, Vorticism ultimately shared Le Corbusier’s conception of the modern city as a problem, envisaging “a scenario in which <span style="font-style:italic;">design</span> (order) was pitted against the <span style="font-style:italic;">everyday</span> (formlessness) on which it sought to bestow meaning” (Gasiorek, 143). For all its attention to the contingency of the passenger, the transformation of the London Underground was still a totalising plan imposed on the capital by a central authority— a Design Caliph—which in rationalising only served to reinforce the nascent spaces of consumer-capitalism. Henri Lefebvre’s critique of the International Bauhaus can therefore equally be applied to the Vorticist Movement: “The curious thing is that this ‘programmatic’ stance was looked upon at the time as both rational and revolutionary, although in reality it was tailor-made for the state—whether of the state-capitalist of the state-socialist variety.”<a name="f65-text" href="#f65"><sup>65</sup></a> Lewis later confessed that at the time he wrote <span style="font-style:italic;">The Caliph’s Design</span> he had not appreciated the extent to which the “hideous foolishness of our buildings, our statues, our interiors” was matched by the “hideous foolishness” of our social and economic life: “nor how impossible it is, until that core of bottomless foolishness is altered for the better, to acquire the kind of gay intellectual shell that I wished” (Lewis, <span style="font-style:italic;">Rude</span>, 169). In creating a bright, new, and enchanting capital, the Vorticists  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> had produced the blueprint for a Babylon that was more <span style="font-style:italic;">functional</span> than if had it been <span style="font-style:italic;">functionalist</span>. They had perpetuated the spaces of the market-prison-metropolis. They had formulated the Art of Being Ruled.
			</p>
<p>
			  This might explain why the English avant-garde persisted in depicting the Tube as a symbol for an as yet unredeemed Modern World. In W.H. Auden’s “Letter to Lord Byron” , it is “The bowler hat who strap-hangs in the Tube / And kicks the tyrant only in his dreams, / Trading on pathos, dreading all extremes.”<a name="f66-text" href="#f66"><sup>66</sup></a> In Aldous Huxley’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Point Counter Point</span> , a naïve young member of the intelligentsia called Walter Bidlake is shown to approve the nationalisation of the mines, but is unable to stomach sitting next to an elderly man who spits on the floor of the Tube and smokes a pipe that stinks: “Walter looked away; he wished that he could personally like the oppressed and personally hate the rich oppressors.”<a name="f67-text" href="#f67"><sup>67</sup></a> And as Hugh Kenner pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Mechanic Muse</span>, it is the Tube that T.S. Eliot turns into a metaphor for descent to the Underworld in <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Quartets</span>—drawing upon his own experience travelling from South Kensington to Russell Square every day well into his mid-forties: “To change from the one line to the other he had to ‘descend lower,’ as puts it in <span style="font-style:italic;">Burnt Norton</span>. One way down was by spiral stairs, on which you turned and turned the narrow gyre in half-darkness.” Or he could take the lift, an abstention from movement, while the world moved, “in appetency on its metalled ways”.<a name="f68-text" href="#f68"><sup>68</sup></a> In the Underground, Eliot had found a space of alienation that could provide him an objective correlative for the mystical Way of Negation:

The following passage from Jean Rhys’s nightmarish novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Good Morning, Midnight</span> , perfectly illustrates the impasse in which members of the avant-garde in England found themselves—trapped by a space that a modernist aesthetic had helped to shape.

<p>
				From the invasion of the station-platforms in the Blitz depicted by Henry Moore and Bill Brandt, to the station-busking celebrated by Eduardo Paolozzi, to the graffiti-art memorialised by novelist John Healy—every subsequent desecration of the ordered space of the network has found champions among writers and artists in the modernist tradition. Even Metroland, an environment formerly reviled by the intelligentsia, has found champions who recognised it, at long last, as a significant triumph of the individual over the non-places of the Modern World. But in the final section of this article I would like to draw attention to a forgotten modernist masterpiece produced in the inter-war period that already seems to exhibit the shift in perspective prescribed by Lewis.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
				Anthony Asquith’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Underground</span>  is an innovative motion-picture that shares the Vorticist preoccupation with the reordering of urban impressions of speed into a rigorously stylised aesthetic. But this little-known piece is also a celebration of cinema’s long love-affair with urban transport.<a name="f74-text" href="#f74"><sup>74</sup></a> The long opening shot, in which a point of light opens up in the darkness like the iris of a camera to reveal a tube-station rushing to fill the screen, echoes the Lumières short of a train arriving and (swiftly followed by a shot in which elevator-steps slide up over the screen like a film-reel) serves to impress forcibly upon the viewer the intimate bond that exists between the motion picture and the railroad. As Lynne Kirby notes,
			      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
				  As a machine of vision and an instrument for conquering space and time, the train is a mechanical double for the cinema and for the transport of the spectator into fiction, fantasy, and dream. It is a metaphor in the Greek sense of the word: movement, the conveyance of meaning.<a name="f75-text" href="#f75"><sup>75</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
				Kirby speculates that directors were quick to seize on the train for the “sense in which the railway journey provides a contained space and time, a special ‘nowhere’ outside the sphere of normal rules and codes of conduct” . And this observation seems particularly suggestive given the formative role the Tube has played in the development of the <span style="font-style:italic;">non-lieu</span>. In associating the camera with the train, the elevator with the film-reel, Asquith implied that the modern medium of the motion-picture can best represent and make meaningful a non-place that more traditional art-forms had failed to comprehend. Shots that recall the primitive short-films of sensation and spectacle are incorporated into a piece with the haunting symbolism of Expressionist Cinema. Importing a lighting specialist from Germany, and choosing a lead-actress “with the face of a Modigliani,” Asquith produced what is perhaps the UK’s single important contribution to modernist cinema in the silent period.<a name="f76-text" href="#f76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>
				But what sets the film apart from other modernist representations of the Underground by English writers and artists in the interwar period is the unprecedented interest evinced in the everyday lives of the people who use the space: “The ‘Underground’ of the Great Metropolis of the British Empire, with its teeming multitudes of ‘all sorts and conditions of men,’ contributes its share of light and shade, romance and tragedy and all those things that go to make up what we call ‘life.’”<a name="f77-text" href="#f77"><sup>77</sup></a> It is for this reason, the opening title-card explains, that the Underground is the setting for a “story of ordinary work-a-day people”. The sensational shot that opens the movie is thus followed by an intimate sequence set in a packed tube-car that attempts to convey something of the subtle interactions that take place between passengers while they travel to work.
			      </p>
<p>
				There is too little space for a full account of Asquith’s extraordinary motion picture. But the scene in which Bill and Nell fall in love (following the shot of the elevator-steps rising like film-reel) merits special mention: walking in opposite directions, the wrong way up parallel elevators, half-way along the shaft, Bill and Nell appear to be holding back time as they flirt over the barrier as well as gloriously abusing the most functional of spaces in a tube-station. Later, as they stand next to one another apart from the crowd,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> innovative lighting reveals the passion seething beneath their humdrum conversation. The camera pans back to show us what they would like to be doing: when they part, Bill and Nell leave their titanic shadows locked in a fierce kiss.
			      </p>
<p>
				And the finale is also of particular interest. At this crucial moment in the film, Asquith once again chooses to mount the camera on a mechanism for movement (in this instance, a lift), thereby transforming this transport system into a moving picture, an optical instrument for observing the capital that serves to heighten, rather than marginalise, our imaginative and emotional engagement with the space; realising that experience of the city that the Vorticists had sought to capture and refine in their art.<a name="f78-text" href="#f78"><sup>78</sup></a> In this, his first solo project, Asquith had proven that film might easily achieve that end for which more traditional mediums such as painting had struggled so hard: a truly <span style="font-style:italic;">kinematic</span> art.<a name="f79-text" href="#f79"><sup>79</sup></a> An art which pointed a way to move beyond a blueprint for Babylon; the project of making ourselves at home in the modern world.
