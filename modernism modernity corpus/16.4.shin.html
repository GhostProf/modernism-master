<p>
      In 1999, <span style="font-style:italic;">The New York Review of Books</span> reprinted Sylvia Townsend Warner’s first novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span>, as part of its eclectic “Classics” series. Reading this now widely accessible work—first published in 1926—alongside more familiar texts of the period alters our perspective on the landscape of modernist British fiction; but not only, I want to suggest, for the reasons that have thus far been offered. In her introduction to the reprinted novel, Alison Lurie presents <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span> as a revolutionary feminist text disguised as “a charming British fantasy about witchcraft.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> The novel, which has as its protagonist a spinster aunt who becomes a witch in midlife and who delivers an impassioned critique of patriarchal society at its conclusion, was a “surprise international best seller” upon its initial release, and indeed was the first ever Book-of-the-Month Club selection. According to Lurie, Warner’s narrative spoke most to “single women of all ages,” anticipating Virginia Woolf’s radical call for the need of “a room of one’s own.” While Woolf “spoke, we know now, for thousands of women then and in years to come,” Lurie proudly declares that “Sylvia Townsend Warner had spoken for them first” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, xiii). Critics writing both before and after Lurie have largely shared her tendency to read Warner’s earliest published experiment in fiction as a work located firmly within, and to a large extent delimited by, what Brooke Allen has labeled a “purely feminist zone.”<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> That is, when the novel has not been dismissed outright as a work of “total fantasy gratification,” to quote Gillian Beer, <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span>’s radical nature as a feminist tract (whether successful or failed) which uses witchcraft as an allegory for the liberation of European women from everyday  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> oppression, has been taken as the primary reason for recuperating it as a significant work of twentieth-century women’s writing.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
      While such an assessment of the novel’s revolutionary potential is not inaccurate, I would argue that it flattens Warner’s sly, slippery, and perverse text by forcing it into the genre of the manifesto. In this article, I wish to resist the impulse to reduce Warner’s novel to a feminist manifesto by attending to its subtle and reanimating play with works of art. I hope to show how the novel’s feminist engagements cannot be fully appreciated apart from its use of narrative witchcraft, or its deployment of what I call its arts of dispossession. Removed from their frames, Warner reveals in her play with a Leonardo portrait, a Henry Fuseli painting, and a woodcut of a witch hunter, the often stealthy interpenetrations between the realms of aesthetics and politics, narrative, and witchcraft. More than a “charming British fantasy” that masks its radical feminist potential through allegory, <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span> can be read as a fiction that disturbs the imperial grasp and gaze of patriarchal possession through a delicate and devious process of conjuring, animating, and reanimating two-dimensional images. Calling forth each image “rather like the Witch of Endor calling up old Samuel” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 115) (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>), as we are told the landlady and witch, Mrs. Leak, dispassionately conjures up her neighbors through her speech, Warner’s narrative proceeds to manipulate the shape and boundaries of the image, giving each one new lives, and in so doing, coolly evacuating possession of its power. This novel can be read alongside the works of Woolf and other modernist writers, not only for its interest in “the current condition of women,” as Lurie notes (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, xii), but also, and perhaps more interestingly, for its profound revision of the novelistic imagination through its unsettling of works of art, enacting a shift from an aesthetics of creation to one of memory and witness. Regarded in this light, <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span> embodies a far more subtle politics and a more deeply nuanced challenge to the unequal power relations engendered by patriarchy than previous accounts of the novel have yet accounted for.
    </p>
<p>
      One fruitful place in which to begin a reassessment of <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span> and its potential to reshape our conception of Warner’s larger aesthetic and political concerns is at the turning point in the narrative, when its protagonist is driven to make her pact with Satan—or the “loving huntsman,” as he is called in the novel’s original subtitle. Warner here establishes the immediate context for the conversion that will rather sedately shift the novel’s register from realism to fantasy. Laura Willowes—who, after her father’s death, is absorbed into her brother’s household for the next twenty years as the “useful and obliging and negligible” “Aunt Lolly” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 150)—one day startles her family by announcing that she is leaving them to forge a life of her own in the English countryside. Despite their astonished and aggrieved protestations, Laura trusts her mysterious inner visions (of picking plums by night) and inexplicable impulses (to wander alone in cemeteries and desolate woods), and moves to the small village of Great Mop. After an uneasy period of transition Laura finally gains a sense of freedom—the “weight of all her unhappy years” mercifully lifting from her one day in a field of fragrant cowslips—when her nephew Titus arrives like a genial, ruthless emperor. Titus is the only member of her family who has been sympathetic to her  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

      move to the countryside, yet he brings along with him the chains of Laura’s identity as “Aunt Lolly,” his pipe and tobacco pouch lying on his aunt’s mantelpiece like “the orb and sceptre of an usurping monarch” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 145), driving her to “despair and rebellion” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 142). As Titus begins to take root in Great Mop, his colonizing relation to the countryside dispossesses Laura, threatening to turn her into an exile, just as she had been exiled from her childhood home upon her father’s death. When Titus and Laura go for walks together, for instance, “he would sometimes fall silent, turning his head from side to side to browse the warm scent of a clover field”:
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	Once, as they stood on the ridge that guarded the valley from the south-east, he said: “I should like to stroke it”—and he waved his hand towards the pattern of rounded hills embossed with rounded beech-woods. She felt a cold shiver at his words, and turned away her eyes from the landscape that she loved so jealously. Titus could never have spoken so if he had not loved it too.
      </p>
<div class="attrib">
	(<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 147)
      </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	However, Titus’s love is “a horror to her,” and is “different in kind from hers.” “It was comfortable, it was portable, it was a reasonable appreciative appetite, a possessive and masculine love.” That is, he “loved the countryside as if it were a body” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 147). “Commenting, pointing out, appreciating, Titus tweaked her senses one after another as if they were so many bell-ropes,” judging the landscape as his uncle sized up horses, sending silence fleeing out of the fields, threatening to turn the village into “a place like any other place, a pastoral landscape where an aunt walked out with her nephew” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 149). Under Titus’s “discriminating paw” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 148) and through his unwitting usurpation, the landscape, which has lost its unique identity, is colonized, domesticated, and rendered picturesque—essentially fixed and framed as a pictorial object—just as Laura herself was “possessed” by the system that left her with no other option than to take on the role and identity of “Aunt Lolly,” the diminutive name bestowed upon her first by a niece and then by all her relations, in the prime of her life.
      </p>
<p>
	The landscape, like a work of art, like a woman’s body, its rounded hills recalling an earlier description of Titus as an infant, his fat hands sprawled over his mother’s bosom, is seen as inescapably caught within a patriarchal system of ownership that attempts to fix and render things both static and portable. This scene foregrounds the way in which the realm of art and the pictorial is particularly under pressure in <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span>, and it raises the question whether anything in the world of the novel escapes the possessive reach of patriarchy, which extends not only over works of art, landscapes, and material goods, but over territories and entire nations as well. Even at the novel’s conclusion, which has baffled critics (such as Jennifer Nesbitt) intent on reading the novel as a feminist manifesto, Laura remains subject to Satan’s “satisfied but profoundly indifferent ownership” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 222).<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Yet Laura’s escape from, and ultimate victory over, Titus, which is achieved through her unquestioning sense that she has entered into a pact with Satan such that others could not “drive her out, or enslave her spirit any more, nor shake her possession of the place she had chosen” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 159–60), enacts a transformation that allows Laura-as-witch to step outside an imposed pastoral  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and pictorial frame. She is able to elude the ration of herself as an aunt walking out in the landscape with her nephew, allowing us to rere the power relations with which the novel ends. I will return to this conclusion later, but for now a consideration of Warner’s slippery play with three works of art in particular can, I suggest, lead us to revise earlier conceptions of the novel’s feminist potential while still preserving its radical, delightful strangeness.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Lady (Laura) and the Ermine</h1>
<p>
	  Our first glimpse of Laura, outside of the perspective of her sister-in-law Caroline’s thoughts, which are busy planning how to accommodate Laura in her London home, Apsley Terrace, and musing on how black is not becoming for her “pale grey eyes,” is of her “not thinking at all”:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	    She picked a red geranium flower, and was staining her left wrist with the juice of its crushed petals. So, when she was younger, she had stained her pale cheeks, and had bent over the greenhouse tank to see what she looked like. But the greenhouse tank showed only a dark shadowy Laura, very dark and smooth like the lady in the old holy painting that hung in the dining-room and was called the Leonardo.
	  </p>
<div class="attrib">
	    (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 7)
	  </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    We catch in this passage only a play of surfaces, projected upon Laura’s unthinking, blank mind: the reflection of Laura in her younger self as she is looking at her reflection in the waters of the greenhouse tank, which reflects another image—Leonardo’s “lady in the old holy painting,” which itself reflects its original sitter who, however, remains draped in darkness. Against this shadowy smoothness we see briefly the vivid, almost excessively sensual, red of the crushed geranium juice that stains Laura’s wrist and earlier, her cheeks, and which is quickly absorbed in the greenhouse tank. In the play of reflections the image of the “dark shadowy Laura” ripples into that of the lady in Leonardo’s painting and back. Whereas, in Walter Pater’s well-known and often-quoted description of “Lady Lisa,” who is “older than the rocks among which she sits,” and whose beauty is “wrought out from within upon the flesh, the deposit, little cell by cell, of strange thoughts and fantastic reveries and exquisite passions,” we are denied any access to an interior knowledge or history of Laura’s (or Leonardo’s lady) that can be wrought through the lineaments of wrist or cheek, eyelids or hands.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    While no specific painting is referred to or named by the narrator—it is simply the “old holy painting”—it seems likely that Warner had in mind <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady with an Ermine</span> (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>)—a work that helped precipitate a shift in European portraiture from the “psychologically inert” profile pose to the more fluid expression of psychological depth.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> David Bull describes the portrait, which is supposedly of the young Cecilia Gallerani, mistress of the duke Ludovico Sforza, as follows:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      Cecelia seems to be gazing with rapt attention at something, or someone, out of view to the right of the picture. She is supporting the bulk of the ermine’s body with her left  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> hand, while her long, elegant right hand gently touches the animal’s shoulder with an ambiguous mixture of soft caress and firm control. The ermine, poised and alert, looks almost directly at the painter as though on guard for its mistress.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a></p></blockquote>

	    The sitter’s turned head is poised upon her long neck like the ermine’s, with, as Joanna Woods-Marsden observes, the narrative power of this “flexed pose, unprecedented in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> European painting” existing in tension with the legibility of the ermine as symbol.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Indeed, the ermine in the painting has been read iconographically in three ways: as standing in for Cecelia Gallerani herself, with the ermine’s designation in Greek, <span style="font-style:italic;">galee</span>, a “pun on the sitter’s family name”; as a marker of purity because the animal “was believed too fastidious to soil itself”; and as a re for the Duke Ludovico, whose heraldic emblem was an ermine.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> The animal is essentially linked with Laura Willowes in that her full name—in fairy tale fashion connected to the story of her birth and coming-of-age—is Laura <span style="font-style:italic;">Erminia</span> Willowes.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Laura’s father, Everard, we are informed, “was a lover of womankind,” and delights upon the birth of his daughter. Faced with the inappropriateness of setting aside port as he had done with his two sons for her coming-of-age, he hits upon a solution that involves “[g]oing to London upon the mysterious and inadequate pretext of going bald.” Everard returns from the city “with a little string of pearls, small and evenly matched, which exactly fitted the baby’s neck”:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	      Year by year, he explained, the necklace could be extended until it encircled the neck of a grown-up young woman at her first ball. The ball, he went on to say, must take place in winter, for he wished to see Laura trimmed with ermine. “My dear,” said Mrs. Willowes, “the poor girl will look like a Beefeater.” But Everard was not to be put off. A stuffed ermine which he had known as a boy was still his ideal of the enchanted princess, so pure and sleek was it, and so artfully poised the small neat head on the long throat. “Weasel!” exclaimed his wife. “Everard, how dare you love a minx?”
	    </p>
<p>
	      . . . To Everard she seemed his very ermine come to true life. He was in love with her femininity from the moment he set eyes on her. “Oh, the fine little lady!” he cried out when she was first shown to him, wrapped in shawls, and whimpering at the keen sunlight of a frosty December morning.

<p class="continued">
	      Soon after her birth he goes out hunting and returns with the brush of the first kill—“‘’Twas a vixen,’ he said. ‘Such a pretty young vixen. It put me in mind of my own, and I thought I’d ride back to see how she was behaving’” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 15–16). As in the play of Laura’s reflections at the beginning of the novel, we witness (with perhaps a degree of bemusement as well as much amusement) a quick series of slippery Ovidian-like transmutations that constitutes one of the primary aesthetic principles of Warner’s novel. That is, we move from an imagined ermine trim to the stuffed ermine as enchanted princess, to Laura as the ermine reanimated and come to life, and then quickly compared to the hunted and killed vixen whose tail she is presented with. This shape-shifting mirrors the instability of the ermine as signifier in Leonardo’s painting, which can be read, as noted above, both iconographically and as a physical animal, or as both captive and protector, supported and gently probed—controlled and caressed—by the sitter’s enlarged hand with its delicate fingers. Laura herself can be viewed as the lady in the portrait, whose beads encircle her neck and hang down her chest, or as the animal being held (if we agree that <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lady with an Ermine</span> is indeed being conjured by Warner), which is gripped yet still remains elusive. Or Laura can be taken as herself, merely, just as difficult to pin down to any two-dimensional surface as Leonardo’s lady with her  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> ermine. Thus, while the painting by Leonardo is one of the Willowses’s prize possessions, catalogued and inventoried as part of the dowry that Laura’s mother brought to Lady Place upon her marriage to Everard (one of “two oil-paintings by Italian masters which the younger Titus, Emma’s brother, had bought in Rome whilst travelling for his health” [<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 14]), it manages to escape the pervasive system of masculine possession—in part at least—through a process of reanimation and transformation within Warner’s narrative. In referring to Leonardo’s “old holy painting” and playing with the forms of the lady and ermine, the text performs its own mischievous magic—a kind of narrative witchcraft that critics, intent on reading <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span> as a stridently political critique, have so far overlooked.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Leonardo’s lady makes another appearance in the novel during the Witches’ Sabbath that Laura attends after making her pact with Satan. Here, she is brought face to face with a re that she (mistakenly, she discovers afterwards) takes to be Satan joining in the revelries. Laura sees his face and for a moment the possibility that “he was a Chinaman” crosses her mind; “then she saw that he was wearing a mask”:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		The candle-light shone full upon it, but so fine and slight was the modelling that scarcely a shadow marked the indentations of cheek and jaw. The narrow eyes, the slanting brows, the small smiling mouth had a vivid innocent inexpressiveness. It was like the face of a very young girl. Alert and immobile the mask regarded her. And she, entranced, stared back at this imitation face that outwitted all perfections of flesh and blood. It was lifeless, lifeless! But below it, in the hollow of the girlish throat, she saw a flicker of life, a small regular pulse, small and regular as though a pearl necklace slid by under the skin.

<div class="attrib">

<p class="continued">
		The girlish mask, rendered foreign and strange, and the reappearance of the pearl necklace that slips and beats like a “small regular pulse, small and regular” in the hollow of the re’s throat, uncannily bring back the younger Laura and the lady in Leonardo’s painting reflected in the greenhouse tank. This image of the would-be-Satan, actually a young author who has lazily sold his soul for fame at dinner parties, also recalls an earlier description of Laura’s other sister-in-law, Sibyl, who, it seems to Laura, has “exchanged her former look of a pretty ferret for this refined and waxen mask.” This prompts Laura to wonder, “Which, what, was the real Sibyl: the greedy, agile little ferret or the memorial urn?” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 85). Linking together all of these female res, the masked man keeps us in the play of reflections and surfaces, foregrounding the difficulty of probing beneath them and of possessing something that does not immediately elude one’s grasp, displaced or transformed into something else. We are confronted with a frustration of readerly desire to penetrate beneath exteriors— the desire, as Gillian Beer aptly describes in her essay on Warner, “to move closer inside the text than it quite permits.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> In Warner’s novel, as in her other works of fiction, “[e]mpathy is encouraged and then deflected,” a process that largely operates through the process of shape-shifting transformation that is evident in the novel’s play with ladies and ermines (or foxes and ferrets), which are brought to life and death and life again by the playful, quick movements of the narrative voice, darting in with keen observations yet maintaining its distance persistently, ironically—one might even say, devilishly.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<span style="font-style:italic;">The Nightmare</span> and the Secret Country of the Mind</h1>
<p>
		The image of another artist’s painting is also, I would argue, summoned and transformed by Warner in <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span>—Henry Fuseli’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Nightmare</span> (<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>). Laura’s nephew, we are told, is writing a biography of Fuseli:
	      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		  Fuseli—pronounced Foozley—was a neglected re of the utmost importance. The pictures, of course, didn’t matter: Titus supposed there were some at the Tate. It was Fuseli the man, Fuseli the sign of his times, etc., that Titus was going to write about. It had been the ambition of his life to write a book about Fuseli, and his first visit to Great Mop convinced him that this was the perfect place to write it in.
		</p>
<div class="attrib">
		  (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 145)
		</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		  Hovering somewhere between Titus’s idiom and Laura’s—and the narrator’s—tacit, mocking exasperation at his flippantly expressed ambitions (which ignore the work for the man), this passage opens up a space for the reader to spot the utter incongruity between Titus’s literary plans and Fuseli’s works. It is only because the “pictures, of course, don’t matter,” as Titus insists—pictures known for their ability to depict as well as evoke in their viewers an irrational terror—that there is nothing at all out of keeping for Titus in writing a biography of the artist in Great Mop, which is for him a “comfortable lap” like any other (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 148). However, as easily as Titus colonizes Fuseli as a subject for biography (just as he domesticates the landscape, to Laura’s horror), Fuseli’s paintings—<span style="font-style:italic;">The Nightmare</span> in particular—emerge as an uncanny subtext in the novel, conjured up for any reader familiar with the artist’s name and work while remaining unseen, or in the blind spot of the would-be biographer himself.
		</p>
<p>
		  In Fuseli’s painting a sleeping woman in her bedchamber, draped in a sheer white gown, lies stretched on her back, her hair and arms dangling dramatically to the ground.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> A goblin sits astride her stomach, directly facing the viewer in a pose of sinister contemplation with a look that suggests a recognition of complicity, while a horse’s head with glowing eyes stares from the shadows in eerie blankness at the woman’s form. The vulnerability of the woman’s body and the sense that the confined space around her is invaded by these bestial, unreadable forms creates a mood of dread and an awareness of a violation that has both already happened and which is also an inevitability that has yet to occur. As Martin Myrone notes in his study of Fuseli, “<span style="font-style:italic;">The Nightmare</span> in particular is instantly recognisable” as a work by the artist, “reproduced in publications literary, scholarly and popular as an icon of irrational eroticism.”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> This image, evoked in the reader’s mind’s eye by the talk of Fuseli, is conjured and reenvisioned by a later scene that takes place in the “sour field” where Laura makes her pact with Satan, while also rippling backwards to an earlier moment in the novel, set not in any gothic castle or young heroine’s bedroom, but on “the top of Cubbey Ridge, past the ruined windmill that clattered with its torn sails” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 122).
		</p>

		  Before considering this scene on the ridge, let us consider the one that follows close upon the heels of our discovery that Titus is writing a biography of Fuseli. While Laura shows her visiting nephew all of her favorite footpaths in the countryside, she hears a great deal about the artist from Titus, who discourses on Fuseli as they walk.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Because the paths are narrow, “there was seldom room for two to walk abreast, so Titus generally went in front, projecting his voice into the silence.” His words about the artist thus fill the hot summer air and filter back towards his restless aunt, who feels “ashamed of his company,” sensing that the woods, upon seeing her with Titus, are drawing “back scornfully to let them pass by together” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 146). One can imagine Titus’s inflated and suspended speech, spurned by the trees, punctured by the summoned vision of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Nightmare</span> that is to emerge, or perhaps reemerge, and change, before the alert reader.

		  Exasperated by her situation, feeling pushed out from her new home and newfound freedom by her nephew, and driven to escape, Laura concludes bitterly that, “Nothing was left her but this sour field. Even this was not truly hers, for here also Titus walked beside her and called her Aunt Lolly. She was powerless against him. He had no idea how he had havocked her peace of mind, he was making her miserable in the best of faith” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 149). Well-intentioned and even kind, the ruin that Titus brings with him is devastating nonetheless; he lacks the awareness to even detect any resentment in his aunt, who for him is illegible precisely because he has already determined what he will find written upon her countenance. Indeed, when she is with him, “she came to heel and resumed her old employment of being Aunt Lolly.” Blocked both by him and, more powerfully, by her own helpless submission to her former identity as the obliging spinster aunt, Laura determines that “There was no way out.”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

		    In vain she had tried to escape, transient and delusive had been her ecstasies of relief. She had thrown away twenty years of her life like a handful of old rags, but the wind had blown them back again, and dressed her in the old uniform. The wind blew steadily from the old quarter, it was the same east wind that chivied bits of waste paper down Apsley Terrace. And she was the same old Aunt Lolly, so useful and obliging and negligible.

<p class="continued">
		    The field becomes full of “complacent witnesses” in the form of her relations, who, in her imagination, express surprise to find her in this field, struck by the incongruity of her presence in this dim and sultry place, which, in its triangular shape and enclosure on two sides by woodland, takes on a “premature twilight, as though it were a room” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 141). Laura stands “at bay, trembling before them, shaken and sick with the grinding anger of the slave. They were come out to recapture her, they had tracked her down and closed her in. They had let her run a little way—that was all—for they knew they could get her back when they chose. They had stood grinning behind the bushes when she wept in the cowslip field” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 150).
		  </p>
<p>
		    Laura feels them closing in about her, condescending and malevolent, magnanimous and cruelly gleeful in their good intentions, with Titus standing somewhat detached “like a showman” saying, “‘You see, it’s all right. She’s just the same’.” She sees them “all leagued against her. They were come out to seize her soul. They were invulnerably sure of their prey” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 151). Hemmed in by these res, which both comically and terrifyingly obtain the grinning status of the beasts in Fuseli’s painting, with the field transformed into the site of some violation that has already occurred and which has yet to happen, Laura cries out for help against this pressure of claustrophobic inevitability (a pressure so powerfully conveyed by Fuseli’s painting), the sound of her own voice frightening her, echoing in the “impassive wood.” She waits for an answer to her cry yet hears none; however, “the silence that had followed it had been so intent, so deliberate, that it was like a pledge. If any listening power inhabited this place; if any grimly favourable power had been evoked by her cry; then surely a compact had been made, and the pledge irrevocably given” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 151). Thus is her pact with Satan made, unspoken yet understood. Conjured up and transposed from a bedchamber to a sour field that resembles a room, Fuseli’s painting takes on a new life, one in which Laura’s family members become the perpetrators of some unthinkable crime, as invasive as the bestial creatures that impose their presence upon the sleeping re in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Nightmare</span>, becoming both leering witnesses and benevolent oppressors. In this version, though, the woman is awake and not asleep, not silent but forced to cry out, answered by an intent silence, falling out of a private nightmare into a sleepwalking state that offers some means of liberation from the pressing realities she seeks to escape.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Considered in retrospect, an earlier scene in <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span> also seems to call forth and transform Fuseli’s painting, removing it from its frame and challenging its status as an object of possession. Laura climbs to the top of Cubbey Ridge one night on a solitary walk, soon after her move to Great Mop, and feels “the wind swoop down to the earth. The moon was out hunting overhead, her pack of black and white hounds ranged over  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the sky.” Listening to the voices of the wind through the trees, Laura hears “another voice,” the “far-off pulsation of a goods train labouring up a steep cutting”:
		  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		      It was scarcely audible, more perceptible as feeling than as sound, but by its regularity it dominated all the other voices. It seemed to come nearer and nearer, to inform her like the drumming of blood in her ears. She began to feel defenseless, exposed to the possibility of an overwhelming terror. She listened intently, trying not to think. Though the noise came from an ordinary goods train, no amount of reasoning could stave off this terror. She must yield herself, yield up all her attention, if she would escape. It was a wicked sound. It expressed something eternally outcast and reprobated by man, stealthily trafficking by night, unseen in the dark cleft of the hills. Loud, separate, and abrupt, each pant of the engine trampled down her wits.
		    </p>
<div class="attrib">
		      (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 122–23)
		    </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		      While Laura is exposed on a ridge rather than lying asleep in her room, and is again extremely alert rather than dangerously unconscious, this scene evokes the sublime, erotic terror and sense of fatality we find in Fuseli’s painting. Animated with sound, the panting goods train is as terrific a beast as the grinning goblin or glaring mare of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Nightmare</span>, or the pressing members of her own family whom she envisions closing in upon her, out to “seize on her soul.”
		    </p>
<p>
		      Yet there is a significant difference between Laura’s “nightmare” here and the one depicted by Fuseli. Laura realizes on the ridge that she “was alone, just as in her dreams, and the terror had come to keep her company, and crouched by her side, half in fawning, half in readiness to pounce.” She asks, in a curiously antiquated diction, “What was this cabal of darkness, suborning her own imagination to plot against her?” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 124). The outward scene mirrors the “secret country of her mind” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 123) and is thus both familiar and strange. Laura is not only frightened but also delighted by the train; she is both hunter and hunted, trapped with her wits trampled down and yet not only mistress of the desolate countryside (outward and inward) but “mistress, too, of the terror that roamed over the blank fields and haunted round her” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 123). She possesses, in other words, a power to experience pleasure that revisions the gendered relations of power evident in Fuseli’s painting of a prostrate female subject. Thus when we learn of Titus’s planned biography in the following section of the novel and reenvision <span style="font-style:italic;">The Nightmare</span> as it unfolds within the dim field occupied by Laura, I would argue that we are also led back to this vividly pictured, highly sensual scene, which in its turn ripples forward to the site of Laura’s transformation into a witch, allowing us to discern there an element of pleasure and even power in its vision of entrapment. Her experience in this field, we can now more clearly discern, offers a negative image of irrationality and sublimity that counters the pastoral, picturesque frame (“a pastoral landscape where an aunt walked out with her nephew”) that Titus’s presence in Great Mop places around her. She is trapped yet able to transform her condescending family into bestial hunters of her soul. Later, in her extended speech to Satan, she tells him to think “what a compliment” he pays a woman, “pursuing her soul, lying in wait for it, following it through all its windings, crafty and patient and secret like a gentleman out killing tigers. Her soul—when no one else would give a look at her body even!  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> And they are all so accustomed, so sure of her!” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 214). Able to be both hunted and hunter, prey and mistress of the terror she feels, Laura, as the narrative performs its delicate visual transactions, steps beyond any pastoral or even gothic frame. Each iteration of Fuseli’s image interfuses and interpenetrates the other in a way that challenges Titus’s masculine possessiveness, or indeed any firm possession of a work of art as a mere object to be catalogued, fixed, framed, and hung on a wall. The reprobate and stealthy goods train that Laura hears, however mundane, potentially loaded with cabbages making their way to “their bourne at Apsley Terrace,” offers a means of stepping outside the realm of the comfortable, tame, and domestic as well as the realm of powerless subjection into a world where familiar spirits can be sent forth to individuals at the command of Satan.
		    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Witch-Finder Generall and the Satanic Imagination</h1>
<p>
		      Warner’s play with Fuseli lies just beneath the surface of the text, as if the artist’s painting, like Leonardo’s, is reflected in the dim waters of the greenhouse tank, conjured and transformed, rippling backwards and forwards, yet never completely illuminated. There is, however, one work of art that is explicitly described in <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span>: a woodcut illustration of Matthew Hopkins, famously known as the “Witch-Finder Generall,” as he is labeled in the image that initially accompanied Hopkins’s pamphlet, “The Discovery of Witches” (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>).
		    </p>
<p>
		      After Laura’s cry of desperation and her sense that she has been heard by, and has entered into a pact with, Satan, she returns to her lodgings (in her sleep-walking state) to find that she is not alone there. She has been joined by a nearly starving “little rag-and-bone kitten with absurdly large ears” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 157), which, after biting her hand and sucking her blood, behaves like any normal kitten. Laura immediately and matter-of-factly recognizes the kitten as her familiar spirit, sent to her by the “Prince of Darkness” as a “sign of the bond between them” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 156). When Titus later asks what Laura will name the kitten, she recalls
		    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
			a picture she had seen long ago in one of the books at Lady Place. The book was about the persecution of witches, and the picture was a woodcut of Matthew Hopkins the witch-finder. Wearing a large hat he stood among a coven of witches, bound cross-legged upon their stools. Their confessions came out of their mouths upon scrolls. “My imp’s name is Ilemauzar,” said one; and another imp at the bottom of the page, an alert, ill-favoured cat, so lean and muscular that it looked like a skinned hare, was called “Vinegar Tom.”

<p class="continued">
			Laura decides to call the kitten “Vinegar,” and upon hearing its name, it pricks up its ears as if in recognition. In a characteristic manner, the flattened pictorial plane of the illustration, described in a moment of ekphrasis in the novel, is literally reanimated by Warner in the living form of the playful kitten.

			the right facing each other, and two animals facing the left of the image and two facing the right, and even the open door in the upper left corner balanced against the flourish of Vinegar Tom’s tail in the lower right, is unsettled by the narrative’s foregrounding of the cat (which is actually described as a mix between a greyhound and an ox in the pamphlet).<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Giving the animal precedence through a process of reanimation over Hopkins, who holds a staff and has spurred boots—symbols of power—in the illustration and who is associated with the mania of witch hunts, Warner’s text challenges any  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> conception of the image, already infinitely reproducible and lacking a Benjaminian aura, as an object of possession.
		      </p>
<p>
			While Laura’s act of naming the kitten would seem to be an Adamic or God-like one, which would further unsettle a patriarchal system of power, her act is not located in the power of the Logos. It is certainly not compelled, as is the case with the witches whose confessions come “out of their mouths upon scrolls” in the woodcut. Instead, her power is transformative, conjuring and reanimating a two-dimensional image into a three-dimensional being within the narrative, reflecting the work that the novel itself performs in its play with works of art. Warner’s imagination in this, her first novel, is far more aligned with Satan’s than with God’s. It is one of memory and witness rather than creating (or naming) out of nothing. As Laura muses, there “remaineth a rest” for the people of Satan as for those of God:
		      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
			  Held fast in that strong memory no wild thing could be shaken, no secret covert destroyed, no haunt of shadow and silence laid open. The goods yard at Paddington, for instance—a savage place! as holy and enchanted as ever it had been. Not one of the monuments and tinkerings of man could impose on the satanic mind. The Vatican and the Crystal Palace, and all the neat human nest-boxes in rows, Balham and Fulham and the Cromwell Road—he saw through them, they went flop like card-houses, the bricks were earth again, and the steel girders burrowed shrieking into the veins of earth, and the dead timber was restored to the ghostly groves. Wolves howled through the streets of Paris, the foxes played in the throne-room of Schönbrunn, and in the basement at Apsley Terrace, the mammoth slowly revolved, trampling out its lair.

<p class="continued">
			  Anticipating Lucy Swithin’s flights of “imaginative reconstruction” as depicted by Virginia Woolf in <span style="font-style:italic;">Between the Acts</span> , this passage restores wildness, savagery, and the natural state of things to civilized and domesticated spaces, superimposing one upon the other. Like Woolf, Warner demonstrates a keen “awareness of the simultaneity of the prehistoric in our present moment”; yet for Warner this awareness is only possible within the memory of Satan, which “was too long, too retentive; there was no appeasing its witness, no hoodwinking it with the present” (<span style="font-style:italic;">LY</span>, 221).<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> The satanic imagination is one that does not forget, and as a result of this act of witnessing, restores the past in the present—a restorative power that poignantly calls to Laura, who has spent the prime of her life living an existence not her own. It is a power to reanimate and transform rather than create out of nothingness; it relies upon multiple visions and re-visions, and is a form of narrative magic practiced by Laura’s landlady, Mrs. Leak, as she conjures her neighbors for Laura through telling their stories. Thus witchcraft in <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span> is more than a mere fantastic element or a useful tool for political allegory; rather, it can be read as an aesthetic principle that mirrors the author’s own and which demands of the reader a retentive memory—to be, that is, on the side of Satan. All this is not to deny the impressive creative force of Warner’s work in <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span>, but to underscore its transformative principle of reanimation, which allows in the shifting from one shape to another, the rippling from one reflection to another, of the displacement from one plane to another, works of art or women some means of eluding the grasp of masculine possession.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
			  In her female appropriation and dispossession of male art (as opposed to the male appropriation of female art that Carol Christ explores in Victorian necrophilic poetry and portraiture) Warner, in her “storyteller’s voice, droll, discomfiting, serene and implacable,” as Beer wonderfully describes it, animates the fixed pictorial image.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Transposed out of their two-dimensional plane, paintings or prints escape the boundaries of their frame or original context and take on a new narrative life that mischievously unsettles and disrupts their original. While at the novel’s conclusion Laura remains under her “Master” Satan’s indifferent possession, the alignment of the narrative’s technique with the satanic imagination indicates a profound indifference <span style="font-style:italic;">to</span> ownership, which Laura embodies. Titus’s “discriminating paw” that attempts to stroke the landscape as if it were a female body is thus nothing more than a paw making an empty gesture. Since what it seeks to grasp cannot ultimately be destroyed or forgotten, can indeed be summoned and given new life—multiple lives, shapes, and forms—by one who can call it forth, the power dynamic behind possession is evacuated, its dominating force deflated. In rewriting the novelistic imagination and exploring the arts of dispossession with a marvelous slyness and subtlety, Warner moves <span style="font-style:italic;">Lolly Willowes</span> beyond a feminist manifesto into the realm of narrative witchcraft, offering a radical perspective on the work of art and the work of the novel.
