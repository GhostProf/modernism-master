In <I>The Big Sea,</I> Langston Hughes describes the authorship dispute
that ended his collaboration with Zora Neale Hurston by insisting that
theirs "was not really a literary quarrel."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 He discredits Hurston's claim to sole authorship of <I>Mule Bone</I>
 and denies any artistic basis for their quarrel by indicating that
 Hurston was motivated by irrational jealousy of another woman:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
She said, yes, she had sent the play to <I>her</I> agent [under her
name only] because she felt that if the play were ever produced I
would only take my half of the money and spend it on a girl she didn't
like. Besides, the story was her story, the dialogue her dialogue, and
the play her play--even if I had put it together, and she didn't want
me to have any part in it. Girls are funny creatures! [<I>BS,</I> 332]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although Hughes's story is misleading and self-serving, when read on a
rative level it does highlight Hurston's artistic motives for ending
the collaborative relationship by recapitulating the literary strategy
that caused the dispute. In the spring of 1930, when Hurston and Hughes
began planning a dramatic comedy based on Hurston's short story "The Bone
of Contention," Hughes structured the play around a romantic triangle,
thereby displacing and altering the artistic and political themes at
the center of Hurston's story. Unwilling to accept this disruption of
her artistic vision, Hurston ultimately stopped working with Hughes,
wrote a new version of the play, claimed sole authorship of the drama,
and stopped production of the collaboratively written version.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although Hurston succeeded in preventing production or publication of
Hughes's preferred version during her lifetime, his romantic triangles
have dominated the reception of the play and critical accounts of the
collaboration. In 1991, <I>Mule Bone</I> was produced at Lincoln Center
and published in a full-length version for the first time, through the
advocacy of George Houston Bass and Henry Louis Gates, Jr. The cover
of this edition promises "the complete story of the <I>Mule Bone</I>
controversy," and, toward that end, includes Hughes's account from
<I>The Big Sea,</I> Robert Hemenway's and Arnold Rampersad's accounts
from their biographies of Hurston and Hughes, respectively, and numerous
letters written while the play's authorship was being disputed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Both biographers focus primarily on problems of "patronage and
 personality," including the triangle of Hurston, Hughes, and Louise
 Thompson, the "girl" whom Hughes says Hurston "didn't like" (<I>ZNH,</I>
 136). Despite assurances that Hughes's relationships with Thompson and
 Hurston were both platonic, Rampersad concludes that Hurston "acted
 like a lover spurned" when she ended the collaboration (<I>LH,</I> 136).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his introduction to the Harper edition, Gates indicates that he
finds Rampersad's reconstruction of the conflict most accurate, but
characterizes the conflict as "a complex and bizarre incident that
will forever remain impossible to understand completely, beclouded in
inexplicable motivation."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Gates makes no reference to Ruthe T. Sheffey's 1987 article about
 <I>Mule Bone,</I> the only critical analysis that examines the play's
 texts for evidence of artistic disagreement and, consequently, the
 only one that identifies Hughes's insertion of a romantic triangle
 as the cause of the Hurston-Hughes split. Sheffey demonstrates that
 Hughes's romantic triangle displaced Hurston's focus on religious and
 political power, compromising the original folk themes incorporated into
 "The Bone of Contention" and "negat[ing] any movement in the direction
 of female wholeness," a transformation that "must have justifiably
 enraged Hurston."
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I build on Sheffey's argument by considering how Hughes's insistence on
romantic triangles affected representations of artistry and authorship
in the play, as well as Hurston's efforts to redefine existing notions
of authorship through collaboration.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Through a feminist analysis of the genetic history of <I>Mule Bone,</I>
 including two previously unexamined drafts at the Library of Congress,
 I will reconstruct Hurston and Hughes's writing process, reevaluate
 Hurston's versions of <I>Mule Bone,</I> and reposition Hurston's and
 Hughes's problems of "patronage and personality" in relationship to
 ideological disputes about definitions and representations of authorship,
 artistry, and authority.

Constructing Collaborative Authority
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On 12 April 1928, Hurston wrote Hughes from Florida, initiating the
<I>Mule Bone</I> collaboration by proposing that he join her in creating a
"new," "<I>real</I> Negro art theatre."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Hurston was planning to bring her own versions of southern black folk
 performances

<B></B>

to New York, but in doing so, she faced three major, interrelated
obstacles: her patron Charlotte Osgood Mason's ownership of her folk
materials; the mainstream demand for stereotypical, minstrel-like
representations of blacks; and the need to find a form that would bridge
the gap between performance conventions of the New York art theatre and
those of the southern black rural community.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 All of these obstacles posed significant problems of authorship
 and authority for a woman of the rural South seeking to develop a
 reputation as an African American author. As Hemenway has noted, in the
 late 1920s, Hurston was searching for an intellectual approach and new
 literary genres that would integrate the folk artistry of Eatonville,
 the anthropology of Barnard College, and the aesthetic revolution of
 Harlem. To her Harlem Renaissance contemporaries, however, Hurston's
 anthropological work and performances of Eatonville folklore at Harlem
 parties tarnished her reputation as an aspiring literary author. Men
 such as Hughes, Wallace Thurman, Bruce Nugent, and Arna Bontemps read
 Hurston's intellectual struggle to integrate seemingly disparate elements
 as a lack of artistic commitment.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hurston hoped that collaborating with Hughes would help her to overcome
all of these obstacles. As a fellow "godchild" living near Mason in New
York, Hughes was particularly well situated to advise Hurston on how to
handle Mason (<I>LH,</I> 183). In the summer of 1928 Hurston suggested
that Hughes help her persuade Mason when possible and evade her if
necessary: "Could you broach the magazine article to [Godmother]? I
couldnt very easily. . . . Shall we work on [our show] at once? I am
willing if you are. I know that G[odmother] would never consent for me
to do so, so you will have to take it all in your name."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Hurston apparently thought that Mason would be more likely to approve a
 magazine article than a theatrical endeavor and was willing to circumvent
 Godmother's control of these folk materials by putting them in Hughes's
 name. Her priority here was not authorship credit but the creation of a
 new African American drama, a goal she believed would be best achieved
 through collaboration.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hughes seemed an ideal artistic collaborator. Unlike most other Harlem
Renaissance writers, he had a genuine interest in southern folklore. In
1927, after an accidental meeting, the two took an extended automobile
trip from Mobile to Manhattan, discussing plans for an opera and sharing
their knowledge and ideas about folklore along the way. Hurston had a
deeper background in southern folklore, possessing not only the southern
upbringing that Hughes lacked but also the knowledge gained from the
anthropological field work she had just completed. Nonetheless, Hughes
had spent some time in the (mostly urban) South collecting conjure lore
and folk expressions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The letters Hurston sent Hughes upon her return to southern fieldwork in
1928 and 1929 indicate that she found Hughes a sympathetic and useful
sounding board, a helpful collaborator from afar: "I am collecting the
expressions, similes, etc as you suggested but that is another instance
of our thoughts clicking."
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Hughes provided both useful advice and positive reinforcement for
 Hurston's ideas. Not infrequently,

<B></B>

Hurston's thanks are extravagant: "Without flattery, Langston, you are
the brains of this argosy. All the ideas have come out of your head."
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 As long as Hurston was in the field, receiving Hughes's suggestions
 from a distance, using them as she liked, and in undisputed control
 of her working process and textual products, she could afford to be
 extravagant in her praise and generous with offers of authorship credit.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Most important in their long-distance relationship was the technique
Hurston devised for loosening the tongues of her informants using Hughes's
poetry. At each new location, Hurston organized storytelling sessions,
which she began by reading from Hughes's <I>Fine Clothes to the Jew.</I>
Hurston reported excitedly that "they are making it so much a part of
themselves they go to improvising on it. . . . One man was giving the
words out-lining them out as the preacher does a hymn and the others
would take it up and sing."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 The ease and enthusiasm with which these folk artists assimilated
 Hughes's poetry into their own performances implied a compatibility of
 Hughes's and Hurston's aesthetics that struck Hurston forcefully. Yet,
 this free-flowing exchange between Hurston and her folk sources again
 places Hughes at a disadvantage imposed by distance. His fixed textual
 contributions are manipulated by Hurston and her informants through
 performance and improvisation. This experience, combined with Hurston
 and Hughes's car trip together, led Hurston to believe that Hughes
 was particularly well-suited not only to write the type of drama she
 envisioned but also to participate in the type of collaborative process
 she was seeking.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hurston and Hughes finally had the opportunity to work together on
their play in the spring of 1930. Both were living in Westfield,
New Jersey, roughly an hour from Manhattan, because Mason believed
they would get more writing done away from the distractions of New
York City. The most vivid picture of the early writing process in
Hemenway's and Rampersad's accounts is of Hurston "reducing [Hughes
and their stenographer-typist, Thompson] to helpless laughter as she
acted out all the parts" (<I>ZNH,</I> 137-8). The powerful image
of Hurston acting out all the "male and female roles in a variety of
voices" suggests that Hurston's performances played a central role in the
writing process and the shaping of Hurston's and Hughes's identities as
(co)authors. (<I>LH,</I> 184)
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In thinking about Hurston's and Hughes's conceptualization of a
collaborative authorial identity, we can imagine the effects of
Hurston's performances in a variety of ways. Initially, having just
returned from fieldwork where she and her informants improvised on each
others' contributions, Hurston would have viewed these performances as an
excellent way to bridge the gap between group vernacular folk performances
and solitary writing--and among her identities as "anthropologist,"
"raconteur," and "author." She may have expected Hughes to perform
as well, participating in a creative process like vernacular folk
performance, with its permeable boundary between artists and audience who
swap roles frequently so that all are potentially artists themselves. But
Hughes's apparent failure to produce performances comparable to Hurston's
suggests that Hurston's oral creative practices established an

<B></B>

uneven relationship between them. The nature of this inequality was
probably variously interpreted by the different participants. In Hurston's
mind, Hughes may have appeared to act primarily as an audience member
opposite her own role as artist. She may have viewed these performances
as an opportunity to test and hone her material in front of an ideal
audience member--an oral invention and editing process through which she
revised her work-in-progress. Hurston no doubt acquired an even stronger
sense of ownership over her research materials as she performed all of
the parts before Hughes and Thompson. In these performances, Hurston not
only dominated the stage but also literally embodied the developing text.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hughes, meanwhile, would have viewed these performances from a
different vantage point. Perhaps he mentally classified Hurston as the
"folk" during her performances, equating her with the characters she
performed. This elision was made more likely by Hurston's status as an
Eatonville native and Hughes's familiarity with Hurston's presentation
of Eatonville folklore at Harlem parties even before she had made any
formal anthropological expeditions. In this conration, Hughes
becomes author-anthropologist, encouraged by Hurston's extravagant
praise and offers of authorship credit in her letters from the field,
interpreting and structuring what he viewed as Hurston's "naive" or
"primitive" performances of material that was unrefined, unstructured,
unwritten, and, as yet, unauthored.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We need not imagine that Hurston and Hughes each consistently held to a
single vision of their roles as collaborators throughout their writing
process. I consider it much more likely that they each imagined their
roles and working relationship in different ways at different times. What
we do know is that, when the two collaborators argued over authorship
credit in 1931, each privileged the definition of "authorship" and
"the writing process" in his or her respective self-interest. Hurston
claimed sole authorship using the vocabulary of performance, "It
was my story from beginning to end. It is my <I>dialogue;</I> my
<I>situations.</I>" In response, Hughes documented his coauthorship with
texts and the vocabulary of the writer, telling Spingarn that the plot
that he and Hurston initially agreed upon was "largely worked out and
<I>constructed</I> by myself, and the whole action <I>outlined</I> in
my own <I>handwriting.</I>"
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 A knowledge of their different backgrounds suggests that their different
 vocabularies represent not only rhetoric for the promotion of their
 individual interests after the working relationship dissolved but
 also the different conceptions of artistic creation that they valued
 most throughout the writing process. Hurston was more committed to
 and at home with a vernacular model of artistic creation than Hughes
 was; Hughes associated the writerly acts of selection, outlining, and
 (hand)writing with authorship.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even before the collapse of the collaborative relationship, Hurston's
and Hughes's differing approaches to artistic creation would have had a
strong influence on their decision-making process. Hurston's reliance
on vernacular techniques may have been a handicap when she faced a
conflict in a collaborative writing situation. Although, as her other
works demonstrate, "telling lies" can be used to express conflict between
individuals and to reveal power relations, these vernacular approaches

<B></B>

are based on turn-taking that allows an audience to hear multiple and
competing tales about a single character or theme.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 There is no need to settle on a single version of a story, as there is in
 the linear dramatic plots that dominate Broadway, or on a final written
 version of a script that will displace other possible versions. Hurston's
 experiences in Eatonville and Polk County apparently did not prepare her
 to win an argument with Hughes about the structuring of a drama. As a
 consequence, Hughes's romance plot structures most of the manuscripts
 and typescripts of <I>Mule Bone,</I> as well as the published edition
 available today.

Broadway's Stereotypes as a Shared Bone of Contention
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We do not have access to Hurston's oral performances during the writing
process, but we do have her initial approach to fictionalizing the
folktale on which <I>Mule Bone</I> is based. "The Bone of Contention," a
short story she wrote before collaborating with Hughes, is an excellent
starting point for a play designed to mediate between the southern black
vernacular tradition and the black Broadway musical of the 1920s, a
goal both Hurston and Hughes shared. Its plot and themes demonstrate
the complexity and power of black folk culture through interwoven
representations of folklore and politics in an all-black Florida town.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 The catalyst for town conflict is a t over a wild turkey, which is
 won when one hunter, Jim, hits the other, Dave, over the head with the
 hock bone of Brazzle's yellow mule. This personal, physical t is soon
 incorporated into the ongoing religious conflict between Eatonville's
 Methodists and Baptists as well as the more recent political conflict
 between the two men who would be mayor--the incumbent, Joe Clark and
 the new Methodist minister, Reverend Simms.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
These political conflicts are used as material for an exploration
of the process of artistic and cultural creation in Eatonville. Each
Eatonville resident retells the tale of the t: outside the courtroom
"the children [engage] in fisticuffy trials of the case"; inside, adults
engage in pretrial argument by playing the dozens, or "specifying,"
across church and class lines (<I>MB,</I> 34). During the official
trial, African American preaching is the discourse of authority in
the courtroom. Reverend Long wins the case with a syllogism that draws
on Judges 15:16, which states that the jawbone of an ass killed 1,000
Philistines:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By depicting the entire community engaged in interpreting and retelling
Dave's initial story of the t, Hurston demonstrates the many ways
Eatonville residents draw on black vernacular tradition both to enact
and to settle conflicts. Subtly, Hurston

<B></B>

suggests that those who fail to appreciate the potency of black vernacular
artistry are Philistines who will be defeated by the power they do
not recognize.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"The Bone of Contention" stands out as a perfect vehicle for the
reinvention of 1920s black Broadway musicals for a second reason: its
similarity--to a point--with the decade's prototype, <I>Shuffle Along.</I>
Created in 1921 by Noble Sissle, Eubie Blake, and a talented cast of black
performers, <I>Shuffle Along</I> both pushed the envelope and established
the pattern that would be recycled, exploited, and rigidly imposed on
subsequent black musicals by profit-hungry white producers well into the
1930s. <I>Shuffle Along</I> was the first major, financially successful
black musical on Broadway as well as the production that ended the
taboo on serious love scenes in black Broadway shows. For the remainder
of the 1920s, black musicals appeared regularly on Broadway, but the
profitability of <I>Shuffle Along</I> soon led white producers to take
control of the form. Their formula prevented any frequent departures
from the use of minstrel-like malapropisms and chicanery as the basis
of the shows' comedy.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even in 1940, Hughes was still "thrilled and delighted" by <I>Shuffle
Along,</I> which featured outstanding performances by the comedy team
of Flournoy Miller and Aubrey Lyles, as well as Sissle and Blake:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
<I>Shuffle Along</I> was a honey of a show. Swift, bright, funny,
rollicking, and gay, with a dozen danceable, singable tunes. Besides,
look who were in it: the now famous choir director, Hall Johnson, and the
composer, William Grant Still, were a part of the orchestra. . . . the
internationally celebrated Josephine Baker [was] merely in the
chorus. Everybody was in the audience--including me. [<I>BS,</I>
223-4]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What captured Hughes's enthusiasm was not the script but the talented,
later famous performers, the music and dancing, and the show's tremendous
popularity. This enthusiasm remained in spite of the fact that by 1928,
according to Rampersad, "all the new plays about blacks affronted him"
(<I>LH,</I> 160). Hughes's complaint about a "terrible" new Miller and
Lyles musical captures his objections to the body of black Broadway
revues and <I>Shuffle Along</I> imitators that controlled the field in
the late 1920s; they presented only hackneyed black stereotypes, including
"a listless chorus in blue overalls, the obligatory cotton field scenery,
[and] stale jokes about blacks stealing" (<I>LH,</I> 160).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hughes apparently hoped to push several steps beyond the pale <I>Shuffle
Along</I> imitators by taking what he enjoyed about the original--the
music, dancing, and comic performances by African Americans (and the
Broadway popularity they inspired)--and adding what even the original
had lacked--a solid script that rejected more of the stereotypes. "The
Bone of Contention" was an ideal vehicle for reforming the stereotypes
of <I>Shuffle Along</I> while still providing a plot that might seem
familiar enough to appeal to Broadway audiences and producers. Both the
musical and the short story include a conflict among men who would be
mayor in an all-black town. In <I>Shuffle Along</I>, political conflict
is largely an excuse for displays of

<B></B>

chicanery, theft, and foolishness by two of three mayoral candidates,
and the idea of black political candidacy seems a source of humor
in itself. In contrast, in "The Bone of Contention" town politics
are produced through a complex interplay of religious conflict and
personal ambition, and there is nothing inherently funny about black
politics. <I>Shuffle Along</I> relies in large part on malapropisms,
slapstick, and comic ineptitude to produce laughs. "The Bone of
Contention" focuses on displays of verbal and physical prowess rather
than buffoonery and draws specifically on rural southern folk traditions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 All of these elements of "The Bone of Contention" are utilized in
 <I>Mule Bone.</I>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hurston and Hughes used southern folk sources to rere the relationship
between North and South found in typical black Broadway musicals. Such
shows often make a rative trip from South to North, beginning with
songs that harken back to good old plantation days (e.g., "Bandanna
Days" in <I>Shuffle Along</I>) and ending with songs about life in the
North, which is red either as more confusing (e.g., "On Patrol in No
Man's Land" in <I>Shuffle Along</I>) or more sophisticated (in <I>Dixie
to Broadway</I> and <I>Blackbirds</I>).
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 In contrast, <I>Mule Bone</I> starts and ends in the South, celebrating
 the folk artistry of an all-black town rather than longing for
 plantations, slavery, and mammies. As I will discuss below, the one
 character who returns from the North, Daisy, is associated with whites
 and threatens traditional black southern folk culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Mule Bone</I> also revises black musical performance traditions by
reimagining the black male song-and-dance team. In the tradition of
Walker and Williams, Johnson and Cole, and the two <I>Shuffle Along</I>
duos--Sissle and Blake and Lyles and Miller--the central characters
of <I>Mule Bone</I> sing and dance for the audience. However, in an
interesting departure from the typical black musical (and "The Bone of
Contention"), Dave and Jim are a song-and-dance team <I>in the plot</I>
as well. The change allows Hurston and Hughes to incorporate music and
dance into the plot fairly realistically rather than presenting a skimpy,
undeveloped plot as an excuse for a musical revue. This change also
facilitates a major revision of previous representations of black men as
collaborators. Leading male duos in black Broadway musicals had typically
been partners in crime in the plot. In <I>Shuffle Along</I>, Steve and
Sam collaborate only provisionally; the majority of their relationship
consists of their repeated betrayals of each other and of Jimtown. They
betray their original partnership as co-owners of a grocery store,
first by running against each other in the election, next by stealing
from the store to buy votes, and finally by hiring an investigator when
they become suspicious of each other. The two men also betray the town
by forming a secret political alliance, promising that the winner will
make the loser Chief of Police. As soon as Steve wins the campaign, he
betrays all those he made promises to, including, initially, Sam. In
short, the plot demonstrates that there is no honor among thieves--or
black male collaborators. The only honest mayoral candidate in the play,
Harry Walton, does not have a male collaborator but rather a lady-love
who stands supportively behind him in a respectable feminine manner.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Mule Bone</I>'s representation of collaboration turns <I>Shuffle
Along</I> on its head by making black male artistic collaboration
a positive force in the cultural life of Eatonville. By transforming
Dave and Jim of "The Bone of Contention" into a song-and-dance team that
functions in both a professional context (playing for white folks) and a
folk context (playing for the Eatonville community), Hughes and Hurston
give them dual status as authors and folk artists who are central to
Eatonville's cultural life. Rather than treating the partners as a
constant double threat to good government and each other, Hurston and
Hughes treat conflict between team members as a rarity that hurts both
team and town. In <I>Shuffle Along,</I> both cooperation and conflict
between black male collaborators is criminal, and such collaboration is
inevitably both corrupted and corrupting. In <I>Mule Bone,</I> only the
rare conflict between black male collaborators is criminalized.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">

Displaying and Displacing Black Women's Artistic Authority
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hurston's careful development of the team of Lonnie and My Honey in
<I>Polk County</I> demonstrates that the positive reinvention of the
black male musical team was as important to her vision of a "<I>real</I>
Negro art theatre" as it was to Hughes's.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 However, Hughes pushed through another textual transformation that
 Hurston, in the end, could not abide: the substitution of a woman for
 a turkey as the object of contention between Dave and Jim, a change
 that led to the excision of most of the positive representations of
 black women's artistry. By structuring the plot around the conflict
 produced by a romantic triangle, Hughes set in motion a mechanism that
 defined the female love object and male-female relationships as threats
 to the male collaborative relationship at the center of Eatonville's
 cultural life. Hurston had included no romance plot and no such negative
 evaluation of women in "The Bone of Contention." This transformation
 eventually drove Hurston to end the collaboration.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hurston's dissatisfaction with the romantic triangle is best illustrated
through an examination of the collaboration in relation to the unpublished
<I>Mule Bone</I> manuscripts. The earliest extant notes for the play,
written in Hughes's hand, focus on Daisy and make no reference to the
turkey (N1:1).
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 This suggests that Hughes's decision to focus on the romance plot
 was made very shortly after Hughes and Hurston came together to
 work on their play in the spring of 1930. Rampersad and Gates have
 indicated that Hughes "plotted out" the play; Hemenway (with Sheffey
 in agreement) specifically states that "the turkey was dropped (over
 Hurston's objections) and a girl made the root of the argument," but
 no critic cites early notes or drafts documenting Hurston's side of
 this dispute, nor have I found any.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Nonetheless, I agree with this assessment; plentiful evidence documents
 Hughes's resistance to Hurston's later efforts to insert the turkey and
 deemphasize the romance plot, including a letter he wrote to Spingarn,
 as well as Hurston's individually written draft, titled <I>De Turkey
 and de Law,</I> and Hughes's revisions, discussed below.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 All extant early notes for the play are in Hughes's hand, which suggests
 the possibility

<B></B>

that these notes represent only the ideas he preferred and exclude
Hurston's other early contributions.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The substitution of a woman for a turkey would obviously have far-reaching
implications. In all likelihood, Hughes wanted to provide the play with
a structuring device that would be familiar and, therefore, saleable
to Broadway producers and audiences. Sheffey argues that to Hurston,
who had grown up in Eatonville, "the play could legitimately turn on
political and religious power structures of Afro-American men" but
that in 1930, these power structures would have appeared "ludicrous"
or "even unthinkable" to the whites who would be the majority of the
audience for any economically successful Broadway production and that
"Langston, remembered by friends and foes as a playwright who kept a
realistic eye on box office receipts" therefore wanted to deemphasize
those power structures ("HH," 50-1). Hurston seems to have been
persuaded temporarily by Hughes's argument in favor of a romance, but
the manuscripts suggest that the authors were unable to agree on what
kind of character this new female love interest would be. No other
character underwent as many changes. For the duration of the writing
process, the depiction of Daisy swung back and forth between an artist
re and a dangerous temptress who draws men from their art and their
community obligations.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The earliest notes begin with a subtitle, "New Gal in Town," that
positions Daisy as the invading outsider (N1:1). The brief character
descriptions in these notes refer to some of the basic political
structures of "The Bone of Contention." The Mayor and the Baptist
minister, "old-timers," who "run the place" and "understand" it, are
being challenged by the new Methodist minister. The only reference to a
woman other than Daisy is in a few lines of dialogue attributed simply to
"Woman": "In Daytona they locks men up fo' beatin' women. You all better
not get no jail here an start lockin' up ma husband cause he beats me
so good." In contrast, Daisy, "dis pretty, strappin' gal done come down
here from up North," is an attractive, "flirtacious," "real free-lover,"
who sings, dances, and wears fancy clothes to attract attention. Neither
woman is derived from Hurston's short story. Daisy's ease of movement
among male lovers and admirers stands in stark contrast to the fixed
position of the Eatonville "Woman." In these notes, Daisy has at least
the potential to function as a positive, independent woman who will
shake up the "old timers," male and female.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the first extant typewritten draft of act 1 (D1:3), however, Daisy
is stripped of her status as a singer and dancer and is portrayed
primarily as a seductress antagonistic to community values. At her first
appearance, Daisy "enters hippily, conscious of her clothes, 'She-ness,'
sportily dressed." She repeatedly threatens the mainstay of Eatonville
culture, the festivities stemming from performances by Dave and Jim
who play together less often now that they are chasing Daisy. The two
men slow their playing when Daisy makes her first entrance. She stops
their performances by "pretend[ing] not to have been entertained" and
by causing the t that ends with the use of the mule bone. A brief
outline of the second act indicates that Daisy attends the trial. It
ends with "Old Sister" explicitly blaming Daisy for Eatonville's troubles:

<B></B>

"Lawd--dis Northern-dressed gal done broke up de Society of dis
holy town." Although the groundwork is laid for the power struggle
between Reverend Simms and Mayor Clark (<I>sic</I>) early in act 1, the
political struggles are left largely undeveloped, even in the notes for
act 2. Instead, attention is focused on the romantic triangle; Daisy's
aggressive female sexuality is the primary cause of community strife.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The next group of notes (N1:2-N1:5) focus again on the political
conflict between Baptists and Methodists that originated in "The Bone of
Contention" and introduce a new and threatening alliance between Daisy
and the white community. Two proposed endings for act 3 highlight this
connection. In the first, she closes the play with: "I'm gonna stick by
my white folks from now on. Dog-gone all men!" In the second, Dave sees
Daisy approaching, "fat and hot and puffing," her attractiveness gone. The
"five o'clock whistle blows. Daisey leaves [Dave and Jim] to go back
to her white folks. Dave and Jim look at one another shamefacedly. Both
tricked, and begin to damn women" (N1:2). The connection between Daisy's
gender and her loyalty to whites over blacks will be developed more
subtly in later drafts. Daisy is also removed from the trial on the
grounds that she must go to work for her white employers. This absence
limits Daisy's role and power, cements her status as a female outsider,
associates her more clearly with the whites, and makes the village-wide
conflict more a result of internal Eatonville politics and less a result
of the invasion of an outsider. Daisy becomes a catalyst rather than a
primary cause of Eatonville's conflict.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The next draft (D1:4) contains evidence suggesting that Hurston had
grown uncomfortable with such a negative portrait of the leading female
character. This draft elaborates on early indications that Daisy would
be an artist re. In D1:4, she appears on the scene as a Harlem
sophisticate, "dressed in the latest Harlem fashion with her hair slicked
down a la Josephine Baker, fingers covered with rings, rather flashily
dressed." The invocation of the name and image of <I>Shuffle Along</I>'s
most famous chorus girl suggests that we will be seeing revisions of
Broadway stereotypes of black women to accompany the new approach to
the male song-and-dance team. In <I>Shuffle Along,</I> her first big
break, Baker was the darkest woman in the chorus, an attribute that,
at the time, seemed to limit her to the role of "high-steppin' clown"
rather than exceptional beauty.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 But by 1925, in <I>La Revue negre</I> in Paris, she successfully
 developed an on-stage/off-stage image as an exotic, erotic
 beauty. Although today most believe that this persona coincides too
 closely with the stereotype of the black woman as "supersexy noble
 savage," in the 1920s, Donald Bogle argues, Baker's new professional
 and personal identity represented a step beyond Broadway limitations
 that many American black women respected and celebrated: "In the black
 community there had long been a fantasy of another world, another place
 and time, where the black woman would be seen for her unique brown
 beauty. In essence and act, Josephine Baker had escaped and lived out
 the fantasy for women back home."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In D1:4, Hurston recreates Daisy as a woman who travels to a faraway,
exotic city and acquires a newly glamorous, sophisticated image, just
as Baker did. Although this

<B></B>

"Harlem Daisy" is not fully elaborated, her initial entrance suggests
that she was to become a more complex character with something valuable
to contribute to the Eatonville community. In this draft only, Daisy is
welcomed warmly by a "general rush of villagers" (women as well as men)
and speaks to the new minister, promising to come to church. Her interest
in reestablishing a connection with one of the community's central
institutions makes her much less threatening to Eatonville's values. This
is also the only draft in which Daisy has returned from a recognizable
and specific black community (Harlem) rather than a foreign but vague
North associated only with flashy clothing and service to white employers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Additionally, all of the changes in Daisy's character in this draft
increase her resemblance to Hurston herself. This Daisy lived in
Eatonville, traveled to Harlem, and then returned home (as Hurston did
to collect folklore). She is no longer the new girl in town or simply
a Maitland resident; this Daisy is compared to a Harlem Renaissance
artist. What clinches the comparison--and indicates that Hurston wrote
this segment herself--is that, for the first time, this Daisy makes a
grand entrance that resembles the one Hurston will write for herself
a few years later in <I>Mules and Men.</I> Both the Harlem Daisy and
Zora of <I>Mules and Men</I> are joyfully welcomed by the folks in
Eatonville, both make contact with old friends and become acquainted
with new residents, and both ask to join in local activities. In <I>Mules
and Men,</I> Zora explains that, despite her northern accoutrements, her
"diploma and a Chevrolet," she "was still just Lucy Hurston's daughter
Zora" when she returned home to Eatonville.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 Daisy, in this draft, seems destined to be similarly reincorporated
 into the community, despite her new Harlem chic. In contrast to other
 drafts, Daisy's freewheeling flirtatiousness is consonant with the
 behavior of other Eatonville women. Her first entrance is positioned
 immediately after Teets and Bootsie dance with Joe Lindsay and Walter
 Thomas, and, earlier in the act, a married woman is shown flirting with
 Hambo while her husband is out of town. Friendly flirtations initiated
 by both women and men seem a natural part of town life.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But in the next draft (D1:5), the Harlem Daisy is crossed out--apparently
by Hughes--never to appear again. Penned-in corrections and additions
make D1:5 substantially similar to all subsequent drafts of act 1 that
Hughes worked on and to the Harper edition. Daisy, in these drafts, has
been firmly repositioned as an outsider, different from the Eatonville
women. The warm reception she receives from the "general rush of
villagers" in D1:4 is replaced by the specifically sexual interest of
the men on the store porch. Daisy's freewheeling sexuality once again
seems out of place; the flirtation between the married woman and Hambo is
excised, and Daisy's first entrance is connected with Walter's ominous
assertion that friendships among men are inevitably threatened when
disputes over a single woman arise.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Why was the Harlem Daisy eliminated? The answer seems to lie with the
romance plot, including the ultimate rejection of Daisy in act 3. In
act 1, Daisy stands out as a woman who refuses to be limited to one
man. In all extant drafts of act 3, Daisy demonstrates her independence
by agreeing to marriage only on her own specific

<B></B>

and, for Jim and Dave, unacceptable terms. After a traditional courtship
exchange demonstrates Daisy's desire to marry and a ritualized contest
ends with Daisy declaring Jim the winner, she demands to know where
they will live and how they will support themselves. Dissatisfied with
Jim's vague answers about wandering away from Eatonville and continuing
to perform, Daisy insists that her future husband take a steady job as a
yard man for her white employers. In so doing, she asserts her intention
to become an equal partner in marriage at the cost of Jim's dedication
to his art and of Dave and Jim's collaborative artistic relationship--a
cost that the play clearly defines as prohibitive. She also refuses
marriage on their terms in favor of servitude to white employers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Act 3 signifies on Broadway stereotypes of lazy black men by
 demonstrating that Dave and Jim's refusal to work--as domestic
 servants--is actually a choice to do the important cultural work of
 their community instead.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 In contrast, Daisy uses her fluency in the traditional language of
 courtship for purposes that would be detrimental to black (male)
 artistic production.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The romance plot, including the treatment of work described above, had
already been planned when Hurston created the Harlem Daisy in N1:2 and
N1:4. Even the draft in which the Harlem Daisy appears (D1:4) includes
references to her disruptiveness that potentially contradict the warmth of
her reception. To incorporate the Harlem Daisy into the play completely,
Hurston and Hughes would have needed to work through a broad range of
issues, including the relationship between Harlem and southern black
culture, the role of black women as performers in folk versus Broadway
settings, the relationship between black women and black men as artists,
and, perhaps most importantly for Hurston, the relationship between
an Eatonville native influenced by a northern aesthetic and the folk
(artists) who remained at home. A well-developed exploration of any of
these issues would have created a very different play than the version
she and Hughes had nearly completed when she left the collaboration
in May 1930. <I>Mules and Men,</I> which Hurston was structuring and
writing during this period, demonstrates her interest in pursuing these
issues, and Hurston's subsequent musical comedy, <I>Polk County,</I>
demonstrates her desire to explore them in dramatic form. Indeed, in
<I>Polk County</I> Hurston successfully addresses the issues raised
by the Harlem Daisy when she had escaped the restraints imposed by her
contract with Mason and her collaborative relationship with Hughes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Hughes, as I shall demonstrate, objected to any disruption of his romance
 plot. If Hurston and Hughes had inserted the Harlem Daisy into act 3 as
 outlined, allowing her to be rejected by both Jim and Dave, they would
 have created a parable of inevitable conflict between Eatonville and
 Harlem culture, an end result neither author could have wanted.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By late May of 1930, Hughes and Hurston had completed well developed
drafts of act 1, act 2 scene 1, and act 3 using Hughes's structure
(D1:8). This script, which would prove to be the last collaboratively
written version, approves Dave and Jim's decision to earn their living
by playing for the white folks, portraying this form of white patronage
as a necessary and acceptable accommodation to economic reality

<B></B>

that leaves men free to participate in the creation of black art and
black community outside of working hours. In contrast, Daisy, although
an able talker, is not, in the end, a professional artist. Her presence
in Eatonville is destructive to black (male) artistic production, and
her relationship with white employers is judged not as a necessary
accommodation but as a betrayal of her (former) community.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hurston had good reason to view the objectification of Daisy as an attack
on black women's artistic authority and integrity and, consequently, on
her own artistic vision and authority. If Hughes had encouraged her to
develop the fictionalized self-portrait begun with the Harlem Daisy,
the result might have been a more rounded portrait of a woman as both
a creative artist and a sexual human being, as Big Sweet is in <I>Polk
County</I>. Instead, Hughes insistently refocused attention on Daisy
as a sexual object. One of the play's "village wags," Walter, has a
conversation with Daisy early in act 1 that elucidates the structural
imperatives that govern her role in Hughes's romance plot:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A woman, Walter's remark indicates, naturally disrupts the relationship
between two men who simultaneously desire her. Once such a love triangle
is established, it must be resolved in one of two ways: by one man
gaining possession of the object (hence Walter urges her to "tell us
which one you laks de best"), or by both men rejecting the object in
favor of their relationship with each other, as Dave and Jim ultimately
do in act 3 (<I>MB,</I> 59).
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 If the woman seeks to retain her independence and her relationship with
 both men, she, of necessity, exerts a counterforce upon this cultural
 convention that Hughes's romance plot is not designed to accommodate.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At this moment in the writing process--when Daisy's position as a
demonized sexual object had just been fully elaborated--Hurston departed
Westfield to go South, telling Hughes that she would work on the climactic
trial scene of act 2 while she was away. Hemenway attributes the departure
to her perception that Hughes was trying to make Thompson more than a
stenographer and typist; Rampersad simply quotes Hughes's comment in
<I>The Big Sea</I> that Hurston was "restless and moody, working in a
nervous manner" (<I>BS,</I> 320). Both biographers argue that Hurston's
desire to consolidate her relationship with Mason while Hughes's was
deteriorating strongly influenced the breakup, either in May or in the
fall. Both indicate that Hurston avoided Hughes when she returned in
September and failed to keep appointments to work on the play with him
in November and December, but neither notes Hughes's own

<B></B>

report that during that same period Hurston wanted to "put the turkey
back in the story and cut down on the girl-interest."
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 Additionally, both state that Hurston copyrighted her own version of
 <I>Mule Bone</I> under her name only in October and solicited Carl Van
 Vechten's advice on her own version (D2:1) in mid-November, but neither
 appears to have located that version or interprets these moves as signs
 that dissatisfaction with the collaboratively written script may have
 motivated her May departure or the subsequent authorship dispute.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Indeed, Rampersad mentions Hurston's draft only in an effort to establish
 Hurston's intentional deceitfulness, inaccurately asserting that she
 "sent it to Van Vechten without mentioning Hughes's name" (<I>LH,</I>
 195).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In fact, Van Vechten wrote that Hurston sent her script with a cover
letter stating, "Langston and I started out together on the idea of the
story I used to tell you about Eatonville, but being so much apart from
rush of business I started all over again while in Mobile and this is
the result of my work alone."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 This statement reveals much about Hurston's conception of
 authorship. First, it indicates that, by this time, Hurston had abandoned
 the idea that collaborative authorship was the best approach to creating
 her <I>Mule Bone;</I> only with full authorial control could she redeem
 the play. Second, it demonstrates that Hurston believed she had a just
 claim to sole authorship of her play based on both oral and written
 uses of the material. Far from hiding her collaborative relationship
 with Hughes, Hurston acknowledged it to a man who was Hughes's friend
 as well as her own. She asserts her claim of sole authorship on two
 grounds: first, that she started anew, writing a unique version on her
 own, and, second, that she already had a claim to authorship of the
 material from a time before the collaboration, when she told the source
 story to Van Vechten. He accepted her explanation without question
 until Hughes pressed his claim.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The tendency of critics other than Sheffey to overlook the importance
of Hurston's revisions is less surprising when one considers the state
of the archival material. At the time they were writing, only act 2 of
Hurston's version had been discovered, and the only extant descriptions
of her complete version(s) were the derisive assessments Hughes penned
during the authorship dispute.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 More recently, I have discovered that <I>De Turkey and de Law,</I> which
 Hurston registered at the Library of Congress under her name only on
 29 October 1930, is a complete copy of one of Hurston's individually
 drafted versions of <I>Mule Bone</I> (verifying my supposition that act
 2 of the draft of <I>Mule Bone</I> that Hughes sent to the Library of
 Congress on 19 January 1931 was lifted from Hurston's version). These
 drafts have allowed me to date the other extant drafts held at Howard
 and Yale with much greater certainty than was previously possible (see
 <A HREF="#appendix">appendix</A>). The Howard and Yale archives, which Hemenway, Rampersad,
 Sheffey, and Bass and Gates relied upon, hold only act 2 of Hurston's
 "individually authored" version(s) and only in fragmented, modified
 form, as interpolated into one of Hughes's later revisions of act 2
 for the Gilpin Players (D3:2).
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although <I>De Turkey and de Law</I> is clearly a version of <I>Mule
Bone</I>, Hurston substantially revised the play structurally and
thematically to provide more positive representations of women as
folk artists and citizens. Most importantly, Hurston eliminates
the artistic relationship between Dave and Jim, thereby removing the
structural imperatives that defined Daisy as an enemy of black artistic
production. In <I>De Turkey and de Law,</I> as in previous versions of
<I>Mule Bone,</I> Dave and Jim are friends turned rivals, separated by
their competitive courtship of Daisy, but in <I>De Turkey and de Law,</I>
Dave is a hunter, not a dancer, and Jim plays guitar primarily for the
pleasure of town residents. The number of references to Daisy's white
employers in act 1 is reduced in <I>De Turkey and de Law,</I> reflecting
her decreased role and decreased threat in this version. Daisy remains
a powerful sexual magnet, juggling not only Dave and Jim's interest
but also the successful advances of Lum Boger. In <I>De Turkey</I>
(as in D1:4, with the Harlem Daisy), however, Daisy's flirtatiousness
is a part of normal town behavior, naturalized by new segments in which
the various men court the town women. Indeed, much of act 1 focuses on
the aggressive behavior of a large number of girls and boys and women
and men, who flirt and compete within and across gender lines. And,
significantly, Hurston replaces Daisy's self-centered, feminine cry for
help at the end of the coauthored version of act 1 ("Now who's gonna
take me home?") with the aggressive scheming of Lum, who takes advantage
of Dave's and Jim's absence to instruct Daisy, "tell yo' mama to put
on de hot water kittle. I'll be round there before long." Thus, female
speech and female sexuality represent little threat to black artistry
in this version--they are a routine part of the town conflicts that
feed and comprise vernacular artistry. Hurston also improves the status
of women and girls as folk artists by revising the depiction of other
female characters. She eliminates the early misogynistic representation
of the fat, demanding Mrs. Roberts, who begs Joe Clarke for food and
henpecks her husband, by beginning the play instead with an enhanced
exploration of the interaction among children--particularly older and
younger girls--playing Chick Ma Chick Ma Craney Crow.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Having eliminated the artistic collaboration of Dave and Jim, Hurston is
free to restructure the play to be more like "The Bone of Contention,"
reestablishing the emphasis on intraracial politics and the folk
artistry of the town as a whole rather than emphasizing the professional
artistry of the two male protagonists. Part of this restructuring is the
return to the turkey as an object of contention. In <I>De Turkey and de
Law,</I> Dave, whom the other men acknowledge as the best marksman in
town, competes for Daisy's attention by promising to shoot her a wild
turkey. When Jim claims he can do the same, their Eatonville neighbors
ridicule the thought, urging Jim to stick to his own forte, music
making. Offstage, both men hunt turkey, and Dave returns to the stage
near the end of the act, reporting that he shot a wild turkey and then
fought over the bird with Jim, who claimed to have shot it himself. Dave
tells the audience that Jim used the hock bone of Brazzle's yellow mule
to strike him and win the battle; consequently, Dave asks for Jim's
arrest and expulsion from the town. In <I>De Turkey and de Law</I>, as in
"The Bone of Contention," the hock bone

<B></B>

never appears on stage; its importance lies not in its physical
properties but in its political and rative uses. And unlike the
earlier collaboratively written versions of <I>Mule Bone,</I> act 1 of
<I>De Turkey and de Law</I> ends with several pages of argument among
the town folks, which immediately place the t in symbolic political
and vernacular circulation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Act 2 of <I>De Turkey and de Law,</I> the first full extant version of
the act, again demonstrates the value Hurston placed on representations of
women's skillful use of black vernacular as well as on the reinstatement
of the turkey. Her scene 1 (also included in the Harper edition) takes
place on a street in front of one or two houses--the women's domain--in
contrast to the store porch, which is controlled by the men. This short
scene displays the women's ways of discussing and enacting town politics
among themselves and subjects the men who pass by (Clarke, Lum, Reverends
Simms and Childers, Dave, and Lindsay) to the women's critical gaze--a
reversal of the gender dynamic in act 1. The trial scene (scene 2) opens
with arguments between the (female and male) Methodists and Baptists
before the official trial and closes with the ministers making their
arguments and Mayor/Judge Clarke delivering his verdict. These portions
of the trial scene were retained by Hughes in his revised versions and
were later incorporated into the Harper edition (<I>MB,</I> 108-20,
131-8). The midsection of Hurston's trial scene is devoted to the
turkey, however. Clarke attempts to get Marshall Lum Boger to present
the turkey as evidence but eventually learns that, after Lum prevented
Jim from seizing it, he allowed Mrs. Taylor to cook it and many of the
town members to eat it. The difficulties Clarke encounters in attempting
to get the turkey incorporated into the trial point humorously to
the town members' appropriation and use of the t for their own
specific purposes. (These difficulties also resonate with the trials
Hurston encountered in her effort to get the turkey incorporated into the
script.) When Dave indicates that he wanted to give the turkey to Daisy as
a gift, Daisy's mother stops all further discussion of her daughter. This
act of silencing calls attention to Hurston's deliberate reinstatement
of folkloric components of the story in place of the previous focus on
the romance plot.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The dialogue in act 3 of <I>De Turkey</I> remains similar to that
in previous drafts of <I>Mule Bone,</I> except that, here again, the
turkey is inserted as one of the objects of contention and the artistic
collaboration is eliminated. Thus, when Daisy asks first Jim and then Dave
to marry her and work for her white employers she is asking them to sever
their male friendship and leave the all-black community of Eatonville,
but she is not threatening black artistic production in Eatonville. In
rejecting her, the men continue to prioritize black men's friendship and
economic independence over romance, but the cultural life of Eatonville
is never seriously endangered.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As I will discuss below, <I>De Turkey and de Law</I> is substantially
similar to the version of <I>Mule Bone</I> (D2:1) that she gave to Van
Vechten a few weeks later. Upon first reading her version, Van Vechten
was impressed enough to send the script, without Hurston's knowledge,
to Barrett Clark, a reader for the Theatre Guild. In his capacity

<B></B>

as an employee of Samuel French, Clark offered the script to Rowena
Jelliffe, director of the Gilpin Players, a black acting company located
in Cleveland. Jelliffe was enthusiastic. On January 15, the day before
she received the script from Clark, Jelliffe happened to see Hughes, who
was staying with his mother in Cleveland. Jelliffe casually mentioned to
a shocked Hughes that she had acquired a comedy by Zora Hurston called
<I>Mule Bone.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Because we do not have a complete copy of that version of <I>Mule
Bone,</I> we are forced to rely on information in Hughes's letters of
January 1931, when he was attempting to reestablish his authorship credit
and artistic control of the play. Hughes's comments must be interpreted
with caution, for his personal interests at this time were opposed to
Hurston's and, as Hemenway has already documented, his accounts of the
collaboration often contain self-serving inaccuracies and omissions. For
example, in a letter of 21 January 1931 to his lawyer Arthur Spingarn,
Hughes created an inflated picture of his contribution to the script,
indicating that it was his own idea to make Dave and Jim representatives
of warring Baptist and Methodist factions, whereas we know that this
religious conflict was previously included in Hurston's "The Bone of
Contention."
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 But, while Hughes's attributions of credit and his evaluation of
 Hurston's script are suspect, I have no particular reason to doubt
 his basic descriptions of the plot, and these descriptions lead me to
 conclude that this version of <I>Mule Bone</I> (D2:1) was quite similar
 to <I>De Turkey and de Law,</I> but included two additions: Hurston sent
 two possible endings to act 1 and two versions of act 3--"the original

Fair or not, Hughes's evaluation of Hurston's script affected its
immediate (as well as its long-term) reception and ultimately led Hurston
to cancel the production. As soon as the script arrived in Cleveland,
Hughes took action to regain both authorship credit and artistic control,
arguing to Spingarn and Jelliffe that Hurston's version was

(An awful way to send out a manuscript, evidently leaving the producer
his choice of acts and endings. In fact the whole thing is perfectly
amazing. Maybe she has lost her mind!) . . . [Mrs. Jelliffe] liked my
version of the first act much the best (because it does have order and
climax in construction, whereas Miss Hurston's insertion of the turkey
threw the whole thing out of gear, as she simply put it in to an act
that had not been written for it.)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hughes's comments do not acknowledge that Hurston had originally
sent her version to Van Vechten for advice--not to a producer for
consideration. She may have included multiple endings of act 1 and
multiple versions of act 3 because she regarded this version as a rough
draft, or she may have been willing to consult with performers (as a
result of her previous experiences with folk artists). And, in persuading
Jelliffe that Hurston's version was "out of gear" when measured against
conventional Broadway standards, Hughes prevented her from seeing that
Hurston was working

<B></B>

 to invent a new form that was derived from vernacular folklore and
 performance conventions. After persuading Jelliffe that Hurston's version
 of Acts 1 and 3 should be rejected in favor of the collaboratively
 written version and that he should edit act 2 to complement them, Hughes
 began his campaign to persuade Hurston to authorize his revisions,
 successfully enlisting the assistance of Spingarn and Clark. He
 told Hurston that she could have a greater share of the royalties,
 specifically suggesting a two-thirds/one-third split to Spingarn, a
 concession indicating his awareness that the play was more hers than his.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Critics have favored Hughes's perspective in judging the flurry of letters
that documents the authorship dispute. Hurston's repeated assertions
that the play was entirely hers have been characterized as either the
understandably vengeful response of a wronged friend (by Hemenway) or
the self-deluded beliefs of a slightly mad genius (by Rampersad).
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 A reevaluation of the correspondence in light of the genetic history
 of the text indicates that Hurston had attempted to get Hughes to
 authorize her own plans for revision before finally proceeding with
 her efforts to deauthorize him. In his January 21 letter to Spingarn,
 Hughes casts himself as the unknowing and innocent victim of Hurston's
 disingenuous behavior, stating that when he returned to New York in
 November, Hurston canceled, failed to attend, or came unprepared to a
 series of appointments. Hughes buries his one obtuse reference to their
 artistic dispute--"she thought we ought to put the turkey back in the
 story and cut down on the girl-interest"--amid a catalog of Hurston's
 cancellations and "nervous" behavior, carefully omitting his own opinion
 about Daisy and the turkey in this paragraph. He can therefore conclude,
 "since we . . . <I>had had no disagreements about our work on the play
 together or anything else,</I> I put down her actions to a rush of
 other work, and perhaps nerves."

 His description is hardly credible in light of the archival evidence.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What exactly transpired between Hurston and Hughes in the fall? The
archival evidence supports Hurston's statement that by November
she and Hughes were championing two very different versions of the
play. Although Hughes may not have realized that Hurston was going to
circulate her version under her name only, I suspect that by November
at the latest, he knew more about Hurston's version than he was later
willing to acknowledge. If he had spoken of the artistic disagreement,
his claim would have been less convincing. Hurston's statement that
Hughes had suggested

<B></B>

letting the market settle their artistic dispute is credible in light
of the more conventional nature of his preferred version.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Even Hurston's claim "that virtually all of the play was written
by her" is reasonable when one values Hurston's performances as a
form of authorship, as she did, and views the play in light of the
dispute. Hughes's primary contribution to <I>Mule Bone</I> was, as he so
often said, "its construction," or structure, and he seems to have created
that structure by making the romantic triangle the center of the plot and
by selecting the portions of Hurston's performances and writing that would
be included in the drama. Her version, as even Hughes admits, deemphasized
his romance plot in ways he considered completely unacceptable and
rejected his selection of folklore, reinstating the turkey that he had
eliminated. In rejecting his structure, Hurston rejected his primary
contribution and, in the face of Hughes's resistance, had ample artistic
and ideological motivations for denying him coauthorship in her version.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Although Hughes tried to appease her with a greater share of the
royalties, Hurston was more interested in artistic control than in
financial rewards. On January 20, she sent Jelliffe two telegrams, the
first authorizing the production and the second voicing concerns about
the "integrity of [the] script" and stipulating that "not one word must
be altered except by me."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 Jelliffe disregarded this stipulation, allowing Hughes to proceed
 with his revisions--elimination of the turkey, restoration of the
 professional male artistic collaboration, and reemphasis of the
 romantic triangle. As he revised, Hughes eliminated the primary scene
 that represented women's ways of wielding black vernacular, the street
 scene that opens act 2 (<I>De Turkey</I> and D3:2-D3:4). The Gilpin
 Players' production, then, would have excluded any representations of
 women as professional artists comparable in status to Dave and Jim,
 would have cut representations of women's artistry and power to a bare
 minimum, would have identified the central female character as a threat
 to black artistic production, and would have diluted the focus on town
 politics and folklore that Hurston had taken pains to reinstate.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From Hurston's perspective, Hughes had butchered her <I>Mule Bone</I>. Her
refusals to reestablish the collaborative relationship and to authorize
the Cleveland production were not primarily personal, emotional, or
financial responses; they were first and foremost actions promoting her
authorial interests, artistic goals, and ideological positions. Although
I am persuaded by Hemenway's assertion that Hurston felt betrayed
by Hughes's growing friendship with Thompson and by both biographers'
assertion that Hurston had much to gain financially by strengthening her
relationship with Mason, I argue that these factors are subordinate to
the artistic and ideological dispute.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Hurston aligned herself with Mason and against Hughes in January 1931
 for the same reason that she had enlisted Hughes as her collaborator
 and co-conspirator against Mason from 1928 to 1930--to realize her own
 vision of a "<I>real</I> Negro art theatre." By 1931, circumstances
 had changed; Hughes was now the impediment to Hurston's goals, whereas
 Mason was in a position to be helpful. It is difficult to

<B></B>

imagine what else Hurston might have done at this point if she wanted
to see her own version of <I>Mule Bone</I> staged.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Characteristically, Hurston performed memorably in the service of
her goals. Van Vechten and Hughes both describe Hurston's scenes of
lamentation and indignation over the course of the winter.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 By late January, Hurston saw Hughes not only successfully asserting
 his claim of coauthorship (with Thompson firmly on his side) but also
 successfully regaining artistic control of the script via Jelliffe.
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 If Hurston was to prevent Hughes's vision of the play from eclipsing
 her own, she needed to take additional action. It was then that Hurston
 told Mason that Hughes and Thompson were having an affair and had gone
 "off to his rooms" while she alone worked on the play.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 Although we can never establish Hurston's motivations for this accusation
 with absolute certainly, I would suggest that she was playing the
 role of the trickster by executing an ironic reversal--signifying
 on Hughes's imposition of a romance plot on her tale of politics and
 artistry by imposing a (second) romance plot on their own battle for
 artistic authority.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hurston's romance plot was successful in that it stopped production
of Hughes's final version of <I>Mule Bone.</I> But Hughes, an able
signifier himself, turned Hurston's romance plot against her by again
triangulating--casting her as a stereotypically jealous female and himself
as the innocent object of a "funny creature[']s" irrational reaction to
"a girl she didn't like." His story of the collaboration in <I>The Big
Sea</I> and the papers he used to document his claim of coauthorship,
now preserved in the archives, have shaped subsequent literary histories
and have served as the basis for the published edition of the play.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Taking a new look at the genetic history of the text leads me not only
to theorize a new cause of the battle for authorship credit but also
to reevaluate the impact of mainstream conceptions of authorship on
the resolution of the dispute. When Hughes turned Hurston's folklore
against her, creating a portrait of Eatonville that diminished women's
artistic authority, Hurston was unable to regain sole authority over the
text and was driven to sacrifice the play along with the collaborative
relationship. This turn of events resulted in no small measure from
the concepts of authorship accepted by Hurston's and Hughes's New
York literary and theatrical communities, which privileged writing and
"construction" over oral performance as methods of authoring a text. This
general definition of authorship also contributed to the creation of
the literary reputations of the individuals concerned. As Van Vechten
wrote Hughes in response to his first claim of coauthorship:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Zora's performance is not very pretty, but I am not surprised. . . . Even
if she has entirely rewritten the play in a version of her own, she
had no moral right to do so without getting your permission. . . . So,
perhaps you had better put yourself on record by telling a few people
what you have just told me . . . you have standing as a writer and Zora
has not and people will believe you.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Van Vechten's prediction was accurate; the people who mattered (those
who controlled the production and publication of the play) did believe
Hughes. Hughes's

<B></B>

established reputation as a poet, marked by his recently acquired Harmon
Gold Award for Literature, stood him in good stead. Hurston's reputation
as a raconteur did not. In the end, Hurston could find only one method
of preventing Hughes's preferred version of <I>Mule Bone</I> from taking
the stage. In using it, she acted not "like a lover spurned" but like
an aspiring author silenced and dismissed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hurston's reputation has risen, collapsed, and risen again since
1931. Although Hughes remains the more prominent literary author in
the 1990s, Hurston's standing as an anthropologist and a recorder and
transformer of Eatonville's folklore has been well established by <I>Mules
and Men,</I> <I>Their Eyes Were Watching God,</I> and the renewed interest
of critics and artists, including Hemenway, Gates, Bass, Rampersad,
Sheffey, and Alice Walker. The rebirth of Hurston's professional
reputation in the 1980s and 1990s led Bass to reinsert a representation
of Hurston into <I>Mule Bone</I> for the play's 1991 premiere at Lincoln
Center. In Bass's new opening, Hurston first enters the scene "with
a diploma and a Chevrolet" to capture Eatonville's folktales and then
disappears into the crowd, becoming one of the town's single women.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 This representation of Hurston as folklorist and Eatonville resident
 contextualizes and authenticates the 1930s racial humor for 1990s
 audiences.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 It also specifically borrows language from the same segment of <I>Mules
 and Men</I> that is anticipated in Hurston's depiction of the Harlem
 Daisy, demonstrating a simultaneous, interlinked need for deleted
 elements of Hurston's work and for an onstage representation of Hurston's
 (enhanced) literary and anthropological authority. In 1931, Hurston did
 not have the authority necessary to get her <I>Mule Bone</I> staged,
 but in 1991, when theatre practitioners wanted to make Eatonville's
 artistry accessible to New York art theatre audiences, they invoked
 the name and image not of Josephine Baker but of Zora Neale Hurston.

To discuss authorship in a way that reflects Hurston's aesthetic vision,
I define the term "author" specifically as a professional creator
of art (i.e., one who is paid, expects to be paid, or is institutionally
recognized as a creator of high art) and an "artist," more broadly,
as any creator of art--including "professional artists" ("authors")
and "folk artists." In Eatonville's world of folk art, singers, guitar
players, dancers, and storytellers are the creative artists most closely
equivalent to composers, choreographers, or playwrights on Broadway or
in the "art theatre." For this reason, I will not use the terms
"author" and "artist" to distinguish between writers and performers or
among types of art created (e.g., music, dance, literature). These two
kinds of distinctions are typical of the mainstream American and European
understanding of art. Hurston's alternative understanding breaks down
the boundaries among genres, between written and oral culture, and among
creators, performers, and audience. My definitions recognize Hurston's
move towards these forms of integration, as well as the distinction
between professional artistic activity and folk artistry, which evolves
in her dramatic writing between Mule Bone and Polk County
and is central to her struggle to define her identity as an author. See
Zora Neale Hurston and Dorothy Waring, Polk County: A Comedy of
Negro Life on a Sawmill Camp with Authentic Negro Music (Stephen
Kelen d'Oxylion, 1944; James Weldon Johnson papers, Beinecke Rare Book

a Cleveland production could be the first step toward a production on
Broadway and possibly even a movie (see ZNH, 144). Although Hurston
and Hughes intended Mule Bone for Broadway, Clark's diversion
of the play to the Gilpin Players suggests that it challenged Broadway
norms enough to be considered more appropriate for a less commercial
venue that was more clearly dedicated to African American interests.

John Lowe indicates that the Hurston character identifies the show as
the result of her fieldwork. He also describes the resistance Gates
encountered in 1985 when he began his campaign to produce the play,
including the objections of more than fifty African American writers and
theatre professionals who regarded the comedy as stereotypical; see John
Lowe, "From Mule Bones to Funny Bones: The Plays of Zora Neale Hurston,"
The Southern Quarterly 33 (winter-spring 1995): 69.
