1. Photographs and Stories
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 "The necessary condition for an image is sight," Gustav Janouch claims to
 have said to Kafka. Kafka supposedly smiled and replied: "We photograph
 things in order to drive them out of our minds. My stories are a way
 of shutting my eyes."
<SUP><A NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Photography as exorcism is performed in order to drive things out
 of our minds. In a typical paradox, Kafka transforms the photograph
 from a vehicle of remembrance, a monument to a thing or moment in
 the external world, into a means of expelling a "thing"--a place, a
 person, a demon?--from the mind itself. Given material expression in
 the photograph, the image is separable, detachable not only from its
 referent but, as Kafka is supposed to have put it, from the "mind." In
 Kafka's formulation as transmitted by Janouch, stories are "a way,"
 a means of shutting the eyes, of not looking at what we do not wish
 to see. But this paradox ensures that the link between photographs and
 works of fiction remains ambiguous. On the one hand, stories are seen in
 contradistinction to photography--not as a means of exorcising demons,
 but rather as a means of shutting them out, of erecting a textual barrier
 between self and world. On the other hand, it is the relatedness of
 story to photograph that is intriguing, the sense in which writing too,
 may be an exorcism. "Shutting the eyes," as an act entailed in writing,
 would render narrative an effort both to expel and shut out the images
 that photography fixes. In this reading, narrative is complicit with
 photography in its attempt to keep the "things" that haunt us at a
 distance. But is sight really the "necessary condition for the image,"
 as Janouch postulates? Surely it is also suggested that some images
 exist in the mind's eye alone.
<SUP><A NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
What, then, might keeping one's <I>Eyes Wide Shut</I> imply? The title
of Kubrick's last film almost certainly refers to this exchange between
Kafka and Janouch, albeit indirectly.
<SUP><A NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Adopting Kafka's tendency to speak in paradoxes, Kubrick shrouds the
 relations between photograph and narrative in further ambiguity. Where
 to look for enlightenment? Quoting Kafka and Janouch in <I>Camera
 Lucida</I>, his meditation on photography, Roland Barthes muses that
 the best way to look at photographs may be to look away, to <I>close</I>
 one's eyes. "Absolute subjectivity," writes Barthes, "is achieved only
 in a state, an effort, of silence. Shutting your eyes is to make the
 image speak in silence . . . to say nothing, to shut my eyes, to allow
 the detail to rise of its own accord into affective consciousness"
 (<I>CL</I>, 55). The detail to which Barthes refers is of a particular
 kind: it is what he calls the <I>punctum</I>, an element which "shoots
 out of [the scene] like an arrow and pierces me" (<I>CL</I>, 26). The
 marks or wounds created by the <I>punctum</I> generate affective
 responses: "a photograph's <I>punctum</I> is that accident which pricks
 me (but also bruises me, is poignant to me)" (<I>CL</I>, 27); it is
 that which "attracts and distresses"(<I>CL</I>, 40).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
With reference to Barthes's reflections, then, keeping the "eyes wide
shut" refers to the insight that comes from sustained meditation on the
image that a photograph leaves in the mind's eye. It is when all else is
excluded--what Barthes calls the "noise" that surrounds the image--that
the significant detail, the wounding <I>punctum</I>, brings insight in the
form of affective response. Barthes, then, takes Kafka's words literally,
applying them to the photograph rather than to the story. "Shutting his
eyes," Barthes <I>restores</I> the image of the exorcised "thing" to the
mind. Reconnecting with the wounding "thing" and viewing it in the mind's
eye once more, Barthes savors those affects that Kafka prefers to keep
at bay. Could it be that <I>Eyes Wide Shut</I>--a film whose title was
chosen by Kubrick, remaining enigmatic to his screenwriter--contains a
<I>punctum</I>, something that attracts and distresses Kubrick? Something
once exorcised--only to be internalized and viewed with "eyes wide shut"
after all? What is it that attracts and distresses? What is it that
produces affects, both pleasurable and unpleasurable?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kubrick's films reveal a fixation with the writers and artists of the
Hapsburg monarchy; the "Blue Danube Waltz" and Strauss's "Also Sprach
Zarathustra" only momentarily seem out of place in the aural texture of
<I>2001</I>. In interviews, Kubrick in particular invokes the names of
the late Austrian monarchy's Jewish writers and intellectuals--of Kafka,
Stefan Zweig, Arthur Schnitzler, and Freud.
<SUP><A NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 The Stefan Zweig story "The Burning Secret" ("Brennendes Geheimnis"),
 that took Kubrick's fancy was never made into a film, but the adaptation
 of Schnitzler's <I>Traumnovelle</I> intrigued Kubrick for decades
 before its realization (<I>KUB</I>, 154, 156). Frederic Raphael,
 screenwriter for <I>Eyes Wide Shut</I>, was given books of paintings
 by Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt, and asked to study Freud (<I>EWO</I>,
 112). Years before, collaborating on a screenplay for <I>The Shining</I>,
 Kubrick and Diane Johnson read Freud's essay on "The Uncanny" together,
 and Kafka was also on Kubrick's mind.
<SUP><A NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 How intriguing, then, that in an essay written years before the
 release of <I>Eyes Wide Shut</I>, Michel Ciment suggests that Kubrick's
 "unfulfilled ambition" of filming the Schnitzler text may have "found
 an outlet" in <I>The Shining</I> (<I>KUB</I>, 144). As this essay will
 claim, the points of connection between <I>The Shining</I> and <I>Eyes
 Wide Shut</I> are mediated by the presence of Kafka.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In Kafka's writing, at once so allegorical and yet, as Kubrick put it,
"simple and straightforward, almost journalistic" in style, Kubrick
thought he had found the "perfect guide" for a "realistic approach"
(<I>KUB</I>, 186). Critics who have sought the "missing auteur" in
Kubrick's work might look to the extreme anonymity of Kafka's narrative
technique--to what Kubrick refers to as Kafka's "journalistic" style--as
a model for what is read as the filmmaker's authorial "absence"("TDA,"
301). If Kubrick is said to have "eviscerated the affective surfaces" of
more than one novel ("TDA," 291), it is equally claimed of Kafka that he
"affectively neutralizes" what his stories are at pains to represent.
<SUP><A NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 But oddly, perhaps, it is two minor scenes in <I>Eyes Wide Shut</I> that
 most obviously cue Kafkaesque concerns in Kubrick. It is Schnitzler's
 <I>Traumnovelle</I> that contains the scenes to which I am referring--the
 scenes in the costume shop--but readers of Kafka will agree that these
 scenes might well have come straight out of <I>The Trial</I>. In both
 their fictional and filmic versions, they play themselves out against
 the background of sexual antics performed by a young girl with two men
 in wigs--antics that take place behind and under furniture and have both
 the offhand and yet grotesque effect of similar couplings in Kafka's
 fiction. For Kubrick, I will suggest, the Kafkaesque overtones of these
 scenes in Schnitzler's novella constitute what Barthes's <I>punctum</I>
 is to the photograph: that which "pricks me, bruises me, is poignant
 to me."

2. Material Images
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A meditation on the nature of the still image lingers even in the midst
of Kubrick's most kinetic films, not surprising in a filmmaker who began
his career as a photographer.
<SUP><A NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Kubrick's concentration on the still image is the natural counterpart
 to his fascination with cinematic movement; we find it in the thousands
 of pre-production photographs in which most of Kubrick's films have
 their visual origins and we find it variously expressed in the films
 themselves. It appears, for example, in <I>Barry Lyndon</I>, the most
 painterly of Kubrick's films, usually in the rendering of painting. It
 is present in the compositions taken from Gainsborough and Hogarth, and
 in the homage to Reynolds that occurs in the static shots especially
 of the Lyndon residence, in reality the picturesque Castle Howard. We
 also find it in the careful composition of each frame, in the manner
 in which movement itself becomes an "actor" in some frames, often
 beginning in the middle of an otherwise still frame, and then gradually
 subsuming the frame from within, in the manner of F. W. Murnau. Kubrick's
 interest in the still image as the basis and foil for cinematic motion
 is evident even in <I>2001</I>. Although the film is "a formal statement
 on the nature of movement", as Annette Michelson has pointed out, the
 orchestrated and abstract nature of this movement admits its reliance
 on the still image--hence our sense, as Michelson puts it, that we are
 viewing another <I>Ballet M&eacute;canique</I>.
<SUP><A NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 We find the still image likewise in the transparencies used for the
 "Dawn of Man" prologue in <I>2001</I>: they are "picture postcards" that
 provide sublime backdrops for these scenes, but they also endow each
 of them with something of the photograph's atemporality, its "moment of
 time" feel in a series of incomprehensibly distant moments of the past.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In <I>The Shining</I> , the static image as photograph does much
to evoke the uncanny and the supernatural. Perhaps Kubrick himself had
the intuition expressed by Kracauer that the photographic rendering of
human bodies produces portraits of ghosts and ghostly images.
<SUP><A NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Or perhaps it was Barthes's assertion in <I>Camera Lucida</I>, that the
 <I>eidos</I> of the photograph is death, which suggested the particular
 possibilities of still photography for rendering the supernatural to
 Kubrick (<I>CL</I>, 15). Certainly Freud's work on "The Uncanny" ("Das
 Unheimliche", 1919) would have triggered an interest in the effects
 that mechanically-rendered motion can have on the spectator, reminding
 Kubrick of early film's preoccupation with its capacity to set images of
 the human body in motion, to efface the divisions between life and death.
<SUP><A NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 Or it may in fact have been Kafka's suggestion to Janouch, mediated by
 Barthes, that photography is a kind of exorcism. Whatever the source,
 <I>The Shining</I> is haunted by photography: photography itself
 resurfaces as an aspect of the film's imaginary, as a return of the
 repressed--or, as Barthes puts it, a "return of the dead" (<I>CL</I>, 9).
<SUP><A NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Most intriguing, perhaps, is the almost maniacal, willed insistence on
photographic indexicality that persists in film's relation to photography
in Kubrick: it is here that the body enters film. Photographs in <I>The
Shining</I> become "material." Jack's "visions" or mental projections--his
experiences with the dead--take their subjects both from newspaper photos
and from the myriad black and white photographs that adorn the walls
of the Overlook Hotel. These images take on lush colors as Jack brings
their dead imaginatively to life, as he "realizes" the photographs and
enters their spaces, interacting with the ghosts who populate them.
<SUP><A NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 Jack has a "visionary" power that resides in the capacity to animate
 photographs from the past, to animate them narratively in the manner of
 cinema. But of greatest importance to this essay is the film's insistence
 on the (red) materiality of these images, on the manner in which
 they evoke the body. In one of his "visions," Jack "recognizes" the
 former caretaker from his photograph in the newspaper and, as Fredric
 Jameson puts it, "the film public palpably gasps when the conventions
 of the ghost story are violated, when the hero physically intersects
 with his fantasmagoric surrounding and he collides with the <I>material
 body of a waiter</I> whose drink he spills" (emphasis mine).
<SUP><A NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Another case in point is the allusion to <I>Faust I</I> as Jack sits
 down at the ballroom bar: "I'd give my goddamned soul for a glass of
 beer," he announces. A moment later, his own reflection in the mirror
 is replaced by the image of the bartender, a devil clothed in red. Just
 as Goethe's Mephisto plays to the students' bodily desires by conjuring
 up an image of wine real enough to guzzle down, the bartender produces
 a drink for the "parched" Jack in an atmosphere that similarly insists
 upon the materiality of illusion.
<SUP><A NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Drinks are spilled and consumed, music listened and danced to, lust
 is aroused, disgust produced. The horror film, as Linda Williams has
 famously said, is one of the "body genres."
<SUP><A NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Here, the ghost materializes and is revealed to have a body; Kubrick's
 uncanny is decidedly corporeal.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Using language that suggests the indexical relation of the photograph
to the real, Mr. Halloran tells Jack's son Danny that the violent events
perpetrated in the hotel have left "their trace." The photographic nature
of certain images will be evoked visually several times later on in the
film, each time juxtaposing the photograph's "flat

<B></B>

Death" (<I>CL</I>, 92) and an uncanny materiality. One notable
incidence occurs in the "Thursday" scene, when the film camera moves
in on Jack's crazed face with its motionless grimace--an image that
is a freeze frame--until Jack arches his eyebrows diabolically. This
moment of controlled movement exemplifies the possibilities both
of arresting action, and of killing off the moving, hence seemingly
three-dimensional image into the photograph--and then bringing it to life
by the introduction of movement once again. The macabre "frozen" moment
and arrested action of the photograph are suggested in the ice sculpture
that Jack's body--very much a material image--will become. How fitting,
then, that the film camera, moving ever closer, will discover Jack at
the center of the group photo of Overlook guests at a 1921 ball. Now
himself a ghost, Jack has been exorcised into the space of photography.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like father, like son. Danny's visions also have a photographic dimension:
the first one features the oceanic, silent eruption of blood out of the
elevator, with the two Grady girls not yet part of the scene. Instead,
the image of the elevator is cut with a very briefly-held still
of the two murdered girls: their frontality and the directness with
which they look out of the frame suggest a family snapshot, while their
near-doubling--they are not twins--seems to allude to subjects in similar
compositions by American photographer Diane Arbus. Later, Danny will turn
around to see the Grady girls behind him as he is playing darts. Although
they have now "materialized"--become more filmic and entered the space
of the narrative--they continue to assume a frontal pose. Even as they
turn around they hold hands and maintain their "frontal" conration:
they are silent images only partially released from a photograph. In the
"Tuesday" scene, the Grady sisters will appear to Danny again as res
in a photograph, but in the "Thursday" sequence he will come upon them at
the end of a corridor, and this time they will speak to him--in tandem,
and in the formulaic language of fairytales. Terrified by these images,
Danny recalls what Mr. Halloran had told him--that the images he sees are
"just like pictures in a book."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A number of Annette Michelson's assertions concerning <I>200l</I>--that
it dissolves the opposition between body and mind, that "things seen"
are supplemented by "things felt," and the camera has a great deal to do
with both--hold true for <I>The Shining</I> as well ("BIS," 60). There the
film camera is a "presence" from its first frames, of course, when its
eccentric trajectory seems to stalk, then lose interest in, the family
in the VW below. Swooping over a cliff rather than keeping its prey in
focus, the camera emerges as a character rather than as an embodiment of
authorial presence--unlike the camera in a Hitchcock film, for instance,
it is less voyeuristic than predatory. The familiar <I>dies irae</I>
melody with which the film begins conjures up Carl Theodor Dreyer's
<I>Day of Wrath</I> (1943; also known as <I>Vredens Dag</I>), reinforcing
a connection with the earlier film in its use of a mobile camera.
<SUP><A NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 Here, as in <I>Day of Wrath</I>, the camera seems to have the evil eye as
 well as the witch's power of invocation, the power to call up "the Quick
 and the Dead." Its sinister playfulness is continued in many interior
 shots of the hotel, where, rather than keeping the Torrances in frame,
 the camera often disappears behind pillars, only to bring them into
 focus once more as it wends its sinuous way along confining corridors.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
My point here is simply that the film camera does not play to the eye
alone. During long takes the steadicam tends to track rapidly backwards,
retreating in front of the characters who are moving towards us,
thus doubling the effect of speed and motion, and producing spectator
vertigo. While the camera is rarely alligned with Jack, and prefers to
shoot characters frontally, it is often located behind Danny--sometimes
seeming to share his point of view, sometimes in pursuit--most notably
during the dizzying sequences when he is on his tricycle.
<SUP><A NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 In <I>The Shining</I>, the affective response missing from the film's
 unlocalizable narrative voice is displaced into the spectator, in whom
 camera movement and imagery produce sensations of vertigo and nausea.
<SUP><A NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Kubrick ensures that his spectator is embodied.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At times the film camera crosses to the other side. Moving "through the
looking glass," it may playfully juxtapose the uncanny mirror image with
the (diegetic) real, as in the crucial sequence titled "A Month Later,"
when Wendy brings Jack breakfast in bed.
<SUP><A NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 In our first view of Jack, the camera pulls back from a frontal shot,
 only gradually revealing that what we see is his reflection in the
 mirror. Next the "real" Wendy enters the frame, and then the camera moves
 back into the space of the mirror. There follows a shot of Wendy from
 Jack's point of view that emerges from an "impossible" place--out of the
 mirror itself, another Dreyer moment, recalling the impossible point of
 view of the corpse in <I>Vampyr</I> (1932; also known as <I>Vampyr--Der
 Traum des Allan Grey</I>). The mirror will likewise be the site of the
 uncanny when Jack enters Room 237. A shot of Jack shows him in happy
 anticipation as a young and beautiful woman approaches him. But as
 he embraces her, he glances into the mirror in which their bodies are
 reflected. As the woman's body visibly ages, disintegrates, and decays
 in the mirror, telescoping time, we hear the cackle of a witch. Once
 again illusion asserts its connection to corporeality, a corporeality
 that corrupts the image from within. The witch as temptress and hag
 recalls <I>Day of Wrath</I>. But the image in the mirror--a trope of
 the supernatural--more importantly points to the abject maternal body,
 alive and dead, equally the object of desire and horror.

3. "Canniness" or the "Vital Domain"
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Citing Freud as his source, Winfried Menninghaus reminds us that
fairytales can represent uncanny situations and occurrences without
bringing them fully into affective consciousness. Just so, Kafka's stories
have the ability, as Menninghaus puts it, "to render virtually invisible
and affectively neutral what his fictions are continuously at pains to
represent: disgusting bodies, gestures, and actions."
<SUP><A NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Eating and sex, two canonical acts of the grotesque, are closely
 associated in Kafka, and carnality--both in its sexual and gustatory
 forms, approaching even cannibalism--evokes strong affective responses
 in the male characters who populate his texts. Similarly--the
 Deleuzian insistence on Kubrick's cinema as a "cinema of the brain"
 notwithstanding--critical response to <I>The Shining</I> has noted
 its corporeal concerns, variously connecting the Overlook Hotel with
 the womb, its labyrinth with the intestines, and pointing out that its
 dominant color is blood red.
<SUP><A NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 As in Kafka's texts, disgust and nausea are often

<B></B>

linked in the genre of the horror film to a complex relation to the
female body.
<SUP><A NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 But even beyond this clich&eacute;d common concern, the nature of
 Kubrick's obsession with the female body points to an unexpected
 dimension of Kafka's significance for his work.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"It's all very homey," says Jack Torrance when he first surveys
the cavernous spaces of the Overlook Hotel; "homey" in the sense of
comfortable, <I>gem&uuml;tlich</I>, is precisely what the Overlook is
not. A month later, when Jack claims to have fallen in love with the hotel
right away, to have felt as though he "had been there before", as though
he "knew what was going to be behind every corner," we know what his
remarks are intended to suggest. "Homey" in this context means canny, and
as Ciment reminds us with Freud, a sense of <I>d&eacute;j&agrave;-vu</I>
suggests that the familiar place has been connected with the maternal body
(<I>KUB</I>, 144). Further, in his visions, Jack's son Danny repeatedly
sees "torrents" (Torrance?) of blood pouring out of an elevator. Blood
is first seen seeping out from behind the doors, then gushing forth
(the cinematic allusion here is to Fritz Lang's <I>Metropolis</I> of
1927), and the narrative overtly connects this blood with a paternal
violence against children that transgresses our most rigid taboos. But
visually, this scene accomplishes something else: by suggesting that
the corridors of the hotel are corporeal passageways--arteries for the
transport of blood--it turns the hotel itself into a body. What is more
"homey"--<I>heimlich</I>, canny--than the body of the mother? And yet this
scene is violent: the gushing of blood surrounds the deaths of children,
as though to suggest a perverse inversion of the nourishing placenta.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Indeed, as in Kafka, perversion and disgust infiltrate the domain
of nourishment and eating from this film's beginning, when a
conversation about the snowbound Donner party cues the theme of
cannibalism. Foreshadowing the desperate circumstances of the snowbound
Torrances, this theme persists during the tour of the meat freezer,
and we feel relief that Danny, when asked which meat is his favorite,
replies "French fries and ketchup." The suggestion of cannibalism
infects the act of eating so profoundly that it comes into play even
as the sympathetic African-American chef, Mr. Halloran, serves Danny
chocolate ice-cream, and we might add that his father Jack's preferred
drink is Jack Daniels. Cannibalism resides in the domain of Kristeva's
abject, a prime example of the "crossing over of the categories of Pure
and Impure," a perversion of the infantile desire for incorporation.
<SUP><A NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If Danny experiences nausea as well as terror at the images of his bloody
visions, his reactions only serve to make the connections between the
digestive and the uterine domains more fluid. And then there is Tony,
Danny's imaginary friend and double, the "author" of his visions, who
lives, as Danny puts it, in his "mouth" and in his "stomach." In keeping
with Otto Rank's insights concerning the double, Danny gives birth to Tony
in order to ward off death, in turn keeping Tony "safe" in his "stomach,"
as he puts it, his metaphorical womb. From the child's point of view,
Tony--both a voice who speaks through Danny, and the "source" of Danny's
ghastly visions--inhabits his body rather than his mind. Thus Danny's
visionary power--"shining"--is by its very location identified with the
"desirable and terrifying, nourishing and murderous, fascinating and
abject inside of the maternal body" (<I>POH</I>, 55). Danny's visions
both re and produce substances--blood and vomit--that Kristeva
relegates to the domain of the

<B></B>

mother, the domain of the body. From what source, we may well ask, does
the heartbeat that makes its way into so many of Kubrick's soundtracks
emanate? And why does the color red tend to dominate the visual field?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The maternal body itself is abject, and we must break with it through
the power of language (<I>POH</I>, 13). Small wonder, then, that Jack
Torrance, would-be writer, imprisoned within the maternal body that
is the Overlook Hotel, has a disturbed relation to the symbolic. Jack
comes to the hotel armed with an album into which he has carefully pasted
newspaper clippings--both photographs and stories--intending to use these
as a basis for his novel. But Jack cannot write, he can only type; he and
his typewriter have become a mechanical writing machine. In the manner of
concrete poetry, Jack uses language as though it were a non-signifying
material, creating a series of typographical variations on a single
sentence--a sentence not even of his own devising. Page after page piles
up, producing a modernist that is a material object, a sculpture--a text
whose relation to temporality is distorted in favor of the image.

In Schnitzler's <I>Traumnovelle</I>, the two men engaged in sex with
the young daughter of a costume shop owner first appear as judges of
the Vehmic court, dressed in the red hats (<I>Talare</I>) and pleated
robes of this office.
<SUP><A NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 The judges are seated at a table from under which the young girl slithers
 to escape her approaching father. In this first scene at the costume
 shop, the father admonishes the girl and chastises the judges who, as
 they leave the shop in evening clothes, are revealed to have been in
 costume--not judges at all. The next day, when the hero of Schnitzler's
 story returns to find one of them leaving the young girl's room,
 the father will reveal himself to have been in complicity with their
 behavior: it had never been his intention to have recourse to the law
 at all. Indeed, the father is his daughter's pimp. Schnitzler's scene
 is a scene out of Kafka.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kubrick's <I>Eyes Wide Shut</I> both masks and intensifies this
connection. The daughter's lovers do not even pose as judges: Kubrick's
modern-day New York version of this scene transforms the costumed
"judges" into Japanese tourists in wigs; one of them is wearing red
bikini briefs, and the other emerges naked from behind the sofa where he
has presumably been having sex with the young girl. In Kubrick's film,
the costume shop owner is a man named Milich who speaks in a heavy
accent that permeates the scene with a Middle-European atmosphere. The
bathrobe that Milich wears is worn by Schnitzler's shop owner as well,
a sign of the not-quite-respectable nearness of the body that evokes
memories of many Kafka texts. Further, the film introduces a Kafkaesque
"gatekeeper" aspect into the initial encounter between Bill Harford,
the protagonist, and Milich: Harford bargains with Milich for access
to his shop at an actual wrought-iron gate, while Milich--jangling his
keys--claims "one can't be too careful." Milich, we might add, is played
by Rade Scherbedgia, an actor who resembles Kubrick himself, suggesting
that a personal concern may inform the costume shop sequences.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In his memoir of the collaboration with Kubrick, Frederic Raphael
repeatedly recurs to the topic of "how thoroughly Schnitzler's story is
impregnated with Jewishness"

<B></B>

(<I>EWO</I>, 59). Although the topic of Jewishness came up between Kubrick
and Raphael time and again, Raphael complains with more than some regret
that Kubrick "forbade any reference to Jews"(<I>EWO</I>, 59) and that
Jews are not featured in any of Kubrick's films (<I>EWO</I>, 108).
<SUP><A NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 But Jewish culture must at least have had a part to play in the affinity
 Kubrick apparently felt both with Schnitzler and with Kafka.
<SUP><A NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 It is present in Kubrick's intensification of the Kafkaesque scene
 embedded in the Schnitzler text--and perhaps in his decision to delete
 what may have been most meaningful to him, and yet to retain a reference
 to Kafka by other, more easily recognisable, means.
<SUP><A NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Let us return now to Schnitzler's young men dressed as Vehmic court
judges. Their relations with a young girl are shocking in the Schnitzler
story at least in part because of the nature of the office that they
appear to hold: they appear to be the contaminated representatives of
a Law which is itself contaminated by their acts. Nevertheless, the
Law is not cleansed of its contamination when the men are revealed as
imposters: on the one hand, their fantasies suffice to contaminate the
Law and--equally important--paternal Law itself is "infected" when the
father's complicity becomes apparent.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Citing Reiner Stach's work on Kafka, Slavoj Zizek reminds
us that the "trespassing of the frontier that separates the vital domain
from the judicial domain" is a characteristic of Kafka's universe.
<SUP><A NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 In <I>The Trial</I>, for example, the court is located within the
 "vital promiscuity" of the workers' lodgings, it is a sexually-enticing
 washerwoman who allows K. entry into the interrogation chamber and, as
 K. stands before the tribunal, he dimly sees a man and woman locked
 in an embrace (<I>LA</I>, 147). Zizek puts it thus:
 "Smeared by an obscene vitality, the law itself--traditionally a
 pure, neutral universality--assumes the features of a heterogeneous,
 inconsistent <I>bricolage</I> penetrated with enjoyment" (<I>LA</I>,
 149). Zizek reads Kafka's reaction to the separation of
 these domains as a sign of his embeddedness in Jewish culture: the Jewish
 religion, claims Zizek, "marks the moment of the most radical
 separation of these domains. In all previous religions, we encounter a
 place, a domain of sacred enjoyment (<I>in the form of ritual orgies,
 for example</I>), whereas in Judaism the sacred domain is evacuated
 of all traces of vitality and the living substance is subordinated
 to the dead letter of the Father's law" (<I>LA</I>, 150; emphasis
 mine). Reacting against this separation, writes Zizek,
 "Kafka trespasses the divisions of his inherited religion, flooding
 the judicial domain, once again, with enjoyment" (<I>LA</I>, 150).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is as though <I>Eyes Wide Shut</I> had been made with this quotation
from Zizek in mind. Kubrick's elaboration of the ritual orgy
in his film culminates in the moment when its participants take on the
role of judges as Bill Harford stands before them in the crimson circle,
unmasked and brought to judgment. In Schnitzler's story, the mock judges
who participate in the orgy with the shopkeeper's daughter anticipate
this moment, of course.
<SUP><A NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Although Kubrick has disguised Schnitzler's mock-judges as businessmen,
 he nevertheless retains the theme of the permeability of the judicial
 to the vital domain that he reads in Kafka, transposing it to the
 scene of a ritual orgy enacted by powerful men participating in a
 quasi-religious rite.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It remains to suggest in what sense Kafka's merging of these domains
might consitute a <I>punctum</I> for Kubrick. What, for Kubrick, might
the implication of "flooding the

<B></B>

judicial domain with enjoyment" be? If, as Zizek contends, in
Judaism "the living substance is subordinated to the dead letter of the
Father's law," then Kafka presents the reader with the counter-example
of a textuality which is anything but dead--yet whose sensuality is
masked by the glossy surface of a distanced, opaque, <I>modernist</I>
style. It is a style of "proverbial purity," whose effect on the reader,
as Zizek sees it, may be otherwise: "It is as if," he writes,
"Kafka's text were a coagulated, stigmatized, signifying chain repelling
signification with an excess of sticky enjoyment" (<I>LA</I>, 151). The
"stickiness" of this text is that of unmentionable bodily substances--of
the body of the sexual woman, of Kristeva's abject mother, and of the
Bakhtinian grotesque who ingests, excretes, and fornicates.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In any art form, Annette Michelson has said with reference to Kubrick's
<I>2001</I>, the perception of "lived reality" is not easily compatible
with the "movement towards abstraction which animates the style and
esthetics of modernism" ("BIS," 58). As we have noted, Jack Torrance's
typewriter is a machine that can only produce mechanical writing on
stacks of paper, while in his <I>Penal Colony</I>, Kafka notoriously
offers his reader a writing machine that inscribes human flesh. This
bleeding script points to modernism's Other, its counterpart and
complement. It is the vital domain itself--the stuff of representation
becomes its surface--reversing the relation between the photograph
and its inscription of the body as trace. What Kubrick sees in Kafka's
stories is a relation between style and content that is antithetical in
the extreme. If, as Kafka puts it, his stories are a way of "shutting
his eyes," Kafka may also be referring to the manner in which his "pure"
style acts as a kind of sealant, covering over--even entrapping--his
subject under a veneer that represses it, contains it, and gives it an
auratic glow. To have one's eyes "wide shut," then, is, like Kubrick,
to be aware of Kafka's project--and to imitate it.

Indiscriminately combining the different temporal moments of the
photographs--Grady's stewardship of the Overlook in the 1970s is
merged with the 1920s in which the hotel flourished--Jack's visions
de-emphasize temporality in favor of the space of their setting,
the hotel. But it is not "nostalgia" for the past--for <I>which</I>
past, we might well ask--that animates Kubrick to bring them to life,
as Fredric Jameson has suggested (see Fredric Jameson, "Historicism in
<I>The Shining</I>," in <I>Signatures of the Visible</I> [New York:
Routledge, 1992], 82-98). Rather, it is the temporality of the
photograph, its unique moment in time, that these sequences undermine
as they conflate and subvert their several temporalities by introducing
narrative--or cinematic time--into their frames.

Kubrick's visual allusion to Lewis Carroll is a complex one, perhaps
referring less directly to <I>Through the Looking Glass</I> than to
Carroll's staged photographs, whose transparent dream res and ghosts
seem to speculate on the nature of the photographic medium. Kubrick
also alludes to sequences in Expressionist film in which the mirror
image takes on a life of its own. See especially Paul Wegener's

Frederic Raphael asserts: "It is, however, absurd to try to understand

to have two Jewish parents. Jews are not featured in any of his films;
he seemed to expose, or at least to dwell on, many ugly aspects of human
behavior, but he never confronted anti-Semitism. Is it unduly fanciful

Kafka's <I>The Trial</I>, and that he seems to have read <I>The Castle</I>
in 1928, two years after the publication of <I>Traumnovelle</I>. But the
actual presence of "Kafkaesque" material in Schnitzler's text is not at
issue; what matters is how Kubrick--who did read Kafka--may have read the
Schnitzler novella, one of the literary texts that most fascinated him.
