      In 2007, the New York Public Library ran an exhibition, “Russia Imagined 1825–1925: The Art and Impact of Fedor Solntsev,” which provided an illuminating view of the beginnings of Russia’s folk art revival. Solntsev was best known for <span style="font-style:italic;">Antiquities of the Russian State</span> , a lavish illustrated catalogue of ancient and medieval artifacts from the Kremlin treasuries. Funded personally by Nikolai I, Solntsev’s catalogue pioneered the use of medieval forms as a means of articulating a distinct national culture. In his inventories and paintings, the artist combined such disparate elements as Scythian weapons, ancient Greek statuary, Byzantine regalia, and medieval manuscripts “into a single, palpable vision of Russian history, a cross section of culture, geography, and time.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>
      The curator of the exhibition Wendy Salmond convincingly argues that Solntsev created a unified synthesis of the cultures that existed before Peter the Great’s westernizing reforms of the eighteenth century. Moreover, as the basis for what became known as the “Old Russian” style, Solntsev’s revivalist vision was an enduring one. What was most striking, however, was how effectively Solntsev’s version of “Old Russia” served the interests of the imperial state, creating an ideological union of pre- and post-imperial Russia. As Salmond writes, Solntsev’s work betrays “an overwhelming emphasis on the hierarchy, symbols, and rites of the Orthodox Church and the Romanov dynasty,” that was designed to “[bind] the peoples of the Russian Empire together around a single ‘Great Russian idea’.”<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>
      The seamless bond between “Old Russia” and absolute monarchy that Solntsev achieved for Nikolai I was often imitated,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> but by the twentieth century such an ideological synthesis was unsustainable. In 1913, Nikolai II presided over numerous lavish events planned to celebrate the tercentenary of the Romanov dynasty. One such event, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition of Cottage Industries</span>, notably echoed the ambitions of Solntsev’s albums by attempting to forge a connection, through visual and material culture, between the legitimacy of the autocrat and the authenticity of “Old Russia.” However, the negative critical response to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span> is evidence that the unified understanding of antiquity and nationality that was created under Nikolai I could no longer be maintained. While the preoccupation with antiquity as a medium of collective identity continued and even grew after Solntsev’s time, the question of what constituted antiquity, and whose traditions were represented, became a point of contention rather than unification.
    </p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Second All-Russian Exhibition</span> was an indication of the failure of the “Great Russian idea” attributed to Solntsev and Nikolai I. Despite its commercial and popular success, the exhibition garnered scathing reviews from both the liberal newspaper <span style="font-style:italic;">Speech</span> and the modern art journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Apollo</span>, both of which were important forums for progressive public opinion. In addition, other exhibitions of folk art that occurred at the same time, such as Mikhail Larionov’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span>, formed an implicit critique of the role of autocracy in “Old Russia.” While liberal and progressive critics outlined the glaring paradoxes of imperial folk revivalism, Larionov presented an alternative vision of “Old Russia” and its relevance to modernity.
    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Folk Art Exhibitions of 1913</h1>
<p>
	On the afternoon of 10 March 1913, the most powerful men in Russia (with the exception of the Emperor himself) gathered at the grand neoclassical halls of the Imperial Botanical gardens in Saint Petersburg to celebrate the opening of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span>.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Under the patronage of the Empress Aleksandra and organized by the Grand Duke of Oldenburg, the exhibition was part of a series of public spectacles celebrating the tercentenary of the Romanov dynasty.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> The exhibition’s pavilions were filled with all manner of luxury goods, from embroidery produced at the state-run School of Folk Art in Saint Petersburg, to toys from the private Sergiev-Posad workshops, to furniture and carpets produced by the workshops administered by regional councils (<span style="font-style:italic;">zemstva</span>). (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>) Tsar Nikolai himself visited the exhibition on 22 March and was regaled with gifts, but the Emperor’s stamp of approval was not needed to prompt the public to fall in love with the motley display.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Even on the first day, when only the press and people of high social rank were admitted, many of the objects proudly displayed tickets declaring them sold (L, 3). The exhibition opened to the general public three days later, and, even though it was a workday, 1,600 entry tickets were sold by the afternoon.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> The Secretary of State used such statistics to claim a great victory for imperial leadership in Russian crafts.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>
	The passion for Russian folk art took on a different cast when it was staged by the avant-garde painter Larionov. On 24 March, just two days after the Emperor’s visit to the Botanical Gardens, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span> (templates for icon  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> painters and broadsheet prints) opened in Moscow. In a small private gallery, this exhibition had none of the imperial pedigree or regalia of its Petersburg contemporary. Instead of luxury craft goods housed in neoclassical grandeur, the Moscow exhibition displayed far more modest items, crowded into a relatively small space.

<div class="reEnd"></div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span> was organized by Larionov in conjunction with a group exhibition of avant-garde painting called <span style="font-style:italic;">The Target</span>. The two opened simultaneously in neighboring rooms in Anna Mikhailova’s Salon. At <span style="font-style:italic;">The Target</span>, Larionov exhibited his series of ethnic <span style="font-style:italic;">Venuses</span> and his lubki-inspired <span style="font-style:italic;">Seasons</span>.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> More importantly, both Larionov and his partner, Natalya Goncharova, presented their primarily abstract rayist canvases, an avant-garde gauntlet thrown down in defiance of traditionalists. Across the hall, at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span>, on the other hand, Larionov presented these far more traditional objects, many of which were from his own collection.
      </p>
<p>
	Although Larionov’s exhibitions relied on the contrast between the avant-garde and the traditional, his presentation of the icons and lubki also presented a stark contrast with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span> in Petersburg. The presentations of folk and traditional art at these exhibitions demonstrated the disparity between imperial and avant-garde narratives of national character. Like the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span> took advantage of urban Russians’ desire to view examples of “authentic” national art. The framework of this nostalgia, however,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> differed fundamentally from one event to the other. The contrast between the imperial and avant-garde displays of folk art indicated that modernity and the primitive were not simple terms with stable associations. Instead, the politics of late imperial Russia demanded to know what kind of “primitive” was at stake, in order to know what kind of modernity was being forwarded.
      </p>
<p>
	Pairing the icons and lubki with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Target</span>, Larionov, Goncharova, and their cohort connected these traditional and archaic forms with the most advanced art then found in Russia. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Target</span> was intended as an assault on public taste; Larionov’s and Goncharova’s rayist paintings were a provocation that went far beyond the “Cézannist” pictures of their rivals in the Jack of Diamonds, a modernist group to which both Larionov and Goncharova had previously belonged. At the debate organized to publicize the exhibition, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Target</span> speakers condemned their Jack of Diamonds rivals as timid dilettantes. Entitled, “The East, Nationality, and the West,” the debate demonstrated the strange mixture of nationalism, primitivism, and Futurism that characterized the group. Aleksandr Shevchenko began with a lecture on the negative influence of the West on Russian art, contending that Russian art was closer to Eastern and Asian visual culture. Ilya Zdanevich, on the other hand, sang the praises of telephones, trolley cars, and airplanes, proposing that a patent-leather shoe was more beautiful than the Venus de Milo. Both called for nationalism and a final break with the West.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Like the Jack of Diamonds dispute the year before, this evening ended with a brawl and was closed by the police. Larionov and Goncharova, who were deemed responsible for the breakdown and disorder, were arrested and later convicted for disturbing the peace.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> As part of this oppositional <span style="font-style:italic;">Target</span> program, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span> was explicitly anti-academic. And unlike the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span> in Petersburg, Larionov’s icons and lubki in no way celebrated the imperial family’s dynastic anniversary.
      </p>
<p>
	The pointed contrast between the two events raises a series of questions about the role of folk art in the period. How could traditional peasant crafts serve as an argument for the legitimacy of Romanov autocracy in Saint Petersburg, while in Moscow the same category of objects was forwarded by those who claimed to challenge these existing authorities? The objects in themselves may not be able to answer the question, but the logic of the organizers and, especially, the critical reception of the two exhibitions, give a clearer picture. To its critics, the imperial exhibition was transparent autocratic propaganda. Larionov’s icons and lubki, on the other hand, should also be seen in the context of critics and artists who were trying to rethink the concept of authentic national expression as an instrument of political opposition. The organizers of the two exhibitions did not only disagree on what folk art was or how it should be presented, but also on the question of what the “folk” or nationality itself was, and how it could be reified through visual culture.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Critique of the Petrine Reforms and the Russian Folk Art Revival</h1>
<p>
	Despite their differences, the organizers of the imperial exhibition, the schools and workshops whose products were displayed there, and the avant-garde artists who presented the icons and lubki did have one important thing in common: their inheritance of the principles of the nineteenth-century folk art revival. Like craft revivals in other European countries, the Russian revival was a response to crises of collective identity in the face of dramatic economic change. The Russian folk art and craft revival, though, was rife with internal contradictions, partly responsible for the split evidenced by the 1913 exhibitions.
      </p>
<p>
	While Solntsev provided a formal template for the antiquarian and ethnographic bases of the Russian folk art revival, the movement was also a material manifestation of a broad critique of post-Petrine Russia. By the 1880s it was commonplace for educated Russians to believe that Peter the Great’s eighteenth-century reforms (introducing European educational institutions, dress, social customs, and reforming both the Russian language and the Russian Orthodox church) had stripped Russia’s educated classes of any recognizable Russian identity. The identification of pre-Petrine culture with authentic Russianness was an idea with its own distinct intellectual history. Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries official imperial culture cleaved to the idea of Peter I as the founder of the Russian nation. At the same time, however, many major res in Russian thought were beginning to have doubts about the efficacy of Peter’s reforms. As early as 1810, Russia’s first major historian, Nikolai Karamzin, formulated a critique of Peter’s reform that would shape the folk art revival that developed later in the century. By forcing the populace to change their native dress and customs, Karamzin said, Peter enacted a violation of human rights, an act of violence and humiliation. Karamzin’s view of national identity as a human right reflected broader trends within European political philosophy, but he was also among the first to identify Peter’s reforms as a split within the Russian nation:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  Until [Peter’s] reign all Russians, from the plow to the throne, had been alike insofar as they shared certain features of external appearance and of customs. After Peter, the higher classes separated themselves from the lower ones, and the Russian peasant, burgher, and merchant began to treat the Russian gentry as Germans, thus weakening the spirit of brotherly national unity binding the estates of the realm.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Karamzin introduced the idea that Peter’s reforms created an insurmountable rift between the gentry and the masses, the former embodying modern Russia and the latter preserving antiquity. Karamzin’s argument is borne out by the views of the lower classes themselves. From the period of Peter’s reign itself, popular literature, illustrations, and folklore tended to represent Peter as, at best, a foreign usurper, and, at worst, the Antichrist himself.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>
	A generation later, more radical writers expanded upon Karamzin’s critique. Not only were the classes separated by this cultural rift, but the upper classes were more or less devoid of any true culture at all. In 1836, Petr Chaadaev shocked the Russian  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> intelligentsia with his categorically nihilist understanding of Russian history. In his “Philosophical Letter” he described the Russian nation as a historical and cultural black hole, one that “only adopted deceiving appearances and useless luxury from all the things that others have thought out . . . .” Speaking of Peter, Chaadaev said, “One time, a great man wanted to civilize us, and in order to give us a foretaste of enlightenment, he threw us the cloak of civilization: we took up the cloak but did not so much as touch civilization.”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> The westernization of Russia was not only limited in its demographics. Even the aristocracy, bureaucracy, and bourgeoisie who had taken up Peter’s reforms had done so only in the most superficial way. According to Chaadaev, the Russian gentry turned “great truths” into “useless luxuries”; they wore the cloak Peter gave them, but did not touch the substance.
      </p>
<p>
	Both Chaadaev’s and Karamzin’s observations led logically to even starker views of the relationship between the Russian people and the Russian state. The slavophile Konstantin Aksakov referred to Peter’s reforms as “a dangerous and deep-rooted ulcer in the body of our Russia.” Describing the process of westernization Peter imposed on the population, Aksakov argued: “Thus was accomplished the rift between the tsar and his people . . . thus there arose in the place of the previous bond the yoke of the state over the land. The Russian land became, as it were, conquered territory and the state was the conqueror.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> To Karamzin’s notion of the split between the masses and the intelligentsia, and to Chaadaev’s assertion that the Russian intelligentsia were lacking in culture altogether, Aksakov added the provocative claim that Russia was a nation colonized by its own state. With this extended critique of Peter’s reforms, the idea of Russian history as split into Petrine and Muscovite, modern and ancient, European and Asian, rational and spiritual, superficial and authentic, settled into the intellectual ether.
      </p>
<p>
	The negative reassessment of Peter’s reforms, and the resulting belief that only the peasantry had retained native Russian traditions and sensibilities, was most powerfully articulated in the folk art revival. The revival was an attempt to encourage and preserve the physical manifestations of the supposedly authentic Russian culture of the rural masses. In addition to the critique of Europeanization and the belief in the authenticity of the peasantry, the folk art revivalists were prompted by a new sense of urgency. The survival of peasant culture, as they knew it, was threatened by new economic and political forces. Although the abolition of serfdom in 1861 earned Alexander II the title of “Tsar Liberator,” the so-called liberation just as often increased the level of hardship experienced by the rural peasantry. Combined with the beginning of industrialization in Russia, the conditions of liberation encouraged economic migration to urban centers. Considering that, in 1851, less than eight percent of the Russian population lived in cities or towns, urbanization constituted a traumatic change for Russian social life.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> As the old feudal estates began to disintegrate, the traditional estate-based crafts, such as lacemaking, embroidery, pottery, and woodworking, also lost their institutional base. In the 1870s and 1880s, founders of the folk art revival, such as Vladimir Stasov and Elena Polenova, warned that these arts were in danger of permanent extinction; the physical objects that embodied the essence of the Russian nation, they claimed, would be lost forever.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	Subsequently, various private and state-run initiatives were developed to prevent this predicted extermination of national spirit. At the Abramtsevo estate near Moscow, Saava and Elizaveta Mamontov set up craft workshops in an attempt to maintain traditional labor and economic structures. Princess Maria Tenisheva exercised similar efforts at Talashkino, her estate near Vitebsk. Without such opportunities, revivalists argued, the younger members of the local peasantry would migrate to the city to work in industry, losing their native culture.
      </p>
<p>
	The state also took part in this attempt to revive craft as a rural industry, both to help maintain traditional social structures and as a way to supplement agriculture in the face of drought and natural disasters. With growing peasant unrest and the rise of violent political dissent in the cities, the amelioration of rural poverty was an urgent matter. Local and regional administrations set up land management and crafts distribution channels that encouraged the development of urban markets for traditional crafts, thereby establishing a viable crafts industry in the countryside.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>
	In 1905, the imperial state expanded upon these local efforts by establishing the Chief Administration of Agriculture and Land Tenure (GUZZ), a section of the Ministry of Agriculture dedicated to supporting peasant craft industries. In 1913, the GUZZ was the primary organizing body of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span> and of one of its most important exhibitors, the School of Folk Art. Like the Abramtsevo and Talashkino workshops before it, the School of Folk art was dedicated to helping young peasants and workers gain the skills necessary to make marketable crafts—skills that they were no longer learning from their own community. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span> thus had an economic as well as ideological purpose. In addition to celebrating the Romanov tercentenary, the exhibition advertised the products of rural cottage industry. This was a necessary step because, in order to compete with cheaper factory-made goods, craft items needed to be understood as aesthetically and ethically superior. The state itself had an interest in promoting the folk art revival—making craft objects fashionable and desirable was a political and economic imperative.
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Folk Art Revival and the Nationalities Question</h1>
<p>
	By promoting the authenticity and national integrity of peasant crafts, the GUZZ attempted to help craft goods compete in the marketplace, but the correlation of peasant crafts with the Romanov tercentenary had its own ideological function as well. The GUZZ was founded in the height of the unrest that followed Bloody Sunday (9 January 1905) when imperial troops killed hundreds of unarmed strikers attempting to deliver a petition to the Emperor.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Struggling to bring back a modicum of order, as well as heal the increasingly bitter divide between the state and civil society, Nikolai II’s regime introduced a number of reforms. Although the most important was the so-called October Manifesto, which promised civil rights and an elected legislature, enhanced state support for rural crafts was a significant part of the government’s campaign to restore its credibility.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	The importance of the rural aspects of the 1905 revolution should not be underestimated. Though the unrest began with massive general strikes in larger cities like Warsaw, Saint Petersburg, and Moscow, the destruction or seizure by peasants of state and privately held lands was one of the most common forms of dissent during the period (<span style="font-style:italic;">R</span>, 52–56, 139–45). It was therefore urgent that the state address the concerns of the peasantry, who were plagued by crushing land management and taxation policies, as well as drought and other natural disasters.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> In other words, what was under extreme duress in 1905 was the supposedly sacred bond between Tsar and people that Solntsev had so successfully conveyed in his works for Nikolai I. It was this mystical bond that provided the justification for Romanov autocracy. The politics of the GUZZ and its activities, such as the 1913 exhibition, are therefore reasonably transparent: Nikolai II’s regime, with the establishment of the GUZZ and the promotion of rural crafts, was attempting to ideologize away the rift between the Emperor and the “real” Russian people, that is, the non-westernized peasantry.
      </p>
<p>
	The organization and literature surrounding the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span> revealed the ways the imperial state hoped to make folk art serve their interests. In a 1911 address to the All-Russian Crafts Congress, Adrian Prakhov, a professor at the Imperial Academy of Art and a frequent spokesman for the GUZZ, declared, “The artistic education of the common people can have only one goal—allowing the national spirit in all its purity to be expressed in artistic form.”<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> In this statement Prakhov expressed the early revivalist belief that fundamental cultural renewal (the expression of a national spirit) could be coaxed through institutional structures (crafts education). Bureaucrats like Prakhov tried to assimilate the early populist tendencies of the craft revival into the policies of the imperial state. The idea of folk authenticity was, for a time, powerful enough to reconcile Prakhov’s paradoxical claim to authentic folk expression through state intervention.
      </p>
<p>
	However, in his essay introducing the catalogue for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span>, Prakhov revealed that the imperial state had even more pressing obstacles in their creation of imperial nationality than the philosophical hypocrisy of the folk art revival. Explaining the choice of works illustrated in the enormous exhibition catalogue, Prakhov wrote:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	  The selection of examples printed in the eighty-eight plates . . . thought by the [GUZZ] to be the “exhibition of honor” of the best artistic peasant crafts goods—was made without bias. The goods were chosen exclusively for their distinctiveness and aesthetic attraction. The result, it turns out, is that the Great Russian provinces, which are grouped around . . . Moscow, have contributed eighty-four drawings to the book; Little Russia [Ukraine], the center that is second in significance, gave thirty-nine drawings; the Caucasus and the Asian regions gave twenty-two; the Southern provinces of European Russia gave seven; the Polish Kingdom—six, Finland—six.
	</p>
<p>
	  The numbers speak for themselves and confirm the lasting impressions received from visits to the exhibition.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Prakhov’s claim—that the “exhibition of honor” was chosen on the basis of merit, or “distinctiveness,” alone, and for that reason the ethnic Russian works should naturally form the majority—was inherently suspicious. Prakhov’s transparent ethnic Russian chauvinism should be read in terms of the broader imperial treatment of the “nationalities question.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> In such a multinational state as Russia, the status of the ethnic minorities had been a constant source of conflict, and tensions had only increased by the late nineteenth century. In 1897 the state carried out the first complete census of the empire. When the data was finally fully published in 1904, the results showed that ethnic Russians made up less than half the population of the Russian empire. The spiritual ideal of the Russian nation therefore faced a double threat of obliteration: economic destruction of the peasants (the only authentic Russians) on the one hand, and the waning of ethnic dominance through natural demographic change on the other.
      </p>
<p>
	Prakhov’s comments on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span> demonstrate that the anxiety over the “nationalities question” could be used to reconcile the appropriation of a populist argument by the imperial state. In an essay accompanying an earlier exhibition of craft arts, Prakhov explained that the purpose of developing a “national spirit” was, “Not to imitate a pre-existing foreign [culture] but to raise one’s own profoundly national one to universal significance—that is the task of those nations whom Providence has ordained for greatness; and it is the task of the [ethnic] Russian people.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> In this formulation, craft is both a concrete manifestation of authentic national spirit and a guarantor of continued ethnic Russian hegemony in the Empire. Prakhov was reformulating the folk art revival. It was no longer a search for an authentic expression of a formerly repressed national character, but a careful shaping and controlling of that expression to reflect a particular kind of national character—one that would enforce the hegemony of a minority ethnicity while helping to justify continued autocratic rule.
      </p>
<p>
	The situation became even more pressing in the period surrounding the 1905 revolution. While this revolution is often understood as a call for political and civil rights for the lower and middle classes, the “nationalities question” was central to the supposedly universal concerns of democracy and the rule of law. Though many factors contributed to the widespread rebellions of 1905, the question of “national spirit” was in fact a vital point of revolutionary discord. For centuries, the social and political rights for which the 1905 revolutionaries agitated had been distributed along ethnic and national lines. National groups within the empire had largely differing degrees of political autonomy—different rights to travel, own property, and use their own language.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> In his authoritative account of the 1905 revolution, Abraham Ascher admits that, “it is not easy to separate the national from the social and political factors” in determining the cause of various instances of unrest (<span style="font-style:italic;">R</span>, 47). In truth, some of the non-Russian nationalities were already engaged in full-scale revolt before Bloody Sunday, the event that supposedly set off the revolution (<span style="font-style:italic;">RE</span>, 330).<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>
	The political landscape in the aftermath of the 1905 revolution was also deeply affected by the “nationalities question.” Several of the reform measures were national in character: on 21 October 1905 (four days after the October Manifesto), the government granted amnesty to all political prisoners, a move which largely favored the Poles, 1,511  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of whom were being held in Warsaw alone. The next day the state restored autonomy to the Kingdom of Finland (which had been put under direct Russian control in 1899), and in November 1905 the administration added 133 towns to the Pale of Settlement for Jews (<span style="font-style:italic;">R</span>, 80–81). The most important reform, the establishment of an elected legislative body (the Duma), began a political process that further demonstrated the growing power of the non-<span style="font-style:italic;">russkii</span> Russians—220 out of the approximately 490 elected members of the first Duma were not ethnic Russians (<span style="font-style:italic;">RE</span>, 341). Their power actually exceeded their numbers, as the Constitutional Democrats (Kadets), the political party with the largest plurality, relied on the national factions to create a majority voting bloc.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>
	The revolution ushered in a new era of national consciousness among the minorities and civic engagement among the populace as a whole, yet it likewise prompted a huge backlash against non-Russian national groups. The October Manifesto, published on 17 October 1905, declared that all citizens of the empire had inviolability of person, freedom of conscience, speech, assembly, and association. It also announced the distribution of voting rights to formerly disenfranchised classes of people, and the imminent election of the Duma, without which, the manifesto declared, no law could be passed (<span style="font-style:italic;">R</span>, 74). If the October Manifesto had actually been implemented as written, it would have meant the end of Romanov autocracy and the establishment of a constitutional monarchy. Public reaction to the new system was immediate. On 18 October the celebrations that filled the streets were met by an orgy of violence against Jews and other national minorities. The violence threw the country back into a state of anarchy as extreme as that which the Manifesto had been designed to quell (<span style="font-style:italic;">R</span>, 81–82). What is important here is that the supposedly universal ideals of political or democratic rights were, in fact, closely linked to the imperial hierarchy of nationalities. Such reactionary groups as the Union of Russian People and the Black Hundreds saw a natural link between the defence of autocracy and the defence of ethnic Russian dominance.
      </p>
<p>
	Official complicity with anti-minority violence was seemingly confirmed by the government’s actions following the revolutionary period. After the dissolution of the second Duma on 3 June 1907, Prime Minister Petr Stolypin severely curtailed the voting rights of non-propertied citizens and national minorities. This was only the beginning of a far-reaching official backlash against the nationalities. In 1910, Finnish autonomy was again revoked and periodicals were banned from publishing in Ukrainian (<span style="font-style:italic;">RE</span>, 343–44). Agrarian reform, which had been initiated partly to prevent further revolutionary unrest among the peasantry, was enlisted as part of the broad anti-minority policy. In Central Asia, the distribution of land to formerly landless peasants was made at the great expense of Muslim nomads (<span style="font-style:italic;">RE</span>, 346–47).
      </p>
<p>
	The backlash against liberalism and ethnic nationalities continued during the period of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span>. On 9 February 1911, while the Duma discussed the possibility of dissolving the Pale of Settlement (a first step towards granting Jews rights comparable to other citizens), members of the nobility raised the specter of alleged Jewish blood rituals. This political debate regarding civil rights and nationality policy was followed, in March, by the accusation of a Jewish clerk, Menahem Mendel Beilis, of the ritual murder of a Ukrainian boy in Kiev. With the preponderance of evidence  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> supporting Beilis’s innocence, the state nevertheless continued to press charges. The political circumstances surrounding the trial, the fact that few actually believed Beilis to be guilty, and the obvious corruption of the prosecutors have led historians to point to the Beilis trial as a transparent act of political intimidation against the nationalities and the left in general. The connection between the obscure Jew from Kiev and the political left was further cemented by Vasily Maklakov, a prominent liberal politician who served as Beilis’s defense attorney.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> The trial concluded with Beilis’s acquittal in September 1913, but not before the affair had deepened the split within public opinion.
      </p>
<p>
	With the momentum of political reaction and the Beilis controversy raging in the background, the politics of imperial support for the craft revival take on a new transparency. As the political right tried to identify civil rights and the democratic process as a threat to the “Russian-ness” of the Empire, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span> demonstrated the supposed ethnic superiority of ethnic Russians and served as a justification of imperial autocracy.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Critiques of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition of Cottage Industries</span>
</h1>
<p>
	Within the flood of oppositional journalism that followed the October Manifesto, art criticism played a surprisingly prominent role, and it was art critics who exposed the political paradoxes of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span>. Two reviews of the exhibition, in particular, emphasized its failure to provide convincing narratives of either Russian superiority or national spirit. The first review, in the Kadet-party newspaper, <span style="font-style:italic;">Speech</span>, most clearly demonstrated the conflict between imperial and oppositional claims to the authenticity of a mythologized folk.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> The <span style="font-style:italic;">Speech</span> critic, S. Lyubosh’, directly contradicted Prakhov’s claim that the Russian crafts dominated “without bias” and through quality and “distinctiveness” alone. A viewer’s first impression, Lyubosh’ said, was “that the frontiers and the non-Russian areas in general, presented themselves at this exhibition with a brighter expression of the national character of their art than did native Russia” (L, 3). Lithuanian, Polish, Caucasian, Kirgiz, Ukrainian, and Finnish craftspeople, “hardly exhibited anything without a determined physiognomy”; whereas the Russian workshops often produced goods “completely alien to any folk motif” (L, 3). Lyubosh’s observations were borne out by such works as a carpet depicting medieval Russian knights created in a GUZZ-administered workshop. (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>) The clumsy res in the colorful landscape are closer to stylized art nouveau visions of Russian folklore than to any actual native tradition. The fault lay in the government workshops and schools that had been “improving” Russian crafts for so long. These improvements, Lyubosh’ claimed, “met the demands and interests of the market and developed industry in a direction having nothing in common with the revival of folk style.” In contrast, the non-Russian crafts, like the Polish and Kirgiz carpets displayed at the exhibition, still maintained “national character” in their works because they were immune to the improvements and economic support of the imperial state (L, 3). (<a name="3-text" href="#3">. 3</a> and <a name="4-text" href="#4">4</a>) Prakhov may have claimed “distinctiveness” as the measure of quality that set  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the Russian material apart, but this very criterion was just as easily turned back against the Russian material.

	The premise of Lyubosh’s critique was not entirely new. In a 1911 issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Apollo</span>, Aleksandr Mantel’ complained that the ethnic Russian population of the city of Kazan’ had lost all folk creativity. This was not true, he claimed, of the native Tatar population. Mantel’ attributed this Tatar authenticity to “the closedness and fanatical nationalism which coerces the Tatar to estrange himself from everything Russian. And thank God. Otherwise even these crumbs of folk taste would disappear.”<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

	tension over the “nationalities question.” With the intelligentsia and imperial state “improving” native Russian folk culture into a form beyond recognition, and the repression of native languages, customs, and educational institutions for the non-Russian nationalities, critics like Lyubosh’ and Mantel’ had grounds to fear that any form of authentic national character was destined to be destroyed by imperial policies. Official promotion of so-called “Great Russian” nationality was thus also understood as repressive of authentic nationality in general, including Russian nationality.
      </p>
<p>
	By far the most damning indictment of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span> was also found in <span style="font-style:italic;">Apollo</span>. Here, the critic Georgii Lukomskii mocked the absurd juxtaposition of romantic nostalgia for Russian peasant life with the reality of bourgeois Moscow and Petersburg taste:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	  The art of the rural craftsman—a gray hut, the light of a candle, the smell of tar, limewood, bright colors, the measured sound of the joiner’s bench, a doleful song . . . and an empire-style exhibition entryway designed by civil engineer Count de Rochefore, a frieze filled with griffons and imperial attributes, bucranias, ionic capitals and similar details of [posh] Moscow homes.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Lukomskii admitted that Sergei Chekhonin’s exhibition design was well-executed. However, he lamented its lack of authenticity:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	  No matter how successful the decorations are in places, no matter how closely Chekhonin approaches the spirit of Russian folk art, it is nevertheless the work of a cultured Petersburg artist, and one would have wanted to see here exactly the work of craftsmen left to their own devices in decorating the walls, ceilings, etc.
	</p>
<div class="attrib">
	  (GL, 39)
	</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  Moreover, Lukomskii’s words echoed Lyubosh’s in that he blamed this absurd falsity on both the aristocratic assumption of superiority in taste and, just as importantly, the market forces driving the crafts revival:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	    From the general number of displays . . . a part appears to be the fruit of spontaneous fantasy and personal taste (not dictated by a school or by urban manufacturing culture) or else full of the throwbacks of good old traditions; the other, significantly larger part relates to the inventions of our high society ladies . . . .
	  </p>
<p>
	    Of course, the exhibition has once again proven that the granting of full freedom in work and possibly a larger demand on production is what would best of all facilitate the development of folk creativity. However, such a course is deemed insufficiently profitable for the craftsmen, and so we have the schools . . . .
	  </p>
<div class="attrib">
	    (GL, 40)
	  </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    As Lyubosh’ and Lukomskii both implied, most of the craft revival institutions dictated forms according to market demand and at the same time justified their state support by claiming to preserve threatened cultural practices. By 1913, this tension between urban bourgeois taste and the narrative of folk authenticity could no longer be reconciled. Even worse, Lukomskii claimed that the craft revival movement had successfully repressed any possibility of true folk creativity. Speaking of the folk art schools, he said:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	      Culture is sown, advice is given, how to make the things that would be successful for a large public and, most importantly, make a good profit. But with this course, alas, only a second rate art is developed, [an art] adapted to the philistine tastes of the urban dweller. The pedagogical course is the most thoughtless and destructive for the development of the original creativity of the folk! [Judging] by the exemplars exhibited by the School of Folk Art, we clearly see how fruitless is the effort by the city to support old rural traditions in art.
	    </p>
<div class="attrib">
	      (GL, 40)
	    </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      Lukomskii complained that the crafts revival movement had betrayed the reformist impulses of its original primitivist aesthetics: it had abandoned the idea of a folk culture generated outside of the top-down Petrine reforms that had imposed European language and dress on the upper classes. Instead, as many critics pointed out, the new crafts revival shaped folk culture to match the very imperial culture from which it was supposed to differ. This false, packaged manifestation of folk creativity reified a homogenous ethnic Russianness, doing nothing to revive the national spirit squashed by Peter’s reforms.
	    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Larionov and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span>
</h1>
<p>
	      From Prakhov’s catalogue essay, it is clear how the imperial court used the evidence of a peasant creativity strongly identified with the empire to justify autocratic rule. That many on the left understood this agenda is indicated by the criticism forwarded by Lyubosh’ and Lukomskii. The question still remains, however, why the artistic avant-garde also chose folk art to forward its own agenda. Larionov’s exhibition and its accompanying literature, while sharing many of the same precepts as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Speech</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Apollo</span> journalists, presented a startling new appraisal of the role of folk art. In his manifestos and catalogues Larionov outlined an anti-imperial strategy that used the “nationalities question” as a path of anti-autocratic dissent, thereby also challenging the folk art appeal in which autocracy had been packaged.
	    </p>
<p>
	      While the critics attacked the imperial exhibition’s presentation of folk art, Larionov’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span> presented an alternative vision of the folk. The choice of objects was certainly significant here, as icons and lubki each had a particular resonance for the Russian public. Icons were often seen as a symbol of Russia’s inheritance of the legacy of Byzantium, an indication that the Empire had a special divine sanction, and evidence of the spiritual bond between the Russian people and their state. On the other hand, lubki had a distinctly anti-imperial quality, and their use emphasized the opposition between “authentic” and official culture that formed the heart of the above-cited critique of the Petrine reforms.
	    </p>
<p>
	      In addition to the objects themselves, the context in which Larionov situated them was distinct. By pairing the <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span> with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Target</span>, a group effort showcasing the most avant-garde painting in Russia, Larionov attempted to reveal a kinship between the primitive art of icons and lubki and that of himself and his peers.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Larionov’s own writing for the exhibition affirms that he imagined an anti-historical framework for the relationship between folk art, modern art, and national  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> history itself. In this way, Larionov attempted to free folk art and folk identity from the linear historical and geographic conceptions of ethnic identity that were used to rationalize such official demonstrations of national revival as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second All-Russian Exhibition of Cottage Industries</span>.
	    </p>
<p>
	      As the legacy of the folk art revival was one of the most contested arenas of culture in late imperial Russia, it warrants examination as the place that official and avant-garde approaches to the broader problem of national identity were differentiated. Larionov had a long-standing interest and investment in traditional and archaic Russian art and his organization of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span> in March 1913 marked a high point in this dimension of his practice. Larionov established his avant-garde credentials as a founder of the Jack of Diamonds group in 1910 and he demonstrated his interest in ethnic and national identity with paintings of Gypsies and Turks and a series of ethnic <span style="font-style:italic;">Venuses</span> in 1912. However, it was in his practice as a collector, organizer, and spokesman that Larionov best articulated an avant-garde approach to the primitive and to nationality at odds with official and academic positions.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Larionov first emerged as a defender of traditional Russian art in an interview with the newspaper <span style="font-style:italic;">Against the Grain</span>. Asked to comment on the 1911–12 All-Russian Congress of Artists, Larionov insisted that artistic organizations were generally useless—but made an exception for the preservation of icons, an urgent task that artists needed to take up.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Larionov’s comments on artistic organization was probably prompted by his recent split from the Jack of Diamonds group, which planned to solidify their loose association into a formal exhibiting society. Two weeks earlier, in an interview with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Voice of Moscow</span> (Golos Moskvy), Larionov explained that he left the Jack of Diamonds because they were already an academic school. Emphasizing that he still considered himself an “extreme realist,” Larionov underlined that his idea of realism was to use painterly methods to represent the essence of things. The Jack of Diamonds painters were also realists, but they cared about the form, rather than the being, of things. In effect, Larionov claimed that the Jack of Diamonds were realists of the “Repin school.”<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> Little could be more offensive for the self-styled progressives of the Jack of Diamonds than association with what was then seen as the reactionary artistic force of didactic realism, in the person of Ilya Repin.
	    </p>
<p>
	      The break between Larionov and Goncharova and their former Jack of Diamonds comrades was flamboyantly consummated at a public debate organized on the eve of the second Jack of Diamonds exhibition in February 1912. Objecting strongly to the use of her work in a slide lecture on cubism, Goncharova wrote an open letter to several newspapers:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		Cubism is a good thing, although it is not altogether new, especially in Russia. The Scythians, in blessed remembrance, made their stone statuettes in this style, and at our fairs, amazing beautiful wooden dolls are sold. These are sculptural works, but in France, too, Gothic and Negro sculptural representations served as a point of departure for cubism in painting.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      In her comments, Goncharova chose not to reject cubism outright, but rather to reorient it as an authentically Russian tradition rather than as a French innovation. With the creation of their new group, the Donkey’s Tail, Larionov and Goncharova were both asserting their commitment to Russian national art and concurrently distancing themselves from the perceived “westernizing” qualities of other avant-garde painters in Russia. Moreover, by comparing them to the “Repin School,” Larionov managed to accuse the “Jacks” of being derivative of both French modernism and Russian academicism, two categories that had previously been understood as opposed.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<p>
	      The Donkey’s Tail marked a new clarity on the part of Larionov and Goncharova, especially in the importance and function of “primitive” art, native Russian primitive art in particular, for their own creative processes. Folklore and folk art were already part of the Jack of Diamonds repertoire, but Larionov and Goncharova wanted their new group to have a more authentic, “purer” expression of Russian national art, hence the term “purism” (rather than later monikers such as cubofuturism or neoprimitivism) for this new intransigent faction of the Moscow avant-garde. In an address to the above-mentioned All-Russian Artists’ Congress, the poet Sergei Bobrov claimed that the Russian purists “having overcome Cézanne, Gauguin, and Matisse, have returned to their Russian roots, to Russian archaism.”<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Purism, according to Bobrov, found its sources in
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		our amazing icons—those world-class culminations of Christian religious art, our old lubki, Northern embroideries, stone women, bas-relief on communion bread and crosses, and our old shop signs. There is so much here that is new, touched by no one . . . . Russian purists, having seen all this value, became one with it, penetrated into the very soul of it. Henceforth our native antiquities, our archaism lead us towards unknown prospects.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      Bobrov, Goncharova, and Larionov followed these pronouncements with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Donkey’s Tail</span> Exhibition in March 1912, where Larionov showed primitivizing paintings of soldiers, Turks, and urban street scenes. Goncharova displayed work that corresponded more literally to Bobrov’s description: religious paintings, paintings in the style of lubki and embroideries, and peasant themes. However, while the purists claimed a privileged access to their Russian heritage, these “roots” were hardly recognized as legitimately national—eight of Goncharova’s religious paintings, for example, were confiscated by the state on suspicion of blasphemy.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> This conflict between the avant-garde and officialdom anticipated the more stridently oppositional use of folk art that Larionov engineered in the spring of 1913.
	    </p>
<p>
	      The March 1913 <span style="font-style:italic;">Exhibition of Icon Patterns and Lubki</span> was a follow-up, of sorts, to the <span style="font-style:italic;">First Exhibition of Lubki</span>, which was organized by Larionov’s friend, the architect Nikolai Vinogradov, and was on display at the Moscow School of Painting in February 1913.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> Many of the lubki (especially the 170 from Larionov’s own collection) were used in both exhibitions, which meant that the inclusion of icon patterns distinguished the second exhibition from the first. In this change, Larionov indicated his awareness of the different valences attributed to these forms.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	      Lubki had been legitimized as a form of folk art in the late nineteenth century, most notably due to the publication, between 1881 and 1893, of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Russian Folk Picture</span>, by Dmitrii Aleksandrovich Rovinskii.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> By 1909, lubki had become such an apparent influence among the new generation of artists that Aleksandr Benois, arguably the most prominent art critic in late imperial Russia, devoted an entire column in <span style="font-style:italic;">Speech</span> to the subject. “The Turn to the Lubok,” as the essay was called, described the “deliberate effort of artists to rid themselves of virtuosity and . . . return to the rude simplicity of primitive art.” While Benois was not entirely sympathetic to this trend, he also disputed the more conservative position that such art was “simply a sign of brutishness, or descent into the dark depths of ignorance.”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>
	      Benois argued that “lubokness” was a phenomenon predicated on the aesthetic demands and discontents of modernity. The new primitivism, Benois explained, was the latest in a series of reactive turns that were inevitable within the framework of modernism:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		Not too long ago [artists] escaped from the realist countryside to a fantastical Versailles, to golden dreams, to exquisite delight. Now from these same magic palaces into which the crowd penetrated, they escape to the peasant, to his simple-hearted happiness, to his colorful toys. They want to learn from him how to look at objects simply, into their core, to laugh coarsely but cheerfully, to weep coarsely but passionately, to eat black bread with a cucumber . . . .<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      Benois presented the difference between his own refined and cosmopolitan generation and the youth preoccupied with simplicity and authenticity, but the contrast was more pointed than that for many. In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Russian Folk Picture</span>, Rovinskii identified a number of the most popular lubki—<span style="font-style:italic;">The Mice Burying the Cat</span> (<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>), <span style="font-style:italic;">The Cat of Kazan’</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Barber Cutting the Beard of an Old Believer</span>—as satirical critiques of Peter and his reforms. Although more recent scholarship has convincingly disputed the original political content of these works, Rovinskii held great sway over early-twentieth-century artists and critics (Larionov, for example, referred his readers to Rovinskii’s text in the essay he wrote to accompany the two lubok exhibitions).<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> While Larionov scholars have long emphasized the close relationship between these lubki and his paintings, the parallel is usually cited as a demonstration of the “lubokness” of the artist’s work, but the more particular, anti-imperial, resonance of these lubki should not be overlooked in relation to Larionov’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Soldier at the Hairdresser’s</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">Katsap Venus</span>. As lubki became objects of collection and fascination for modern artists, they also had a strong association with the political protest of popular culture against imperial oppression.
	    </p>
<p>
	      In this way lubki were clearly distinct from icons in their cultural associations. Icons were critical to the notion of “Holy Russia,” and of Moscow as the “Third Rome.” They were the conduits through which the identity of the state (as the heir of Eastern Christendom) was experienced by the people. Icons served to reinforce the endangered bond between the peasantry and the Emperor. Not surprisingly, Nikolai II presided over a revival of icon painting and icons played an important role in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition of Cottage Industries</span>.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> The critic Yakov Tugendkhol’d made this  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> contrast explicit in his “Contemporary Art and National Spirit,” an essay prompted by Goncharova’s solo exhibition in the fall of 1913. Tugendkhol’d argued that it was not proper embroidery patterns or carving techniques (forms that demonstrated the continuity of a “national spirit” at such events as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Second All-Russian Exhibition</span>), but rather “cynical irony [that is] typical of the Russian folk genius.”<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> This “cynical irony” was expressed most clearly in lubki, which were “the travelling companions of everyday life” and carried “demonic temptation.” In contrast to the “light idealism” of icons, which were “the illuminators of life, the lubok is its mirror, and often, a crooked mirror” (YT, 157).

	      If for Benois the lubok recalled the coarse laughter of the muzhik, and Tugendkhol’d deemed it a “crooked mirror,” Larionov argued that the lubok had an almost apocalyptically anti-historical force. He introduced his essay for both lubki exhibitions with fictional historical epigraphs, the second of which claimed:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		In the kingdom of the Assyrian King Hammurabi, an exhibition was arranged of lubki from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, from Russia, China, Japan, France and other places. The prints stimulated such an intensity of aesthetic feeling that time was killed by the sensation of timelessness and omnipresence. The arising sensation reigned like self-contained infinity.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      The essay was as strange and puzzling as anything else published in Russia in 1913. Larionov practically overwhelmed his readers with his obtuse illogic. And he was explicit about his rejection of linear temporality:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		It is of absolutely no consequence as to when lubki in general, and Russian lubki in particular, came into being . . . . The most astounding and the most contemporary doctrine—Futurism—can be transferred back to Assyria or Babylon, while Assyria with its cult of the goddess Astarte and the teaching of Zarathustra can be transferred into what we call our own time period.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      In this passage, lubki, monumental Assyrian sculpture, and Futurist scandal-mongering were collapsed into one ecstatic category. Larionov’s equation of traditional Russian art with Futurism and the religious culture of ancient Babylon is quite far from Benois and Tugendkhol’d, with their thoughtful analyses of the lubok. His approach was hardly conducive to practical applications, but Larionov’s anti-temporal history of art was nevertheless an inspired gesture. Through it he rejected the fallacy of cultural continuity that underscored Prakhov’s claim to a resurgence of Russian national spirit. Instead, Larionov called for an artistic identity free of historical or geographical limits. Russianness could be celebrated, but as a classification without boundaries, easily encompassing both Futurism and Babylonian mythology.
	    </p>
<p>
	      While Larionov’s strange approach differed markedly from anyone else working within the craft revival milieu, there were others who looked to the avant-garde as proof of the ideological bankruptcy of revivalism. Using Goncharova’s 1913 solo exhibition as a starting point, Tugendkhol’d, in “Contemporary Art and National Spirit,” generalized that “contemporary Russian artists fell in love with stone women, peasant dolls, and folk pictures, in the hopes of finding a firm, native soil under their feet” (YT, 156). However, like all revivalists before them, he claimed, they failed. “Goncharova,” he said, “dreamed of coming close to folk tradition, to the folk spirit, but, in the end, was unable to approach it. Is this not our eternal ailment of the intelligentsia?” (YT, 153). Tugendkhol’d ultimately questioned the ability of anyone with an urban education to understand the “folk.” The prominent members of the Russian avant-garde, had, for the most part, grown up in the country and been educated in urban centers. “What kind of ‘folk’ are there in the city, anyway?” Tugendkhol’d asked (YT, 158). This question is key to the avant-garde rethinking of folk tradition as dynamic and urban, two characteristics incompatible with the imperial narrative of Russian national identity.
	    </p>
<p>
	      “What kind of ‘folk’ are there in the city, anyway?” The question is worth repeating, because it was exactly what motivated and divided the interest in folk art, peasant culture, and the crafts revival after the 1905 revolution. In their 1913 manifesto, “Rayists and Futurists,” Goncharova and Larionov wrote, “Long live Nationality! We march hand in hand with our ordinary housepainters.”<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> In this formulation, the authenticity of the peasant craftsman is replaced by the comparatively nondescript urban re of the sign painter and house decorator. This is the kind of folk that were in the city—semiliterate economic refugees from the countryside and far-off provinces—dislocated people like Niko Pirosmanashvili, an itinerant Georgian sign painter that Larionov included in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Target</span>.
	    </p>
<p>
	      For the modernist critics of the imperial folk art revival, it was important to find a medium that was recognized as both authentic and resistant. The lubok performed this task admirably, returning to the folk revival the populist agenda that it had lost by 1913.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Larionov’s presentation of the lubok goes even farther in this resistant capacity. Presenting the “folk picture” within the context of the modern and the urban, and insisting, as he did, that there was no difference between the sixteenth and twentieth centuries, or between Russia and Assyria, Larionov was also performing a folk authenticity that could not be located within the conventional historical narratives of ethnicity.
	    </p>
<p>
	      More than anything else, the exhibitions of spring 1913 demonstrated that Russian folk art was not a monolithic category and in this plurality the category of folk art also revealed the fault lines within the concept of nationality itself. While certain projections of the nation or folk could serve to further imperial hegemony, others were ardently anti-imperial, and therefore linked to the ideals of democratization and the broader opposition to autocracy.

	In 1905, peasants were still forced to pay reparations to their former masters, despite the fact that they were often restricted from leaving their original estates.

      Prakhov’s focus on ethnic distinctions may require some additional clarification. There are actually two separate words in Russian that are translated into English as “Russian.” The first, <span style="font-style:italic;">russkii</span>, signifies the Russian language and Russians as an ethnic group. The second, <span style="font-style:italic;">rossiiskii</span>, refers to Russia as a state or governing body—the Russian Empire, a Russian citizen, the Russian imperial academy. The Second All-Russian Exhibition was explicitly <span style="font-style:italic;">rossiiskii</span> (imperial) and therefore inclusive of all the nationalities in the Empire.

      Kappeler’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Russian Empire</span> study reveals that the ethnicities that were considered the most abject (gypsies, nomads, and pagans, primarily) were also often the least regulated, and therefore able to retain a greater degree of autonomy than nationalities that were considered highly cultured and well-educated (Poles and Armenians, for example).
