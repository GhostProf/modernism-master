<p id="lead">"It was as if a curtain had fallen, hiding everything I had ever known. It was almost like being born again," muses Anna Morgan, the &#x00E9;migr&#x00E9; narrator of Jean Rhys's <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  This 1934 novel about a Creole demimonde illuminates a complex but overlooked genealogical moment in twentieth-century literature: the point when the exhausted limits of modernist form revealed the lineaments of postcolonial fiction. Rhys's semicanonical tale of a chorus-girl-turned-prostitute has generally been read as a key to pre-War London, a novel of female fl&#x00E2;nerie, or one among the author's several fictions of feminine self-destruction.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  In this essay, I argue that in order to understand the English novel's "postcolonial turn" in the middle of the twentieth century, we should revisit <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> and its interventions into British literary modernism. The novel's complex transnationality&#x2014;the contrapuntal geography that oscillates between England and the West Indies&#x2014;gives rise to its transitional literary quality: Rhys produces a new geopolitics that challenges the continued relevance of modernist formal accomplishments, and, simultaneously, inaugurates what would soon become the central goals of postcolonial literature in English. And although <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> has been overshadowed by Rhys's 1966 masterpiece, <i>Wide Sargasso Sea</i>, it is the earlier novel that shows us a crucial transformation in the aesthetic priorities and political thrust of twentieth-century English fiction. As this fleeting, slight work gradually renders obsolescent the longstanding modernist worship of form, it announces the visionary and revisionary work of a nascent postcolonial literature.

<b></b>

 </p>

<p><i>Voyage in the Dark</i> maps two overlapping arcs: Western imperialism's rise and decline over four centuries, and British modernism's rise and decline over four decades. The novel's very title invokes two earlier modern-imperial texts: <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> looks back to <i>Heart of Darkness</i> , Joseph Conrad's famously inconclusive meditation on colonial praxis, and <i>The Voyage Out</i> , Virginia Woolf's anti-Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman in which a young female protagonist dies abruptly in South America. But the title of Rhys's novel also suggests the uncertain future of aesthetic modernism itself, which by the mid-1930s was no longer able to purchase artistic triumph with its cache of experimental techniques and was, accordingly, voyaging in a kind of darkness. Tyrus Miller's <i>Late Modernism: Politics, Fiction, and the Arts Between the World Wars</i> argues that experimental writing in the late 1920s and early 1930s begins to distance itself from the literature that preceded it; this writing, Miller claims, "loosens the modernist dominance of form and allows a more fluid, dialogic relation with the immediate historical context. It accomplished this unbinding of the work at the cost of abandoning the modernist gold standard: form as the universal currency in which aesthetic value could be measured and calculated."<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> turns away from the wonted sacredness of literary form and registers the urgency of engaging an "immediate historical context"; Rhys's novelistic outcry against the limits of modernism anticipates Gy&#x00F6;rgy Luk&#x00E1;cs's polemical attack on the generation of authors who esteemed form to the near-exclusion of other considerations. And while Rhys does not privilege a Luk&#x00E1;csian return to social realism, <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> elucidates the dark consequences of what Luk&#x00E1;cs would soon criticize as the "opaque, fragmentary, chaotic and uncomprehended" aestheticization of everyday experience.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>   </p>

<p>As <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> breaks modernism apart by refusing to privilege artistic form, it lays the groundwork for a developing literature of postcoloniality through the many-shaded voice of a Creole protagonist-narrator. Indeed, the novel's opening claim that to arrive in London is "almost like being born again" foretells <i>the</i> defining quality of postcolonial English literature: the advent of the twentieth-century postcolonial novel would not be a literary genre's triumphant renaissance, but would be, like the newly formed nation-states it described, the complicated emergence of a literature inextricably bound to the very culture it sought to escape. To be Creole is to be born displaced, to label as not-home the land of one's birth, and Rhys deploys Anna Morgan's Creole identity to remake the modernist fascination with fragment and fracture into the key problematic of postcoloniality. The Creole subject's multiplicity defies an exact point of geographical and genealogical origin because, as Judith Raiskin points out, Creole identity encompasses "the white native who lives in a cultural space between the European and black Caribbean societies and the native of mixed racial ancestry living in the islands and in England after World War II."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  It is precisely this multiplicity&#x2014;a collocation of subject- and object-positions that both promises and suspends cultural expressiveness&#x2014;that makes <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> a pivotal text in the transition between the downturn of British experimental modernism and the crescendo of postcolonial literature. <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>'s indeterminate beginning, fractured delivery, and inconclusive ending look back to the techniques that demarcated high 

<b></b>

modernism from nineteenth-century realism, but they also look ahead to the historical crises that shape later novels by Chinua Achebe, V. S. Naipaul, and Salman Rushdie. The intricate geopolitics of Anna Morgan's narrative mount a far-reaching challenge to the hegemony of imperial perspectives: the novel's faint oppositional politics, despite Anna's own powerlessness, anticipate the <i>ressentiment</i> that surges through subsequent fictions about Western imperialism's various legacies. And as Rhys turns the Empire's colonizing gaze back on itself, she unravels the violent cultural epistemologies that give form to so much experimental modernism, thereby reimagining English fiction along a new&#x2014;and inevitably transnational&#x2014;axis.  </p>

<p>Published in 1934, <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> tells the story of Anna Morgan, the daughter of a Welsh planter in Dominica. Whether describing Dominican childhood or adulthood in England, Anna's first-person narration registers multiple voices: mass advertising, popular and folk songs, plantation catalogues of slave-names, passages from imperial geographical tracts, and English cultural mandates about femininity. These voices further divide Anna's already-fissured narrative perspective, repeatedly calling attention to her status as a permanent outsider who claims neither a native community in Dominica nor an adopted home in England. When Anna arrives in pre-War London at the age of nineteen, she is surprised to find herself violently alienated from the white English people she encounters, whether her working-class flatmates, her wealthy lovers, or well-heeled shopgirls in London's department stores. Her insistent, oft-repeated claim, "I'm a real West Indian," describes an identity that history has robbed of meaning: Dominica's violent, centuries-long colonization at the hands of the Spanish, the French, and the English means that a "real West Indian" could be an indigenous Caribbean Indian, an African slave, a European settler, or (and this is the possibility that haunts the text) a mixture of all three.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  Left penniless by her alcoholic father, Anna lives the transient, unstable life of an English chorus-girl; the indifferent metropolis brutalizes her with the seductions of consumerism and the ease of anonymous sexual encounters. When Anna's stepmother cuts her off and her first lover, Walter, abandons her, Anna spirals into alcoholism, relying on the patronage of various sexual partners until she faces an accidental pregnancy. In the novel's original ending, which Michael Sadleir of Constable and Company forced Rhys to change, Anna dies from a bungled abortion. In the revised and now-standard ending, Anna lies on the doctor's operating table being treated for a post-abortion hemorrhage, remembering a Caribbean carnival from her childhood, and preparing to "start all over again . . ." (<small class="caps">v</small>, 188). Neither version allows postcolonial identity to be assimilated into extant forms of modern-imperial narratives in the 1930s: and so Anna's "voyage" ends uneasily, twisting in a cultural limbo that has yet to find a self-assured literary voice.  </p>

<p>As a fulcrum between experimental modernism and postcolonial literature, <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> alters the literary stakes of <i>metropolitan perception</i>. The emergence of new social, psychological, and aesthetic modes of metropolitan perception in the twentieth century, as Raymond Williams has influentially argued, launched high modernism's dazzling experiments; the experience of an imperial and industrial metropolis&#x2014;alienating, exhilarating, relentlessly new&#x2014;fueled linguistic, visual, musical, and theatrical 

<b></b>

revolution in modernism's European centers.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  It is by now understood that the radical aesthetic gestures that grew out of these new modes of metropolitan perception are inseparable from imperial praxis. Nineteenth- and early twentieth-century imperial expansion around the globe meant that the daily life that constitutes the content of national literature, as Fredric Jameson puts it, "can no longer be grasped immanently; it no longer has its meaning, its deeper reason for being within itself."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Modernism's formal devices often compensate for the lost totality of imperial modernity: experimental modern art answered the formal dilemma posed by the imperial metropole's inability to locate meaning fully within itself. But in <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>, the keen global awareness that shapes Anna Morgan's "metropolitan perception" fails to yield up the rich aesthetic rewards available to an earlier generation of modernist authors and artists. As Rhys's protagonist journeys from colonial Dominica to London and then relives her journey through dreams, memories, and hallucinations, the distinction between center and periphery dissolves into a nightmarish unreality in which the narrative breaks free of Anna's control. Anna's psychic inability to separate her material experience of the imperial metropole from her memories of colonial Dominica&#x2014;itself a fractured, overwritten, long-lost totality&#x2014;makes unhappy chaos of modernist faith in the liberatory potential of reordering time and space. Despite the longing for a stable, unitary perspective that pervades Anna's fragmented narration, her transnational Creolit&#x00E9; reorients modernist metropolitan perception so that it no longer calls either stories or subjects into being. As Rhys's novel unmasks the faltering self-conscious artistry of the moderns, it offers a proleptic glimpse into how postcolonial literature would appropriate that artistry and repoliticize modernist modes of metropolitan perception. By this novel's elliptical and unproductive final page, the experience of the fast-paced imperial center has been foundationally altered by the intrusions of its Caribbean colonies. It is a startlingly astute prediction of the later oeuvre of postcolonial fiction, which would decentralize Western imperial capitals as it illuminated narratives obscured or devalued by colonialism. And while Rhys's Creole &#x00E9;migr&#x00E9; finds herself powerless and paralyzed within early twentieth-century London's "high, smooth, unclimbable walls" (<i>V</i>,147), the novel's fascination with modern urban culture nonetheless hints at the rise of "metrocolonial" novels at the century's end, those fictions by writers like Salman Rushdie and Zadie Smith celebrating the multilayered racial parfaits of Bombay, London, and New York.  </p>

<p>The publication history of <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> spans the intellectual contours of literary modernism and places Rhys at the heart of London and Paris modernism in the 1910s and 1920s. <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> went through several incarnations before its eventual publication in 1934, and its multiple titles and revised endings&#x2014;as well as the twenty-year time lag between first draft and final publication&#x2014;suggest the novel's growing distance from the early modernist moment in which it was conceived. Rhys originally drafted the novel in 1911, writing it in diary-form in a series of black exercise books purchased at a London stationer's; dissatisfied with the story, she put the notebooks away in a suitcase and turned her energies toward writing short fiction. Ten years later, when Rhys was living in Paris, her husband&#x2014;a writer named Jean Lenglet&#x2014;was 

<b></b>

imprisoned for fraud; Rhys tried to support herself by selling translations of Lenglet's stories to a Mrs. Pearl Adam, the wife of a <i>Times</i> correspondent. Mrs. Adam did not care for Lenglet's work, but expressed an interest in Rhys's own writing. Impressed by the earliest version of <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>, which Rhys had tentatively named "Triple Sec," Mrs. Adam began to edit Rhys's drafts. She introduced Rhys to Ford Madox Ford, who had moved from London to Paris after the War to continue his patronage of new writers; as founding editor of the <i>transatlantic review</i>, Ford was bringing out new literature by Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, James Joyce, Ernest Hemingway, and William Carlos Williams.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  Ford preferred Rhys's short stories to the early draft of <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>, and in 1924 he published "Vienne," a piece about French expatriates in Vienna, in the <i>transatlantic review</i>. "Vienne" took its place in Rhys's first full-length volume of work, a 1927 collection of short stories titled <i>The Left Bank</i> for which Ford penned the introduction.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  In 1934, following the publication of her second work&#x2014;a 1928 Paris novel originally titled <i>Postures</i> and later re-named <i>Quartet</i>&#x2014;Rhys revised <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> and sent it to the London publishers Chatto and Windus, who rejected it. Rhys then sent her manuscript (at that point titled "Two Tunes") to Constable, where Michael Sadleir accepted the manuscript but insisted that Rhys alter the ending so that Anna Morgan would live rather than die following her abortion.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Rhys reluctantly made the change, which she regretted for the rest of her authorial career.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  In 1985, six years after Rhys's death, Nancy Hemond Brown discovered and published the novel's original ending in <i>London Magazine</i>, restoring Rhys's preferred conclusion in which Anna Morgan waits for the moment when "everything is blotted out and blackness comes . . ." instead of preparing to "start all over again. . . ."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  </p>

<p>This complex publication history&#x2014;from the novel's fragmented conception in pre-War London to its first revision in Paris during the 1920s and its eventual publication in London in the mid-1930s&#x2014;provides a metaphor for the very cultural transition it describes: the collapse of the exuberant literary experiments that had buoyed up the English novel since the fin-de-si&#x00E8;cle, and the rise of a new literature that explores a world torn asunder by the forces of Western imperialism. In her autobiography <i>Smile Please</i>, Rhys herself described the novel's inception in a chapter appropriately called "World's End, and a Beginning," a title whose two halves symbolize the literary metamorphosis that <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> enacts. The chapter's title refers to the London neighborhood where Rhys was living when she drafted the first "Black Exercise Book" version of the novel; Mary Lou Emery's influential study of Rhys (called, in fact, <i>Jean Rhys at "World's End</i>") claims that the phrase "world's end" evokes "urban spaces marginalized by the appearance of solitary women in public, the Caribbean islands invaded and possessed by Europeans, and the islands and urban Europe upset in the process of decolonization."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Retroactively, and in the context of <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>, I would add that the phrase also suggests two other "ends": the end of pre-War English tranquility, and, two decades later, the end of experimental modernism. The "Beginning" of the <i>Smile Please</i> chapter title refers to the starting point of Rhys's vocation as a writer, but also suggests the "beginning" of an entirely new literature: the artistic domain of post-coloniality, in which the priorities of high modernism acquire a radically different political charge.

<b></b>

  </p>

<p>I do not wish to imply that a stark polarity divides modern and postcolonial literature. As my earlier mention of Conrad and Woolf reminds us, modernist authors devoted as much time to the nuances of colonialism as postcolonial authors have since devoted to artistic form. But I do wish to demonstrate that in the evolution of the twentieth-century English novel, <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> quietly announces a cultural shift, a literary moment as significant for what it departs from as for what it moves toward. Unlike Wyndham Lewis's <i>BLAST</i> and other early modernist texts, <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> does not issue a clarion call to revolutionize literature and art. Neither does Rhys's novel repudiate enshrined genres of the English literary canon, as would postcolonial fictions like Achebe's <i>Things Fall Apart</i>  and Rhys's own <i>Wide Sargasso Sea</i> in subsequent decades. The Yeatsian title and Nigerian folktale structure of Achebe's novel&#x2014;like <i>Wide Sargasso Sea</i>'s simultaneous resistance and indebtedness to <i>Jane Eyre</i>&#x2014;would offer a <i>productive</i> intellectual tension between Western cultural dominance and the indigenous narrative forms that predated that culture's arrival. But the tense coexistence of literary forms in Rhys's 1934 novel is unproductive, indeed, as the protagonist's abortion suggests, antiproductive. Like Anna Morgan, whose body has been emptied of its child and then forced to "start all over again," the very structure of English fiction now begins to empty itself of modernism's cherished vitality and to move toward the cultural and artistic terrain in which postcolonial literature would subsequently flourish.  </p>

<p>How does <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> subordinate modernist formal innovation to the imperative of authoring postcoloniality? Edward Said's <i>Beginnings</i>, appropriately, furnishes a useful entry point into this novel's insistence on new literary priorities. In Said's formulation, European modernism was "an aesthetic and ideological phenomenon that was a response to the crisis of what could be called <i>filiation</i>&#x2014;a linear, biologically grounded process, that which ties children to their parents&#x2014;which produced the counter-crises within modernism of affiliation, that is, those creeds, philosophies, and visions re-assembling the world in new non-familial ways."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  The conflicts that define the formal logic of <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> arise from the twin crises of filiation and affiliation, crises that Rhys reveals as integral to the very Caribbean into which Anna Morgan is born. The Caribbean islands where Christopher Columbus landed in 1492 represent the complex originary point of European imperialism: master-narratives of modern Western history call the Caribbean into being only through its resistant or dependent relationship to European rule and conquest. Simon Gikandi argues that Caribbean identity has always been caught in a "paradox of history," because "for Columbus and the European conquerors, the 'discovery' of the Caribbean initiated modernity; but . . . the implication of this modernity for the natives of the islands and African slaves was nothing less than the loss of cultures, physical annihilation, and historical displacement."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Born in Dominica, where Columbus landed on his Second Voyage in 1493, Anna Morgan emblematizes this paradox of history: her tale's point 

<b></b>

of origin is fraught with uncertainty, and the narrative's often-incoherent elements reflect the similar incoherence of her Caribbean Creole heritage. Further, the familial lineage that is an obsession in this novel raises broader questions about the lineage of novels and nations themselves, questions that cannot be resolved through modernist experiments with time, space, and consciousness, but must seek their answers in new narrative strategies. Anna's disrupted racial genealogy, consequently, expresses itself in the novel's disruptions of English literary genealogy. </p>

<p>One of Anna's London flatmates unintentionally strikes at the heart of Anna's cultural and familial anxieties when she sneers, "You're not all there; you're a half-potty bastard. You're not all there; that's what's the matter with you" (<i>V</i>,145). This jibe, however crudely phrased, suggests that the dislocations of Creole identity and the ambiguity of Anna's parentage have profoundly destabilized Anna's consciousness. Anna grows up on Constance Estate, a Dominican plantation owned for four generations by her mother's family and brought to prosperity through slave labor. Following Anna's mother's sudden and unexplained death, Anna's father marries an Englishwoman named Hester, who struggles to restore the family's long-lost image of undifferentiated Englishness. Insinuating not only that Anna's mother was a "coloured" woman rather than a white descendant of English settlers, Hester also rails against Ramsay Colterus, Anna's uncle who has fathered several children by Dominican women and has "the laugh of a negro":  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">

<p class="continued">As Hester's diatribe suggests, Anna has been racially compromised by the incomplete or broken ties that divide the Morgan family. Between the stepmother who replaces her dead, racially ambiguous mother and the uneasy kinship with her illegitimate "cousins," Anna has slipped into a vague cultural interstice between "lady" and "nigger." Keen to protect Anna from what Homi Bhabha has famously termed the "not quite/not white" predicament of colonial identity, Hester warns her stepdaughter against "the sins of the fathers" who have for generations raped slave women on the plantation.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  (Indeed, the family's legacy of racial and sexual exploitation torments Anna when she becomes Walter's mistress in London: sexual encounters with an English lover stir up Anna's troubled memories of Constance Estate slave rolls.) Ordering Anna to embrace the racial fictions of British imperial self-fashioning, Hester insists that she cut off her close friendship with Francine, the black plantation cook partially responsible for Anna's behaving "exactly like a nigger."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Anna's "affiliation" with Francine&#x2014;a childhood intimacy that inspires Anna's pronouncement, "I hated being white"&#x2014;foundationally threatens the codes of white 

<b></b>

Caribbean plantocracy (<i>V</i>, 72). Historically, British colonials abroad worked strenuously to preserve an image of cultural unity, a strategic essentialism aided by race-science, propaganda, and commodities from the imperial center.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  A striking passage from James Anthony Froude's widely read 1887 study <i>The English in the West Indies, or, The Bow of Ulysses</i>, lauds this unity: "being one the British people everywhere intend to remain one. With the same blood, the same language, the same habits, the same traditions, they do not mean to be shattered into dishonoured fragments."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  But Anna's behaviour in Dominica shatters the myth of Englishness into the very "dishonoured fragments" that imperial mores are meant to deter. Certainly, as Hester points out, mixed-race children abound in the Dominica of Anna's childhood, but neither miscegenation nor interracial sexual desire disrupts the race-plot that buttresses colonialism. The sexual availability of colonial women and the offspring of mixed-race alliances belong firmly in the racial logic through which Western European empires justified their cultural and material authority.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  However, Anna's declaration that "I wanted to be black, I always wanted to be black. . . . Being black is warm and gay, being white is cold and sad" reveals a dangerous desire to <i>be</i> the Empire's other, to locate subjectivity in what imperial discourse has relegated to object-status (<i>V</i>, 31).  </p>

<p>Anna's friendship with Francine comes to an abrupt end when Anna begins to menstruate; the beginning of sexual adulthood corresponds to the end of racial childhood. When Hester mandates the end of the friendship, Anna realizes that the racial elasticity she cherishes in her imagination has no place on a British plantation: "But I knew that of course she [Francine] disliked me too because I was white; and that I would never be able to explain to her that I hated being white. Being white and getting like Hester, and all the things you get&#x2014;old and sad and everything. . . . And I knew that day I'd started to grow old and nothing could stop it" . Forbidden from rejecting the cultural identity that accompanies her skin color but unable to comply with that identity's demands, Anna subsequently falls prey to the fissured familial, racial, and national ties of her Creole birth. Her liminality as a modern-imperial subject surfaces tellingly when, as an adult living in London, she recites a passage from a textbook of Dominican history: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The Caribbean Sea. 'The Caribs indigenous to this island were a warlike tribe and their resistance to white domination, though spasmodic, was fierce. As lately as the beginning of the nineteenth century they raided one of the neighbouring islands, under British rule, overpowered the garrison and kidnapped the governor, his wife and three children. The few hundreds that are left do not intermarry with the Negroes. Their reservation, at the northern end of the island, is known as 'the Carib Quarter.' They had, or used to have, a king. Mopo, his name was. Here's to Mopo, King of the Caribs! But, they are practically exterminated.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Anna's glacial delivery of this passage reveals that none of its subject-positions describes her place in Dominica: if she is not a youthful member of the British governing class for whom such histories affirm a tradition of conquest, neither does she claim kinship with the Carib Indians who survived European invasion or the Negro slaves brought 

<b></b>

forcibly to Dominica. Her claim that she is a "real West Indian" points only to her troubled status within the "paradox of history"; it does not affix her place within the mosaic of contradictory identities that comprises the Caribbean. In other words, Anna's ambivalence towards colonial discourses and their attendant power structures expels her from private as well as public imperial histories. </p>

<p>Peter Hulme observes in his brilliant study <i>Remnants of Conquest: The Island Caribs and Their Visitors: 1877&#x2013;1998</i> that "there really was no position&#x2014;certainly no respectable position&#x2014;within Dominican society that could be occupied by a white person not fully committed to imperial norms of behaviour" (<i>RC</i>, 240&#x2013;1). Having disavowed the whiteness that signifies political, moral, and intellectual authority in the colonies, Anna cannot move into any of the cultural plots available to English protagonists of imperial fiction. Her Creole identity, coupled with her impossible desire to be black, sets her apart from her peers and predecessors in early twentieth-century novels of Empire. Unlike Kipling's Kim, Anna can neither revel in hybridity nor claim a place in the ruling culture; unlike Marlow in <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, Anna cannot tell her own story, because her voice is interrupted and overwritten by the forces of colonial history and contemporary mass culture alike; unlike Adela Quested in Forster's <i>A Passage to India</i>, Anna cannot travel as a tourist or return to a nation she once called home; and unlike John Flory in Orwell's <i>Burmese Days</i>, Anna cannot die a spectacular death that will eventually become absorbed into the fabric of colonial lore. And even though many of these other protagonists come to unsatisfying or tragic conclusions, their conclusions unfold within the longstanding racial and cultural matrix of imperial narratives. The ellipses that end Marlow's tale in <i>Heart of Darkness</i> and the "Not yet" that concludes <i>A Passage to India</i>, for example, do not significantly dislodge the West's continued ideological or material dominance over its far-flung colonies. But the ellipses that end Anna Morgan's story denote the troubled beginnings of a new historical and literary moment, one that finds no meaningful self-expression either in established forms of imperial fiction or, as we will see, in the experimental possibilities of high modernism.  </p>

<p>In words evocative of Woolf's famous description of "beautiful caves" in <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>, Rhys wrote in a letter to Evelyn Scott that she intended <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> to reveal "Something to do with time being an illusion I think. I mean that the past exists&#x2014;side by side&#x2014;with the present, not behind it; that what was&#x2014;is. I tried to do it by making the past (the West Indies) very vivid&#x2014;the present dreamlike (downward career of girl)&#x2014;starting of course piano and ending fortissimo."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  But unlike Woolf's 1925 novel, in which the narrative simultaneity of past and present offers up powerful resistance to the tyrannies of industrial modernity, the temporal kaleidoscopes of Rhys's 1934 novel are neither enabling nor enlightening. The radicalizing gestures that freed Woolf from the externally focused realism of her Victorian and Edwardian forebears&#x2014;the transcription of interiority, free indirect discourse, the fluid alternation between <i>temps</i> and <i>dur&#x00E9;e</i>&#x2014;here signal only a literary emptiness. Consider this passage, in which Anna describes her departure from Dominica and arrival into England: </p>

<p class="continued">Exiled from a Caribbean in which she is neither subject nor sovereign and lost in a London that promises but never delivers the transformations of fashion and upward mobility, Anna's consciousness becomes a repository for the variously menacing discourses of coloniality and metropolitan modernity. These discourses intersect her narrative in much the same way that geographical coordinates crisscross Dominica or the train windows divide England; and precision about urban and colonial geographies only ironizes the more fundamental dislocations of Anna's own identity and her inability to take her place in the island of her birth or the nation of her putative ancestry. Neither does urban fl&#x00E2;nerie&#x2014;the cultivated placelessness of the moderns&#x2014;protect Anna from the brutalities of city life. Anna's experience of detached transnationality, whether performing as a chorus-girl, dating anonymous men, or shopping on Oxford Street, only heightens her profound desire for belonging. As she moves through London "like a fish out of water," as Hester says, the city's proliferating voices compromise her authorial control. Rather than engendering a Baudelairean odyssey through the metropolis, the multiplication of narrative perspectives only produces bleak, unending alienation. </p>

<p>This alienation expresses itself in Rhys's emendations to the modernist Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman, a subversive genre in its own right that nevertheless cannot deliver Anna Morgan into social stability or heightened self-knowledge. If the Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman was the literary form par excellence of the nineteenth century, we can attribute the rise of early twentieth-century modernism, in part, to a reaction against Victorian realist novels of development. In Franco Moretti's words, experimental modernism's emergence was marked by a "crisis of the European <i>Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman</i>," because the novel of the modern world "could no longer be the <i>Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman</i> which, in all its diverse manifestations, had always held fast to the notion that <i>the biography of a young individual was the most meaningful viewpoint for the understanding and the evaluation of history.</i>"<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  The well-known modernist repudiation of the Victorian Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman rewrites the chronological passage from youth to adulthood in a number of aesthetically spectacular and politically radical ways. Modernism's often-rudderless protagonists variously resist the individual socialization that was Victorian fiction's cherished telos, casting aside family, marriage, property, religion, and respectability&#x2014;the very filiation and affiliation that 

<b></b>

Said describes in <i>Beginnings</i>&#x2014;in favor of art, martyrdom, rebellion, or death. Experiments with time and consciousness, and the new self-reflexive creation of art, offer the richest sites for escaping linear and cultural chronology, so that Conrad's Jim, Woolf's Lily Briscoe, Joyce's Stephen Dedalus, and Lawrence's Paul Morel elect to occupy private worlds of their own making rather than integrating themselves into the public world of bourgeois normativity. But the newness, youth, and refusal of conventional adulthood that are the modernist Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman's signature traits only lead to stasis and paralysis in <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>   </p>

<p>To be sure, Anna tries to consolidate her London experiences into a coherent coming-of-age narrative. But the chronological birth-to-death tropes of the conventional Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman prove inadequate for her experiences, and high modernism's nonlinear chronologies paralyze rather than liberate the narrative. To describe her arrival in England on the first page of the novel, as we have already seen, Anna claims that "It was almost like being born again"; the asymptotic quality of her opening pronouncement leads into a narrative in which neither sequentially nor randomly ordered events produce maturity or agency. Although Anna tells herself that "This is a beginning . . . I'll go to all the lovely places I've ever dreamt of. This is the beginning," revels in summer days that "made me start again imagining that there was nothing I couldn't do, nothing I couldn't become," and hopes that "Something else will happen&#x2026;and then something else, and then something else. It'll be all right," the "almostness" of her life in London prevents her from recording its progression in linear or self-contained narrative (<i>V</i>, 28, 157, 171). From Anna's palindromic name to her description of London streets "going north, south, east, west, all exactly alike," the novel bursts with metaphors of paralysis and directionlessness: stopped clocks, dead-end streets, walled-in gardens, lopped trees, unsent letters, movies starring "Three-Fingered Kate," songs titled "The Girl I Left Behind Me" and "There's a Brown Girl in a Ring," and books such as <i>The Iron Shroud</i> and, of course, <i>Nana</i>, Emile Zola's 1880 novel about a doomed prostitute whose name (and premature death) anagrammatically foreshadow Anna's fate.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Like Zeno's arrow, Anna tries to move forward without ever reaching her desired end point; even as she offers a pithy summation of her romance with Walter&#x2014; "There was a man I was mad about. He got sick of me and chucked me. I wish I were dead" &#x2014;she names a goal that she cannot realize (<i>V,</i> 115). Her "voyage in the dark," with its uncertain starting point and indefinite destination, comprises a series of stalled beginnings that extends into the novel's final page, when Anna lies bleeding on the doctor's operating table listening to his prediction that she will soon be "'Ready to start all over again in no time'" (<i>V</i>, 187).  </p>

<p>Rhys's dismantling of the modern Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman sets the stage for the novel's most powerful repudiation of radical modernist aesthetics. Adrift in London and moving aimlessly between jobs, apartments, and men, Anna dreams of being on a ship "that was sailing very close to an island, which was home except that the trees were all wrong. These were English trees" (<i>V</i>, 164). In the confusion about whether the island is Dominica or part of the British Isles, Anna's dream becomes a nightmare version of her early claim that "Sometimes it was as if I were back there and as if England were a dream. At 

<b></b>

other times England was the real thing and out there was the dream, but I could never fit them together" (<i>V</i>, 8). Memories of the past have become indistinguishable from lived experience in the present, and sleep has become indistinguishable from waking. This traumatic temporal and perceptual chaos produces the novel's metacommentary on its own literary technique: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I was still trying to walk up the deck and get ashore. I took huge, climbing, flying strides among confused res. I was powerless and very tired, but I had to go on. And the dream rose into a climax of meaninglessness, fatigue and powerlessness, and the deck was heaving up and down, and when I woke up everything was still heaving up and down. </p>

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">A "climax of meaninglessness" is the unavoidable result of modernist excess: the psychic and experiential merging of England and the Caribbean, the linguistic shifts from English to French to Creole patois, and the narrative's transparent self-consciousness collide in Anna's plaint against the "fatigue and powerlessness" of formal experimentation. Metropolitan perception&#x2014;the creative fount of Rhys's literary predecessors&#x2014;fails to transform lived experience into gratifying artistic form, and Anna's desperate dream-effort to "walk up the deck and get ashore" furnishes a penetrating metaphor for the late modernist move to abandon the worship of formal mastery. In <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>, the provocative, restorative, and liberating aesthetic gestures of high modernism become uncontrolled attempts to consolidate what history has irrevocably fractured. </p>

<p>Darkly, Anna's pregnancy&#x2014;itself a "climax of meaninglessness"&#x2014;is the only element of this novel that arrives at an unambiguous conclusion. After Walter abandons her and she begins sleeping with strangers, Anna realizes that she is pregnant while dancing with an unnamed man in her flat. Gripped by waves of nausea, she listens to the song "<i>Connais-tu le Pays?</i>" and thinks bitterly, "Do you know the country? Of course, if you know the country it makes all the difference."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  The song filters through Anna's recognition that she is pregnant: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">

<p class="continued">The nausea that is "[l]ike seasickness" counterposed against the lyrics of "<i>Connais-tu le Pays?</i>" suggests that Anna is embarking on yet another voyage, one intimately bound up in knowledge of nationhood: human reproduction is inseparable from the production of national identities. Pregnancy intensifies the cultural ambivalence that history has thrust upon Anna, and the baby's uncertain paternity furthers the mysteries and erasures of Anna's already-fractured lineage. Anna's futile efforts to induce a miscarriage deepen her sense of entrapment: "And all the time thinking round and round in a circle that it is there inside me, and about all the things I had taken so that if I had it, it would be a monster. The Abb&#x00E9; Sebastian's Pills, primrose label, one guinea 

<b></b>

a box, daffodil label, two guineas, orange label, three guineas. No eyes, perhaps. . . . No arms, perhaps . . ." (<i>V</i>, 67).  </p>

<p>Anna's speculation that the baby might be an eyeless or limbless "monster" bespeaks not only fear of drug-induced birth defects, but more importantly, a primal anxiety about her own racial heritage: the baby's potential deformities raise the spectre of the "monstrous races" long thought to inhabit the Caribbean Basin. The ghost of Columbus's 1492 landing haunts Anna's pregnancy, notably the famous passage in the Discoverer's <i>Diario</i> claiming that the islands harbored "one-eyed men, and others, with snouts of dogs, who ate men, and that as soon as one was taken they cut his throat and drank his blood and cut off his genitals."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  The moving horizon of the Euro-Caribbean encounter has earlier shed light on Anna's own disruptive position vis-&#x00E0;-vis colonial history; as the encounter resurfaces in Anna's fears about her unborn child, it forecasts European colonialism's tragic legacy. In a novel whose deepest anxieties fixate on racial belonging, Anna Morgan's inchoate baby symbolizes yet another unassimilable racial identity. The baby's doubly ambiguous lineage conspires to destroy it: Anna's child will inherit not only the Caribbean's centuries-long "crisis of filiation" represented by the unresolved identity of Anna's late mother, but also the detotalizing experience of metropolitan modernity represented by its anonymous, absent father. The abortion, accordingly, represents the racially encrypted body's ultimate dis-integration, a violent literalizing of Anna's psychic disunity and her exile from the domains of imperial modernity. And although the bastard half-children of a hybrid past eventually become the heroes of postcolonial literature (almost fifty years later, Rushdie's Saleem Sinai would open <i>Midnight's Children</i> with the gleeful remark, "I was born in the city of Bombay . . . once upon a time. No, that won't do." ), <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> consigns such children to scorn, invisibility, and death.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Anna finally becomes unrecognizable to herself, her consciousness splitting between the competing narratives of colonialism and urban modernity. The voices that have interrupted her storytelling become overtly menacing in the novel's last scene, where cascading prose shifts between a Masquerade carnival in the West Indies, Anna's memories of Walter, and the experience of the doctor's office. As the doctor anesthetizes her, Anna's thoughts mirror the aleatory, nonlinear pattern of her movements through cultures: </p>

<p class="continued">This scene describes a total emotional dissolution precipitated by the disjuncture between the white surface of Anna's skin and the interior experiences of racial and cultural hybridity that it conceals. And the literal hemorrhage of Anna's body in this final scene symbolizes the hemorrhage of modernist forms: Anna's various cultural identities, all of which are called up in her hallucination, have become, like extant forms of modern aesthetics in the 1930s, discrepant, excessive, and unassimilable. The anaesthetic that the doctor administers not only robs Anna of sensuous perception, but also signals the text's resistance to self-conscious artistry itself: an-aesthetic. Despite Anna's multiple attempts to control the sequence of her narrative from childhood to adulthood, the privileged act of telling her own story fails to furnish an end in itself. Because her narrative contains as many voices as she herself has cultural parents, she collapses under the accumulated weight of public and private histories, her voice obscured by the very polyvocality and pastiche that had ushered in so many exhilarating possibilities for earlier modern protagonists. And whereas the modernist reworking of the Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman rejected the chronological sequence that began with youth and ended with mature adulthood, Jean Rhys goes one step further and challenges the very birth and death that are the implicit boundaries of even the most anticonventional modernist novels. Through Anna's own mysterious parentage, her "re-birth" upon entering England, the aborted life of her child, her thwarted desire to die, and the revised ending of the novel itself, <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> troubles the foundational conditions of imperial life-writing as well as the modern English Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman. Moving beyond the outermost limits of English modernist experimentation, Rhys ushers in the protocols of the genre that would dominate English literature in the second half of the twentieth century: the postcolonial novel.  </p>

<p>In 1972, V. S. Naipaul praised Rhys's "purity as a novelist" and declared that "Jean Rhys thirty to forty years ago identified many of the themes that engage us today: isolation, an absence of society or community, the sense of things falling apart, dependence, loss."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Naipaul referred to the first generation of postcolonial novels in English, those works deeply engaged with the formal conventions of canonical English novels and intent on restoring what imperialism had erased or marginalized. The second half of the twentieth century witnessed the rise of deliberate, provocative anti-Bild&#x00FC;ngsromane that repudiated the consolidation of the national subject by making irresolution and placelessness their most powerful subversions. From Chinua Achebe's <i>Things Fall </i>

<b></b>

<i>Apart</i>  and Naipaul's <i>A House for Mr. Biswas</i>  to Tsitsi Dangarembga's <i>Nervous Conditions</i>  and Jamaica Kincaid's <i>Lucy</i> , postcolonial authors have extended <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>'s reworking of the English Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman to explore the failed promises of modernity, capitalism, and liberal self-fashioning. In these dark fictions of postcoloniality, protagonists do not mature or take their places in stable social hierarchies; neither do they arrive at self-knowledge through the act of telling their own stories. Rohinton Mistry's 1997 novel <i>A Fine Balance</i> offers a stunning coda to its predecessors: Mistry's Dickensian recreation of postindependence India demonstrates that the desire for marriage, children, education, and class mobility&#x2014;in short, the defining goals of the 19<sup>th</sup>-century Bild&#x00FC;ngsroman&#x2014;leads inexorably to poverty, castration, amputation, and death. Exile and rootlessness, instruments of subversion in earlier postcolonial novels, serve here as the mildest consequences of the West's often-fatal legacy of progress. </p>

<p>Naipaul's 1972 praise for Rhys's prescience continues to ring true more than three decades later. As a new strain of late twentieth-century postcolonial fiction joined these earlier works, the tense counterpoint of center and colony gave way to a fresh subgenre: the metrocolonial novel. The works of Zadie Smith and the recent writings of Salman Rushdie, as I have mentioned earlier, as well as novels by Hanif Kureishi, Monica Ali, and M. G. Vassanji, refuse to equate marginality with exile and invite readers into the multicultural ebullience of London, New York, Nairobi, and Boston. Such fictions, while still committed to teasing out the tangled origins of history, bring a new headiness to their description of the present moment. Tempering political outrage with tremendous humor, metrocolonial novels offer an intense distillation of a cosmopolitan present whose "transnational decentredness," as John Clement Ball puts it, "has become its most visibly constitutive feature."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  And although <i>Voyage in the Dark</i> could not secure a place for Anna Morgan in modern London's cityscapes, Anna's literary successors move through former capitals of imperial power undaunted by their historical status as Empire's second-class citizens. Racial hybridity, cultural multiplicity, and geographical restlessness no longer hold life-narratives hostage, but instead illuminate the mercurial labyrinths of national and familial history.  </p>

<p>And in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, we find the most recent innovations to this novelistic tradition in the writings of the South African Nobel laureate J. M. Coetzee. Coetzee's skilled hands have shaped the postcolonial novel into its latest form and given the genre a new focal point: the loosely connected lectures, letters, and short stories that comprise his 2003 work <i>Elizabeth Costello</i> suggest that old age holds more substantive and tragic terrain than youth. In this work about an Australian writer&#x2014;as well as in its successor, <i>Slow Man</i> &#x2014;the mere fact of death trivializes even the most brutal historical narratives. Coetzee sets aside postcolonial literature's longstanding obsession with history and origins to lay bare the obscene, ineluctable processes of aging and human mortality. Neither metropole nor periphery, imperial center or colonial borderland, can command the focus of Coetzee's latest fictions: the particulars of postcoloniality pale next to the universal fragility of the human body, a fragility that stands far outside of history. In a world whose boundaries become daily more porous, there is nothing 

<b></b>

more transnational than death. And so almost seventy five years after the publication of Jean Rhys's <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>, we find that Anna Morgan's passage between almost-birth and almost-death uncannily presages the English novel's trajectory: Rhys's slender novel anticipated the postcolonial phoenix that would rise out of experimental modernism's ashes. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT2" href="#REF2">2</a>. Jean Rhys's authorial influence has until very recently been subordinated to the facts of Rhys's own life. Overwhelmingly, scholarship about Rhys's fiction diminishes her contributions to twentieth-century literature by correlating biographical events with events in her fiction. For example, studies ranging from Thomas Staley's <i>Jean Rhys: A Critical Study</i> (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1979) and Arnold Davidson's <i>Jean Rhys</i> (New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Company, 1985) to Paula Le Gallez's <i>The Jean Rhys Woman</i> (London: Macmillan, 1990) and Stanford Sternlicht's <i>Jean Rhys</i> (London: Twayne Publishers/Prentice Hall International, 1997) take as their point of departure the assumption that, to quote a 1967 <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> review, "All Jean Rhys's novels deal essentially with the same unhappy situation in different guises" ("Neurotic Women," <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> [20 July 1967] 644). Most recently, this kind of reductive portrayal appears in Joseph Wiesenfarth's astonishingly misogynistic <i>Ford Madox Ford and the Regiment of Women: Violet Hunt, Jean Rhys, Stella Bowen, Janice Biala</i> (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 2005). Wiesenfarth attributes all of Rhys's fiction to her "need to portray herself as a helpless victim of a scheming man with a pimping wife" and dismisses her as "nothing more than a drunken, nymphomaniacal liar" (74, 89). </p>

<div class="fn">
<p>In a piece for <i>Harper's Magazine</i> published a year before her death, Rhys revealed her contempt for depictions of her life's work: "Inaccuracies occur, for people must be entertained. So now I can read calmly of my dark dreadful life, extraordinary versions of my first marriage, that I worked on stage for ten bob a week (this last annoys me), but as a rule I don't turn a hair" ("Making Bricks Without Straw," orig. published in <i>Harper's Magazine</i> [July 1978] 70&#x2013;1; reprinted in <i>Critical Perspectives on Jean Rhys,</i> ed. Pierrette M. Frickey [Washington, D. C.: Three Continents Press, 1990], 37). Contemporary scholarship has worked to overwrite these "inaccuracies" and restore Rhys's significance to modernist, feminist, and postcolonial studies. Three notable examples are Mary Lou Emery, <i>Jean Rhys at "World's End": Novels of Colonial and Sexual Exile</i> (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1990), Elaine Savory, <i>Jean Rhys</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press: 1998), and Deborah Parson, <i>Streetwalking the Metropolis: Women, the City, and Modernity</i> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000). </p>

Significantly, the <i>transatlantic review</i>'s motto was "Fluctuat," a shortened version of the motto of the city of Paris: "Fluctuat nec mergitur" ("She is tossed by the waves but does not sink"). It is an apt phrase for the increasingly borderless character of late modernism, as well as for the beginning of Jean Rhys's authorial career. See Bernard J.

Emery's study describes Rhys's novels as "beginning experiments in female and Third World modernism written in dialogue with European modernism" (xiv); scholars like Kerry Johnson, Peter Kalliney, and Joseph Clarke have recently built on this claim to develop theories and histories of Caribbean modernism. In this article, I emphasize Rhys's contributions to the evolution of European modernism rather than her role as an envoy for experimental Caribbean literature. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT19" href="#REF19">19</a>. Imperial propaganda and commodity production play a submerged but powerful role in <i>Voyage in the Dark</i>. Note, for instance, Anna's fascination with a tin of cocoa bearing the lines "What is 

<b></b>

Purity? For Thirty-five Years the Answer has been Bourne's Cocoa," and her description of a hoarding in Dominica with an advertisement for "Biscuits Like Mother Makes, as Fresh in the Tropics as in the Motherland, Packed in Airtight Tins" (<i>V</i>, 58, 149). Both products showcase British imperial control: the cocoa is a natural resource from the Caribbean that has been imported into England and turned into something "pure," whereas the biscuits are a domestic product intended to export the "freshness" of English culture around the world. Anna mocks the racially charged ideas of freshness and purity, challenging the manufactured images of desirability and dominance that the Empire projects through even the smallest commodities.

(<i>V</i>, 179).The fact that the racially ambiguous Anna reads Zola's novel <i>Nana</i> and that her chorus-girl friends call her the "Hottentot" implicates her in an enormous late nineteenth-century discourse that, as Sander Gilman has famously pointed out, connected race, female sexuality, prostitution, and deviance.

Kelley, Jr. (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1989), 133. Peter Hulme insightfully explains the status of the Carib peoples in the colonial imaginary: "In one sense they were 'merely' another of the native peoples of the world sheltering as best they could in some corner of a European empire where they had been left to rot after their usefulness had been exhausted or their t for survival overcome. But the Caribs had always been recognized as special, in part because their widespread reputation as cannibals had earlier made them into the archetype of unregenerate savagery, in part because, as sole survivors of the native peoples who inhabited the Caribbean at the time of Columbus's arrival, they still stood as symbols of the first encounter of Europe with America, an encounter much discussed in the 1890s, as it was in the 1990s" (<i>Remnants of Conquest</i>, 2&#x2013;3).
