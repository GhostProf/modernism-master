On the afternoon of 14 November 1993, the so-called "People's Day of Mourning" [<i>Volkstrauertag</i>], the "Central Commemorative Site of the FederalRepublic of Germany" was unveiled in the modest, neoclassical building originally designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, called the Neue Wache, or "New Watch." President Richard von Weizs&#x000E4;cker, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Bundestag President Rita S&#x000FC;ssmuth, Bundesrat Vice-President Henning Voscherau, and Constitutional Court President Roman Herzog entered the building and laid five wreaths at the base of the statue, which bears the inscription "To the Victims of War and Tyranny." Outside, cordoned off by steel barricades and eight hundred riot police in body armor, with plastic shields and leather truncheons, facing a group of spectators and protestors half their number, a solitary soldier stepped forward from the honor guard, raised his trumpet and played an elegiac theme from Brahms under cold and drizzly skies. The entire event lasted less than ten minutes.
</p>

<p>
These largely symbolic proceedings had been preceded by months of acrimonious controversy that had already led to the decision to erect a separate "Memorial for the Murdered Jews of Europe" near the Brandenburg Gate, and later to further discussion about a second monument to the Roma and Sinti victims of Nazism.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  The controversy was very different from the reception which has greeted another recent memorial in Berlin, a project which is located in the Bavarian Quarter (a formerly Jewish neighborhood, decimated and depopulated by a raft of National Socialist actions) and was constructed according to very different principles. Those principles are suggestive for thinking 

<b></b>

about memorials to the National Socialist past in Germany and, more important, share critical affinities with Walter Benjamin's notion that "dialectical images" can be sites of historical materialism and remembrance insofar as they juxtapose material forms, affective attunements, and ideological functions from the past with those of the present.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Underlying the memorial project in the Bavarian Quarter is Benjamin's method of "[t]elescoping . . . the past through the present" (<i>N</i> 7a, 3), his belief that "[t]he materialist presentation of history leads the past to place the present in a critical question" (<i>N</i> 7a, 5) and achieves a "dissolution of 'mythology' into the space of history" (<i>N</i> 1, 9). To appreciate the differences between the two memorials and the principles behind them, however, we must first situate the discussion within ongoing and broader debates about modernity and "collective identity," then identify a methodological shift from a psychological model of collective identity to one that is grounded in cultural resources and their discursive transmission.

Memorials in our time possess a dialectical relationship to the end of what the French historian Pierre Nora calls "the tradition of memory." According to Nora, "we speak so much of memory because there is so little of it left":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
These <i>lieux de m&#x000E9;moire</i> are fundamentally remains, the ultimate embodiments of a memorial consciousness that has barely survived in a historical age that calls out for memory because it has abandoned it. They make their appearance by virtue of the deritualization of the world&#x02014;producing, manifesting, establishing, constructing, decreeing, and maintaining by artifice and by will a society deeply absorbed in its own transformation and renewal, one that inherently values the new over the ancient, the young over the old, the future over the past.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
What Nora calls the "acceleration of history" and "the lack of spontaneous memory" seems to imply a nostalgia for tradition-bound substantive <i>Gemeinschaft</i>, but we can deepen his insight by placing it alongside related diagnoses of modernity: the transition from a stratified to a functional society (Luhmann), the disenchantment of traditional societies in the rise of abstract and bureaucratic rationality (Weber), the alienation of life-world and labor (Marx, Luk&#x000E1;cs), the intertwining of technical progress with failed political emancipation (Horkheimer and Adorno), the loss of traditional continuity in storytelling (Benjamin), and the general rationalization of production and irrationalization of societal relations micrologically analyzed in the phenomena of mass culture (Kracauer). In fact, the analysis of the "memorial cult" at the turn of the century by the young Alois Riegl offers a more nuanced and dialectical historical framework than Nora's, by juxtaposing the nineteenth century as the era of "historical value" with the onset of a contemporary era of "age value": the latter reflected a superhistorical notion of objective knowledge, manifesting itself in a tireless pursuit of exacting restoration of past architecture, the former reflected the awareness of fashion, of the swift 

<b></b>

and inexorable transition from new to old, and manifested itself in an appreciation of the effects of time, the process of aging, in themselves.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Preliminarily then, we can situate the question of the significance and role of monuments and memorials against the background of the loss of traditional contexts of significance that has become a commonplace characteristic of modernity in all these analyses. However, public remembrance is not only conditioned by the fact that spontaneous memory in a homogeneous communal life-world has largely vanished but, more important, by the existence of a <i>multiplicity</i> and <i>heterogeneity</i> of narratives and traditions vying for the status of public memory. Recent German history provides one unparalleled example of this phenomenon, the one I shall discuss here; multicultural American society provides another.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Discussions of German postwar memory have concentrated around the notion of personal and, by analogy, collective identity. So for instance, Eric Santner's penetrating book <i>Mourning, Memory and Film in Postwar Germany</i> undertakes to answer the question "What are the strategies and procedures by which a cultural identity may be reconstituted in post-Holocaust Germany?"<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  I will return to this question in a moment, but for now let me cast an initial skeptical glance at Santner's question by noting that it was most likely one of the questions motivating Helmut Kohl's government as well when it reincarnated the Neue Wache. Santner himself, however, takes a first step toward undermining a singular notion of cultural identity by differentiating between generations. Whereas according to Alexander and Margarete Mitscherlich, whose analyses of the postwar German "psyche" form Santner's <i>terminus a quo</i>, first generation Germans sought to evoke notions of universal reconciliation and "drawing a line" or "mastering" their past and repressing any feelings of guilt, second-generation Germans receive their sense of the past from their parents' stories, as one survey summarizes: "Fleeing advancing armies, bombed out, homeless and unemployed, hidden from Allied police, arrested and jailed, these parents are remembered by their children as victims of the war, as victims of a lost war."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Some post-Cold War representations of the war in popular culture clearly reflect this self-understanding, for instance, Helke Sanders's documentary <i>BeFreier und Befreite</i>, about the rape of German women by advancing Russian soldiers, and Joseph Vilsmaier's 1993 film <i>Stalingrad</i>, which depicts decent Wehrmacht soldiers commanded if not commandeered by diabolical SS officers. In both cases the revisionist portrayals of Germans as victims have proved controversial: at one point Sanders's film suggests a tacit equality (if not equity) between German women and Jews; the idealized moral line drawn in Vilsmaier's film between Wehrmacht and SS is belied by the Wehrmacht's documented participation in genocidal actions in the East.
</p>

<p>
Although Santner acknowledges the marked differences in the attitudes of first and second generations, he still formulates the generational problem as one of conflicted collective identity based on a social-psychological model of individual identification:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The core dilemma is that the cultural reservoir has been poisoned . . . To carry out their labors of self-constitution the second and third generations face the double bind of needing 

<b></b>

symbolic resources which, because of the unmanageable degrees of ambivalence such resources arouse, makes these labors impossible. . . . The double bind of having to identify with res of power one also at another level needs to disavow . . . leads to . . . a resistance to identification with parents and elders, in the second generation.

<p class="noIndent">
Yet a further attenuation of generations argues for reconsidering the <i>context in which</i> and <i>extent to which</i> the social-psychological model of mourning has purchase: the third generation is so far removed from the events that their information is provided less by personal testimonial than by today's educational institutions and entertainment media. In being institutionalized as history, what was <i>psychologically lived</i> or reported first-hand experience becomes <i>discursively and/or symbolically constructed and transmitted</i> simulacra of experience, what Santner aptly terms "the cultural reservoir." 
</p>

<p>
Santner emphasizes that "postwar generations have inherited the psychic structures that impeded mourning in the generations of their parents and grandparents" and "face the complex task of constituting stable self-identities by way of identifications with parents and grandparents who, in the worst possible cases, may have been directly implicated in crimes of unspeakable dimensions, thereby radically impeding their totemic availability."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Generational differentiation is only one way in which a notion of <i>the</i> German collective identity undergoes empirical attenuation. In the wake of events which Santner's book, published in 1990, could not have addressed, the third generation finds itself in an entirely new context of an abruptly reunified Germany that&#x02014;at least officially&#x02014;is no longer characterized by ideological division. A German collective identity, even posed simply as a task, is already composed of two traditions and two spheres of experience from two social systems, a <i>political</i> conflict of collective narratives more than a psychological working through of mourning. Finally, besides the multigenerational and (for lack of a better term) multi-ideological attenuation of a German collective identity, there is a multicultural dimension, in which national, ethnic, religious, and cultural identities are <i>not</i> coextensive. Whereas first-generation "guest workers" (a more apt term would be "permanent immigrants") from Turkey, Greece, or Italy remain largely unassimilated in German society, their sons and daughters do not possess German passports. They are wholeheartedly Berliners, native German speakers, and so on without, however, being "German." Clearly their relationship to a collective "German identity" and social memory involves an entirely different framework, including the poetics of memorials.
</p>

<p>
What I have been calling the empirical "attenuation" of a supposed singular German collective identity, whose (re)generation Santner's book explores, suggests rather that we speak of different <i>contexts</i> of identity: ranging from personal (with its criteria of authenticity and self-realization), through religious, ethnic, cultural, economic, up to national and legal (citizenship) and moral (universal human rights, for example).<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  A given situation may address or activate any one (or several) of these levels of identity, so that it becomes pertinent for that situation.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  This suggests a "postconventional" notion of identity that is no longer theorized by an analogy to Freudian psychology's concept of egological identification but rather admits a variety of contexts of identity.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Besides the empirical attenuation of collective identity in the classical sense, there is also a methodological point to be raised in considering social memory. Already in the 1920s the historian Marc Bloch criticized Durkheim's pupil, Maurice Halbwachs, for his easy borrowing of terms from individual psychology and nonchalantly prefacing them with the adjective "collective."<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  To the extent that Santner projects Freudian notions of successful mourning as a reconstruction of egological identity after loss onto the plane of collective (national or cultural; Santner speaks of them apparently interchangeably) identity, he too is vulnerable to that criticism. Bloch himself also explored social memory but stressed the process of transmission rather than group-psychological identity. Paul Connerton has drawn the lesson I shall follow here as well: "If we want to continue to speak, with Halbwachs, of collective memory, we must acknowledge that much of what is being subsumed under that term refers, quite simply, to facts of communication between individuals . . . to study the social formation of memory is to study those acts of transfer that make remembering in common possible."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Thus <i>either</i> the egological analogy is maintained but a multitude of overlapping, stratified, interpenetrating multiauthored collective identities within a pluralistic framework is accepted, <i>or</i> a change in focus is necessary from "collective identity" to competing, potentially conflicting public discourses of remembrance and transmission. I would therefore like to shift the emphasis from the social-psychological notion of collective identity to that of contradictory historiographical discourses, which are discernible and available to the historian and cultural critic in a way that collective psychology is not, and which constitute the "archive" out of which social memory undergoes an ongoing process of construction and reconstruction. These discourses form orientation points for individual memory, action and "improvised predispositions" (in Bourdieu's words) in the various contexts of identity suggested above. In this way social memory as "cultural reservoir" in fact is the counterpart to methodological individualism and not to collective identity. Furthermore, the discursive conflicts in the construction and transmission of social memory, perhaps not unlike the collisions of subterranean masses in plate tectonics, produce surface fractures and sudden eruptions of energy at long-established fault lines, such as the impact of the last fifty years of German history upon a small building on Unter den Linden.
</p>

<p>
Genealogically, the end of World War II produced two Germanies, and each commemorated its genesis as a way to justify its claim to authenticity of tradition and political legitimation against the background ideologies of the Cold War. So the GDR viewed itself as the continuation of the Weimar Republic's communist left who fought fascism and portrayed the Federal Republic as the continuation of the capitalist organization of society that "necessarily" led to fascism and imperialism. The GDR's double bind was, of course, that it paraded itself as the workers' state that arose from the ruins of totalitarianism while denying its own totalitarian lineaments. The workers' uprising on 17 June 1953 represents that double bind in all its tension.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the FRG faces a different kind of paradox. Its self-understanding holds that West Germany was liberated by the Allies from . . . itself, in Nazi guise. 

<b></b>

Or rather, the story stands on the distinction between a Nazi <i>tyranny</i> that usurped the incipient <i>democracy</i> of the Weimar Republic and drove Germany to ruin. The rupture of 1945 represents Germany being liberated from its own dictatorship: Germans were <i>both</i> agents of their regime&#x02014;no matter how unwilling or unknowing&#x02014;who sacrificed for their fatherland <i>and</i>, so the story goes, passive victims of that regime. This leads to a perennial problem in negotiating the closure of the Nazi regime and the origin or rebirth of (West) German democracy, since in a sense it is the same event under two different descriptions as, for instance, in the controversy about whether May 8th should be commemorated as the "day of capitulation" or the "day of liberation." Furthermore, the legitimacy of the FRG was also continually contrasted with the illegimitacy of the other German state: the communist totalitarianism was equated, more or less openly, with the prior national-socialist one. This allowed a reversed projection. The FRG could exploit the rule of force as exhibited in the GDR (most graphically in the killings at the wall and the suppression of the strikes and demonstrations on 17 June 1953) to dramatize the way the Nazi regime had made resistance impossible; this secured the necessary historiographical rupture between Nazi past and democratic present. The fact that the dissolution of the GDR is at least in large part due to the populist impulses for change in a broad spectrum of the population (as for instance in the Leipzig and Berlin demonstrations in the autumn of 1989), that is, precisely the kind of resistance that did <i>not</i> occur during the Nazi regime, is of course more problematical and less acknowledged. Moreover, the case of resistance the FRG chose to make paradigmatic, the failed attempt on Hitler's life by a group of Wehrmacht officers, draws on another tradition that stands in a more complex relationship to National Socialism. For the 20 July 1944 plot was organized and led by army officers of Prussian aristocratic background intent on saving Germany from absolute defeat and occupation by the Russians (thus recapitulating the classic "Weimar choice" between Bolshevism&#x02014;often personified as "Jewish"&#x02014;and fascism all over again), and there is no indication that their vision included a democratic form of government. Thus the official sanctioning of their attempted coup d'&#x000E9;tat in conjunction with the official disregard, if not omission, of leftist resistance organizations before and during the war (the latter orchestrated from Moscow) indicates an unbroken line of Prussian militarist patriotism within the FRG which, though latent, is an available historical-narrative resource. And so when Kohl's press-spokesman was asked if the Chancellor was disappointed not to have been invited to the commemorative ceremonies in Normandy marking the fiftieth anniversary of D-Day, he quipped, "Do you seriously believe the Bundeskanzler places any value in participating in a celebration of the defeat of German soldiers?"<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Thus on the one hand both East and West Germany constructed discourses of national legitimacy through denial of the prior national self-image, while on the other hand trying to claim the proper continuity with an even earlier tradition. The confluence of contradictory historiographies often results in symbolic conflict, and such conflict is perhaps nowhere more noticeable than in public memorials that seek to rescript these various histories into one story, one <i>mythos</i>. One such neuralgic point is the small memorial located on Unter den Linden known as the Neue Wache. If, according to 

<b></b>

Benjamin, "the historical object, by virtue of its monadological structure, discovers within itself its own [dialectical] pre-history and post-history" (<i>N</i> 10, 3), then the Neue Wache is a preeminent monad, for this modest memorial more than any other state building has been programmatically used in each of its concrete historical forms to provide the then current German state with a unifying image of national legitimation. If "[t]o write history means giving dates their physiognomy" (<i>N</i> 11, 2), then the incarnations of the Neue Wache amount to a dialectical image of the failed project to symbolically found a German national-cultural identity. Each attempt, each incarnation, has failed, I claim, for two reasons: <i>first</i> because of the conflation of military memorial and civil&#x02014;usually national&#x02014;monument inscribed in the very building's history. Indeed this is a recurrent conflict in the hybrid genre of national monument and military memorial throughout modern German history. The <i>second</i> reason for the Neue Wache's failure is that the equally conflicted post-war genealogies of national self-legitimation likewise conflate the civil and military dimensions of their narratives: on the one hand the GDR and reunified Germany wish to establish a complete break with the National-Socialist political past, while on the other hand they strive to maintain the national-cultural military tradition of honoring their war dead. This double-bind of trying to rewrite contradictory narratives into one story, one <i>mythos</i>, results in a symbolic conflict at whose center stands the Neue Wache.

The Neue Wache is a small, unprepossessing building. Its origins stretch back to 1786, when a soldiers' watch station, called the Kanonierwache, was located on the main thoroughfare across from the king's residence. It was one of thirty-four such buildings located throughout the city at gates, barracks, royal houses, etc. The soldiers at the Kanonierwache, later called the K&#x000F6;nigswache, were responsible for security in the area surrounding the Berlin city castle and the king's residence. The original wooden structure soon proved too small for them and, in the wake of Napoleon's defeat, too modest, and so in the spring of 1816 Friedrich Wilhelm III commissioned his chief privy architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel to design an impressive but, because of massive debts accrued during the Wars of Liberation, also an economical "Neue Wache." Schinkel's design called for a neoclassical pavilion with a duty room for about 100 soldiers of the Imperial Watch, Fourth Guards regiment, and a detention cell (<a href="#1"> 1</a>). Schinkel wrote: "The design of this solitary and free-standing building is in a rough imitation of a Roman <i>castrum</i>, hence the four quite solid corner towers and the inner courtyard."
</p>

<p>
In addition to its military use, the building also served to commemorate the victory over Napoleon, that is, served as a national monument. Thus the intended tympanum relief designed by Schinkel depicts a battle in which, as he wrote: "a Victory in the center decides in favor of the heroes ting on the right side; on the left are represented the final efforts, the exhortation to battle, flight, the plunder and pain of the family awaiting their fate; on the right one can see the overwhelming emotion and mourning for a fallen comrade."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>The tympanum was finally built in 1842 by Johann Gottfried Schadow, the leading neoclassical sculptor of his day. Schadow had already designed the Quadriga&#x02014;the female re of Victory, standing in a war chariot, her brow adorned with a chaplet of oak leaves&#x02014;for the Brandenburg Gate, which was unveiled in 1791 as the "gate of peace." Following the Wars of Liberation the Quadriga, which Napoleon had hauled off to Paris in 1806, was returned to the Brandenburg Gate, now renamed a "triumphal gate" at the head of Unter den Linden's "Via Triumphalis," henceforth the main avenue of Prussian parades, in which the Neue Wache played an integral role. The intended sculptures of victory trophies to crest the corner towers were never built. Originally it was planned to erect statues of five generals who had helped defeat Napoleon, but because of budgetary considerations only three were realized: Bl&#x000FC;cher across the street near the Opera house, and von B&#x000FC;low and Scharnhorst flanking the Neue Wache. The statues were unveiled in 1822 on the anniversary of the battle of Waterloo (<a href="#2"> 2</a>). Likewise the chestnut tree grove adjoining the Neue Wache boasted a permanent exhibit of captured French howitzers: war trophies from the Wars of Liberation. After the Berlin city castle received its own regiment of soldiers, the Neue Wache's function became purely ceremonial, and extravagant military parades passed by it to celebrate the defeats of Denmark , Austria  and France . On 1 August 1914 the general mobilization orders were announced from its steps, as were the demobilization orders four years later.

<p>After the abdication of the Kaiser in 1918 the building fell into disuse, serving as emergency housing for the homeless, among other functions. On 3 August 1924, on the tenth anniversary of the beginning of World War I, Reichspresident Friedrich Ebert expressed his desire for a "national monument of honor" [<i>Reichsehrenmal</i>] that would "serve to mourn the past and embody the vital energy and the will to freedom of the German people." Controversy and indecision lingered on until 1929, when Otto Braun, Ministerpresident of Prussia, decided to transform the Neue Wache into a "Memorial Site [<i>Ged&#x000E4;chtnisst&#x000E4;tte]</i> for the Fallen of the World War" and asked for proposals for the interior. Heinrich von Tessenow's design was accepted (<a href="#3"> 3</a>). Light gray limestone plates cover the walls, and dark basalt-lava stones form a floor mosaic. In the center a black memorial stone, marked "1914-1918" and bearing a large silver oak-wreath, represents the "Altar of the Fatherland." Two candelabra flank the altar to the rear in each corner, and a large opening four meters in circumference and encircled in bronze is cut in the ceiling above the altar. In his review of the memorial for the <i>Frankfurter Zeitung</i> Siegfried Kracauer wrote:
</p>

Of course, one can erect emotional memorials and reinforce the interpretation ascribed to them by means of some symbol or other&#x02014;but haven't we had enough of our Bismarck towers? It is simply the case that a positive statement is virtually impossible for us at this time. We cannot countenance it either in the literary language nor in the language of architecture. . . . Why? In Germany in any case, it is because we are much too divided on questions of the most important and vital kind, so that we cannot come together through some insight that would unite us. Thus, with the memorial it can only be a question of a necessarily pragmatic solution. The deliberate presentation of content is not what is needed&#x02014;what do most people today know about death?&#x02014;but rather the most extreme abstinence of content.

honest, it should not be much more than an empty room. And precisely this is the propriety of Tessenow's design: that he only wants to give what we possess . . . that is not much, indeed it is very little, but in consideration of our present economic and intellectual life it is precisely enough. Tessenow's proper modesty knew how to avoid smuggling in metaphysical contraband and restricted itself to the dignified proportions of the memorial site.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>

Politicians did not demonstrate such self-restraint in their evaluation at the opening ceremony of the redesigned Neue Wache on 2 June 1931. The German Army Minister Groener embedded the Neue Wache squarely in the Prussian military tradition of war memorials: "We consecrate today the remodeled Neue Wache to the fallen of the World War. Built by the warriors of Leipzig and Belle-Alliance, for a century it was the emblem of the Prussian army. The heroic greatness of its form is equal to the greatness of heroism and the greatness of the sacrifices [<i>Opfer</i>] that ever new generations have made so that Germany may live."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Indeed in 1934 the Neue Wache became a "memorial of honor" [<i>Ehrenmal</i>] for fallen soldiers and an inspiration for new ones. A large oaken cross was affixed to the rear wall and candles and candelabras were placed around the altar to convey a greater sense of piety. The Christian iconography of the cross echoed the characteristic adornment on World War I veterans' graves as well as the Nazi memorial to Schlageter and Hindenburg's crypt within the Tannenberg memorial. The civil police posted before the building were replaced by an honor guard of Wehrmacht soldiers of the "Guards Regiment of Berlin" (<a href="#4"> 4</a>). The changing of the guard on Sunday, Tuesday, and Friday was a public spectacle, as was the wreath-laying ceremony by Hitler on "heroes' 

<b></b>

remembrance day" [<i>Heldengedenktag</i>], the precursor to <i>Volkstrauertag</i> (<a href="#5"> 5</a>). During World War II fallen generals were given their final honors before the Neue Wache.</p>

Bombs damaged the building badly toward the end of the war: the roof burnt away, two columns were shattered, the south-eastern corner collapsed, the memorial stone was partially melted in the heat of the bombing, and the wreath was eventually stolen (<a href="#6"> 6</a>). Tessenow said of the ruin: "If it were now up to me, I would not give the building any other form whatsoever. As damaged as it is now, it truly speaks history. A little cleaning up and straightening out, and let it stand as it is."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>

The Neue Wache along with the other neoclassical buildings of Unter den Linden fell within the Russian sector of occupied Berlin (<a href="#7"> 7</a>). In 1948 the local communist government considered tearing down the Neue Wache because of its militaristic history, and because people continued to lay flowers and wreaths there in remembrance of recent war dead, even after the building's iron doors had been chained shut. However, the Soviets interceded, reasoning that the building and its military symbolism represented Russian and German "friendship" in their having joined forces to defeat Napoleon: the military tradition was once again invoked and renewed. The Neue Wache was transformed into a museum of Soviet-German friendship, with slogans and large portraits of party members. The statues of B&#x000FC;low and Scharnhorst were removed and their pedestals given Russian and German inscriptions honoring Stalin.
</p>

<p>
On 10 February 1949 the Freie Deutsche Jugend (FDJ) demanded that the Neue Wache, as a symbol of Prussian militarism, be demolished, an argument that did in fact lead to the demolition of several neoclassical buildings designed by Schinkel: the Berlin city castle in 1950, the Potsdam city castle in 1959-1960, and the Potsdam

But the Neue Wache was saved by its central location on Unter den Linden and by the resolution passed by the Fifth Party Congress of the SED in 1950 that by 1965 the "center of the capital of the GDR" should be completely rebuilt: the new East German state, founded on 7 October 1949, demanded a fitting capital. In the initial phase of East German architecture (1949-1955) Lothar Bolz, the Minister for the Construction of the GDR, stipulated that the capital's architecture&#x02014;so long as it could be integrated into socialist inner-city planning&#x02014;was to be rebuilt in the national and regional traditions, in ideological contrast to the "Americanization" of the Federal Republic's architecture just across no man's land. Returning to a national architectural tradition meant above all that the historical center, the so-called <i>Forum Fridericianum</i>of Unter den Linden&#x02014;the Neue Wache, the Armory, the National Opera, the Prinzessinnenpalais&#x02014;was to return to Schinkel's classicism.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>

<p>Renovations began in 1951: indeed, the Neue Wache was among the very first buildings to be rebuilt in the service of the new East German nation. It was as if a proper relationship to the historical tradition had to precede the building of socialist architecture such as the Ministry for Foreign Affairs (1963-1966) or the Palace of the Republic (1973-1976). On 21 September 1956 the magistrate of East Berlin passed the final decree to make the Neue Wache a new admonitory memorial [<i>Mahnmal</i>] for "the victims of fascism and both world wars." The architect Heinz Mehlan restored the interior, removed the oaken cross, replaced the inscription of "1914-1918" with the final formulation, "to the Victims of Fascism and Militarism," and kept the now disred "Altar of the Fatherland" (<a href="#8"> 8</a>). The restoration was completed in 1960, and the Neue Wache reopened with a military ceremony. On 1 May 1962&#x02014;the year that mandatory military service was introduced in the GDR&#x02014;two NVA (National People's

Army) soldiers of the elite "Friedrich Engels" Guards Regiment took up the posts that had been vacated by their National Socialist predecessors. Every Wednesday at 2:30 pm the changing of the guard took place in full military regalia; it soon became a tourist attraction comparable to Lenin's tomb or Buckingham Palace and was broadcast live on the state radio (<a href="#9"> 9</a>).</p>

In 1966 the Neue Wache was closed for interior remodeling by the architect Lothar Kwasnitza, because&#x02014;according to the GDR souvenir book on the Neue Wache&#x02014;"it became ever more clear that the interior design of the memorial [<i>Mahnmal</i>] did not correspond to the understanding of socialist society."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  The uneasy combination of admonitory memorial and national self-image was redesigned, probably in connection with the upcoming twentieth anniversary of the GDR (7 October 1969). The national crest of the GDR (hammer and compass) was chiseled into the rear wall, and the inscription was transferred to the side wall. Tessenow's altar was removed and replaced by a gas-fed eternal flame as was the custom in the Soviet Union. Probably in imitation of the memorial to the unknown soldier in the Kremlin wall unveiled in 1967&#x02014;itself an imitation of similar national war memorials in Britain and France erected after World War I&#x02014;the remains of a resistance ter shot by the SS and the remains of a German soldier killed in Eastern Prussia were exhumed and placed under the stone floor; the unknown soldier was buried with the soil from nine battlefields, the unknown resistance ter with the soil from nine concentration camps. A glass cupola sealed the ceiling opening, and the basalt-lava floor was covered by bright, polished marble plates. The honor guard's watch station was moved to the adjoining Museum of German History (formerly the Prussian Armory), and cameras were installed to monitor the eternal flame and the interior (<a href="#0"> 10</a>).

guard took place on 2 October 1990. After reunification the GDR crest was removed from the rear wall; otherwise the interior was left intact but unused.
</p>

<p>
In West Germany the need for a memorial to the dead was dictated first and foremost by pragmatic needs, above all the "international protocol" of foreign dignitaries laying wreaths at each other's national war memorials. The first incarnation of such a memorial was a bronze plaque with the inscription "To the Victims of Wars and Tyranny," erected in the court garden [<i>Hofgarten</i>] in Bonn on 16 June 1964 and dedicated by President L&#x000FC;bke "in memory of the victims of the people's uprising on June 17th," the first in a long line of surreptitious ideological identifications by West German politicians of East Germany and Nazi Germany performed while doing nothing more suspect than laying a wreath. Because of the campus atmosphere of the Hofgarten, which adjoins several university institute buildings, the "wreath-laying site" [<i>Kranzniederlegungsstelle</i>], as the memorial was derogatorily nicknamed (it was also more cynically called the "wreath-dumping site," <i>Kranzabwurfsstelle</i>), was moved in 1969 to the Northern Cemetery in Bonn where, however, ninety-six Russian prisoners of war who had been worked to death and seventeen members of the Waffen-SS are buried. 
</p>

<p>
In 1981 Bundeskanzler Schmidt proposed the establishment of a memorial for all those "who through the errors [<i>Irrt&#x000FC;mer</i>] and the crimes of the Third Reich gave up their lives, be it in prisons and concentration camps, be it in the homeland in the bombing war or on the fronts of the Second World War." The German War Graves Commission responded with an aide-m&#x000E9;moire proposing as a "national place of honor" [<i>nationale Ehrenst&#x000E4;tte</i>] a "national commemorative site for the war-dead of the German people" that would have as a "unifying symbol" a "proportionately oversized crown of thorns, suspended in the air or just above the ground."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Protests by the representatives of the Jewish Community in Germany at the Christian symbolism quashed the proposal.
</p>

<p>
The embarrassment of lacking a "central wreath-laying site" was exacerbated by the public outcry when President Reagan and Chancellor Kohl fulfilled their obligations to "international protocol" at Bitburg cemetery on the fortieth anniversary of the end of the war.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
On 27 January 1993 the Federal cabinet under Chancellor Kohl announced that a "central commemorative site of the Federal Republic of Germany" would be erected in the Neue Wache and would be opened on 14 November, the <i>Volkstrauertag</i> of that year. Volkstrauertag, the last Sunday before the first Advent, dates back to the "remembrance day" [<i>Gedenktag</i>] introduced in 1923 to honor the dead of World War I, itself in imitation of the French national day of mourning (11 November) introduced in 1922. The "day of remembrance" was renamed "heroes' remembrance day" [<i>Heldengedenktag</i>] in 1934 and reintroduced and renamed Volkstrauertag under the Adenauer government in 1952. By way of justifying his decision Kohl said that the institution of a central memorial site in Berlin was a "signal that the move [of the government] to Berlin will not be delayed."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Like the East German government before it, the new reunified Federal Republic rebuilt and "rebaptized" the Neue Wache before any other official building in Berlin.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
In answer to protests over the lack of public and government discussion surrounding Kohl's decision, a two-hour debate ensued in parliament: five experts were consulted (two pro, three contra); no alternatives were proposed. The Berliner Amt f&#x000FC;r Denkmalpflege, the city's office of memorial preservation, which had been working on the Neue Wache's interior and had recommended maintaining the 1969 design, was "considered in an advisory capacity only." In his address to the parliament during the debate Kohl informally adduced four reasons for moving forward quickly with the memorial:
</p>

<ol class="decimal">
<li> The state required a site for wreath-laying ceremonies with foreign dignitaries;</li>
<li>Because fewer Germans could directly remember the war (as opposed to those who learn about it only through school, books, etc.) the issue had to be decided quickly.</li>

<li>More generally, because women, as mothers and widows "are victims of war and violence who have been affected by the horror of this century in a particular way," the proposed sculpture of a mother and dead soldier-son, to be installed within the memorial building, would best represent the "tragedy of the century."</li>

<li> Finally, there were letters of support for the project from the "League of the War-Blinded" and the VdK (War Graves Commission), which Kohl read aloud.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> </li>
</ol>

<p>
There was nothing in Kohl's parliamentary address to indicate that he saw the Neue Wache as anything more or other than a national war memorial to Germany's dead soldiers. There was no parliamentary decision procedure, no vote, no referendum, and no advisory committee formed. In the first words of an open letter to the <i>Frankfurter Allgemeine</i> newspaper, Christoph St&#x000F6;lzl, the director of the German Historical Museum and a Kohl-appointee, justified the reason: "The federal government has decided about the design of a commemorative site of great political symbolism. The government did not take the path of public discourse (hearings, competition, jury) but decided to return to tradition. This is not as unusual as it seems to many critics. The selection of other state symbols of the Federal Republic, like flags and hymns, was also made in this way."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  The nexus of the Neue Wache's military and national traditions was thus upheld.
</p>

<p>
So, the Neue Wache is once again redesigned: its interior is restored to the form it had in the Weimar Republic according to Tessenow's <i>original</i> plan. The glass cupola is removed, uncovering the opening in the ceiling, and the floor and wall plating now imitates Tessenow's design. The sculpture by K&#x000E4;the Kollwitz of a mother embracing her dead son, which Kohl had chosen, is enlarged fivefold into slightly larger-than-life size and placed in the center of the interior (<a href="#1"> 11</a>). The new inscription reads: "To the Victims of War and Tyranny" (<a href="#2"> 12</a>). 
</p>

<p>
Critics expressed reservations concerning the appropriateness of the Kollwitz sculpture, as a result of its complex genesis. Entries in Kollwitz's diary indicate that she encouraged, against her husband's protests, their son Peter in his wish to volunteer for the army in the first ecstatic days of World War I, when members of the romantic Youth Movement were swept up in rhapsodic patriotism. Because he was underage, Peter required the permission of his father, Karl, in order to enlist, and with the support of his mother he finally received it. Kollwitz wrote: "I stand up, Peter follows me,

This sacrifice [<i>Opfer</i>] to which he charmed [<i>hinri&#x000DF;</i>] me, to which we charmed Karl." Within a month, in his first action, Peter lay dead on a field in Flanders. The death of her son became the overriding theme in her drawings and sculptures: she addresses her dead son in her diary, reports to him about "your memorial." Yet, most striking is the fact that the image of mother and dead son&#x02014;with K&#x000E4;the Kollwitz and Peter as models&#x02014;already recurs often in her early work, well <i>before</i> the war, before Peter's death, thus complicating a simplistic story of art being used to come to terms with a painful loss. Instead, the ideology that shaped her artistic subject matter seems continuous, indeed complicitous with the ideology that "charmed" her into "charming" her husband into signing Peter's permission papers.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  That ideology, in her art as in her life, is replete with Christian motifs of sacrifice and redemption, for instance of Mary holding the dead Christ in the early "Piet&#x000E0;" of 1903 (<a href="#3"> 13</a>).

What the war withholds, art may provide. On 22 October 1937&#x02014;the anniversary of Peter's death&#x02014;Kollwitz reports in her diary that she is working on a small bronze sculpture that "has become something like a piet&#x000E0;. The mother is sitting and has her dead son lying between her knees in her lap. It is no longer pain, but rather thoughtful reflection."<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  The sculpture is 38 cm. high, 38 cm. deep, and 26 cm. wide. The work was never modified after 1937, and there is no indication that the piet&#x000E0; was ever intended as a model for a larger work or public monument. But, again, more striking is an earlier woodcut and drawing entitled "Death with a Woman in her Lap" [<i>Tod mit Frau im Scho&#x000DF;</i>] dating from 1921 (<a href="#4"> 14</a>). Not a mother and dead son, but Death and a young woman, though one can still recognize Kollwitz and Peter in both images. Here too, as in the diary entry above, I would suggest that we see the iconographic piet&#x000E1; symbolizing the heroic, redemptive sacrifice for the fatherland but also the ambivalence,

The appropriateness of a Christian piet&#x000E0; to commemorate, among others, Jewish victims of National Socialism was questioned by critics of the Neue Wache's new makeover, and the lack of discrimination between perpetrator and victim in the language of the dedication had been challenged.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Kohl responded to criticism of the inscription in the parliament debate: "One could of course ask whether such a sweeping formulation doesn't include much that we don't want to see included. For this reason one might consider going into more detail with the formulation. But in doing that one slides into the whole labyrinth of modern German history. The more you formulate, the less justice you'll provide."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Justice <i>to whom</i>, of course, is the question, and Kohl's attempt at what could be termed as apotropaic invocation stands diametrically opposed to Bundespresident Richard von Weiz&#x000E4;cker's speech on 8 May 1985, in which he attempted to name specifically those who are being remembered and why.
</p>

<p>
In autumn 1993, shortly before the unveiling of the memorial, and in the face of a mounting scandal surrounding its design, a compromise was effected between Kohl's cabinet and various political representatives and critics at large. It was agreed that a separate memorial to Jewish victims will be erected, and two bronze tablets were mounted flanking the entrance portal to the Neue Wache: on the left a short history of the building, on the right an enumeration of who is to be honored:

Arthur Danto has proposed the following conceptual-analytical distinction between monument and memorial: "We erect monuments so that we shall always remember and build memorials so that we shall never forget . . . Monuments commemorate the memorable and embody myths of beginnings. Memorials ritualize remembrance and mark the reality of ends. . . . Monuments make heroes and triumphs, victories and conquests, perpetually present and part of life. The memorial is a special precinct, extruded from life, a segregated enclave where we honor the dead. With monuments, we honor ourselves."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The German language does not have separate words for "monument" and "memorial." <i>Denkmal</i> is the neutral term designating both;<i>Ehrenmal</i> with its root of "honor" [<i>Ehre</i>] was the common term used in the beginning of the century (before World War II) to honor the war dead, but it is seldom used today and has been largely replaced by <i>Mahnmal</i> with its root "<i>mahnen</i>" suggesting reminder, admonition or edification. Finally, <i>Gedenkst&#x000E4;tte</i> has appeared as a neutral term for a site whose purpose is to foster remembrance. Danto's distinction is a good starting point because it rests on the <i>use</i> to 

<b></b>

which monuments and memorials are put in the context of public commemoration, which suggests considering them as modified forms of semiotic communication. According to Roman Jakobson's model, any communicative act involves the (explicit or implicit) presence of six functions: an <i>addresser</i>, who sends a <i>message</i> to an <i>addressee</i>, a <i>context</i> referred to in the message, a <i>code</i> that the addresser and addressee hold in common, and a <i>contact</i> (a physical channel between them).<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Schematizing Danto's insights, we can say: Monuments typically <i>address</i> their producer's community (nation), while memorials may address the dead themselves; the <i>context</i> referred to in monuments is a myth of founding or legitimation, in a memorial a painful reality of loss; the <i>code</i> shared in a monument is likely a traditional iconography of national symbols, whereas memorials "tend to emphasize texts or lists of the dead"; in a monument the <i>contact</i> is one of a privileged central site manifesting the state's importance in daily life, in a memorial a "special precinct, extruded from life" and ritualized.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  With this instrumentarium let us consider the Neue Wache and then the genre characteristics of German national war memorials.
</p>

<p>
The double bind afflicting the postwar Germanies is that the memorials commemorating the war dead are at once <i>also</i> monuments to the "birth" of modern democratic or socialist Germany: the "myth of beginning" and the "reality of ends" that Danto separates by analytical definition are here inextricably convoluted. The message of the Neue Wache as a communicative act is contradictory because the historical narrative&#x02014;the context&#x02014;that Kohl's newly reunified Germany wants to tell itself is just as conflated, trying to name the same event(s) under two descriptions: defeat and rebirth are "co-originary" [<i>gleichurspr&#x000FC;nglich</i>], as Heidegger would say. The oscillation between the two varies according to what instantiation one wishes to disclose in the statue of the mother mourning her dead son: is she the mother of a concentration camp victim, a Wehrmacht soldier or Waffen-SS officer or NVA border guard at the Berlin wall, of a child killed in the night bombings, one of the executed plotters against Hitler, and so on. The variability of the addressee in turn recodes the message so that virtually anyone can symbolically identify himself or herself as the victim. Victimhood has become a universal currency: to turn the supremely ironical phrase from Marx's "On the Jewish Question": the Jews have achieved commemoration in so far as the Christians have become Jews.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The abstraction of the dedication ("To the Victims of War and Tyranny") is matched by the sculpture's universality of address and intended affect: pity [<i>Mitleid</i>]. In West Germany, Kollwitz's art was understood above all as a gesture of humanist pity, as for instance, the opening lines of the most popular monograph on her intone: "to cry together, to empathize, to struggle together, to be needed together: nothing characterizes the person K&#x000E4;the Kollwitz and her work better than this emotional preposition '<i>mit</i>' [together] that aims for commonality."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  St&#x000F6;lzl once again ascribes a clear national purpose to the work: "If any commemorative site erected by the state can found a tradition, then it cannot be wrong in being a tradition of pity . . . Hardly any other problem in artistic design is so arduous for the Germans than that of an official commemorative site for the victims of war and tyranny. Can it be wrong to avail oneself of 

<b></b>

an artistic tradition to which we owe some of the great, binding images of humanity? Some say: that is sentimental. But what is wrong with that?"<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
It remains a question whether Kohl in his speech about the "tragedy of the century" and the "family tragedies" of German families, and St&#x000F6;lzl in his appeal to the unifying effect of pity, were aware of Lessing's attempt in the eighteenth century to unify the German people via a national theater and a modified Aristotelian theory of the universal cathartic effects of pity. Lessing's creative translation of the Greek [&#x003B5;&#x003BB;&#x003B5;&#x003BF;&#x003B6;] as "pity" [<i>Mitleid</i>] rather than, for instance, "misery" [<i>Jammer</i>], universalized the effect of tragedy by disconnecting it&#x02014;in contrast to Aristotle&#x02014;from the moral judgment by the audience that a tragic hero has suffered "<i>undeserved</i> misfortune."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
There is, however, a second level of interpretation regarding the statue, beyond its intended effect of universal reconciliation. The selective reception of K&#x000E4;the Kollwitz in West Germany as an artist of universal humanism and originality in aesthetic form stood in marked contrast to her wholesale adoption by East Germany as a "comrade of the struggling workers": public statues erected on the renamed "K&#x000E4;the-Kollwitz Square" in East Berlin, several major exhibitions alongside a permanent museum, state-funded scholarly studies and a complete edition of her graphic works all solidified the official interpretation of Kollwitz's socialist engagement, which included antiwar and antipoverty graphics and a woodcut for a memorial leaflet on the death of Karl Liebknecht, which characteristically alludes to the iconography of "the mourning of Christ."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Kollwitz and her art thus were subject to the same Cold War ideological pressures and faultlines as the Neue Wache itself, and placing one of her works within the memorial may be seen as the new state's symbolic affirmation of her western ideological image, just as East Berlin streets named after Weimar socialist and communist personalities have now been renamed and ideologically reappropriated.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
However, other criticisms remain. A purported <i>realistic</i> code of the sculpture is mitigated by the fact that in World War II most victims' bodies were not recovered, and that whole families and neighborhoods&#x02014;civilian casualties far outnumbering military ones&#x02014;were eradicated in the death camps and the bombings: as a result of modern warfare and industrial murder the gendered stylization of a surviving mother cradling the body of her soldier son no longer has the purchase on universality Kohl claims. Furthermore, that pool of addressees is curtailed through the <i>symbolic</i> code of the memorial, for indeed the statue belongs to the Christian iconographic tradition of piet&#x000E1;: it thereby excludes precisely many of the groups to which it is ostensibly dedicated: Jews, Gypsies, Orthodox, atheists, communist resistance ters, etc.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Lastly, the contact, the physical channel, also forecloses the work's reception and hence the goal of reconciliation, for the Neue Wache, as we've seen in the historical sketch above, is coded above all as a <i>military</i> memorial, whereas the overwhelming number of the dead did not belong to the military, but rather the <i>civil</i> sphere of society. It is the recoding of a breakdown of civil society (the rise of National Socialism) in the traditional trappings of a national war memorial that most condemns the Neue Wache.
</p>

<p>
The Neue Wache's contribution to the "cultural reservoir" of postwar social memory can be evaluated with recourse to Reinhart Koselleck's seminal study of the genre, in 

<b></b>

which he specified three ways in which a memorial to the war dead [<i>Kriegerdenkmal</i>] can establish identification:
</p>

<ol class="decimal">
<li>  "The dead, the killed, the fallen are identified in a certain respect&#x02014;as heroes, victims, martyrs, victors, followers, and also even as vanquished; furthermore as keepers or bearers of honor, faith, fame, loyalty, duty; finally as guardians and protectors of the fatherland, humanity, justice, freedom, the proletariat or the particular constitution."</li>

<li>  "The surviving spectators themselves are confronted with an identification to which they should or must relate themselves. 'Mortui viventes obligant,' says the simple maxim, which can be filled out according to the identity structure given above. Their cause is also ours. The war memorial does not only remember the dead, it also reclaims the lost life in order to give a meaning to the process of surviving."</li>
<li> "Finally there is the case that is included in all those named, but that in itself means at once either more or less: that the dead are remembered&#x02014;as dead."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup> </li>
</ol>

<p>
The present avatar of the Neue Wache has aroused such controversy because it at once partakes and does not partake of the poetics of <i>Kriegerdenkmale</i> Koselleck outlines. The first level of identification, the dedication's addressees, is left as indeterminate and hence inclusive as possible, augmented by the semantic slipperiness of the German "<i>Opfer</i>," which up to <i>Kriegerdenkmale</i> commemorating World War I translated <i>sacrificium</i>, a voluntary "sacrifice" for one's country, but since World War II has come to mean more the passive <i>victus</i>, "victim." The former belongs to the vocabulary of the Roman soldier's heroic virtue, the latter to the statistics of highway fatalities, aerial bombings and the death camps. 
</p>

<p>
So, too, the second level of identification, the common cause or obligation linking the dead and the living&#x02014;conceivably something like "let there be no war and tyranny"&#x02014;in its very anodyne abstraction can refer to both National Socialism and the GDR, and moreover seems a proleptic justification for sending <i>Bundeswehr</i> soldiers abroad on UN peacekeeping missions, part of Germany's incremental "normalization" as a post-Cold War national power and future permanent member of the UN Security Council. In keeping with the Lessing program of cathartic nation building, "war and tyranny" stand opposed to a passive humanity like divine or natural forces confronting a vulnerable polis&#x02014;as impersonal, inscrutable fate rather than human, all too human political catastrophes. All of humanity appears as a real or potential <i>Schicksalsgemeinschaft</i>, a "community united by fate," a concept with a highly compromised political history.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the concreteness of the re in contrast to the generality of the dedication suggests that&#x02014;to the extent that the memorial is a war memorial&#x02014;the attempt is being made to distinguish the honor of those who sacrificed from the dishonorable cause for which they sacrificed, similar to the poetics, controversy, and subsequent compromise formations (the addition of a flagpole and realistic ral statues of combatants) of the American Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  One can only hope then that the third level, remembering the dead themselves, in their particularity, is somehow possible <i>despite</i> the memorial.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
These motifs are not new, for indeed they have an insistent, recurrent presence in the hybrid genre of national monument and military memorial throughout modern German history. The nexus of civil, military, and Christian elements is specific to German war memorials as opposed to French: as one historian of World War I memorials succinctly notes, "In the German cult of the dead the citizen is celebrated as soldier, in France the soldier as citizen."<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Whereas French memorials exhibit secular motifs of the citizen-soldier and his waiting family, Germany's memorials to its soldiers emphasized sacredness of duty to the nation, part of the larger strategy of nation building in Germany: "The religious is secularized in the national, and the secular is sacralized."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
A perhaps extreme example in this tradition is presented in Hubert Schrade's 1934 study <i>The German National Monument</i>, which lays out the National Socialist program to fulfill the avowed need for a national memorial that, by 1934, was already celebrating the tenth anniversary of its first manifestation: the memorial to Schlageter, the early Nazi martyr from the Ruhr occupation.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  Schrade praises the memorial, a sunken circular crypt with an overarching cross, for providing an <i>Urform</i> of the space that forms a community [<i>Urform des gemeinschaftsbildenden Raumes</i>]: "With its main space and its crypt sunk into the fateful earth of the Ruhr, bringing the ring of community to appearance, dominated by a symbol, this memorial contains in embryo everything that shapes our expectation."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  However, it is Munich's memorial to its 13,000 sons who fell in World War I that captures his unqualified approbation (<a href="#5"> 15</a>). A mausoleum, adorned with the names of the dead and the dedication "To Our Fallen" on one side of the chamber and the assurance "They Will Rise Again" on the other, leads down to a sunken cryptlike space enclosing the full-size sculpture of a soldier in battle-dress laid out upon the altar of the fatherland (<a href="#6"> 16</a>). Schrade provides first a first-person plural ("we") phenomenological description of the experience of the memorial:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
All the names have become a sign for men of one fate, as it were traces of the mythos of the fallen . . . The view upon all the names of <i>one</i> mission [<i>Berufenheit</i>] of itself awakens in us the need for a re in which the fate of the many, who have become one, is allegorically [<i>gleichnishaft</i>] embodied. We are prepared to descend into the crypt located below the altar-tomb-block. In it is the sought-for image of the one who represents all: a young warrior in his repose of death . . .

<p>
My point is not, of course, that the Kohl government is consciously seeking to renew a National Socialist program in its design of the Neue Wache. Rather the homologies in situation, design, address, and allegorical ration indicate the powerful and unbroken function performed by memorials to the war dead in creating a "cultural reservoir" for national identity. From this perspective, the vagueness of the Neue Wache's dedication and allegorical re becomes more motivated, for only from such vagueness could the desired national unity possibly be fashioned out of the wounds and ruins of recent German history.

My final example from the history of German national monuments and memorials addresses the other aspect I named above: the uncomfortable conflation of <i>military</i>

and <i>civil</i> motifs in the Neue Wache, for this conflation dates back at least to the 1969 renovations carried out to bring the building into line with the GDR's founding myth of self-legitimation. At the conclusion of the souvenir book about the Neue Wache by the "Military Publishing House of the GDR" the author addresses precisely the spectator's apprehension and confusion caused by the interference between a military-ceremonial building and rituals (contact and code) on the one hand and the civil-monumental role (context) the remodelled Neue Wache was supposed to play on the other:

Now and again visitors do not really know how they should reconcile the military ceremony with this [i.e., antifascist] tradition. Military demonstrations of honor before memorials in the historically traditional national manner are common in many countries, as also in the GDR. Here, as in all socialist countries, the historically transmitted forms of military ceremony are the point of attachment. They extend from the weekly mounting of the guard to the Great Ceremonial Tattoo on special occasions. However, in a workers' and peasants' state like the GDR there is no possibility whatsoever that this ceremony would serve to glorify the demon of militarism, which was eradicated completely in this state. Carried out by members of a workers-and-peasants army in the "Friedrich Engels" Watch Regiment in honor of the pioneers of socialism and as expression of its reliable armed protection, from the beginning onwards it serves the cultivation of the antifascist tradition of the people of the GDR that is embodied in this memorial.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
That is, the GDR is a legitimate state because it too draws on its specific traditional national forms of military ceremony, while at the same time defining itself in opposition to the national militarism that immediately preceded it, fascism. Furthermore, the memorial is split along the fissure dividing the unknown soldier from the unknown resistance ter, the former performing the function of a military memorial&#x02014;marking the loss of German soldiers in the previous war&#x02014;the latter the function of a civil memorial and monument&#x02014;marking the founding of the GDR upon the tradition of political, antifascist resistance. The unfortunate juxtaposition metonymically links victims and perpetrators in what could be called "Bitburg <i>avant la lettre</i>": the soldier conceivably could have shot the resistance ter, or vice versa.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The current incarnation of the Neue Wache merely multiplies the conflicts between the military and civil registers. The external tablet must prophylactically <i>correct</i> the interior dedication, which conceivably commemorates everyone who suffered during the war, implying an equivalence between fallen soldiers and murdered citizens (which the tablet corrects only to the extent that it invokes "innocence" without, however, explaining how it should be understood in such cases), and again between the National Socialist totalitarianism and the East German regime (which the tablet explicitly reinforces). In this self-diremption the reunified Germany assumes, ironically, the conflicted legacy of the GDR.

<p class="noIndent">
A short critical excursus regarding some recent Holocaust memorials in Germany may provide a useful conceptual transition from the Neue Wache to the Bavarian Quarter memorial for two reasons:  discussing the memorials that commemorate Holocaust victims disentangles the Holocaust as a civil catastrophe from its unfortunate intertwinement with military and nation-building motifs in the Neue Wache; and  the regressive inadequacy, if not bad faith, of the Kollwitz sculpture as a rative representation of Holocaust victims has led critics, in particular James E. Young, to advocate its dialectical counterpart: "counter-monuments" (<i>Gegen-Denkmale</i>)&#x02014;nonrepresentational or self-thematizing memorials&#x02014;which all too often renounce their historico-commemorative specificity. "Counter-monuments" generally fall into three kinds of poetics: nonrepresentational or "negatively sublime" artworks; artworks that self-reflexively thematize the transience and difficulties inherent in public commemoration as such; and "limit-case" artworks that tend toward their own self-effacement in favor of historical documentation. Understanding what I take to be the dialectical relationship between nonrepresentational and representational forms of remembrance will prepare the possibility of moving beyond that opposition in the Bavarian Quarter memorial.
</p>

<p>
The first kind of poetics of "counter-monuments" arose from debates surrounding Holocaust memorials in particular that centered on the opposition between rative representation on the one hand, characteristic of memorials in the 1950s and 1960s and dating back to memorials commemorating fallen soldiers of World War I, and abstract or minimalist, nonrepresentational memorials on the other hand, whose justification often draws on the unrepresentability thesis by thinkers like Lyotard, or, in this context Claude Lanzman or Dan Diner, who hold that the Holocaust has no narrative structure, only statistics. Within this opposition the Kollwitz sculpture clearly is regressive, a totem offering the promise of reintegration, via what Freud calls secondary narcissism: the <i>fusion</i> of mother and child prescriptively mirrors not the viewer's strength and ability to accept loss and separation (in what could be called a politically mature historical consciousness), but the <i>fantasy</i> of a subsuming reunion. The specularization enacted by the reciprocal gaze of mother and child itself res the imaginary reintegration into a mythic unity, satisfying the "historical need" Nietzsche located in "the loss of myth, of the mythical homeland, the mythical maternal womb."<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
But the other pole of the opposition, the memorials of nonrepresentability of the late 1970s and 1980s, is also open to critique. The assumption here is that what is to be remembered, what is to be gestured toward or evoked because it is not directly re-cognizable, is absence, death, mass destruction, the endpoint of the <i>Endl&#x000F6;sung</i>. One example of this concept is Ulrich R&#x000FC;ckriem's "Denkmal f&#x000FC;r die deportierten Hamburger Juden" : a massive gray square of granite, cut into seven pieces and reassembled so that the cuts are visible, and located before the Hamburg Logengeb&#x000E4;ude, the collection point from where in 1941/1942 thousands of Jews were deported. Another example is Sol LeWitt's "Black Form&#x02014;Dedicated to the Missing Jews" (1987 

<b></b>

M&#x000FC;nster, 1989 Hamburg-Altona), a huge black block, reminiscent of Richard Serra's "Tilted Arc"  in downtown Manhattan, that the artist calls a "black hole" or "perceptual barrier" meant metaphorically to denote the absent Jewish population.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  The problem is that such a strategy can all too easily fall into theological transcendence (the Holocaust is unique, unrepresentable) or, even worse, an aesthetic myth. Such "black holes," while they do not provide the convenient closure of universal reconciliation, do provide another kind of closure, that of historical causality and agency. The memorials mark a limit event that in its absolute otherness implies that the Holocaust was itself extraterritorial to its historical genesis. If the first strategy collapses the crimes into an undifferentiated universal mourning, the second strategy hypostatizes them into a sublime negativity; in both cases what is missing is the historical differentiation that, especially in the land of the perpetrators, might actually make a difference toward Auschwitz not happening again.
</p>

<p>
James E. Young introduced the term "counter-monument" (following Jochen and Esther Gerz's coinage "<i>Gegen-Denkmal</i>") specifically to designate the second kind of poetics in my enumeration: several recent memorials, by playing with absence and presence and the processual, ephemeral nature of remembrance, cast doubt upon the function and permanence of traditional monuments. "Instead of seeking to capture the memory of events," younger artists, who never experienced the events directly, "remember only their own relationship to events, the great gulf of time between themselves and the Holocaust" (<i>TM</i>, 27). According to Young, these artists consider it their task "to jar viewers from complacency, to challenge and denaturalize the viewers' assumptions . . . artists renegotiate the tenets of their memory work, whereby monuments are born resisting the very possibility of their birth" (<i>TM</i>, 28). Examples of such "counter-monuments" include Harburg's "Monument against Fascism" by Jochen Gerz and Esther Shalev-Gerz, a twelve-meter-high, one-meter-square pillar made of hollow aluminum and plated with a layer of soft lead. An inscription near its base reads in German, French, English, Russian, Hebrew, Arabic, and Turkish: "We invite the citizens of Harburg, and visitors to the town, to add their names here to ours. In doing so, we commit ourselves to remain vigilant. As more and more names cover this 12-meter-tall column, it will gradually be lowered into the ground. One day it will have disappeared completely, and the site of the Harburg monument against fascism will be empty. In the end, it is only we ourselves who can rise up against injustice" (<i>TM</i>, 30). Unveiled on 10 October 1986, the pillar was sunk eight times over the next seven years until on 8 October 1993, it disappeared, only its top remaining visible.
</p>

<p>
Another example of a "counter-monument" is Horst Hoheisel's "Negative-Form" Monument in Kassel. The original Aschrott-Brunnen (Aschrott Fountain) in City Hall Square was built in 1908 and funded by the Jewish entrepreneur and citizen of Kassel, Sigmund Aschrott. It was demolished by Nazi activists during the night of 8-9 April 1939. In 1943, two years after the deportations from Kassel had begun, the city filled in the fountain's basin with soil and planted flowers, and local citizens came to call it "Aschrott's grave." Rather than rebuild the fountain, Hoheisel's design called for a mock-up of the fountain to be inverted and buried under the original basin, writing: "I 

<b></b>

have designed the new fountain as a mirror image of the old one, sunk beneath the old place in order to rescue the history of this place as a wound and as an open question, to penetrate the consciousness of the Kassel citizens so that such things never happen again" (<i>TM</i>, 43). As part of the project Hoheisel had school children research the lives of individual Jewish citizens, write their life stories on paper, attach them to stones, and place these "memory-stones" before the Kassel train station as an admonitory memorial [<i>Mahnmal</i>]. This dimension of historical documentation accompanying a memorial leads into the third and final poetics of counter-monuments.
</p>

<p>
This third kind of poetics is exemplified in recent work by the Gerzs, who have continued and radicalized their counter-monument strategy in the admonitory "invisible" monument "2146 Stones&#x02014;Monument Against Racism" [<i>2146 Steine&#x02014;Mahnmal gegen Rassismus</i>] in Saarbr&#x000FC;cken, where Jochen Gerz was a guest professor. There he happened upon the cell in the basement of the city castle where the Gestapo had held their prisoners. He and his students wrote to sixty-six Jewish communities and collated a list of all the locations of Jewish cemeteries in Germany before 1933. They then removed paving stones from the path leading to the Saarbr&#x000FC;cken castle, etched the name of one cemetery on the <i>underside</i> of each stone, and replaced the stones. As the artist says, "When you cannot see something, then you are almost forced to talk about it."<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Yet the monument would, in adherence to its own concept, need to remain completely invisible. The monument was in fact "unveiled" on 23 May 1993. The "castle square" [<i>Schlo&#x000DF;platz</i>] was renamed "square of the invisible monument" [<i>Platz des unsichtbaren Mahnmals</i>], and politicians convened to unveil the new street sign. Two critical observations arise here. First, conceptually one could argue that the monument itself is superfluous, that the activity leading to its emplacement&#x02014;the research, the inscribing&#x02014;constitutes the only real memory-work possible, and that in that case the artwork as public memorial has negated itself in favor of remembrance in the form of historical research and documentation. The second point is, to what extent do these strict counter-monuments, in denying representation and/or narration altogether&#x02014;whether through a questionable mimeticism of Jewish traditions and motives such as the <i>Bildverbot</i> or in favor of the enumeration of names and places alone&#x02014;contribute to the historical oblivion against which they are ostensibly struggling?
</p>

<p>
Thus by remaining bound dialectically to what they try to negate, counter-monuments either efface their role as public art in favor of historical documentation alone or, in denying representation, communication, or specificity, they become themselves "black holes" and <i>renounce</i> the very "memory work" they aspire to generate. Finally, by thematizing the resistance or ephemerality of remembrance in their opposition to conventional, ever-present, and hence easily overlooked ("invisible" is Robert Musil's apt expression) monuments, these counter-monuments at best reflexively thematize the problem of memorials in Germany today.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>

I turn now to another kind of memorial that, I think, escapes the dialectic between remembrance and forgetting, rative representation and unrepresentability as I've expounded these oppositions above and that also eludes the entwinement of military and civil spheres, of national monument and military memorial that I've traced in the various incarnations of the Neue Wache. The Neue Wache's inscription reads "Den Opfern von Krieg und Gewaltherrschaft," "To the Victims of War and Tyranny," though the German "<i>Gewaltherrschaft</i>" (as opposed to the loan word "<i>Tyrannei</i>") more literally means rule or domination through force; it thus stands implicitly opposed to the state under the rule of law [<i>Rechtsstaat</i>]. Those who are vulnerable to <i>Gewaltherrschaft</i> are those who stand outside the <i>Rechtsstaat</i>, are deprived of legal rule and recognition as citizens. The difference between a <i>Rechtsstaat</i> and a <i>Gewaltherrschaft</i> is subtly enacted rather than representationally or narratively re-red (positively or negatively) in the memorial entitled "Places of Remembering in the Bavarian Quarter" in the central Sch&#x000F6;neberg district in Berlin.<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  Before World War II the neighborhood was colloquially known as "Jewish Switzerland," home to wealthy assimilated middle-class Jewry. After 1933 a succession of ordinances, including the Nuremburg racial laws, curtailed, confined, and eventually removed all rights of public access to health, transportation, recreation, the right to practice a profession, partake in the public life in any way whatsoever, finally the right to existence itself. More than 6,000 Jewish citizens were deported from the neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
In 1991 the Sch&#x000F6;neberg Arts Department formed a commission of historians, artists, and architects and held an open competition for a central "place of remembrance" for the district's central "Bavarian Square" to accompany a decentralized installation to "provoke" and "irritate" remembrance against the background of everyday life in the bourgeois neighborhood. The winning concept by the artists Renate Stih and Frieder Schnock eschews a central memorial altogether, opting instead for a documentation center about Jewish life during the Nazi years to be housed in the district town hall.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>  The decentralized installation is composed of eighty small, enameled signs that have been mounted at a height of three meters on lamp-posts around the neighborhood, facing passersby. The signs have the same dimensions and location as conventional municipal signs and advertisements. On one side there is a typographic citation of a legal ordinance regarding the Jews and the date the ordinance was passed, on the reverse side a brightly painted, almost cartoonlike picture thematically related to the cited ordinance. For instance, one may come across a bright image of a thermometer and then read on the reverse side: "Henceforward Jewish doctors are not allowed to practice. 25.7.1938"; or an image of a loaf of bread, and on the reverse: "Jews are allowed to go grocery shopping in Berlin only in the afternoon between four and five o'clock. 4.7.1940." One of the earliest citations reads: "All Jewish employees are dismissed from the civil service. 7.4.1933" with a picture of a rubber stamp, and the last: "Documents, which relate to anti-Jewish activities, are to be destroyed. 16.2.1945" with a picture of the filing folders still used in offices today (<a href="#7">. 17a</a>, <a href="#7">17b</a>). These last 

<b></b>

two signs are mounted virtually in the shadow of the Sch&#x000F6;neberg City Hall, while the law prescribing shopping times is mounted in front of a supermarket. There thus arises a complex interaction between text, image, location, and everyday practice to which I'll return presently.</p>

The relationship between colorful icon (often suggesting a child's pictorial vocabulary) and bureaucratic text is the first refraction; in many instances the relationship is further broken, often through irony. Thus the icon of a "welcome home" mat accompanies the text quoting an ordinance issued on the eve of the Berlin Olympic Games: "In order to avoid making a poor impression on foreign visitors, signs with extreme contents should be removed; signs such as 'Jews are not welcome here' [<i>'Juden sind hier unerw&#x000FC;nscht'</i>] will suffice. 29.1.1936"; the cited ordinance forbidding Jews to be members of singing groups is accompanied by an image of the notes to the hymn "Whomever God wants to show true favor He sends into the wide world" ["<i>Wem Gott will rechte Gunst erweisen, den schickt er in die weite Welt</i>"]; the image from the film <i>Der Berg ruft</i> is matched to the ordinance: "German film is recognized as one that is made in Germany by German citizens of German descent." Although the vast majority of signs cite such ordinances, a few quote reminiscences and reports. For example: "'Well the time has come, tomorrow I must leave and that of course hits me hard [ . . . ] I will write you . . . '&#x02014;Before the deportation, 16.1.1942" [reverse image: unaddressed envelope] stands before a post office. Two signs along a street of apartment buildings create a small narrative:

In several ways this memorial disintegrates the traditional aesthetic category of the unique and unified artwork. Firstly, of course, by its location outside of any institutionally defined aesthetic space, its decentralized dispersal within the material public sphere of anonymous information and command. Secondly, in several dimensions the memorial ruptures the "representational bond"&#x02014;the assumed affirmation between image or text (the former by resemblance, the latter by appellation) and referent by which an artwork creates a unified aesthetic difference; this rupture, however, does not content itself with merely thematizing the disjunction.<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  At the level of image the colorful icon, often suggesting a child's pictorial vocabulary, breaks the code of realistic resemblance to its referent; at the level of script, the text&#x02014;which does not denote nor name but rather <i>cites</i>&#x02014;breaks the code of realistic designation. At the level of representation the signs function virtually like a rebus: the bright icon evokes sheltered domesticity, the congenial workplace, familiar quotidian objects, the assurances of family and solidarity that the legal ordinances destroyed. And finally, at the level of utterance or mode, image, citation and location very often comment ironically on one another, as in some of the examples described above. 
</p>

<p>
Most importantly, however, in their mode of signification and seriality the signs&#x02014;being all similar to each other without resembling any original, that is, "artworks in the age of their technical reproducibility"&#x02014;no longer belong to the systemic order of representational or narrative resemblance/non-resemblance as do the dialectically related Holocaust memorials discussed earlier. The systemic order to which the signs belong is another: their authority, presence, production and reception are not correlative with their proximity to or representation of an original but rather lie in the communicational structures upon which they are parasitic. The signs merge into the quotidian life-world of the street because in their format and imagery, their <i>homomorphy</i>, they <i>mimic</i> conventional signs. This mimicry can firstly be interpreted as a survival strategy, in effect: by assuming the contact and codes of advertisements and municipal street signs, they merge into the quotidian life-world of the city and cannot be isolated into an autonomous memorial or ritual which can be as easily isolated as forgotten. Indeed, the signs happened to be put up in June 1993, just a week after the fatal arson attack in Solingen in which five Turkish women and children were killed. Citizens from the neighborhood complained to the police that Neo-nazis were getting "cheekier and 

<b></b>

cheekier," and representatives of Jewish organizations who had approved the project wondered whether the danger of misinterpretation was too great. It was thus decided to affix small "meta-signs" to the signs, explaining that they are part of a memorial:

But secondly, following Roger Caillois's observations on mimicry as sympathetic magic, we can consider the signs to be "a disturbance in the perception of space."<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  That is, the signs, to the extent that they mimete the anonymous discursive authority possessed by authentic municipal ordinances, also assimilate that authority and mode of address in a gestalt switch (Wittgenstein speaks of an "aspect change") that hovers between <i>use</i> and <i>mention</i>: in that momentary affective disorientation, perhaps what Benjamin might accept as a "moment of danger" in which an historical subject seizes hold of a memory, the addressee becomes interpellated into the coordinate system of authority and law which increasingly structured and eclipsed the permissible life of Jewish citizens during those years, in which they were, to speak with Paul Celan, "<i>auseinandergeschrieben</i>" [written asunder].<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  Each person is addressed as a <i>legal</i> (rather than cultural, ethnic, personal, etc.) subject of a <i>Rechtsstaat</i> precisely as the content of the sign documents the abrogation of that legal status in the advent of a <i>Gewaltherrschaft</i>. The homomorphy in contact, code, and implied addressee between past ordinance and present day memorial brings the specific cultural-political form of the period to material expression and possibly, hopefully, conscious reflection. That is, just as Benjamin demonstrated how in the Baroque the artistic form of allegory, irrespective of its particular contents, expressed the age's obsession with transitoriness [<i>Verg&#x000E4;nglichkeit</i>], so too this memorial brings to expression the political-communicational form specific to National Socialism&#x02014;and perhaps more generally the implicit political sovereignty that structures urban everyday life in mass society.<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Here one can perhaps claim a <i>tertium datur</i> between the alternatives Benjamin postulates in the polarity of ritual versus politics: the nineteenth-century individual viewer's attentive, even reverential contemplation of the unique and sequestered artwork versus the twentieth-century mass audience's collective absorption of the reproduced and public artwork in the mode of distraction [<i>Zerstreuung</i>] (film being the premier example).<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  Clearly the memorial's signs are parasitic on the rituals which structure everyday public life around the quarter&#x02014;commuting, shopping, etc.&#x02014;and are thus registered, taken in, used, one might say, in the mode of distraction; however, the shock produced by the signs, once they are in fact perceived, transforms the habitual user into a reflective viewer. Whereas Benjamin sees a revolutionary (communist) potential in the mass audience's self-correcting response to film, these signs recuperate the potentially liberal-democratic individual by inducing a critical, political 

<b></b>

awareness of the habitually used and thus largely invisible structures and institutions which make possible&#x02014;and conversely, which may make impossible&#x02014;everyday life in a modern society.
</p>

<p>
The Bavarian Quarter memorial thus undercuts the opposition between cultic ritual and progressive politics central to Benjamin's argument and underlying Pierre Nora's observations. Nora takes deritualization to be a characteristic of modernity because, I suspect, for him ritual is linked to a historically specific notion of the temporally and spatially sacrosanct, similar to both Benjamin's characterization of nineteenth-century aesthetic experience and to the experience war memorials like the incarnations of the Neue Wache incorporate into nationalist narratives. By contrast, the Bavarian Quarter memorial locates remembrance in the habitual rituals inherent in secularized capitalist public life, as practiced by the citizen as consumer and commuter. The signs' site and situational specificity creates a <i>stereoscopic</i> effect in which today's institutions and practices are momentarily <i>experienced</i> from the perspective of their past misuse during the Third Reich, when anti-democratic political goals where pursued under the cloak of legality, as Otto Kirchheimer among others has documented. A sign citing "Jewish lawyers and notaries in future may not engage in legal matters of the city of Berlin&#x02014;18.3.1933," mounted in front of the municipal courthouse, or "The baptism of Jews and the conversion to Christianity have no significance for the race question&#x02014;4.10.1936" placed before a Protestant church render these institutions, to again speak with Benjamin, monads laden with their own history (<a href="#8">. 18a</a>, <a href="#8">18b</a>). And sometimes it is a history that continues unbroken into the present. "Streets that bear the names of Jews, are renamed. Haberland Street, named after the founder of the Bavarian Quarter, is renamed as Treutlinger Street and N&#x000F6;rdlinger Street&#x02014;27.7.1938" stands today at the intersection of Treutlinger and N&#x000F6;rdlinger Streets (. <a href="#9">19a</a>, <a href="#9">19b<a//>). If everyday urban, public life is composed of secularized rituals against the background of legal order, one could perhaps call this memorial the bad faith of bureaucratic rationality.
</p>

<p>
We might characterize the experience of this memorial, which the artist Stih says is a "making visible of states of affairs," as a making legible of the implicit political sovereignty that structures the everyday life, the "second nature" of mass society.<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  The memorial preserves the history of that sovereignty for remembrance by withholding the closure afforded by rative conciliation or transcendent sublimity. Michael Rosen has suggested that Benjamin's concept of "non-sensible similarities" [<i>unsinnliche &#x000C4;hnlichkeiten</i>] be understood as the "tacit knowledge" by which the members of a specific society manifest "common structures" in a variety of contexts and exhibit a "shared, pre-discursive level of collective experience": " . . . despite not being able to express that knowledge in explicit or theoretical terms, the members of a culture share the capacity to 'map' one area of their experience into another one in such a way that they can recognize (though not articulate) its appropriateness."<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The juxtaposition between then and now of sign, site and above all practical situation perhaps provokes explicit awareness of the tacit knowledge by which citizens in Nazi Germany were addressed by, operated within and were removed from the political structures organizing their quotidian lives. This suggests that a successful memorial

does not recount a grand historical narrative or offer a re of closure to a contemplative viewer but rather places the addressee within a practical situation that can produce a recognition of the history embedded within the material structures and institutions by means of the non-sensible similarity between their past and present incarnations.
</p>

<p>
Finally, there is no possible confusion with the military tradition of conventional monuments and memorials, for this is emphatically a <i>civil memorial</i>, designed to induce the historical experience of a civil catastrophe by citing its material annunciation. The signs achieve their effect through their aesthetic askesis: in their form and decentered location they cite the <i>contact</i> (the physical channel of communication) and the <i>contextual content</i> (everyday life around the district) that was as operative then as now, and in their <i>code</i>&#x02014;their language&#x02014;they cite the juridical and municipal authority that also was as operative then as now. And each citation is a visitation, a haunting of today's juridical, municipal and private institutions by their former incarnation. If the present form of the Neue Wache seeks to entomb history&#x02014;including the history of its own previous incarnations&#x02014;within a maternal re of mythic sacrifice and redemption, that is, aesthetic semblance as myth (historical oblivion), the Sch&#x000F6;neberg memorial shows that institutions and discourses have ghosts. To draw on Kracauer, for Germany, now, that is not much, but perhaps that is precisely enough.

Since reunification, construction and the modernization of the municipal infrastructure in Berlin, especially in former East Berlin, has been proceeding at breakneck pace. As they reopened foundations and streets, construction workers on the average were finding one undetonated bomb a week. The United States government eventually provided Berlin with aerial bombing maps from World War II to aid in locating undetonated armaments. Each time a bomb is located, construction sites are blocked off, traffic is rerouted, whole apartment buildings are cleared, and the vintage ordnance is defused or exploded in controlled detonations. The past continues to send its own material memorials to posterity.

On the American example, cf.
