<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In this essay, I wish to reassess the juncture of cinema and modernism,
and I will do so by moving from the example of early Soviet cinema to
a seemingly less likely case, that of the classical Hollywood film. My
inquiry is inspired by two complementary sets of questions: one pertaining
to what cinema studies can contribute to our understanding of modernism
and modernity; the other aimed at whether and how the perspective of
modernist aesthetics may help us to elucidate and reframe the history
and theory of cinema. The juncture of cinema and modernism has been
explored in a number of ways, ranging from research on early cinema's
interrelations with the industrial-technological modernity of the late
nineteenth century, through an emphasis on the international art cinemas
of both interwar and new wave periods, to speculations on the cinema's
implication in the distinction between the modern and the postmodern.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 My focus here will be more squarely on mid-twentieth-century
 modernity, roughly from the 1920s through the 1950s--the modernity
 of mass production, mass consumption, and mass annihilation--and the
 contemporaneity of a particular kind of cinema, mainstream Hollywood,
 with what has variously been labelled "high" or "hegemonic modernism."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Whether or not one agrees with the postmodernist challenge to modernism
and modernity at large, it did open up a space for understanding modernism
as a much wider, more diverse phenomenon, eluding any single-logic
genealogy that

<B></B>

runs, say, from Cubism to Abstract Expressionism, from T. S. Eliot,
Ezra Pound, James Joyce, and Franz Kafka to Samuel Beckett and Alain
Robbe-Grillet, from Arnold Sch&ouml;nberg to Karlheinz Stockhausen. For
more than a decade now scholars have been dislodging that genealogy and
delineating alternative forms of modernism, both in the West and in other
parts of the world, that vary according to their social and geopolitical
locations, often conred along the axis of post/coloniality, and
according to the specific subcultural and indigenous traditions to which
they responded.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 In addition to opening up the modernist canon, these studies assume a
 notion of modernism that is "more than a repertory of artistic styles,"
 more than sets of ideas pursued by groups of artists and intellectuals.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Rather, modernism encompasses a whole range of cultural and artistic
 practices that register, respond to, and reflect upon processes
 of modernization and the experience of modernity, including a
 paradigmatic transformation of the conditions under which art is
 produced, transmitted, and consumed. In other words, just as modernist
 aesthetics are not reducible to the category of style, they tend to blur
 the boundaries of the institution of art in its traditional, eighteenth-
and nineteenth-century incarnation that turns on the ideal of aesthetic
 autonomy and the distinction of "high" vs. "low," of autonomous art
 vs. popular and mass culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Focusing on the nexus between modernism and modernity, then, also implies
a wider notion of the aesthetic, one that situates artistic practices
within a larger history and economy of sensory perception that Walter
Benjamin for one saw as the decisive battleground for the meaning and
fate of modernity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 While the spread of urban-industrial technology, the large-scale
 disembedding of social (and gender) relations, and the shift to mass
 consumption entailed processes of real destruction and loss, there
 also emerged new modes of organizing vision and sensory perception, a
 new relationship with "things," different forms of mimetic experience
 and expression, of affectivity, temporality, and reflexivity, a
 changing fabric of everyday life, sociability, and leisure. From this
 perspective, I take the study of modernist aesthetics to encompass
 cultural practices that both articulated and mediated the experience
 of modernity, such as the mass-produced and mass-consumed phenomena of
 fashion, design, advertising, architecture and urban environment, of
 photography, radio, and cinema. I am referring to this kind of modernism
 as "vernacular" (and avoiding the ideologically overdetermined term
 "popular") because the term vernacular combines the dimension of the
 quotidian, of everyday usage, with connotations of discourse, idiom,
 and dialect, with circulation, promiscuity, and translatability. In the
 latter sense, finally, this essay will also address the vexed issue of
 Americanism, the question of why and how an aesthetic idiom developed in
 one country could achieve transnational and global currency, and how this
 account might add to and modify our understanding of classical cinema.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I begin with an example that takes us back to one standard paradigm of
twentieth-century modernism: Soviet cinema and the context of Soviet
avant-garde aesthetics. At the 1996 festival of silent film in Pordenone,
the featured program was a selection of early Soviet films made between
1918-1924, that is, before the great era

<B></B>

of montage cinema, before the canonical works of Sergei Eisenstein,
V. I. Pudovkin, Dziga Vertov, and Alexandr Dovzhenko. The question that
guided the viewing of these films was, of course, how Russian cinema
got from the Old to the New within a rather short span of time; how the
sophisticated mise-en-scene cinema of the Czarist era, epitomized by the
work of Yevgenij Bauer, was displaced by Soviet montage aesthetics. Many
of the films shown confirmed what film historians, following Lev Kuleshov,
had vaguely assumed before: that this transformation was mediated, to a
significant degree, by the impact of Hollywood. American films began to
dominate Russian screens as early as 1915 and by 1916 had become the main
foreign import. Films made during the years following 1917, even as they
stage revolutionary plots for "agit" purposes, may display interesting
thematic continuities with Czarist cinema (in particular a strong critique
of patriarchy) and still contain amazing compositions in depth.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Increasingly, however, the mise-en-scene is broken down according to
 classical American principles of continuity editing, spatio-temporal
 coherence, and narrative causality. A famous case in point is Kuleshov's
 1918 directorial debut, <I>Engineer Prait's Project,</I> a film that
 employed Hollywood-style continuity guidelines in a polemical break
 with the slow pace of Russian "quality pictures."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 But the "American accent" in Soviet film--a faster cutting rate, closer
 framing, and the breakdown of diegetic space--was more pervasive
 and can be found as well, in varying degrees of consistency, in
 the work of other directors (Vladimir Gardin, Ceslav Sabinskij, Ivan
 Perestiani). Hyperbolically speaking, one might say that Russian cinema
 became Soviet cinema by going through a process of Americanization.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To be sure, Soviet montage aesthetics did not emerge fullblown from the
encounter with Hollywood-style continuity editing; it is unthinkable
without the new avant-garde movements in art and theater, without
Constructivism, Suprematism, Productivism, Futurism--unthinkable without a
politics of radical transformation. Nor was continuity editing perceived
as neutral, as simply the most "efficient" way of telling a story. It
was part and parcel of the complex of "Americanism" (or, as Kuleshov
referred to it, "Americanitis") that catalyzed debates on modernity and
modernist movements in Russia as it did in other countries.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 As elsewhere, the enthusiasm for things American, tempered by a
 critique of capitalism, took on a variety of meanings, forms, and
 functions. Discussing the impact of American on Soviet cinema, Yuri
 Tsivian distinguishes between two kinds of Americanism: one, stylistic
 borrowings of the classical kind described above ("American montage,"
 "American foreground"), and two, a fascination with the "lower genres,"
 with adventure serials, detective thrillers, and slapstick comedies that,
 Tsivian argues, were actually more influential during the transitional
 years. If the former kind of Americanism aspired to formal standards
 of narrative efficiency, coherence, and motivation, the latter was
 concerned with external appearance, the sensual, material surface of
 American films; their use of exterior locations; their focus on action
 and thrills, physical stunts and attractions; their tempo, directness,
 and flatness; their eccentricity and excess of situations over plot.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Tsivian analyzes the Americanism of the "lower" genres as an intellectual
fashion or taste. Discerning "something of a slumming mentality" in
Eisenstein's or FEKS' fascination with "serial queen" melodramas, he
situates the preference of Soviet filmmakers for "cinematic pulp fiction"
(Victor Shklovsky) in the context of the leftist avant-garde's attack
on high art, cultural pretensions, and western ideals of naturalism
("BON," 43).
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 What interests me in this account is less the intellectual and artistic
 intertext than the connection it suggests, <I>across</I> the distinction,
 between the two faces of American cinema: the classical norm, as an
 emergent form that was to dominate domestic as well as foreign markets
 for decades to come, and the seemingly nonclassical, or less classical,
 undercurrent of genres that thrive on something other than or, at the
 very least, oblique to the classical norm. What also interests me in
 the dynamics of Americanism and Soviet film is the way they urge us to
 reconsider the relationship between classical cinema and modernism, a
 relationship that within cinema studies has habitually been thought of
 as an opposition, as one of fundamentally incompatible registers.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The opposition between classicism and modernism has a venerable history
in literature, art, and philosophy, with classicism linked to the model
of tradition and modernism to the rhetoric of a break with precisely
that tradition.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 In that general sense, there would be no problem with importing this
 opposition into the field of cinema and film history, with classical
 cinema falling on the side of tradition and alternative film practices
 on the side of modernism. If, however, we consider the cinema as
 part of the historical formation of modernity, as a larger set of
 cultural and aesthetic, technological, economic, social, and political
 transformations, the opposition of classical cinema and modernism,
 the latter understood as a discourse articulating and responding to
 modernity, becomes a more complicated issue.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I am using "classical cinema" here as a technical term that has played
a crucial part in the formation of cinema studies as an academic
discipline. The term came to serve as a foundational concept in the
analysis of the dominant form of narrative cinema, epitomized by Hollywood
during the studio era. In that endeavor, "classical cinema" referred to
roughly the same thing whether you were doing semiotics, psychoanalytic
film theory, neoformalist poetics, or revisionist film history. This is
not to say that it <I>meant</I> the same thing, and just a brief glimpse
at its key moments will illustrate the transvaluations and disjunctures
of the term.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Not coincidentally, the reference to Hollywood products as "classical"
has a French pedigree. As early as 1926, Jean Renoir uses the phrase
"cinematic classicism" (in this case referring to Charlie Chaplin and
Ernst Lubitsch).
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 A more specific usage of the term occurs in Robert Brasillach and Maurice
 Bard&egrave;che's <I>Histoire de cin&eacute;ma,</I> in particular
 in the second edition of 1943, revised with a collaborationist bent,
 where the authors refer to the style evolved in American sound film of
 1933-1939 as the "classicism of the 'talkie.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 After the Occupation, critics, notably Andr&eacute; Bazin, began to speak
 of Hollywood filmmaking as "a classical art." By the 1950s, Bazin would
 celebrate John Ford's <I>Stagecoach</I>  as "the ideal example
 of the maturity of a style brought to classic perfection," comparing
 the film to "a wheel,

<B></B>

so perfectly made that it remains in equilibrium on its axis in any
position."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 This classical quality of American film, to quote Bazin's well-known
 statement, is due not to individual talent but to "the genius of the
 system, the richness of its ever-vigorous tradition, and its fertility
 when it comes into contact with new elements."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The first major transvaluation of the concept of classical cinema
came with post-1968 film theory, in the all-round critique of ideology
directed against the very system celebrated by Bazin. In this critique,
formulated along Althusserian and Lacanian lines and from marxist and
later feminist positions, classical Hollywood cinema was analyzed as a
mode of representation that masks the process and fact of production,
turns discourse into diegesis, history into story and myth; as an
apparatus that sutures the subject in an illusory coherence and identity;
and as a system of stylistic strategies that weld pleasure and meaning
to reproduce dominant social and sexual hierarchies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 The notion of classical cinema elaborated in the pages of <I>Cahiers du
 Cin&eacute;ma,</I> <I>Cin&eacute;thique,</I> <I>Screen,</I> <I>Camera
 Obscura</I> and elsewhere was less indebted to a neoclassicist ideal,
 as it still was for Bazin and Rohmer, than to the writings of Roland
 Barthes, in particular <I>S/Z</I> , which attached the label
 of a "classic," "readerly," ostensibly transparent text to the
 nineteenth-century realist novel.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Another turn in the conception of classical cinema entails the rejection
of any evaluative usage of the term, whether celebratory or critical,
in favor of a more descriptive, presumably value-free and scientifically
valid account. This project has found its most comprehensive realization
to date in David Bordwell, Janet Staiger, and Kristin Thompson's
monumental and impressive study, <I>The Classical Hollywood Cinema: Film
Style and Mode of Production to 1960</I> . The authors conceive
of classical cinema as an integral, coherent system, a system that
interrelates a specific mode of production (based on Fordist principles
of industrial organization) and a set of interdependent stylistic norms
that were elaborated by 1917 and remained more or less in place until
about 1960. The underlying notion of classical film style, rooted in
neoformalist poetics and cognitive psychology, overlaps in part with
the account of the classical paradigm in 1970s film theory, particularly
with regard to principles of narrative dominance, linear and unobtrusive
narration centering on the psychology and agency of individual characters,
and continuity editing. But where psychoanalytic-semiotic theorists
pinpoint unconscious mechanisms of identification and the ideological
effects of "realism," Bordwell and Thompson stress thorough motivation
and coherence of causality, space, and time; clarity and redundancy in
guiding the viewer's mental operations; formal patterns of repetition
and variation, rhyming, balance, and symmetry; and overall compositional
unity and closure.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 In Bordwell's formulation, "the principles which Hollywood claims as its
 own rely on notions of decorum, proportion, formal harmony, respect for
 tradition, mimesis, self-effacing craftsmanship, and cool control of the
 perceiver's response--canons which critics in any medium usually call
 'classical'" (<I>CHC,</I> 3-4).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such a definition is not just generally "classical" but more specifically
recalls neoclassicist standards, from seventeenth-century neo-Aristotelian
theories of drama to eighteenth-century ideals in music, architecture,
and aesthetic theory.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 (I do not

<B></B>

wish to equate eighteenth-century aesthetics at large with
the neoclassicist tradition, nor with an ahistorical reduction to
neoformalist principles; the eighteenth century was at least as much
concerned with affect and effect, with theatricality and sensation,
passion and sentiment, as with the balance of form and function.) As
in literary and aesthetic antecedents that invoke classical antiquity
as a model--recall Stendhal's definition of classicism as a style that
"gives the greatest possible pleasure to an audience's ancestors"
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
--the temporal dynamics of the term classical as applied to the cinema
is retrospective; the emphasis is on tradition and continuity rather
than newness as difference, disruption, and change.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I can see a certain revisionist pleasure in asserting the power and
persistence of classical standards in the face of a popular image
of Hollywood as anything but decorous, harmonious, traditional, and
cool. But how does this help us account for the appeal of films as
diverse as <I>Lonesome,</I> <I>Liberty,</I> <I>Freaks,</I> <I>Gold
Diggers of 1933,</I> <I>Stella Dallas,</I> <I>Fallen Angel,</I> <I>Kiss
Me Deadly,</I> <I>Bigger Than Life,</I> <I>Rock-a-Bye Baby</I> (add your
own examples)? And even if we succeeded in showing these films to be
constructed on classical principles--which I'm sure can be done--what
have we demonstrated? To repeat Rick Altman's question in an essay that
challenges Bordwell, Thompson, and Staiger's model: "How classical was
classical narrative?"
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Attempts to answer that rhetorical question have focused on what is
 left out, marginalized or repressed, in the totalizing account of
 classical cinema--in particular, the strong substratum of theatrical
 melodrama with its uses of spectacle and coincidence but also genres
 like comedy, horror, and pornography that involve the viewer's body
 and sensory-affective responses in ways that may not exactly conform
 to classical ideals.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 Also minimized is the role of genre in general, specifically the
 affective-aesthetic division of labor among genres in structuring
 the consumption of Hollywood films. An even lesser role is granted to
 stars and stardom, which cannot be reduced to the narrative function
 of character and, like genre but even more so, involve the spheres
 of distribution, exhibition practices, and reception. <I>The Classical
 Hollywood Cinema</I> explicitly and, it should be said, with self-imposed
 consistency, brackets the history of reception and film culture--along
 with the cinema's interrelations with American culture at large.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is not my intention to contest the achievement of Bordwell, Staiger,
and Thompson's work; the book does illuminate crucial aspects of how
Hollywood cinema works and goes a long way toward accounting for the
stability and persistence of this particular cultural form. My interest
is rather in two questions that the book does <I>not</I> address, or
addresses only to close off. One question pertains to the historicity of
classical cinema, in particular its contemporaneity with twentieth-century
modernisms and modern culture; the other question is to what extent
and how the concept can be used to account for Hollywood's worldwide
hegemony. To begin with, I am interested in the anachronism involved in
asserting the priority of stylistic principles modelled on seventeenth-
and eighteenth-century neoclassicism. We are dealing with a cultural
formation that was, after all, perceived as the incarnation of <I>the
modern,</I> an aesthetic medium up-to-date with Fordist-Taylorist methods
of industrial

<B></B>

production and mass consumption, with drastic changes in social, sexual,
and gender relations, in the material fabric of everyday life, in the
organization of sensory perception and experience. For contemporaries,
Hollywood at its presumably most classical red as the very symbol
of contemporaneity, the present, modern times: "this our period," as
Gertrude Stein famously put it, "was undoubtedly the period of the cinema
and series production."
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 And it held that appeal not only for avant-garde artists and
 intellectuals in the United States and the modernizing capitals of the
 world (Berlin, Paris, Moscow, Shanghai, Tokyo, Sao Paulo, Sydney, Bombay)
 but also for emerging mass publics both at home and abroad. Whatever
 the economic and ideological conditions of its hegemony--and I wish by
 no means to discount them--classical Hollywood cinema could be imagined
 as a cultural practice on a par with the experience of modernity, as
 an industrially-produced, mass-based, vernacular modernism.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In cinema studies, the juncture of the classical and the modern has,
for the most part, been written as a bifurcated history. The critique of
classical cinema in 1970s film theory took over a structuralist legacy
of binarisms, such as Barthes's opposition between the "readerly"
and "writerly," which translated into the binary conception of film
practice as either "classical-idealist," that is, ideological, or
"modernist-materialist," that is, self-reflexive and progressive. This
is particularly the case for the theory and practice of "counter cinema"
that David Rodowick has dubbed "political modernism"--from Jean-Luc Godard
and Peter Gidal through Noel Burch, Peter Wollen, Stephen Heath, Laura
Mulvey and others--that owes much to the revival or belated reception
of the 1920s and 1930s leftist avant-garde, notably Bertolt Brecht.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Moreover, the polarization of classical cinema and modernism seemed
 sufficiently warranted by skepticism vis-&agrave;-vis Hollywood's
 self-promotion as "international modern," considering how much the
 celebration of American cinema's contemporaneity, youth, vitality,
 and directness was part of the industry's own mythology deployed to
 legitimate cutthroat business practices and the relentless expansion
 of economic power worldwide.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While Bordwell and Thompson's neoformalist approach is to some extent
indebted to the political-modernist tradition, <I>The Classical Hollywood
Cinema</I> recasts the binarism of classicism and modernism in two ways.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 At the level of industrial organization, the modernity of Hollywood's
 mode of production (Fordism) is subsumed under the goal of maintaining
 the stability of the system as a whole; thus major technological and
 economic changes, such as the transition to sound, are discussed in terms
 of a search for "functional equivalents" by which the institution ensures
 the overall continuity of the paradigm (<I>CHC,</I> 304). In a similar
 vein, any stylistic deviations of the modernist kind <I>within</I>
 classical cinema--whether imports from European avant-garde and art
 films, native films noir, or work of idiosyncratic auteurs like Orson
 Welles, Alfred Hitchcock, and Otto Preminger--are cited as proof of the
 system's amazing appropriative flexibility: "So powerful is the classical
 paradigm that it regulates what may violate it" (<I>CHC,</I> 81).
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To be sure, there is ample precedent outside film history for the
assimilation of the modern to classical or neoclassicist standards;
after all, art historians speak of "classical modernism" (Picasso, de
Chirico, Leger, Picabia) and there were related tendencies in music
(Reger, Stravinsky, Poulenc, de Faya, to name just a few).
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 In modern architecture (LeCorbusier, Gropius, the Bauhaus), we
 can see the wedding of machine aesthetics to a notion of presumably
 natural functions, and in literary modernism, we have self-proclaimed
 neoclassicists such as T. E. Hulme, Wyndham Lewis, Ernst J&uuml;nger,
 and Jean Cocteau. In the genealogy of film theory, one of the founding
 manifestos of classical cinema is Hugo M&uuml;nsterberg's <I>The
 Psychology of the Photoplay</I> , a treatise in neo-Kantian
 aesthetics applied to the cinema. Its author was actually better known
 for books on psychology and industrial efficiency that became standard
 works for modern advertising and management. Yet, these examples should
 be all the more reason for the historian to step back and consider the
 implications of these junctures that reveal themselves as increasingly
 less disjunctive with the passing of modernity, the disintegration of
 hegemonic or high modernism, and the emergence of alternative modernisms
 from the perspective of postmodernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A key problem seems to lie in the very concept of the "classical"--as
a historical category that implies the transcendence of mere
historicity, as a hegemonic form that claims transcultural appeal and
universality. Already in its seventeenth-
and eighteenth-century usages,
the neoclassicist recourse to tradition, in whatever way it may misread or
invent a prior original, does not take us through history, but instead to
a transhistorical ideal, a timeless sense of beauty, proportion, harmony,
and balance derived from <I>nature.</I> It is no coincidence that the
neoformalist account of classical cinema is linked and elaborated in
Bordwell's work to the project of grounding film studies in the framework
of cognitive psychology.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 <I>The Classical Hollywood Cinema</I> offers an impressive account
 of a particular historical formation of the institution of American
 cinema, tracking its emergence in terms of the evolution of film style
 (Thompson) and mode of production (Staiger). But once "the system" is in
 place (from about 1917 on), its ingenuity and stability are attributed
 to the optimal engagement of <I>mental</I> structures and perceptual
 capacities that are, in Bordwell's words, "biologically hard-wired"
 and have been so for tens of thousands of years.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Classical narration ultimately amounts to a method of optimally guiding
 the viewer's attention and maximizing his or her response by way of
 more intricate plots and emotional tensions. The attempt to account
 for the efficacy of classical stylistic principles with recourse to
 cognitive psychology coincides with the effort to expand the reign of
 classical objectives to types of film practice outside Hollywood that
 had hitherto been perceived as alternative (most recently in Bordwell's
 work on Feuillade and other European traditions of staging-in-depth)
 as well as beyond the historical period demarcated in the book (that
 is, up to 1960).
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
How can we restore historical specificity to the concept of classical
Hollywood cinema? How can we make the anachronistic tension in the
combination of neoclassicist style and Fordist mass culture productive
for an understanding of both classical

<B></B>

Hollywood cinema and mass-mediated modernity? How do we distinguish,
within the category of the classical, between natural norm, canonical
cultural form, and a rhetorical strategy that perhaps enabled the
articulation of something radically new and different under the guise of
a continuity with tradition? Can there be an account of classicality that
does not unwittingly reproduce, at the level of academic discourse, the
universalist norms mobilized not least for purposes of profit, expansion,
and ideological containment? Or wouldn't we do better to abandon the
concept of classical cinema altogether and instead, as Philip Rosen and
others have opted to do, use the more neutral term "mainstream cinema"?
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
For one thing, I don't think that the term "mainstream" is necessarily
clearer, let alone neutral or innocent; in addition to the connotation of
a quasi-natural flow, it suggests a homogeneity that locates side streams
and countercurrents on the outside or margins rather than addressing
the ways in which they at once become part of the institution and blur
its boundaries. For another, I would argue that, for the time being,
classical cinema is still a more precise term because it names a regime of
productivity and intelligibility that is both historically and culturally
specific, much as it gets passed off as timeless and natural (and the
efforts to do so are part of its history). In that sense, however, I
take the term to refer less to a system of functionally interrelated

From this perspective, one might argue that it would be more appropriate
to consider classical Hollywood cinema within the framework of "American
national cinema." Such a reframing would allow us, among other things,
to include independent film practices outside and against the pull of
Hollywood, such as "race films," regional, subcultural, and avant-garde
film practices. While this strategy is important, especially for teaching
American cinema, the issue of Hollywood's role in defining and negotiating
American nationality strikes me as more complicated. If we wish to
"provincialize Hollywood," to invoke Dipesh Chakrabarty's injunction
to "provincialize" European accounts of modernity, it is not enough to
consider American cinema on a par with any other national cinema--inasmuch
as that very category in many cases describes defensive formations shaped
in competition with and resistance to Hollywood products.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 In other words, the issue of classicality is bound up with the question
 of what constituted the hegemony of American movies worldwide and what
 assured them the historic impact they had, for better or for worse,
 within a wide range of different local contexts and diverse national
 cinemas.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The question of what constitutes Hollywood's power on a global scale
returns us to the phenomenon of Americanism discussed earlier in
connection with Soviet film. I am concerned with Americanism here less
as a question of exceptionalism, consensus ideology, or crude economic
power, though none of these aspects can be ignored, than as a practice
of cultural circulation and hegemony. Victoria de Grazia

<B></B>

has argued that Americanism still awaits analysis, beyond the polarized
labels of, respectively, cultural imperialism and a worldwide spreading
of the American Dream, as "the historical process by which the American
experience was transformed into a universal model of business society
based on advanced technology and promising formal equality and unlimited
mass consumption."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 However ideological these promises may, or may not, turn out to be,
 de Grazia observes that, unlike earlier imperial practices of colonial
 dumping, American cultural exports "were designed to go as far as the
 market would take them, starting at home." In other words, "cultural
 exports shared the basic features of American mass culture, intending
 by that term not only the cultural artifacts and associated forms,
 but also the civic values and social relations of the first capitalist
 mass society."
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Regarding classical cinema, one could take this argument to suggest that
the hegemonic mechanisms by which Hollywood succeeded in amalgamating
a diversity of competing traditions, discourses, and interests on
the <I>domestic</I> level may have accounted for at least some of the
generalized appeal and robustness of Hollywood products <I>abroad</I>
(a success in which the diasporic, relatively cosmopolitan profile of the
Hollywood community no doubt played a part as well). In other words, by
forging a mass market out of an ethnically and culturally heterogeneous
society, if often at the expense of racial others, American classical
cinema had developed an idiom, or idioms, that travelled more easily
than its national-popular rivals. I do not wish to resuscitate the myth
of film as a new "universal language" whose early promoters included
D. W. Griffith and Carl Laemmle, founder of the Universal Film Company,
nor do I mean to gloss over the business practices by which the American
film industry secured the dominance of its products on foreign markets,
in particular through control of distribution and exhibition venues.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 But I do think that, whether we like it or not, American movies of the
 classical period offered something like the first global vernacular. If
 this vernacular had a transnational and translatable resonance, it was
 not just because of its optimal mobilization of biologically hardwired
 structures and universal narrative templates but, more important,
 because it played a key role in mediating competing cultural discourses
 on modernity and modernization, because it articulated, multiplied,
 and globalized a particular historical experience.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If classical Hollywood cinema succeeded as an international modernist
idiom on a mass basis, it did so not because of its presumably universal
narrative form but because it meant different things to different people
and publics, both at home and abroad. We must not forget that these
films, along with other mass-cultural exports, were consumed in locally
quite specific, and unequally developed, contexts and conditions of
<I>reception;</I> that they not only had a levelling impact on indigenous
cultures but also challenged prevailing social and sexual arrangements
and advanced new possibilities of social identity and cultural styles;
and that the films were also changed in that process. Many films
were literally changed, both for particular export markets (e.g., the
conversion of American happy endings into tragic endings for Russian
release) and by censorship, marketing, and programming practices in
the countries

<B></B>

in which they were distributed, not to mention practices of dubbing
and subtitling.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 As systematic as the effort to conquer foreign markets undoubtedly
 was, the actual reception of Hollywood films was likely a much more
 haphazard and eclectic process depending on a variety of factors.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 How were the films programmed in the context of local film cultures,
 in particular conventions of exhibition and reception? Which genres
 were preferred in which places (for instance, slapstick in European and
 African countries, musical and historical costume dramas in India), and
 how were American genres dissolved and assimilated into different generic
 traditions, different concepts of genre? And how did American imports
 re within the public horizon of reception that might have included
 both indigenous products and films from other foreign countries? To write
 the international history of classical American cinema, therefore, is a
 matter of tracing not just its mechanisms of standardization and hegemony
 but also the diversity of ways in which this cinema was translated and
 reconred in both local and translocal contexts of reception.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Americanism, notwithstanding Antonio Gramsci (as well as recent critiques
of Gramsci and left Fordism), cannot simply be reduced to a regime of
mechanized production, an ideological veneer for discipline, abstraction,
reification, for new hierarchies and routes of power. Nor can it be
reduced to the machine aesthetics of intellectual and high modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 We cannot understand the appeal of Americanism unless we take seriously
 the promises of mass consumption and the dreams of a mass culture often
 in excess of and in conflict with the regime of production that spawned
 that mass culture (a phenomenon that has been dubbed "Americanization
 from below").
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 In other words, we have to understand the material, sensory conditions
 under which American mass culture, including Hollywood, was received and
 could have functioned as a powerful matrix for modernity's liberatory
 impulses--its moments of abundance, play, and radical possibility, its
 glimpses of collectivity and gender equality (the latter signalled by
 its opponents' excoriation of Americanism as a "new matriarchy").
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The juncture of classical cinema and modernity reminds us, finally, that
the cinema was not only part and symptom of modernity's experience and
perception of crisis and upheaval; it was also, most importantly, the
single most inclusive cultural horizon in which the traumatic effects
of modernity were reflected, rejected or disavowed, transmuted or
negotiated. That the cinema was capable of a reflexive relation with
modernity and modernization was registered by contemporaries early on,
and I read Benjamin's and Siegfried Kracauer's writings of the 1920s
and 1930s as, among other things, an effort to theorize this relation
as a new mode of reflexivity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 Neither simply a medium for realistic representation (in the sense
 of marxist notions of reflection or <I>Widerspiegelung</I>), nor
 particularly concerned with formalist self-reflexivity, commercial cinema
 appeared to realize Johann Gottlieb Fichte's troping of reflection as
 "seeing with an added eye" in an almost literal sense, and it did so
 not just on the level of individual, philosophical cognition but on a
 mass scale.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 I am also drawing on more recent sociological debates on "reflexive
 modernization" (Ulrich

<B></B>

Beck, Anthony Giddens, Scott Lash), a concept deployed to distinguish
the risk-conscious phase of current post-
or second modernity
from a presumably more single-minded, orthodox, and simple first
modernity. However, I would argue (although I cannot do so in detail here)
that modernization inevitably provokes the need for reflexivity and that,
if sociologists considered the cinema in aesthetic and sensorial terms
rather than as just another medium of information and communication,
they would find ample evidence in both American and other cinemas of
the interwar period of an at once modernist and vernacular reflexivity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This dimension of reflexivity is key to the claim that the cinema not
only represented a specifically modern type of public sphere, the public
here understood as a "social horizon of experience," but also that this
new mass public could have functioned as a discursive form in which
individual experience could be articulated and find recognition by both
subjects and others, including strangers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 Kracauer, in his more utopian moments, understood the cinema as an
 alternative public sphere--alternative to both bourgeois institutions of
 art, education, and culture, and the traditional arenas of politics--an
 imaginative horizon in which, however compromised by its capitalist
 foundations, something like an actual democratization of culture seemed
 to be taking shape, in his words, a "self-representation of the masses
 subject to the process of mechanization."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 The cinema suggested this possibility not only because it attracted and
 made visible to itself and society an emerging, heterogeneous mass public
 ignored and despised by dominant culture. The new medium also offered
 an alternative because it engaged the contradictions of modernity
 at the level of the senses, the level at which the impact of modern
 technology on human experience was most palpable and irreversible. In
 other words, the cinema not only traded in the mass production of the
 senses but also provided an aesthetic horizon for the experience of
 industrial mass society.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
While Kracauer's observations were based on moviegoing in Weimar
Germany, he attributed this sensory reflexivity more often than not to
American film, in particular slapstick comedy with its well-choreographed
orgies of demolition and clashes between people and things. The logic he
discerned in slapstick films pointed up a disjuncture within Fordist mass
culture, the possibility of an anarchic supplement generated on the same
principles: "One has to hand this to the Americans: with slapstick films
they have created a form that offers a counterweight to their reality. If
in that reality they subject the world to an often unbearable discipline,
the film in turn dismantles this self-imposed order quite forcefully."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 The reflexive potential of slapstick comedy can be, and has been,
 argued on a number of counts, at the levels of plot, performance,
 and mise-en-scene, and depending on the particular inflection of the
 genre. In addition to articulating and playing games with the violence
 of technological regimes, mechanization and clock time, slapstick
 films also specialized in deflating the terror of consumption, of a
 new culture of status and distinction.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 Likewise, the genre was a vital site for engaging the conflicts and
 pressures of a multiethnic society (think of the many Jewish performers
 who thematized the discrepancies

<B></B>

 between diasporic identity and upward mobility, from Larry Semon through
 Max Davidson and George Sydney). And, not least, slapstick comedy allowed
 for a playful and physical expression of anxieties over changed gender
 roles and new forms of sexuality and intimacy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But what about other genres? And what about popular narrative films
that conform more closely to classical norms? Once we begin looking at
Hollywood films as both a provincial response to modernization and a
vernacular for different, diverse, yet also comparable experiences,
we may find that genres such as the musical, horror, or melodrama
may offer just as much reflexive potential as slapstick comedy, with
appeals specific to those genres and specific resonances in different
contexts of reception. This is to suggest that reflexivity can take
different forms and different affective directions, both in individual
films and directorial oeuvres and in the aesthetic division of labor
among Hollywood genres, and that reflexivity does not always have to
be critical or unequivocal. On the contrary, the reflexive dimension of
these films may consist precisely in the ways in which they allow their
viewers to confront the constitutive ambivalence of modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The reflexive dimension of Hollywood films in relation to modernity may
take cognitive, discursive, and narrativized forms, but it is crucially
anchored in sensory experience and sensational affect, in processes of
mimetic identification that are more often than not partial and excessive
in relation to narrative comprehension. Benjamin, writing about the
elimination of distance in the new perceptual regimes of advertising
and cinema, sees in the giant billboards that present things in new
proportions and colors a backdrop for a "sentimentality . . . restored to
health and liberated in American style," just as in the cinema "people
whom nothing moves or touches any longer learn to cry again."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 The reason slapstick comedy hit home and flourished worldwide was not
 critical reason but the films' propulsion of their viewers' bodies into
 laughter. And adventure serials succeeded because they conveyed a new
 immediacy, energy, and sexual economy, not only in Soviet Russia and
 not only among avant-garde intellectuals. Again and again, writings on
 the American cinema of the interwar period stress the new physicality,
 the exterior surface or "outer skin" of things (Antonin Artaud), the
 material presence of the quotidian, as Louis Aragon put it, "really
 common objects, everything that celebrates life, not some artificial
 convention that excludes corned beef and tins of polish."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 I take such statements to suggest that the reflexive, modernist dimension
 of American cinema does not necessarily require that we demonstrate
 a cognitive, compensatory, or therapeutic function in relation to
 the experience of modernity but that, in a very basic sense, even
 the most ordinary commercial films were involved in producing a new
 sensory culture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Hollywood did not just circulate images and sounds; it produced and
globalized a new sensorium; it constituted, or tried to constitute, new
subjectivities and subjects. The mass appeal of these films resided as
much in their ability to engage viewers at the narrative-cognitive level
or in their providing models of identification for being modern as it
did in the register of what Benjamin troped as the "optical unconscious."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>

<B></B>

It was not just <I>what</I> these films showed, what they brought into
optical consciousness, as it were, but the way they opened up hitherto
unperceived modes of sensory perception and experience, their ability
to suggest a different organization of the daily world. Whether this
new visuality took the shape of dreams or of nightmares, it marked an
aesthetic mode that was decidedly not classical--at least not if we
literalize that term and reduce it to neoclassicist formal and stylistic
principles. Yet, if we understand the classical in American cinema as a
metaphor of a global sensory vernacular rather than a universal narrative
idiom, then it might be possible to imagine the two Americanisms operating
in the development of Soviet cinema--the modernist fascination with the
"low," sensational, attractionist genres and the classicist ideal of
formal and narrative efficiency--as two vectors of the same phenomenon,
both contributing to the hegemony of Hollywood film. This may well
be a fantasy: the fantasy of a cinema that could help its viewers
negotiate the tension between reification and the aesthetic, strongly
understood, the possibilities, anxieties, and costs of an expanded
sensory and experiential horizon--the fantasy, in other words, of a
mass-mediated public sphere capable of responding to modernity and its
failed promises. Now that postmodern media culture is busy recycling
the ruins of both classical cinema and modernity, we may be in a better
position to see the residues of a dreamworld of mass culture that is no
longer ours--and yet to some extent still is.

Peter B&uuml;rger, following Adorno, asserts that the very category of
"style" is rendered problematic by the advanced commodification of art
in the twentieth century and considers the refusal to develop a coherent
style (as in dada and surrealism) a salient feature of avant-gardist,
as distinct from modernist, aesthetics; see B&uuml;rger, <I>Theory
of the Avant-Garde,</I> trans. Michael Shaw (Minneapolis: University
of Minnesota Press, 1984), esp. ch. 2, "The Historicity of Aesthetic
Categories." The opening up of both modernist and avant-garde canons,
however, shows a great overlap between the two, just as the effort on the

Raymond Bellour who stresses the formal and stylistic principles at
work in classical cinema (patterns of repetition-resolution, rhyming,
symmetry, redundancy, interlacing of micro-

classical films produce their conscious and unconscious meanings and

In <I>The Classical Hollywood Cinema,</I> "realism" is equated with
verisimilitude and, as such, res as one of four types of narrative
motivation--compositional, realistic, intertextual, artistic (<I>CHC,</I>
19). While this qualification seems appropriate vis-&agrave;-vis the
diversity of Hollywood genres (think of the musical, for instance),
it does not make the issue of cinematic "realism" go away, whether as
rhetorical claim, ideological fiction, or aesthetic possibility. In
this context, see Christine Gledhill's interesting attempt to understand
"realism" as American cinema's way of facilitating the "modernization of
melodrama" (Gledhill, "Between Melodrama and Realism: Anthony Asquith's
<I>Underground</I> and King Vidor's <I>The Crowd,</I>" in <I>Classical

This is not to say that the cinema was unique or original in forging a
modern type of publicness. It was part of, and borrowed from, a whole
array of institutions--department stores, world fairs, tourism, amusement
parks, vaudeville, etc.--that involved new regimes of sensory perception
and new forms of sociability. At the same time, the cinema represented,
multiplied, and deterritorialized these new experiential regimes. My
understanding of the public sphere as a general, social "horizon of
experience" is indebted to Oskar Negt and Alexander Kluge, <I>The
