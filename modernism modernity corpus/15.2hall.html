<b>Abstract</b>
<p>In November 1919, the Weimar Republic was a year old, yet no domestic consensus seemed in sight. The international military conflict had transformed into a war at home, where assassinations, street ting, and protests disrupted public order. Through all this, law enforcement agencies in Berlin worked alongside other civic and private institutions to establish a sense of day-to-day normalcy and security. In the case discussed in this essay, a fictional manhunt known as "Augen auf!" or "Open Your Eyes!" sponsored by the <i>Berliner Morgenpost</i>, representatives of the newly reformed local criminal police helped to set the tone of the popular discourse on civility and sociability in the nascent democracy.</p>

Sensational Circumstances? 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>In November 1919, the Weimar Republic was already a year old, yet, with the exact terms of the Versailles Treaty still under consideration, no true domestic consensus seemed in sight. The international dispute had transformed into a war at home, where political assassinations, violent clashes on the streets, and partisan protests disrupted any sense of public order. In this atmosphere of upheaval, law enforcement had begun working alongside private and civic institutions such as the press, small and large businesses, and entertainment venues to mollify people's concerns in an effort to establish some sense of normalcy and security in everyday life. At the same time, these institutions made the most of the sensational value of current events to entice and engage the public as readers, audiences, consumers, and concerned and affected citizens.  </p>

<p>These conditions were particularly extreme in Berlin. Berlin's newspapers addressed their audiences with both hard and soft news, reminding readers of the common investment they held in the outcome of national debates, while simultaneously keeping their minds occupied with such local aspects of daily life as weather and social events. One such example of this mixture of news and features appeared in the <i>Berliner Morgenpost </i>(one of the city's most popular papers) on the morning of Wednesday, 12 November, 1919. Its regular column "Berlin's Latest" featured such brief and seemingly disconnected items as "Out With the Prisoners of War!" and "Where Is This Early Snow Coming From?" The column also informed readers of a city-wide manhunt, announcing:

<b></b>

 </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p><i>Berliner Morgenpost</i> Contest<b>.</b> Today our readers will see a poster displaying a picture of a wanted man hanging on advertising pillars. A 2,000 mark reward has been offered for the person who arrests him tomorrow, Thursday. Readers will find all the relevant details in tomorrow's edition of the <i>Berliner Morgenpost</i>.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">By withholding the details for twenty-four hours, the paper's editors strategically left their readers curious. Why was this man wanted?—was he a counterfeiter, a burglar, a pickpocket, a political dissident, or even a murderer? How could Berlin's citizens protect themselves in the meantime if he was in fact dangerous? What was the connection between this case and the morning paper offering the reward? Were the police behind this criminal pursuit? </p>

<p>The answers to some of these questions appeared the next day under an oversized headline declaring, "2,000 Mark Reward. <i>Berliner Morgenpost</i> Contest. Open Your Eyes!"<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Here, readers discovered that the manhunt did not involve an actual criminal. The editors of the morning paper were in fact fabricating the pursuit and staging it with real-life props such as wanted posters, a mug shot, and press reports. The role of the man at large was to be played by an anonymous member of the newspaper's editorial staff whose photo would be plastered throughout the city. Weeks later the wanted man was revealed to be Egon Jacobsohn, a popular reporter on urban affairs, especially crime news and film culture. This would-be fugitive was to take the streets from eight in the morning until eight in the evening, during which time the city's residents were instructed to locate, identify, and apprehend him. The citizen's arrest could be performed by calling out the words "<i>Augen auf!</i>" ("<i>Open your eyes!</i>"), whereupon the journalist would willingly turn himself over to his "captor," who could then take steps to claim the cash prize from the offices of the Ullstein publishing house responsible for the <i>Morgenpost</i>.  </p>

<p>The elaborate description of the 1919 <i>Berliner Morgenpost </i>contest published the day after the first small announcement characterized Berlin as the site of rampant crime in a tenor recognizable from today's sensationalist television news broadcast. While in principle the game sounded fun, its publicity emphasized public anxiety about crime, violence, and social disorder with the following images: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The lack of security in Berlin has in no way declined despite all the efforts on the part of the authorities. Every day new and audacious robberies take place on open streets, in densely populated apartment buildings, and even in hotels. It seems to be impossible to capture the culprits and to bring them to justice. Every week in Berlin at least one murder is committed, and in many cases it is left unsolved. Almost every day reports pour into police headquarters stating that people inexplicably fail to return from their walks through the capital city. They were last seen by an acquaintance here or there—then, they disappeared without a trace. An accident? Crime? Murder? No one knows.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">According to this passage, every person inhabiting Berlin on that day was vulnerable to assault; the city's citizens could fall victim to random violence in any place where people came into contact with one another.

<b></b>

  </p>

<p>Post- and counter-revolutionary street ting had made crossing public space less safe and secure than it had ever been before, and stories abounded of people disappearing without a trace, or turning up dead in the urban canals. The most prominent case of kidnapping and murder was that of Spartacist activists Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, who had been assassinated by right-wing extremists in January of that same year. But the newspaper's campaign drew readers' attention to key personal questions: Was that fate something that the average reader of the <i>Morgenpost</i> should fear for him or herself? What was the perceived correlation between those kinds of events and random individual crime? Was there a connection between news of such events and the sense of general insecurity on the part of average citizens? Yet the inaugural article painted its threatening picture without offering empirical information on Berlin's dangers, thus cultivating audience interest by offering just enough of a dose of reality to inspire the creation of elaborate, perhaps unsubstantiated, fantasies about personal and collective vulnerability. To be sure, common crimes against persons and property remained just that—common—even during this time of political flux. However, a lack of reliable statistical crime records from the time makes it difficult to test the validity of this sensationalist description of the dangers of life in the city. In 1882, the German government had begun compiling systematically a common set of criminal statistics representing events in the unified nation, publishing an annual edition of <i>Statistik des Deutschen Reichs</i>, but it did not publish numbers for Berlin or Prussia during the postwar era. On the basis of the available scattered data, today's historians agree that there were more property crimes during and after the war than before. However, property crimes are not the same as the murders and disappearances described in the <i>Morgenpost</i> article.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  By describing such acts without referencing specific events or statistics, the text revealed itself to be tapping into and perpetuating a vague but popular idea among readers that the metropolitan milieu of Berlin was rife with violence. The fantasy and the reality were and remain virtually impossible to separate, which may have been a source of the appeal of the newspaper game. </p>

<p>Half a year earlier, the new Social Democratic President of the Republic, Friedrich Ebert, had chosen to convene the Constituent Assembly in the city of Weimar because Berlin was still too unsafe a place for high-profile officials to meet. Neither the legitimacy of that form of government and of Social Democratic rule nor the status of Berlin as the seat of that government was taken for granted. Cultural critics on the far left opposed any sense of continuity and direct transmission between the Second Reich and the Weimar Republic, while some on the right argued that the only promising course for German political life would be one that moved away from the terminal locus of Berlin. The violence on the streets that sent the first government officials to Weimar made it questionable to people of all political leanings that Berlin would ever be calm enough to be an appropriate government headquarters. The very tag line for the contest resonated remarkably with the political conflicts of the day as a familiar imperative to readers who might have picked up some of the many partisan leaflets circulating through the city since the war's end. In 1918 alone, two left-wing publications appeared whose titles invoked this exact phrase. The non-partisan Independent 

<b></b>

Organization for German Workers' Peace put out one issue in their larger series of flyers entitled "Arbeiter, macht die Augen auf!" ("Workers, Open Your Eyes!").<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Late in the year the Social Democratic Party published a seven-page flyer appealing for votes to the National Assembly in the January 1919 election, which bore the title "Die Augen auf!"<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  In these contexts the phrase instructed workers and returning soldiers to view critically the militarism of the previous regime and the current parties vying over its re-establishment, while also warning readers to steer clear of the political violence being fomented by parties on both extreme ends of the spectrum. The following questions thus loomed behind the newspaper's description of its city and its invocation of the "Open Your Eyes!" imperative: How in 1919 was Berlin, and so Germany, to regain the social order and the rule of law? How could the re-establishment of law and order occur when power had been wrested from the hands of precisely the agencies that should enforce national order? What role could and should citizens play in the determination of Germany's future?  </p>

<p>In the view of certain critics, not only had the Social Democrats been proven an impotent source of national power by virtue of their concession to the imposed conditions of the Entente, but those who could have stood up for the preservation of strong national principles had simply bowed out when faced with violence and danger. The revolution involved a series of events that weakened and decentralized the traditional source of authority in Wilhelmine Germany: the military. Sailors' rebellions initially triggered the political upheaval at the war's end; workers' and soldiers' councils evolved; and the <i>Freikorps</i> troops split off from the armed forces and became embroiled in the street level political turmoil. The German army had disintegrated on both fronts and, in conservatives' eyes, had been stabbed in the back and humiliated by national representatives who had agreed to the terms of the Entente and the Versailles Treaty. As a result of this combination of perceived internal weakness and external betrayal, the military no longer possessed the authority to enforce public order during internal political disputes and uprisings, something that had been a significant part of its mandate during the imperial era.  </p>

<p>According to various Prussian laws codified between 1820 and 1841, if any uprising or rebellion were seen to threaten public safety, the government could declare a state of emergency, upon which the armed forces would take over all policing duties and law enforcement officers would then answer to the higher authority of the military.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  These laws did not change until the ratification of the Weimar Constitution on 11 August, 1919. Any authoritative action on the part of the army on the occasion of domestic uprising prior to August had been proven untenable because of the military defeat and the abdication of the Kaiser. There existed a palpable power vacuum in the arena of public safety. The crisis of the capital city was a crisis of domestic order. If Berlin were to be viable as government headquarters, someone would have to keep the rebellious forces in check. Yet, skeptics queried, who, in the absence of the armed forces, could possibly reassert any kind of authority and stability?

Turning to the People 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>Although the liberal Berlin paper approached the above questions from an angle different from that of the conservative critics of the revolution and emergent republic, they permeated the texts introducing the <i>Open Your Eyes! </i>event. Rather than asking who could step in from on high to reassert public order in the event of radical street-level political activity, the <i>Morgenpost</i> staff asked what the people could do to establish safety and order on the city streets in the face of base criminal activity. As different as they sound, these questions were deeply enmeshed with one another. The second paragraph of the 13 November article introducing the journalistic manhunt insisted that survival in this dangerous city required concerted cooperation between the public and the authorities. Unlike conservative critics, who might have attributed all disorder in the capital city to the misguided activity of leftists and the weakness of the armed forces, the <i>Morgenpost</i> article attributed the state of social disorder to flaws in the attitude of the citizenry. The article continues:  </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Just why does no one know?</p>
<p>The answer is simple: Because people do not pay attention to one another any more. Nowadays all consider themselves to be so busy with their own affairs that they can muster neither the time nor the desire to concern themselves with their fellow citizens as well. Whereas Berliners used to be famous all around for their curiosity, and for their tendency to complain about and get upset over whatever concerned them—and especially that which did not concern them—Berliners have now become quite accustomed to being ambivalent toward everything and everyone, an ambivalence that could almost be considered deadly. Precisely in these times it is more necessary than ever that Berliners lay aside this rather unmetropolitan "What's it to me?" attitude and attend better to their neighbors as well as to themselves . . . .<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">This portrait of Berlin's average citizen charges that a verifiable self-absorption had been hindering efforts in crime prevention and solution in the German metropolis. The reference to the nosiness for and of which Berliners were traditionally both maligned and proud exhibits the humorous and self-ironizing tone characteristic of much of the the <i>Morgenpost</i>'s local entertainment and society reporting<i>. </i>In this particular case, that tone was used to encourage participation by amusing the reader while also establishing a self-effacing distance that urged self-consciousness. </p>

<p>The article went on to argue that the most striking relevant difference between earlier and current modes of social interaction was the citizens' unwillingness to come forth and provide eyewitness testimony to the police when called for: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The information provided by eyewitnesses is often so valuable! How many murders and crimes before the war owe their solution to the watchful eyes of a Berliner!  . . .  Each one provided observations, regardless of how tiny, that were of great service to the police in leading to revelations about the crime. The public participated cheerfully in police service because people knew that the officers were working for them and their safety alone.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> 

<b></b>

 </p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">This paragraph marks the First World War as the historical divide at which a stable relationship between the general public and its protective authorities was ruptured. Previously, according to the newspaper, Berliners had known that the police worked for the sake of public order (under imperial rule), and it was out of this assurance that they had taken an active stance toward their own self-protection. But a crisis of mistrust had developed on both sides: the public was no longer sure it could count on the police (perhaps because it was not sure what authority the police represented), and according to the adamant terms of the article, the police could certainly no longer count on the public.  </p>

<p>Boosting readership in a media landscape saturated with a variety of competing newspapers, many of which came out with multiple editions each day, was but one of the goals of the <i>Morgenpost</i> promotional event. Another was to render a vast expanse of urban space more navigable and accessible to a diverse reading public (see <i>RB</i>, 16–17). Healing the rift between the public and police and creating an improved sense of concern on the part of the city's residents were two others. Interestingly, the newspaper did not act alone in its efforts to achieve these goals. The contest involved an oversight committee made up of res from a variety of cultural and civic institutions, whose names and affiliations were all listed at a roster at the end of the 13 November article: Arnold Rieck from the <i>Lustspielhaus </i>theater, the author Hans Brennert, Fritz Goetz from the Ullstein publishing house, and Otto Robosky, the editor-in-chief of the <i>Morgenpost</i>. At the top of the list stood the name of Police Superintendent Vonberg of the Berlin <i>Kriminalpolizei</i>. As the contest unfolded, Vonberg became the most visible of the committee members. He was the only one to publish his own by-lined article about the events on the day of the contest, and his name came up repeatedly in the coverage of the ensuing reaction on the part of the paper and the public.  </p>

<p>The superindendent first became such a vocal participant when no one managed to identify the fugitive during his twelve-hour adventure through the city on the original contest date. The editors and readers were left wondering why the stunt had failed. The picture on the poster had borne a true likeness and the mystery man had conformed to all the rules outlined for the game: Jacobsohn wore no disguises; he stayed in publicly accessible locales (entering private property was forbidden to him); he lingered nowhere for longer than half-an-hour; and over the course of the day he visited all of the densely populated neighborhoods of the city that were on the original agenda. It became incumbent upon Superintendent Vonberg, the member of the evaluating board with the most experience in the arena of surveillance, personal identification, and criminal detection, to try to explain why even a playful manhunt with a substantial monetary reward had not elicted a better performance from the public. He responded first by explaining the investment the criminal police of Berlin held in the event, asserting in an article he penned for the 17 November issue of the paper: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>In light of the great interest that the public has expressed for the <i>Berliner Morgenpost</i>'s idea to stage a search for one of their editorial staff members by means of wanted posters, it seems reasonable that the criminal police should make a statement about the case. For it is precisely they who will profit from this effort. After all, the main idea behind 

<b></b>

it is the intention to get the public more actively involved in the non-political events of the day.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Superintendent Vonberg's assertions echoed conservatives' arguments about disorder on the streets of Berlin and the messages of the left-leaning flyers bearing the same tag line as the contest. With his own statement that people should be more involved in the "non-political activities of the day," Vonberg indirectly and euphemistically referred to a variety of political activities that were otherwise taking place in the city's public spaces, ranging in intensity from leafleting to ting bloody battles. From a centrist, early-Weimar law enforcement perspective, political conflict and dissent in public space amounted to public disorder—whether the cause motivating the clash was justified or not. By getting people involved in the playful games sponsored by the popular morning paper, Vonberg and his colleagues hoped to divert them from the politics of the street as a first step towards improving safety and general order. By distracting people, they could begin to establish some sense of normalcy in public life, normalcy that could hopefully translate into acceptance of—if not support for—the parliamentary democracy and the Social Democratic administration at its helm.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> </p>

<p>Those considerations make it no less remarkable that in an effort to establish normalcy and political stability, the organizers of the event would choose to structure the event around the pursuit of a pseudo-criminal. Public officials could just have easily concluded that even an obviously made-up public and police pursuit could reinforce a damaging sense of the ubiquity of crime in contemporary life and thus further destabilize the greater sense of order and faith in the new administration. In the fall of 1919, images of the prevalence of dangerous crime were expected to be reassuring in comparison to images of the recent war and the present political upheaval. The t against illegal activity was hoped to establish a common enemy against which Berliners of all political leanings could mobilize together—instead of warring among themselves. According to the terms of the event publicity, crime was not only inevitable, but it was something that the average citizen could and should do something about. By learning to do so with pleasure, the participants in the game were expected to become more amenable to doing so in other, more serious contexts. Politics, on the other hand, should now best be left to the rightful executors in the newly formed governing bodies.  </p>

<p>The <i>Open Your Eyes! </i>contest was thus intended not only to bond community members to one another, but also to reinforce the positive qualities of their relationship with state authorities. Ever since public disciplinary activities in Prussia had become centralized in the state institution of the police over the course of the nineteenth century, law enforcement officers had become one of the main points of daily contact between the state and the people. Ideally, crime detection and prevention could serve as the primary arena where the general populace, which was feeling itself to be at a loss in terms of power and personal security, could co-operate with the democratic administration, whose representatives claimed to have the interest of that people at heart. Therefore in 1919, police officers had the potential to function as primary agents in bringing the message and the means of democratic reform to the citizenry. Working hand in hand with the press strengthened this position.

<b></b>

  </p>

<p>However, as mentioned earlier, one of the premises underlying the <i>Open Your Eyes! </i>contest was that a certain amount of trust had been lost between the police and the public, which did not bode well for the kind of democratic co-operation that seemed to be the goal of the new administration. Although other representatives of the police would elaborate on this phenomenon elsewhere, nowhere in the coverage of the event did either Vonberg or the <i>Morgenpost</i> staff offer a systematic or historically reflective explanation for this phenomenon.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Indeed, the explanation that Vonberg provided overtly avoided addressing how this lack of trust might relate to specific actions or events in the administration of law enforcement. Instead, he placed the onus on the general population. In his 17 November statement, he reiterated the position articulated in the 13 November article introducing the contest rules, asserting that any current lack of efficacy or faith in law enforcement could be attributed to a failure on the part of the public to work with the authorities. The criminal investigator chided: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>In fact, in recent years the police have had ample opportunity to condemn the public's lack of interest in their concerns, concerns which in truth are nothing other than the concerns of the public itself. Were it otherwise, were the public to keep its eyes open, there would be no doubt that crime would be significantly reduced. To a certain degree all people can protect themselves and others from harm on their own, and without the help of the police.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Superintendent Vonberg went on to offer his own explanation for this specific failure of perception and socialization, which had in the meantime been confirmed by the lack of a contest winner: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Those of us who have experience in such matters might have predicted this outcome, for we have come to know the difficulty involved in locating an unidentified individual on the basis of a picture alone. On the street and in covered spaces, where a large number of people gather together, the eye of the city resident is not focused on individual persons. For most, another person is but one of many a number and is only there to help one to reach a specific goal. This is different than in a small town, where people know one another and where newcomers draw attention and criticism. Only here, where a person exists within a limited circle or a specific environment, can one count on likely success. There was nothing resembling this involved in this task. To the contrary, the sought-after man was very mobile. He moved quickly between streets and city sectors and could thereby move unnoticed among the crowds of people.

The Metropolis and Social Life 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>The above passage by Vonberg demonstrates the degree to which social theories addressing the fate of the subject in urban modernity had been streaming into common parlance. In particular, the terms of Simmel's 1903 essay "The Metropolis and Mental Life" appear to play a central role in the investigator's articulation of how urbanism had impacted human consciousness and, as a result, social life (see <i>RB</i>, 84). Arguably, to 

<b></b>

this date Simmel had offered the most cogent reflections on the experience of urban modernity, articulating the argument that, in order to understand the nature of the city, one must investigate the mental forms of subjective and intersubjective life in it and vice versa. According to this view, not only are emotional and psychological states affected by the unique conditions of modern urban life, but so are neurological and perceptual states; the external world necessarily becomes part of our inner world. The monumental differences between life in a small town and life in a metropolis guarantee that the big city resident (or <i>Großstädter</i> as Police Superintendent Vonberg refers to the target audience in the original German of the <i>Morgenpost</i> article) experiences his or her environment differently than the rural individual would.  </p>

<p>Indirectly underscored by Simmel's principles, Vonberg's article theorizes a historically determined way of interacting and of seeing that is produced by, and productive of, the modern economic, social, and physical environment. The superintendent is eager to condemn Berliners for their inability, and primarily their unwillingness, to spot a deviant in a crowd, although he provides no in-depth analysis of how the urban dweller has become so unobservant. The phrases that he offers by way of explanation seem to indicate that the answers to that question already offered by Simmel in 1903 have become self-explanatory by 1919. The superintendent vaguely alludes to instrumental attitudes and the ways that crowds, the built environment, and modern modes of transportation facilitated the preservation of anonymity in the city.  </p>

<p>In "The Metropolis and Mental Life," Simmel had concluded that intellect and reason did in fact dominate the metropolis because of its status as the seat of the money economy. Performing economic exchanges by means of currency had encouraged the assumption of a matter-of-fact attitude toward objects, an attitude that sought in them only their monetary value. This calculating attitude toward objects translates into an equally calculating attitude toward other people, subsequently reduced to their equivalent in usefulness and efficiency. Simmel further argues that as participants in a market economy, the players in an urban economy usually engage in producing or handling objects for consumers who never entered into their field of vision. Understanding someone in visual terms of recognition is downplayed in favor of formulating abstract and calculated conceptions.  </p>

<p>Police Superintendent Vonberg deduces that the city dweller no longer bothers to look at those around him or her because face-to-face interaction has become less and less a factor in the formation of the relationships most valued in the urban social economy. At the same time that the metropolitan individual finds less to be gained by engaging visually with those around him or her, any efforts to do so are thwarted by factors such as mobility and crowding. Again echoing Simmel, Vonberg contrasts the physical and social quality of life in a big city to that of a small town, where for a variety of reasons residents keep an eye on one another and are able to notice any changes or unusual behavior, a more basic form of community watch that Simmel describes as "a supervision of the citizen by the citizen."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup> </p>

<p>In 1919, the police superintendent expected that the implementation of participatory programs such as the <i>Morgenpost</i> event could instill in the capital city the qualities of 

<b></b>

a small town. He was personally invested in changing the fact that, as described in the headline of an article of 15 November, "Berlin was not paying attention" to the fugitive journalist as he visited the Wertheim department store, strolled on the posh boulevard Unter den Linden, sent a telegram from the post office, stopped by the police headquarters, took the subway and the streetcar, took a turn in a downtown amusement park, and even stopped by the subscription office in the Ullstein building.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">
Reframing the History of Vision 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>The sense of vision was failing Berliners, and not only on bustling city streets, and in hotels and crowded tenements, but also in some of the locations that housed the very modern institutions and technologies that should have been connecting people to one another: high speed public transportation, the telegraph, and the press. Instead of moving society forward, the modern urban capacity to travel and communicate faster and across further distances seemed to be making city residents far-sighted. Even though it had become impossible for residents of the highly dense and relatively mobile metropolis to meet all their neighbors or to recognize even a fraction of those encountered in a day, the newspaper offered the <i>Open your eyes!</i> contest as a tool for transmitting a way of seeing more of the city's faces in better detail, a way of seeing that should be hostile to criminality. This mode of vision would be one adjusted to the porous contours of undulating urban street-life.  </p>

<p>As the title of the event makes clear, the <i>Morgenpost</i> promotion relied on the language of vision to express its aims. All of the texts accompanying the event are replete with references to visual vigilance as the key to a re-establishment of social order. One in particular, a pithy poem, stands out for both its format and its tone. It appears in the upper right-hand corner of the middle column along with the 13 November article describing the procedures for the contest. Entitled "Where Is He Hiding?" it is credited to a Kurt E. Weckwarth (certainly meant to be a coy pseudonym, given the vigilant implications of the name "Weckwarth," which translates roughly into wakeful watch or guard) and its second verse reads: </p>

<p class="continued">This little piece strays from the rest of the predominantly imperative address of all of the articles instructing Berliners on how to get involved in the game and it bears none of the officiousness of Vonberg's article of a week later. Instead, its clever and entertaining tone emphasizes the fun side of learning how to see the other people in the city. Poetry has the capacity to reconre and delimit meaning through the substitution 

<b></b>

of denotatively equivalent but connotatively distinct words. In this case, this linguistic function is part of an effort to effect an actual transformation in perceptual modes, which was the stated goal of the event. Over the course of the verse, the casual act of looking around is transformed into a goal-directed activity, a visual act of detection-cum-identity determination. Reading about and participating in the event (activities that, as Peter Fritzsche has argued become inseparable by virtue of the community-building, participatory model of reading encouraged by Berlin's urban press) were intended to change the urban mode of vision, which should in turn change urban social life (see <i>RB</i>, 51–86). In <i>Open Your Eyes!</i> texts such as the poem, the cityscape was staged as both site of, and product of, socially constructive, mutable ways of seeing. </p>

<p>This literal and rative emphasis on seeing and being seen as a formative, yet transmutable, aspect of urban mental and social life continues the conversation with Simmel's writings from the beginning of the century. Over the course of the Weimar era, the idea that the new and sometimes incomprehensible shocks and jolts of the big city had caused people to develop a protective sensorium that both benefited and suffered from the qualities of distraction and absent-mindedness would be further developed by such cultural theorists as Walter Benjamin and Siegfried Kracauer. More recently, film scholar David Bordwell has directed an important challenge to today's cultural historians (film historians in particular) who have developed what he describes as a "history-of-vision doctrine" that is based on an interpretation of Benjamin and Kracauer (acolytes of Simmel) and which surmises that the anatomical mechanism that we call vision had over a period of less than one hundred years actually adapted physiologically to the new urban environment.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  Bordwell insists that in terms of human evolution this is a highly implausible conjecture and encourages historians of visual culture to speak not of changes in vision per se, but instead of changes in "habits and skills, of cognitively monitored ways of noticing or contextualizing information available in new surroundings" (<i>HFS</i>, 142). While that formulation may seem like only a slight shift in emphasis, Bordwell insists that it is not. He argues that </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>. . . the habits and skills demanded by modern urban vision will be like other habits and skills in important respects. They are distributed unevenly across a population. They are intermittent, specialized and transitory. They can be picked up and cast off; they can thrive and wither. If acquired habits and skills are the most pertinent and plausible sources of changes in visual experience within culture, we need not posit a pervasive, entrenched and uniform "way of seeing." It is very likely that a wide variety of perceptual abilities is at work in any given period, and this state of affairs casts doubt on the initial assumption that a single "mode of perception" rules an epoch.</p>

<p class="continued">Bordwell's argument makes perfect sense when considering the rhetoric of vision scaffolding the <i>Open Your Eyes!</i> contest of 1919. While it is true that Vonberg and the <i>Morgenpost</i> writers argue that the sense of seeing has somehow changed for the worse as a result of urban development and recent historical events, they hold the view that different modes of vision might be more or less applicable and useful in different social or material circumstances and that the newly altered urban mode of 

<b></b>

vision might be influenced to mutate to one more appropriate for the maintenance of social order. They thus mobilize their own version of a "history of vision" distinct from that attributed to Benjamin and others by the "revisionist historians" criticized by Bordwell. Theirs is one that implies a diversity of ways of seeing within modern perceptual and social life.  </p>

<p>According to Bordwell, once we recognize that the modern mode of vision is not absolute, the usefulness of the "history-of-vision" doctrine in its entirety must be reconsidered. The same can be argued for cases such as the <i>Open Your Eyes!</i> contest, where the modern mode of vision, while posited as distinct, was not necessarily theorized as absolute. Bordwell is resolute that, "given the social determination of perception, there would seem to be no voluntary going back. If people can slip out of synchronization with the new mode of seeing or slide back to earlier modes, the history-of-vision account loses a good deal of explanatory power" (<i>HFS</i>, 143). In answer to those theorists who would argue not for singular, but for plural and uneven, development, Bordwell counters: </p>


<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>But to accept this view we would need a more refined historical account than we have yet seen. How did very sweeping economic and social changes create different ways of seeing among various groups? Did the clerks and shopgirls who flocked to the cinema possess a different mode of perceiving the world than blue-collar workers who stepped in fresh from the assembly line? Middle-class citizens were exposed to advertising, traffic and sidewalk crowds; shouldn't they have developed the same distracted perception as other classes?</p>

<p class="continued">He rightly insists that those investigating shifts in modes of vision in this time period should pay careful attention to the different experiences of different classes (and, as he implies very indirectly, gender) in order to account for disparities among both perceptual and representational practices. </p>

<p>In addition to offering an opportunity to understand the state of society and culture in Berlin in the immediate postwar era, the <i>Open </i><small class="caps">y</small><i>our </i><small class="caps">e</small><i>yes!</i> event issues an invitation to meet Bordwell's challenge to pay much closer attention to the historical circumstances affecting perception and to the precise terms mobilized when theorists of the time described the relationship between history and vision. A more rigorous historical analysis of this kind might allow us to diversify our understanding of the history of vision without having to jettison the validity of that pursuit altogether.  </p>

<p>Even if we could in fact test scientifically how, and how well, vision operated in 1840 as opposed to 1919 or in the city compared to a small town, we would still remain unable to access directly the physical operation itself because the semiotic screens of 1840, 1919, and our own time and place would always mediate our understanding of the results. That given, the question that arises when we attempt to answer Bordwell is, what are the historical circumstances that determine the network of signifiers to which the subject was in fact subject in a given time and place? To proceed any further, it becomes necessary to investigate the motivations and methods of the institutions that have placed a vested interest in the operation of vision in not just the cultural 

<b></b>

and economic, but also the social and political, spheres of modern urban life. In the particular case of the <i>Open Your Eyes!</i> event, we are able to understand how specific agents representing specific agencies mobilized certain standards of vision in a specific political and social context. The most relevant agencies in the <i>Open Your Eyes! </i>case are the press and the police. </p>

<p>Since they are not intended to offer a fully elaborated philosophical or cultural theory of vision, the texts surrounding the <i>Morgenpost</i> contest do not indicate whether the agents and agencies involved believed that in earlier times and in rural environments vision was somehow purer or more direct; they simply argue that it was more reliable. Vision in those scenarios was always already experienced in terms that had been negotiated socially and linguistically, regardless of whether this is acknowledged in the texts.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  What is most important is to notice that recent events in Berlin's history had created a historical field in which the senses were felt to have become inappropriately distorted, and the police and the press set about mitigating that distortion in order to affect the social and political field.  </p>

<p>With the mitigation of visual and social distortion as their goal, Vonberg and the <i>Morgenpost</i> staff do not rhetorically separate the physiological act of seeing from the social interactions in which it was operating. In that regard they can be seen to follow Simmel's theory of urban perception more than they presage Benjamin's Weimar texts, which are much more direct and universalizing in their argument on the shift of the sensory apparatus. Like Simmel, Vonberg formulates the shift in perception in geographic terms (rural versus urban) that have temporal implications (before urban modernity and since). The temporal terms had permeated the preceding <i>Morgenpost</i> articles, but his was the first to make the geographic angle of the argument explicit. Vonberg built on, for example, the 13 November article that had insisted that the Berliner of today must give up his or her current habits and go back to a mode of observation and interaction characteristic of "then" (in German <i>damals</i>), an unnamed earlier time. Through this emphatic use of temporal markers such as "then," "today," and "now," the <i>Morgenpost</i> articles contributed to a much broader cultural discourse characterizing modernity's social changes in the specific terms of lawlessness and breakdown in communal life. A fabled golden age of decency, civility, tolerance, and mutual respect had given way to the uncomfortable realities of the contemporary city<i>, </i>wherein anonymity and carelessness promoted a lack of accountability and social authority. The advance of time, with its concomitant material and cultural shifts (including not just urbanization, but also war and revolution), appeared to have brought with it a flood of crime and violence. Despite the fact the <i>Morgenpost</i> texts did establish a distinction between the ways of the past and those of the present, the event organizers cannot be said to have taken a strictly anti-modern position. Rather than insisting upon turning back the hands of time and returning to the traditional social forms of an earlier era, the contest was intended to attempt to forge a third option by reconciling the notions of urbanity, attention to others, and community life.

Establishing Information Networks

<p>Lest the police come out of this complex cultural conversation badly, Vonberg insisted on underscoring in his 17 November article that problems related to crime and public disorder in the modern city were not to be blamed on the criminal justice system. That is to say, they were perceptual and social, but not administrative. According to his rhetoric, it was the press and the individual resident of the city that needed to improve, not the fundamental organization of the police. According to Vonberg, the reason that the 13 November manhunt had failed was in part because the <i>Morgenpost</i> had not supplied the public with the right kind of supporting documentation. Without the appropriate information, how were people supposed to see in a productive way? In this game of make-believe, the press had not gone far enough in assuming its pedagogical role. Vonberg insisted that in its second attempt the paper should offer written materials that could teach people to act in a cooperative way once they recognized what they saw. The suspect's photograph had been taken in the unofficial setting of the portrait studio at the Wertheim Department store, not meeting the specifications of an official mug shot taken under the conditions stipulated by the Bertillon system. Vonberg predicted that the participants would do better if they were given a detailed personal description and more background information about the wanted man's habits and traits, details that would in reality be compiled in a modern police file.  </p>

<p>One week later, the journalist returned to the streets, but by this time the public had read three articles recounting exactly where the journalist had gone on his first day of playing the fugitive (one of which was written by the reporter himself), as well a report on letters written by readers in response to the contest. They had also read a detailed outline of exactly what parts of the city Jacobsohn would be traversing during a specific time period on the second day. This time, the posters bearing the personal photo would more closely resemble a wanted poster; beneath the photograph they were to display a personal description written by Vonberg himself in the style of a police bulletin (the earlier description had been written by the <i>Morgenpost</i> staff). In its second form, the contest became even more like an actual criminal investigation. The language of the coverage changed accordingly by including more references to the contest as a "criminal experiment" and to the audience as witnesses.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  In concert with this development, the 18 November <i>Morgenpost</i> notice describing the revised conditions of the search reiterated the goals of the contest and placed the role of the police even closer to the center than had been the case in any of the earlier texts. The notice stated that, "Should members of the public be inspired by the promoting of <i>Open </i><small class="caps">y</small><i>our </i><small class="caps">e</small><i>yes!</i> no longer to be occupied solely with themselves and instead to devote more attention to their fellow human beings, then they will also once again become valuable helpers to the police in criminal cases. And then the goal of the our experiment will have been met."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup> </p>

<p>The police in Berlin had already been using the printed media to report on criminal activity and recent arrests and to solicit eyewitnesses throughout the late nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, and the 1919 contest was part of their effort to renew 

<b></b>

and further formalize their programmatic commitment to doing so in the wake of the revolution. At this time, various divisions of the law enforcement apparatus were being reorganized according to principles better suited to the new democracy, and the public was being addressed as both the beneficiaries of, and potential participants in, reformed law enforcement efforts. For example, when the homicide division of the Berlin police was revamped in August 1919, an article published in the Social-Democratic paper<i>, Vorwärts</i>, announced the police force's intention to inform the city press immediately of all capital crimes in the hope that members of the public could be encouraged to come forward with useful clues.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Like the <i>Morgenpost</i> contest that was to follow three months later, this resolution acknowledged that the city's residents and the press held stakes in police activities and that they could play a proactive role in crime prevention and solution. It gestured inclusively toward individual citizens by announcing that they would now be privy to information about all—not just some—capital crimes. Yet at the same time, this August 1919 initiative made the careful stipulation that only important criminal investigators could be present at the crime scene itself. While the public and the press were being more directly invited into the process of solving murder cases, the conditions of their participation were being more strictly defined. </p>

<p>This paternalistic double movement of inclusion and restriction can also be observed in the newspaper contest. Because active collaboration with law enforcement had been proven to require a substantial degree of discernment and know-how, the police had to instill in city residents a strong sense of their rights, responsibilities, and accountability. They needed to instruct them on why, when, and how to report suspicious activity or information relevant to an investigation. The daily press offered itself as a channel for this lesson in civic participation. As adept as Vonberg was in his efforts to obfuscate a discussion of police authorities' responsibility for the disintegration of trust between themselves and the public, by voicing his concern at all, he signaled that the police were experiencing a significant legitimacy crisis.  </p>

<p>While the Social Democratic administration strove to resituate law enforcement within the context of the new parliamentary government, the public remained wary of the intentions and methods of the institution as a whole. Voices from across the political spectrum were quick to point out instances where the police may have contributed to the current social disorder—whether by responding with hostility, taking sides in the street ting, or by simply having allowed public violence to proceed unchecked. Critics on the left were especially cynical about the sincerity of the Social Democrats' claim to be distancing the new Weimar police from the law enforcement units of the Second Reich, which had served the political purpose of keeping the imperial system of governance intact. The issues of intervention versus non-intervention and of continuity versus change were particularly thorny because, according to democratic standards of policing, law enforcement must remain beyond politics. It was incumbent upon the new Weimar police force to emphasize their democratic principles and thus to distinguish their philosophies and methods from those of the earlier era without seeming to endorse a specific party (even though it was clear to all that by upholding the rule of law in 1919 they often found themselves responsible for defending the Social Democratic administration).

<b></b>

  </p>

<p>In terms of social ordering, the potential effects of the <i>Open Your Eyes!</i> contest went beyond quieting criticism of the police. They also included encouraging the community to collaborate with law enforcement officers. Berlin's citizens were converted into the coproducers of police services, both discursively through the texts addressing them in their morning paper and physically through their participation in the fictional detection event. In the reporting on the event, Vonberg and the <i>Morgenpost</i> writers openly acknowledged the public's power to coauthor the course of law enforcement. Under the new democratic administration, it was now the people's place to authorize and legitimate police power. At the close of his 17 November <i>Morgenpost</i> article, Superintendent Vonberg himself alluded to the connection between the contest results, criminal justice, and the stability of the new state with the words, "We hope, however, that this incentive might contribute to revitalizing public collaboration on recent grave cases, and that it will thus ensure the calm and peaceful work that will be the foundation for the renewal of our state."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> </p>


<h1 class="sec-headA">
Sense and Self-Sufficiency 
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->



<p>The amateur detection event effectively reinforced the centrality and visibility of the law enforcement apparatus, all the while contributing to the Berlin police force's effort to transform its image from that of an irritable, brutal, and imposing imperial police force to that of a calm and stable institution working cooperatively with an integrated citizenry. The new regime of control moved even farther away from old-fashioned repressive, spectacular law enforcement towards distinctly modern techniques of power at work through more superficially visible, but less forceful, networks of productive social discipline. Superintendent Vonberg's contributions to the <i>Morgenpost</i> event amounted to a cultural experiment, infiltrating and playing off aspects of the lives of Berliners that seemed separate from the imperatives of law enforcement, such as entertainment and leisure activities. The already existent popular appeal of the press and urban mass culture served as a means to naturalize surveillance and informing as an ordinary, everyday, and even enjoyable activity. The declared purposes of the game were expressed in ennobling terms such as community building, self-sufficiency, national security, and personal safety, all implicit dimensions of the new democracy. The goal was that the event would performatively transform the metropolis from the site of crime to the site of public detection and thus into a more viable national capital in the local and national imaginary. </p>

<p>According to Vonberg, the <i>Open Your Eyes! </i>project was aimed at recalibrating vision in order to produce in the citizenry a high degree of self-sufficiency: if the whole community regulated itself, the police would need to be called in as a repressive and arresting force in only extreme situations. Another promotional article from 21 November reinforced this message with its call to action: "Who will it be—civilian, patrolman, officer or imperial solider? Who will think they recognize in any old person our staff member, the one who has been shown on the posters? Who will call to him the magic words, 'Open your eyes!'?"<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  No longer the sole domain of the military and the police, 

<b></b>

law enforcement activities could just as easily be performed by a "civilian." Rank was broken with the amateur detective considered as capable as not only a patrolman, but even a high-ranking officer. By merging the reception of popular culture with police work, the event organizers aimed to reinforce and extend the law enforcement apparatus across a vast social terrain by extending its functions to the masses. </p>

<p>The contest thus falls into place as an extension of the general rise of disciplinary power described so famously by Michel Foucault in <i>Discipline and Punish</i>. Becoming ever more elaborate in its operation since its emergence in eighteenth-century European society, modern discipline has entailed a mobile, diffuse network of power within culture. While it does involve supervisory institutions such as the police, discipline also extends to institutions that are assumed to be serving functions other than surveillance, penalization, or incarceration, enforcing what Foucault describes as "a whole set of instruments, techniques, procedures, levels of application, [and] targets."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Tony Bennett's reinterpretation of Foucault's description of the Panopticon in the context of the modern museum provides a useful framework for discussing how and why certain kinds of visual activities have been mobilized by the state and its institutions to win over city audiences.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  Unlike Foucault's model, where individuals become docile out of their internalization of an awareness of being visually supervised without looking back at the invisible authorities, the <i>Open Your Eyes!</i> event urged everyone to take a participatory role in the task of seeing and then acting on the basis of what one has seen. In this regard, it functioned as a modern urban spectacle in the sense of the term as described by Vanessa Schwartz. It reconstituted the masses of Berlin as a collective of urban spectators enjoying a shared visual experience and thus contributed to the effort to democratize social and political relations.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup> </p>

<p>By rewarding a participatory rather than passive mode of looking (spotting the suspect) and asking readers to then act on the basis of that looking (arresting the man), the contest organizers introduced the notion of play and allowed the public a different, if not stronger, sense of voluntary cooperation and mobility than had been the case in imperial social ordering efforts. This did, however, cost them a degree of control, for with participatory play comes uncertainty and the potential for transgression. Exact outcomes were not predictable, but the goal was that these outcomes would always be socially productive. </p>

<p>Indeed, the <i>Open Your Eyes!</i> idea failed on the first day, putting into question whether Berlin's populace was up to the task of participating in the regulation of their own city space. The contest finally ended two weeks later when a thirteen-year-old boy named Willi Czerwinski managed to identify the anonymous journalist on the basis of a photograph that he and his brothers had ripped from a poster hung on one of the city's ubiquitous advertising columns, or <i>Litfaßsäulen</i>. Ironically, their success was predicated not only on the destruction of public property, but also on taking the image out of the view of other participants in their neighborhood. Yet it aroused no direct criticism from the authorities. The small insurrection was reported in the <i>Morgenpost</i> with a laughing tone of tolerance, for ultimately the boys' gesture helped them and their competitors who read about their success to see the city according to the contest's terms. Even 

<b></b>

though they tore the poster down, they still played along and consequently were treated as harmless adolescents on their way to becoming good citizens.  </p>

<p>Although the reporting made it clear that young Willi was not exactly the winner the paper organizers had originally had in mind, in the overall picture he fit the bill. He came from a family of five children being raised in a working-class neighborhood on the southeastern side of Berlin by a widower mother and <i>Morgenpost</i> subscriber struggling to make ends meet. He and his family thus belonged to exactly the group that the Social Democrats needed to work the hardest to win over from the more radical causes on the left and right. According to the paper, Willi was a public hero for a day. His arrest of Jacobsohn inspired crowds to gather and emit glory cheers for the young man who had done what none of them could—outwit the clever journalist and win a victory for the people.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  In contrast to the newspaper's view, in his mother's eyes Willi's vigilance was impressive not because of what it signified about the boy's wit or participatory ethic. Her remarks in the paper made it clear that Willi's win was meaningful to her because of the much-needed money it brought into their household.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  (She had little positive to say about in the boy in general. When he had originally set out to find Jacobsohn, she had told him he never would because he was simply too dumb too succeed.) It would seem from the tone of the <i>Morgenpost </i>reporting that her devotion to the paper and the centrist positions it stood for were all but assured after this event; however, because her good feelings were based on economic rather than political grounds, her support for the paper was more tenuous than the <i>Morgenpost</i> claimed.  </p>

<p>Reading the paper, watching their fellow citizens vigilantly, and reporting on crime were cultural and social means by which such urban subjects could gain agency and satisfaction. All the same, it is important to recognize that such rewards were available to them only as participants in already existing mechanisms of power centered in law enforcement. By mobilizing the language of the senses in the mass media, journalists and police representatives naturalized this process of civic involvement by locating its functions within the parameters of the citizen's very body. Such a model of disciplining (or calibration in Fritzsche's terms) was geared equally toward generating faith and trust within the populace and placing the police at the center of civil society. Events such as <i>Open Your Eyes!</i> used the media to put the function of policing into the hands and eyes of the citizenry, which had the effect of inscribing law enforcement more broadly into daily life. Neither the police nor the paper ever intended to allow detection to be loosed from its gravitational center at police headquarters, which for the time being was a Social Democratic establishment. </p>
