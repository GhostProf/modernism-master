At the same time, her fiction’s apparent focus on “feminine experiences” such as love, manners, and the domestic is in line with the conventions of the mainstream novel. Hence Nicola Humble’s suggestion that Bowen’s “intellectual abstruse novels” are best positioned “at the highbrow end of the middlebrow.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>7 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Many recent attempts at critically locating Bowen’s fiction, however, foreground its simultaneous reliance on realist and modernist literary conventions.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>8 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">This article aims to intervene in this ongoing debate by considering the central role that clothes and fashion play in Bowen’s novel </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">To the North</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">. Bowen’s narrative relies heavily on textiles and fabrics in the development of character and plot. But while dresses, frocks, and other sartorial markers loom large in her fiction, Bowen’s novel sidesteps the overt dependence on materiality and description that distinguishes the realist novel she inherited from such writers as Henry James or Edith Wharton. As we shall see, clothes, like no other objects in Bowen’s novel, carefully orchestrate her repre</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">sentation of the connections that exist among characters’ interior composition, their intersubjective relations, and the exterior landscape.

For that reason, it is Bowen’s enthusiasm for representing the world of material objects—a feature conventionally associated with classical realism—that provides, incongruously perhaps, an opportune moment to interrogate Bowen’s own relationship to the aesthetics of literary modernism. Bowen’s personal encounters with the world of fashion were far from opportune. Apparently, her “dress sense” was “atrocious” at the time of her marriage to Alan Cam</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">eron, who took on the daunting task of organizing her wardrobe.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>9 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Victoria Glendinning, Bowen’s biographer, notes that “large earrings, necklaces of false pearls or great glass bobbles, and flashy fake jewellery” were classic Bowen accessories.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>10 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">One glance at existing photographs of Bowen makes clear that she was hardly a trend-setter when it came to matters of personal appearance.

In a 1956 essay, for instance, she justifies her eccentric style by stressing the need to avoid conformity and a slavish devotion to the norm: “Fashion,” Bowen writes, “today, no longer is a dictator, rather a would-be ally of the identity; it deals no longer in ‘musts’ but in possibilities.

And that really, that fact that it concerns itself with two people, with three, with an unnumbered cast of persons, placed in a pattern relating to one another and acting upon one another, does constitute the hold and the future promise of the story, whether it be in . . . the novel of sensation, whether it be in the novel of allegory, the Kafka novel, or whether it be in the short story with its simplified invisible view.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.2pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>16 </Sup></SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">But even though the topic of human interaction figures prominently in all of Bowen’s texts, </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">To the North</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, her most cosmopolitan novel, spotlights like none of her other works the instability of interpersonal connections in modern, metropolitan London, and thus occupies a special place in her oeuvre. It tells the story of two young women, sisters</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">in-law Cecilia and Emmeline Summers, who set up house together in 1920s London after the death of Cecilia’s husband and Emmeline’s brother. While the glamorous and unpredictable Cecilia contemplates a second marriage to the eligible bachelor Julian Tower, Emmeline, co-owner of a small Bloomsbury travel agency, forms an ill-fated emotional attachment with the predatory Markie Linkwater. Their affair ends catastrophically, and the novel culminates on a cataclysmic note: after a constrained and awkward dinner with Julian and Cecilia, Emmeline, in an emblematic death-drive scene, provokes a car accident that will, in all likelihood, kill herself and Markie.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>17 </Sup></SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">These characters’ complex emotional and personal transactions are set against a world in which consumption and personal relations threaten to become interchangeable. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:; margin-left:64px; text-indent:-30px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; color:#221E1F">290 </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Indeed, the novel’s apparent interest in metropolitan consumer culture might well be responsible for its abundant sartorial references. Meteorological conditions are reported with allusions to “wet lace” and “sopping chiffon” (</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">To the North</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, 219). Cecilia, we are told, is “charmingly dressed” (4) in “pink folds” (307) or an expensive “fur coat” (1). Lady Waters, Emmeline and Cecilia’s exasperating and exasperated relative, exhibits, in “her black moiré skirt” (15), an “expensive disregard of the fashions” (14). Elsewhere in the novel, Bowen draws attention to a “white tie” (24), a “black tie” (60), Emmeline’s “green dress” (138), her “long yellow dress” (81), and her “red leather slippers” (125). More unconventionally (and disturbingly perhaps), a schoolgirl’s “blue knickers” are on display in a “dignified but dégagé somersault” (94), while the novel’s final scene zooms in on “Markie’s white scarf that he had forgotten” and “Emmeline’s gloves that she would not wear” (307), the latter an image that produces nervous anxiety in the otherwise blasé Cecilia. But even to a reader who does not ransack Bowen’s novel for references to clothes, fabrics, and textiles, this sartorial color chart must seem over</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">determined. While Bowen herself admits that “ten minutes talk about clothes (except between perfect friends) tends to make everyone present either overbearing, guarded or touchy” (“Dress,” 111), her novel, like its author, over-accessorizes. What, then, can be the point of this slightly inelegant and ungainly accumulation of sartorial references? A possible answer can be found by looking at Bowen’s representation of objects. In their seminal study </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Elizabeth Bowen and the Dissolution of the Novel </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">(1995), Andrew Bennett and Nicolas Royle suggest that objects in Bowen’s work function primarily to represent, metonymically, the characters that inhabit her fictional world.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>18 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">However, Maud Ellmann has recently complicated this critical notion by arguing that Bowen’s fiction anthropomorphizes inanimate objects, especially furniture, and provides them with mnemonic abilities.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>19 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Things become guardians of the past, a past that characters no longer want to assimilate, store, or confront. Ellmann, it could be said, describes the psychological emancipation of Bowen’s artifacts: they are no longer figuratively tied to the human mind. Instead of simply representing characters, objects take on a more active and autonomous role in Bowen’s fiction. By maintaining that the “idea that places and things could have sentience and cognition . . . regardless of whether or not a human mediator is present to act as the source of or inspiration for such acts of personification,” Elizabeth C. Inglesby advances the study of Bowen’s “literary ani</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">mism.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>20 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">In Bowen’s fiction, Inglesby argues, artifacts sense, form connections, and communicate with each other. Not only does Bowen’s fiction insist on the spiritual independence of the material world, but it also reveals objects’ potential and desire for independent agency.

But clothes, I would argue, can nevertheless be distinguished from many of the objects that have been given specific attention by Bowen’s critics. Whereas houses, furniture, and other domestic items rep</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">resent tradition, custom, and history (nostalgia made material), clothes are consumer products, transient and short-lived.

While Sombart notes that “change has been trans</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">formed from an individual into a social fact,” he also suggests that “the relationship between human beings and articles of daily use has been stripped of [its] sentimental and romantic attraction.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>21 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Clothes and other disposable consumer articles are certainly no memorabilia.

And as we shall see later, traces of capitalism’s alienating influence are certainly apparent in her novel, while Bowen, in another place, overtly acknowledges modernity’s sedative and paralyzing influences. As she argues in “The Poetic Element in Fiction,” “we could be very easily numbed and very easily made anonymous, unaware of ourselves, by this heavy looming up of invention, of buildings, of process of speed, of similarity, of mass production.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>22 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">However, in </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">To the North</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, garments, dress, and fashion ornaments are also infused with a particular force and verve, and it is precisely their vitality that is responsible for mobilizing or generating interpersonal energies between characters. While the ontological distinction between subject and object be</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">comes therefore increasingly blurred in </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">To the North</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">—her protagonists often appear like passive chessboard pieces—it is, paradoxically, through their reliance on sartorial objects that characters in Bowen’s fiction seem to be able to bond at all with other in</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">dividuals.

Cecilia, it seems, is a consumer, Emmeline a collector. But while the two women differ in their feelings toward clothes and friends, </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">To the North </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">con</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">stantly synchronizes its apparent interest in dress with an equally decisive analysis of its characters’ social connections. Unsure of whether or not to accept Julian’s offer of marriage, to form a new attachment, Cecilia displaces her indecision and uncertainty onto the problematic task of selecting new items for her wardrobe: “Besides the ago</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">nies of decision—green, white or flame-colour?—she could never order a new evening dress without a sense of fatality: how much would have happened before it was worn out? . . .

Ce</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">cilia’s thoughts about the purchase, consumption, and the wear and tear of garments parallel her attitude towards her social engagements. Does she, who “loved strangers, strangeness” and who “could enjoy in a first glance all the deceptions of intimacy” (6), really want to form an attachment that is to outlast her new evening dress? Does one want to find stability and permanence in a swirling world that pays lip service to the “slick mundanity of </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Vogue</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">” (7)?

Accused by his siblings of going “through life too easily, forming too few ties and buying too many pictures” (40), Cecilia’s suitor Julian is equally accountable for a too fashion-conscious attitude to life. In Bowen’s novel consumption and intimacy, like mismatched orna</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ments, do not seem to go together. But if some of Bowen’s characters seem reluctant to form lasting attachments her own fiction is nonetheless extremely loyal to one particular sartorial object: the tie. Cravats, neckties, and their close sartorial relatives, scarves, are everywhere in </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">To the North</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">. Whereas the school tie of Julian’s adolescent niece, Pauline, becomes the sub</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ject of an aesthetic debate (195–96), Emmeline, during her first meeting with Julian glances “once or twice at his white tie” (24). Likewise, Cecilia reports that her first conversation with Markie on the train came to pass because she “looked at his tie” (18)—“at his Old Harrovian tie: the only tie, for some reason, she ever recognised” (3).</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>23 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">In this last case, a fashion accessory motivates a fleeting encounter on the train, which has, nevertheless, more long-term and ultimately unfortunate repercussions because it connects Markie and Emmeline. This unconcealed concern with ties is certainly puzzling. But if Bowen’s novel relies heavily on this particular fashion ornament, it is, of course, for the explicit purpose of exploiting the semantics of the homonym “tie” and to stress the associative connec</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">tion between sartorial objects and social attachments. Accordingly, Peter, Emmeline’s business partner, in an early scene in the novel, is seen to maintain “an air of slightly disdainful discretion” during Emmeline’s talk with a parlor-maid, “as though he were thankful he had no ties” (36–37). Such playful conceptual fusion on Bowen’s part confirms Neil Corcoran’s proposal that her fiction is extremely alert to the “semantic, acoustic, and etymological interconnections between words” and that she consistently aims to merge discursive fields associated with particular linguistic referents.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>24 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">This overlap between the sartorial and the socio-psychological is comically obvious when Lady Waters hopes that Cecilia, after her marriage, will “travel with Julian, or have more ties” (274). In </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">To the North</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, a text that develops bizarre grids of ties, sartorial ornaments and personal relationships become exchangeable in a deft (or daft) play with linguistic signifiers. Bowen, it seems, was extremely fond of this particular image, as she uses it again in </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">The Heat of the Day </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">(1949), another of her novels exploring the ephemerality of human connections, this time in London at the time of the Second World War.

Odd as this conversation about Robert’s tie must appear in the first place, it is awkwardly pinned to a chapter reviewing emotional rapports between individuals—personal ties—in a time of war. Death and the dangers faced daily and nightly during the Blitz function, according to Bowen’s narrator, like an aphrodisiac: </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:32px; line-height:16px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:9pt; color:#221E1F">So, among the crowds still eating, drinking, working, travelling, halting, there began to </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; color:#221E1F">293 </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:9pt; color:#221E1F">be an instinctive movement to break down indifference while there was still time. The wall between the living and the living became less solid as the wall between the living and the dead thinned. In that September transparency people became transparent, only to be located by the just darker flicker of their hearts . . . There was a diffused gallantry in the atmosphere, an unmarriedness: it came to be rumoured about the country, among the self-banished, the uneasy, the put-upon and the safe, that everybody in London was in love . . . (92, 94–95) </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-right:34px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">A man called Harrison intrudes on this atmosphere of romance and passion, forcing himself (and certain unwanted information about Robert’s intelligence work) on Stella. With her suspicion awakened, Stella, who is unable to confront her lover directly, none</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">theless decides to investigate Robert’s case: what follows is an intricate dialogue about Harrison, Stella’s “friends” (102), and Robert’s relatives, a conversation that produces uneasiness, the crucial “tie question” (102) and an emotional outburst: “‘The thing is,’ [Stella] cried, kneeling by him with the tie in her hands, ‘that really I cannot judge any tie you wear . . . How should I feel, for instance, if somebody tried to tell me something preposterous about you?’” (102). In the emotionally charged atmosphere of war-time London, where human associations form rapidly and intimacy becomes discountable, all sorts of ties, it seems, might easily become oppressive or burdensome and finally will have “to go” (102).</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>26 </Sup></SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">In </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">To the North</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, the novel’s fad for ties is most seductive for the affectionate, devoted, and emotionally consistent Emmeline, whose strong attachment to Markie has such drastic consequences. Unexpectedly finding her lover in her garden one morning, she registers his “dishevelled white tie” (</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">To the North</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, 126), an ostentatious marker of an eventful night. And although Bowen’s novel does not record Emmeline’s discomposure and agitation directly, the sartorial image does provide clues about Markie’s nocturnal activities and Emmeline’s emotional response. “To get his tie like this,” we are told, “someone must have been holding him tight round the neck” (127). For Emmeline, we can deduce, Markie’s “crumpled tie” (127) advertises the possibility of either a violent encounter or of sexual betrayal. But instead of giving the reader access to the internal, psychological organization of Emmeline’s character, Bowen externalizes her sentiments and perceptions by concentrating on a fashion ornament. It is the charac</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ters’ garments that can reveal emotional states. Accessories thus become the focus for a close-reading of Markie’s activities and Emmeline’s character. The reader turns, like the elusive Emmeline herself, into a vigilant examiner of fashion ornaments. At the same time </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">To the North </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">opts for representing the world—to use Bowen’s own expres</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">sion—not through the lens of the “solitary consciousness reflecting everything else,” but through investigating the relationships of “a cast of persons, placed in a pattern.” As it happens, Bowen, in the described scene, emphasizes the associative connection between sartorial and social fabrics by coordinating the reading of characters’ clothes and personal relations. Emmeline’s attention to Markie’s tie illustrates that clothes consistently facilitate the inspection of other people’s personal connections. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:; margin-right:12px; margin-left:64px; text-indent:-30px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; color:#221E1F">294 </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">But Emmeline is by no means the only alert and fashion-conscious reader in </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">To the North</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">; in that role she is outstripped by her secretary, “recently down from Lady Marga</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ret Hall” (35), the bland and neglected (but appropriately named) Miss Tripp. Oblivious to the stenographer’s display of increasingly striking clothing, put on for “Emmeline’s eye alone” (149), and to Miss Tripp’s bottled-up emotions, Emmeline finds herself in a tight spot one day when walking into the office in an arresting green silk dress. Ar</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">riving late, “agitated and bright-eyed” (143) from a lunch date with Markie, she must realize that her unpunctuality and her unusual choice of dress provoke Miss Tripp’s “hectoring intimacy” (143) and an emotional crisis. Unfortunately for both women, Miss Tripp has misread the significance of the green frock. In principle Emmeline is a version of what the psychologist J. C.

A tense exchange between employer and employee then occurs in Emmeline’s travel agency, revealing the alienating aspect of modern office work that threatens to mechanize and standardize human life and labor. It is precisely this “impersonality” </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-left:31px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">(148) </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">that Doris Tripp criticizes in Emmeline’s behavior, especially in a place that prides itself on taking “personal care of clients” (26). Although Doris knows better than to allow “personal feeling to impinge on business relations” (148), she refuses to be regarded as “an automaton” or, worse even, “a platinum blonde” (151). “But where was the confidence,” wonders Emmeline’s employee, “where were the smiles, the gleams of satirical understanding, the dear sense of impositions endured together, of jokes shared grimly enough, that should cement an association between females?” (150). Tripp, who takes up Emmeline’s request for dictation, “smiling, as though at an invitation to dance” (146), wants intimacy while her employer expects nothing but “punctuality, bridling diligence” (153), and “the seductive efficiency” “implicit in [the] use of ‘stenographer’” (154). </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-left:31px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">In writing this specific scene from </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">To the North</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, Bowen registers that fashion influences the problematic office politics depicted here. By associating the image of modern and stylish femininity with the attractive picture of women’s competence and efficiency, the fashion industry, in the 1920s, had started to set standards for female dress and demeanor in the workplace. In </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">To the North</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, a particular “type” of employee is required by the business partners: one who is “cheap,” “wrote the King’s English, absented herself at tea-time, and did not sniff” (153). Not individuality, represented by Tripp’s “striped, checked or polka-dotted” dresses (149), but compliance with the ready-made image of female professionalism is in high demand on the 1920s job market. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; margin-bottom:20px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">For her chosen profession, Tripp is certainly ill-equipped or ill-fitted.

Although the frock carries the distracting memory of Emmeline’s lunch with Markie and their plans for a short trip to Paris—memories out of place in the work space—it is not an invitation to an intimate and friendly tête-à-tête between “girls” (</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">To the North</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, 143).

In Bowen’s novel costumes and outfits are therefore responsible for producing emotional energies between characters. Even the capricious Cecilia is not immune to the seductive allure of the personal, as long as it speaks to her and lets her speak through sartorial referents. Having finally decided to tie the knot with Julian, she faces the task of befriending Julian’s teenage niece, Pauline. Confronted with the girl on an evening during one of Lady Waters’s tedious country outings, Cecilia, after a number of awkward attempts to build rapport, finally offers to assist Pauline in getting dressed: “‘Does your dress do up at the back?’” she wants to know before suggesting, “‘Perhaps I could hook it’” (201). Although Pauline rejects the well-meant offer, Cecilia’s concern about Pauline’s dress and hair produces a “burst of confidence” (201) in the young girl. Bowen’s novel leaves no one in doubt that Pauline and Cecilia have broken the ice, especially since Pauline recalls the scene for the benefit of her uncle Julian: “‘A girl of my age might easily feel </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">de trop</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">,’” she says, “‘but they are all determined to make me feel quite at home.

Clothes consolidate, once more, a personal connection. Needless to say, the fact that </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">To the North </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">consistently interrogates the relation</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ship between material goods and human relationships also suggests that Bowen’s text contributes to an ongoing debate exploring the extent to which contemporary con</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">sumer culture had an alienating effect on modern individuals. It is well known that in his remarks on the fetishism of commodities, Karl Marx expressed a deep mistrust of consumer objects because of their ability to commoditize human labor. In Marx’s words, “whenever, by any exchange, we equate as values our different products, by that very act, we also equate, as human labour, the different kinds of labour expended upon them.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>31 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">But in contrast to Marx’s assumptions, Bowen shows in </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">To the North </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">that sartorial items (and her characters’ reliance on those consumer objects to establish intersubjective relations) can obtain assembling powers. In her fiction, material items such as clothes and other fashion accessories have significance and acquire affective qualities through the personal associations they construct and encourage. Bowen’s use of fashion accessories thus moves beyond critical paradigms that pessimistically envision, </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">pace </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Marx, estrangement and personal isolation as the logical consequence of capitalist modernity. Although she frowningly records the evanescence of intimacy and personal connections in a modern world of mass production and consumption, her fiction also shows that it is, paradoxically, precisely through those mass-manufactured consumer objects that emotional rapport can occasionally be established. In </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">To the North</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, Bowen remains committed to investing in sartorial items and materiality. But this investment is always motivated by emotive, not by materialist, concerns. Her writing continues to be dedicated to uncovering the emotional energies among her characters by focussing on the objects that crowd their world. Bowen’s characters thus form what I would like to call sartorial connections, and let themselves be directed and conducted by the energy of their clothes and fashion orna</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ments. Moreover, the novel’s reader also forms strong links to the characters’ fashion </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; color:#221E1F">297 </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">accessories and thereby to Bowen’s fictional personalities. We become intimate with her characters, are fastened to them, through getting to know their clothes and dresses. When the emotionally tormented Emmeline, in one of the novel’s last scenes, turns to her wardrobe for inspiration on what to wear for Cecilia’s dinner party, she has the choice between “the yellow in which she had dined with Markie, the silver in which she had first met Julian” (284). Both dresses are associated, in the reader’s (and Emmeline’s) mind, with the men, who, in one form or another, have contributed to terminating her tenancy at Oudenarde Road and to interrupting her comfortable intimacy with Cecilia. For Markie, however, the experience of spotting Emmeline in “a long silver dress that he did not know” (286) rekindles his sexual desire. Like the unknown frock, Emmeline represents novelty, a renewed offer of consumption. With the words, “‘You are looking lovely: is that dress new’” (289), Markie advances, prepared to start all over again. But the reader is aware, unlike Emmeline’s lover, that the silver dress does not represent a clean slate. Intimacy with Emmeline has intensified since we first saw her in the shiny silver dress. With the help of the sartorial reference we are able to follow her in recalling decisive moments in her past, like her first encounter with Julian. By the end of the novel it has therefore become apparent that the casual personal attachment desired by Markie is clearly incompatible with Emmeline’s emotional intensity. Accord</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ingly, the fabrics in Emmeline’s wardrobe assist in associating and evaluating different elements in Bowen’s textual design. When we connect text passages with the help of sartorial references, our familiarity with her protagonists stabilizes and intensifies. In Bowen’s fiction it is exterior attributes such as clothes, dress, and fashion ornaments that generate ties between the characters as well as between characters and the reader. Not the characters themselves but the consumer objects that surround them are, in many cases, the agents of the narrative. Bowen’s protagonists might well lack agency. Instead it is the inanimate world of frocks and ties that provides them with stimulating impulses, energetically determining their choices. In other words, clothes, not literary characters, are responsible for driving Bowen’s plot. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Given the fact that the revolution of literary characters was a key aspect of mod</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ernism’s experimental agenda, it is at this point that the dialogue between Bowen’s writing and the aesthetics of modernism should be considered. In 1924, Virginia Woolf published her pamphlet “Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown,” a text that would obtain am</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">bassadorial status for literary modernism’s pioneering art of “character-reading.” In this essay on the generational shift in novel writing Woolf argues that “it is to express character—not to preach doctrines, sing songs, or celebrate the glories of the British Empire, that the form of the novel, so clumsy, verbose, and undramatic, so rich, elastic, and alive, has been evolved.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>32 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">The writers of the previous period—Edwardians such as Arnold Bennett, H.

Obviously, Bowen did not share Woolf’s dislike for representing objects in fiction. On the contrary, her writing relies on negotiating the intricate relationship between the modern individual and the material and social composition of the world. As Maud Ellmann convincingly claims: “The difference between Bowen and Woolf is that Bowen relishes the narrative business of the realist, insofar as it releases her from the stifling rose-house of inner life into the world of cars and cocktail-shakers, typewriters and telephones—in short, into the modern world, which claims her attention just as much as the archaic phantoms of the mind.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>36 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">In </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">To the North</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">, rather than develop the modernist depiction of interiority advocated by Woolf, Bowen allows us to read her protagonists through their accessories. This means that Bowen’s fiction evinces—in an all but realist fashion—a determined devotion to style, forms, and surfaces. For Bowen, the kaleidoscopic organization of the modern social landscape marked by fast-paced consumption, commercial exchanges, and the ephemeral nature of human connections, proved to be too exhilarating and fascinating to be neglected. Individuals, in her fiction, are shown to be thrown into a modern force-field of competing social and economic energies that can be anesthetizing and galvanizing at the same time. But since we have seen that Bowen’s apparent attention to sartorial markers refuses to fall neatly into line with an unwavering materialist outlook, her aesthetic commit</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ment to realist conventions is in need of further investigation. Whereas the realist writers criticized in Woolf’s essay would insist on the solidity of the material world— the concreteness and substance of objects surrounding characters in fiction—Bowen foregrounds, like other modernist writers, the ephemerality of that world. In her work, psychological interiors and external appearances form complex alliances. On the one hand, costumes and clothes offer an invitation to the reader to speculate on the emo</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">tional make-up of characters. On the other hand, Bowen’s play with linguistic signi</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">fiers emphasizes the instability of these sartorial connections. To use Roland Barthes’s expression, dress “is </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">a priori </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">a kind of </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">text without end</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; color:#221E1F"><Sup>37 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Like Miss Tripp and Markie, readers might misjudge characters’ clothes and thus their states of mind, both of which become attributes that are provisional and temporary of nature. In a modern world, in which experiences are short-lived and nothing is static, personal characteristics become as volatile as fashion objects. </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">To the North </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">reproduces this sense of instability through Bowen’s playful pooling of sartorial and linguistic accessories. So it is precisely this conceptual elusiveness in Bowen’s fiction that unhinges scholarly interpretations focusing exclusively on her writing’s realist facets. Although she remained, throughout her writing career, dedicated to literary practices of the realist tradition—to represent</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ing “the fabric of things” as Woolf called it—Bowen nonetheless offers a different way of representing the interdependence of human subjects and the world of objects surrounding them, one that notes the variable nature of personal associations and one </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">that brings into play the suggestion of consumer objects’ energetic intervention in the </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; color:#221E1F">299 </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">world of human relationships. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:justify; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">In “The Poetic Element in Fiction,” Bowen explicitly criticized “introverted in</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">dividualism” and “the idea of a one-man world” while arguing at the same time that the individual is always part of a complexly woven, interceding social fabric. For this reason her novel rejects Woolf’s proposition that objects obtain ontological significance predominantly through the subject’s oscillating perceptions and creative interven</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">tions.

As the last few paragraphs have shown, the analysis of clothes and other sartorial objects in </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">To the North </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">raises the question of its generic affiliation and indicates how much Bowen’s fashion-conscious writing unsettles both realist and modernist conventions. Her novel thus presents a significant challenge to her critics because it severely stretches established scholarly paradigms for literary analysis. However, by simply noting the apparent formal pro</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">miscuity of Bowen’s fiction critics are in danger of evading the issue of defining her unconventional style through too much critical circumspection.

It seems that in the encounter with Bowen’s fiction, scholars are redirected to consider their own analytical tools, all of which seem to be lacking in conceptual precision. What has become apparent in the foregoing analysis, though, is Bowen’s consciousness of sartorial, social, and generic patterns. Their mutually responsive relationship allowed her to revolutionize subject-object relationships in modern fiction and to develop her eccentric literary practices. In her writing, as much as in matters of personal appear</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">ance, Bowen delighted in the idiosyncrasy of style. </SPAN></P></DIV><DIV class="Sect"><H5 style="margin-bottom:12px"><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; font-size:10.5pt; font-weight:bold; color:#221E1F">Acknolwedgments </SPAN></H5><P style="text-align:justify; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; color:#221E1F">Research for this article was underpinned by a Fleur Cowles Endowment Fellowship from the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, and I am happy to acknowledge the support I received from staff during my visit in July–August 2010.

Knopf, Bowen records that she was, during their first encounter, similarly arrested by his tie: “Circling the room, I succeeded in getting my back to the windows, put on my spectacles (I am near-sighted) and again looked round, more worried if less blinded. There seemed to be several women in their thirties (my then age), any one of whom might well have been I. It struck me that Alfred might be in the same quandary as myself: possibly he might have become bored by the puzzle and gone home? Or, had something gone wrong, had he not come? He could not possibly be anyone I had looked at so far. Then my eye lit on a tie, some distance away. The sun glinted on it. The tie was not so much magneta as the dark-bright purple-crimson of a petunia, and it was worn with a shirt of a light green, just too blue to be almond, just not blue enough to be verdigris. Tie and shirt were at some height from the ground; their wearer stood leaning in a doorway or archway, a vantage-point some way away from the throng. He looked almost sleepy. With an onlooker’s great calmness, one might say indolence, he was considering everybody, including me. ‘I wondered how we should find each other,’ I said, as we shook hands.” Elizabeth Bowen, “Alfred Knopf,” in </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Listening In</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; color:#221E1F">, 222. </SPAN></LI><LI style="margin-left:0px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; color:#221E1F">24.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; color:#221E1F"> Corcoran, </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Elizabeth Bowen: The Enforced Return</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; color:#221E1F">, 4. </SPAN></LI></ol><LI style="margin-right:34px; margin-left:0px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; color:#221E1F">Elizabeth Bowen, </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">The Heat of the Day </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; color:#221E1F">(London: Random House, 1998), 114 (hereafter cited in text as </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">Heat of the Day</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; color:#221E1F">). </SPAN></LI><LI style="margin-right:34px; margin-left:0px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; color:#221E1F">A typescript marked “alternative version” in the Elizabeth Bowen Collection in the Harry Ransom Center illustrates that Bowen, at some point, wanted to make this link between the sartorial and the social more explicit. First of all, the optional ending of the chapter emphasizes sexual jealousy on Robert’s part who asks Stella overtly not to “‘two-time with Harrison, will you?’” Moreover, the two lovers discuss their relatives and relations in more detail. Accordingly, Stella provides a reason for her request to meet Robert’s family: “‘After all, you’ve met Roderick [Stella’s son] not only once but often—in fact, I should be miserable if you hadn’t.’” Likewise, Robert volunteers more personal information: “‘Oh, so should I; but we both know perfectly well that my mother and Ernestine aren’t to me anything like what Roderick is to you. He is part of you; they’re my origin—if you like.’” Finally, the “khaki tie” features even more prominently as a focal point in the scene. Stella, in an exchange that references a famous case of mistaken affection, even wonders if it could function as keepsake: “‘Yes,’ she said, looking straight at the tie, ‘this will have to go. To feel I should like to keep it is idiotic.’ ‘Like Harriet Smith and Mr Elton’s toe-nails?’ ‘No, dear; it was sticking-plaster she kept.’” Elizabeth Bowen, holograph draft and typescript of </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">The Heat of the Day </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; color:#221E1F">with revisions and inserts, 19–20, Elizabeth Bowen Collection, HRHRC, box 5, folder 2. </SPAN></LI></ol><P style="text-align:justify; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:15px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; color:#221E1F">27.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; color:#221E1F"> J.

I can’t tell you what they will do for my morale, this coming depressing London weather, or how angelically thoughtful I think it was of you to send them—not least to </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; font-style:italic; color:#221E1F">find </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:8.5pt; color:#221E1F">them, for I know that elegant shoes in my outsize are far and few.” Unpublished letter from Elizabeth Bowen to Blanche W.

He accordingly states that modernist writers aim to “show how the discrete object, as the particular representative or crystallization of non-human Being, could exert a powerful hold on the imagination at a time when questions about the meaning of existence seemed unusually pressing” to illustrate modernism’s evident fascination with the things that crowd the modern world.
