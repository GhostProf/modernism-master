      “Imagination,” asserted the journalist John Hollingshead in Dickens’s weekly <span style="font-style:italic;">All the Year Round</span> in 1861, “loves to run wild about underground London, or the sub-ways of any great city.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Seldom, however, have imaginings about the subterranean nineteenth century been unequivocally pleasurable in substance. When praising the order and cleanliness of the modern technology that provided water, drainage, gas, telegraph, transportation, and electricity to the metropolis, scientific discourse never fails to reveal a concomitant concern over the consequences of a failure of technology to fulfill its promise: disorder, accident, death. Nor, for that matter, can one quite bring oneself to describe the scientistic discourse of progress as more than an extremely attenuated form of pleasure. In contrast, there is certainly pleasure and desire at stake in the nineteenth-century fascination with poverty, crime, sex, drugs, and other attributes of the human underbelly of the modern city. Nevertheless, journalistic and literary discourses never fail to displace that desire by measuring the cost of excessive dabbling in the urban underworld. Like the Hays Code that mandated the punishment of any deviant behavior before the closing credits of mid-century Hollywood films, codes of nineteenth-century visual and verbal representation ensured that very seldom indeed would any alternative space or behavior in the city receive a wholly positive representation.
    </p>
<p>
      This should strike us as an unusual state of affairs, for the topics located underground during the nineteenth century—utopian hope in progress and the improvement of the city and desire for individual pleasure—are fundamental sources of happiness.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> In political terms, this situation is perfectly comprehensible: however technocratic it may appear, subterranean infrastructure promised to resolve the pressing problems of sanitation and circulation that arose from the population explosion in nineteenth-century cities such as London and Paris, while progressive authorities and radical activists were appalled by the conditions of the urban poor and exploitative structures within the criminal and sexual underworlds that were most effectively represented as infernal. Consequently, both discourses presented themselves as pragmatic, rationalistic, and sober responses to grave problems of the modern city, with no place for excess of any kind. But excess has long been a characteristic attributed to the underground, as subterranean space has accreted to itself associations both with hell and with paradise, with imprisonment and with shelter, with punishment and with pleasure. What occurs in the dominant framework described above is that pleasure and desire cease to be articulated directly as such, and representations of underground space become split between a technological utopianism and a social miserabilism. The nature of the split manages to excise key and imaginatively powerful elements of the conventional associations of the underground: to wit, the happiness to be derived from the pursuit of individual desire and of social action. The mythic conventions that had located the Elysian Fields within the Roman underworld or romance and adventure within the Celtic otherworld were transformed into the anodyne and universal pleasure of an efficient drainage system and a congestion-free transit system. The individualistic pleasures of the mythic underground manifested themselves only in the highly displaced form of transgressively animal desires, invariably base, selfish, and self-conflictive, and invariably punished severely, either through legal strictures or through narrative conventions. These twinned threads of underground discourse continued to dominate urban writing through the twentieth century: by and large, scientific discourse would focus on the development of infrastructure in terms of technological progress while the humanities and the social sciences would plumb the depths of the “infernal wen,” “the city of dreadful night,” and the many other faces of the infernal metropolis.
    </p>
<p>
      Neither of these dominant discourses is precisely <span style="font-style:italic;">wrong</span>, however; what I want to argue is that the specific constraints of their spatial representations militate against uncovering and articulating alternative spatial practices and possibilities buried within them in the same way that certain medieval crypts incorporate within their Christian depths the material traces of earlier, less orthodoxly religious structures. The conceptual spaces of the nineteenth century may not have found a visible place for them, but these buried pleasures nevertheless do begin to take form if we know where to look for them. And even though Victorianism as a discourse is heavily invested in constraining the scope and significance of individual pleasure and collective desire, there certainly were myriad, if often heavily diluted, forms of happiness to be found in the open air of the nineteenth-century city.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> But the forms of pleasure that interest me here, the ones whose power increases in inverse proportion to their visibility as such, are precisely those which are furthest removed from the conceptual space of open air Victorianism, the ones that suggest both the desires that were lacking if not actively being repressed and the ones that were made visible in new and perhaps unforeseen  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> ways because of the new and unforeseen modes of being suggested by the technology and spatial practices of the modern city. In this essay, I approach these pleasures in two ways, both associated with the child: through representations of nineteenth-century children’s experiences of subterranean space and through a modernist search for pleasure within those nineteenth-century experiences, a pleasure doubly buried, in space and in time. I conclude by considering briefly what is at stake in interpreting these Victorian pleasures as they continue to manifest themselves in popular culture of the last couple of decades.

      </div>

<p>
	There is only one readily available locus for representing unequivocally positive pleasure in the nineteenth-century underground: culture for children. Only in writing aimed at youthful readers are the wide-eyed wonders of technology and the unconflicted pleasures of subterranean Arcadia able to meet and perversely mingle. Thus, in Jules Verne’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Indes noires</span> , an exhausted coal mine can be transformed into a light-saturated, lake-side Coal City [<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>]. Badger’s safe and palatial burrow in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wind and the Willows</span>  can reclaim and redeem the labyrinthine ruins of a derelict (and presumably Victorian) metropolis. In journalistic and sensationalistic writing about children, we find more grime but a residual insistence on the persistence of pleasure even within a sewage space that would destroy any adult foolhardy enough to venture into its depths. Hence, the gang of street children known as the Wild Boys of London can build a safe and dry clubhouse deep in the city sewers without emerging diseased or degenerated from contact with their subterranean environment. And Henry Mayhew’s Mud-lark can crack a mischievous smile as he rolls up his pants legs to wade deeper into the foul Thamesside muck in search of his daily bread [<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>]. Dickens captures both the allure of these images and the need to sublimate them in order to accede to adulthood in the autobiographically-based narrative trajectory of <span style="font-style:italic;">David Copperfield</span>. A favorite activity of young David during his tea break from work at Murdstone and Grinby’s warehouse is “wandering about the Adelphi, because it was a mysterious place, with those dark arches.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> [<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>] Much later, as a young apprentice at Doctor’s Commons in Lincoln’s Inn Field, David measures the distance he has come in terms of that same space, now receded into the conventional underground of proper London: “I turned my face to the Adelphi, pondering on the old days when I used to roam about its subterranean arches, and on the happy changes which had brought me to the surface.”<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	Seldom are built spaces created expressly for children, especially within an urban setting, but children, as the French sociologist Henri Lefebvre well knew, are eminently capable of appropriating space designed for more serious purposes. Lefebvre regarded childhood as a primary source for what he termed “lived space [ . . . ] where the ‘private’ realm asserts itself, albeit more or less vigorously, and always in a way against the public one,” the conceived spaces that dominate the spatial practice of any particular historical moment.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> There are, of course, fairgrounds, amusement parks, and zoological gardens, but the latter in particular is a case in point of the way in which a childhood pleasure—the unambivalent enjoyment of seeing and interacting with the natural world—is contained and conceptualized by a rational space. The compromised space of the zoological garden is evident in the “Full Moon” chapter of P. L. Travers’s Victorianist children’s novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Mary Poppins</span> , where Jane and Michael Banks, following their magical nanny to the London Zoo one night, are first terrified and then awed by the sublime world-turned-upside-down spectacle of freely roaming wild animals taunting caged humans. Even by day, and in a much less transgressive manner, the London Zoo did capture a child’s sense of space in the pair of tunnels linking its extension north of the Outer Circle to the main grounds; upper-class children must similarly have thrilled to the Nursery-maids’ Walk cut by John Nash under the New  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> (now Marylebone) Road between the private green spaces of Park Crescent and Park Square just south of Regent’s Park. Dickens mirrored Nash’s child-friendly utility tunnel at Gadshill, the country house in Higham-by-Rochester, Kent, that he had admired as a child and purchased as an adult in 1856. A public road divided the brick mansion from a miniature Swiss chalet in the garden where he liked to write, so Dickens had a brick-lined tunnel excavated to join the two, through which he would journey every morning, a spatial threshold into the space where he would compose his late novels.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>
	While any space can be appropriated in this manner into a source of childlike, if not childish, pleasure, underground spaces both urban and rural seem particularly amenable to the process. In rural spaces, they tend to merge with the arcadia and secret gardens Humphrey Carpenter identifies as the core image of what he calls the “golden age of children’s literature” from the mid-nineteenth century through to the First World War.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Carpenter is also quick to note that these occluded sites of childhood endlessly preserved from the pressures of modernity and adulthood were available primarily to children of middle class and affluent families, with the less well off left with “the pious trash that the Sunday Schools handed out as ‘reward books’.”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> But doubtless these less privileged children would also have passively consumed the popular literature of urban mysteries, the city children at least, along with the myriad urban sensation scenes in the penny gaffs and East End theaters and transpontine theaters. These presented an urban underground far grittier and more violent than the arcadia of Kingsley, Mac- Donald, and Burnett, with less potential for positive pleasure and more potential for negative social truth. Fortunately there were the material spaces to compensate: riding the Tube, wandering through the Thames Tunnel, and exploring the Adelphi and the other dry arches that predominated in the poorer sections of the city whose inhabitants had not had the means to prevent the train embankments from cutting through their neighborhoods. All of these London spaces provided youthful urban dwellers with opportunities to appropriate the conceptually rational spaces of the new urban underground for their own pleasure and amusement.
      </p>
<p>
	Middle-class Cyril may be the one to step through the magic Regent’s Park arch into ancient Egypt in E. Nesbit’s fantasy novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Magic Amulet</span> , but the “little ragged children playing Ring o’ Roses” around it have equal opportunity to view the moment of transgression.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> We have few traces of the child’s direct experience of underground London. What we do have are the arcadian otherworlds of authors pining for the subterranean virtues they can only imagine, or represent to themselves beyond the city limits and spaces of urban modernity. We have the technology eulogies of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Boy’s Own Papers</span> which, like the Steam Man of nineteenth-century American pulp fiction, promise machine utopia shorn of the hints of destruction and overreaching that lurk around the edges of their adult versions. And we have the dour portraits and fictions of working children: toshers and mud-larks, crossing-sweeps and pickpockets, and flower- and watercress-girls. Emerging in the middle of the century, these are all partial representations of a single spatial practice, all simultaneously distorted and true. And all ask, I think, the same question, but in different ways: how do we recover the spaces of pleasure buried in our childhood when those same spaces have been paved  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> over by a technological modernity that threatens to negate the very phenomena that had caused those pleasures to begin with?
      </p>
<p>
	I should make it clear that I am not claiming the status of ontological truth for childhood pleasure; rather, I want to argue that it is through its burial in a represented space of childhood that those pleasures can be represented as such, just as their negation can be represented in the exploitation visible in the very streets and urban thresholds where they ought in fact to be occurring. They are, in other words, a roundabout mode of articulating dissatisfaction with modernity that the representational modes of modernity do not allow to be articulated directly. Certainly, much has been made by critics of the various forbidden desires the authors of the golden age of children’s literature were displacing onto the otherworlds of their fictions. Walter Benjamin has similarly alerted us to the imaginative and utopian value of the wilder dreams of the industrial age before its inventions were slotted into their proper place within the rational structure of capital. And the irrepressible suffering of resilient children laboring in the streets, while a potent image of the ills of capitalism, is simultaneously a potent image of the refusal of whatever desires we have invested in those images to fade away. That the Victorian era was the great era of repressed desire is a commonplace; that those very sites of repression have proven irresistible to later seekers of lost pleasure suggests that the act of hiding was also powerfully creative. The nineteenth century, as I have argued elsewhere, was the age when the underground, in addition to its function as waste depository and space of repression, was also, and uniquely, productive of new spatial practices.
      </p>
<p>
	It should not surprise us, then, that the four writers most responsible for Carpenter’s “secret garden” image were born within a decade of each other between 1849 and 1860 (Frances Hodgson Burnett in 1849, Edith Nesbit in 1858, Kenneth Grahame in 1859, J. M. Barrie in 1860), experiencing as children the precise years in which representations of urban modernity were taking a dark turn into the Babylonian.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> And perhaps it also should not surprise us, even if it may have disappointed Carpenter, that the next pantheon of children’s writers were born nearly as close together two generations later (A. A. Milne in 1882, Hugh Lofting in 1886, J. R. R. Tolkien in 1892, C. S. Lewis in 1898, P. L. Travers in 1899). Rather than lived as a child and processed as an adult, their nineteenth century would have belonged solely to the not-yet rationalized space of childhood, and their Victorian city filtered second-hand through the lives of their parents. We have tended to view the generational specificity of these writers exclusively in terms of the shock of the Great War at the moment they were coming into adulthood, but I want to argue that their unique spatial and temporal relationship to the nineteenth century marked their writing in an equally profound manner. I focus here on Hugh Lofting, as he is the only one of the four to signal his special investment in the nineteenth century through the Victorian timeframe he assigned to his signature character, John Dolittle, in the series of children’s novels bearing his name.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

</blockquote>
<p>
	  The trench origins of the Doctor Dolittle stories is a commonplace of what little scholarship there is on Hugh Lofting, just as the trench experience has become a commonplace of the more substantial scholarship on J. R. R. Tolkien. And yet it is significant that none of the children’s writers of this generation either formally or thematically rejected the Victorianism that had led to the war to the extreme degree that their modernist contemporaries most certainly did.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> The Australian dancer and actor P. L. Travers did not arrive in England until 1925, but Lofting, Tolkien, Milne, and Lewis all served in the trenches on the Western Front, and we find different echoes of this service in the subterranean spaces that punctuate their fictions. Milne’s Hundred-Acre Wood is certainly the most benign of these spaces and the most strongly and uncritically redolent of the pastoral otherworlds of Victorian children’s writing. Milne’s spaces are simple shelters, half animal burrow and half country dwellings; the only frightening space is the pit dug by Piglet and Pooh as a Heffalump trap, which comically traps them instead. Lewis retains the magical portal to Narnia in the dark back of the Victorian wardrobe, but the primary subterranean space of the series is the vast, evil, and enchanted land of Underworld that is the major setting of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Silver Chair</span>. Like Lewis’s Narnia books (published between 1950 and 1956), the spatial and thematic dynamics of Tolkien’s books of Middle Earth (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Hobbit</span>, 1937, and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lord of the Rings</span>, 1954–55) are at least as heavily influenced by the Second as by the First World War. Nevertheless, the blasted spaces created by the misshapen orcs wherever they go powerfully resonate with the experience of the trenches.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Moreover, the way Tolkien constructed the thematic core of his books around different uses and abuses of the underground—the human inhabitants of Middle Earth are the only race that habitually dwells aboveground, and even so their most powerful and significant architectural accomplishments are seamed with subterranean constructions—places him in direct dialogue with the Victorian underground. Between the extremes of the village arcadia of the hobbit hole and the industrial catacombs of Sauron’s minions, we have a sustained meditation on the pleasures and desires of insularity. Tolkien plots the fortunes of war by the way in which subterranean spaces rapidly oscillate in their identity between pastoral pleasure and urban suffering, implicitly arguing that the Victorian separation between the two forms of space had become unstable if not downright untenable.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	  Although he portrayed insularity as under siege by the forces of modernity, Tolkien appears never to have relinquished a belief in its superiority as a spatial practice. While the repeated quest structures fill the books with medievalist journeys through the underworld in search of knowledge and truth, those journeys (Bilbo meeting Gollum, Bilbo and the dwarves’ escape from the elves of Mirkwood, Gandalf in the Mines of Moria, Aragorn and his companions walking the Paths of the Dead, Frodo and Sam in Shelob’s lair and at Mount Doom, to name the most prominent) tend to be so traumatic that their retrospective necessity barely if at all mitigates the ordeal, and scars the participants for life. At the same time, the loss of mythically wondrous built spaces (the Lonely Mountain, the Mines of Moria, Erech and the paths of the dead, Minas Anor, Orthanc) to the forces of evil is nearly always predicated on a biblical sense of overreaching, either Babel-style to the skies or Satan-style to the depths. The simple, childlike pleasures of the rural undergrounds of the Shire hobbit holes—food, drink, companionship, and fireworks—hearken back to the Victorian, but whereas Grahame’s Badger could unproblematically re-appropriate the ruins of an ancient metropolis, Tolkien’s hobbits risk being fundamentally transformed by any direct contact with the urban underground.
	</p>
<p>
	  The underground dynamics of the early Victorian world of Lofting’s Doctor Dolittle series are quite different from those of Tolkien’s Middle Earth. All but one written between 1920 and 1933, the dozen volumes of the series are indelibly marked by their composition between the wars, from their inspiration, according to Lofting, in his sympathy over the unmitigated suffering of army horses at the Western Front, to their assault on the fundamental Western assumption of human superiority to animals.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> But the books are also the most explicitly indebted of any of the modernist children’s writers to the nineteenth century, not only as a source of critique, but as a site of buried pleasure and utopianism. The series’ temporal location in early Victorian England (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage of Doctor Dolittle</span> is explicitly set in 1839, and the series more generally located in the first half of the century) has not gone unobserved by critics. In his colonialist reading of the novels, David Steege notes how the temporal situation allows Lofting “to emphasize the best side of Britain’s interventions in African affairs,” in keeping with Dolittle’s paternalistic ameliorism and avoiding confrontation with early twentieth-century imperialism.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Elick views the historical setting as allowing Lofting “both a rosy lens for viewing the past and a platform from which to criticize the march of human history,” in particular, as she shows, the ways in which “eminent Victorian virtues [ . . . ] propelled English society into the Great War.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> The plausibility of both explanations begins to suggest the extent of Lofting’s engagement with the Victorian; I want to add to the depth of that engagement by considering the specific nature of Lofting’s subterranean utopianism and the ways in which the early Victorian also offered him a portal further into the hidden past.
	</p>
<p>
	  Margaret Blount testifies to the originality of the series’ central conceit of human-animal communication “in human terms of words and grammar”<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a>; it becomes clear as the series progresses (the novels are linked or nested one within the other in such a way as to constitute a single massive <span style="font-style:italic;">roman-fleuve</span>) that Lofting views this discovery on a  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> par with the contemporaneous inventions of paleontology and archaeology with which he frequently links Dolittle’s scientific endeavors, especially in Africa. The subtlety of Lofting’s achievement in these novels is not only to allow communication with animals that are, as Blount puts it, “not only much nicer than most people, [and] also more intelligent than many of them,” but, as Elick argues, to use a dialogic structure that gives these animals their own voice in such a way that their radical questioning at times even undercuts Dolittle’s more liberal vision of a benevolently human-centered world in which animals would be well treated.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Large portions of many of the novels are taken up by tales nested within tales told by various creatures to the Doctor, the members of his household, and various other animal communities. Moreover, as Schmidt has argued, the presence of Dolittle’s young apprentice, Thomas Stubbins, as either implicit or explicit narrator of nearly all of the books situates the novel’s subjectivity not in the fairly static and idealized character of the Doctor, but in a re that develops markedly as an individual over the years of the series’ publication.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> But Stubbins’s development is neither a maturation into adult middle-class values as in the Dickensian model nor the refusal to grow up characteristic of so much Victorian children’s literature; rather, he is the primary catalyst in the production of an alternative model of Victorian space that appears to be Lofting’s approximation of what would happen if the lived spaces of children and animals were allowed to develop into maturity unimpinged by the repressive structures of Victorianism.
	</p>
<p>
	  While Dolittle for the most part can be termed a holy fool in terms of money and convention, Stubbins is highly conscious of both but able to subordinate this consciousness in order to gratify his desire to wander, nurture the animal kingdom, and remain free. Gaining in ability as a mediator between the Doctor and the outside world, he promises to preserve the Doctor’s legacy into future generations. This is not to say that Stubbins’s existence is staid or banal: he travels around the world on a number of vessels, journeys beneath the sea inside a giant glass-shelled snail, and flies to the moon on the back of a lunar moth. His first task of major responsibility is the establishment of the Dolittle Zoo in the capacious gardens of the Doctor’s house in Puddleby-on-the- Marsh, for which he must both follow his mentor’s idea of a zoo and satisfy the animals’ own conceptions of one:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    I felt very proud that the Doctor had intrusted such a large measure of the responsibility to me. [ . . . ] “Animal Town” or “Animal Clubland” is really what it should have been called, instead of a zoo. [ . . . ] But if it wasn’t a regular zoo to the ordinary public’s way of thinking, it was very certainly Doctor Dolittle’s idea of one. In his opinion, a zoo should be an animals’ home, not an animals’ prison. Every detail of our zoo [ . . . ] was worked out with this idea foremost in mind, that the animals should be made comfortable and happy. [ . . . ] There were certain rules, it is true, although the Doctor was not fond of rules, but they were all drawn up to protect the animals against one another, rather than to enslave or cut off their liberty in any way. For instance, any one wishing to give a party had to notify his next-door neighbor (they were very close, of course); and no tenant was allowed to sing comic songs after midnight.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  It should be observed that, for all of their good intentions, none of the Doctor’s schemes, including the zoo, endure for very long. This is one of the ways in which Lofting keeps his reader conscious of the frame of the world around the enclosed spaces in which the Doctor constantly retreats with his inner circle of animals and which, while not always invasive, always exerts pressure upon the fantastic spaces within. But, as above, Dolittle also never loses sight of the equal pressure of inevitable disharmony within nature. The dogs are unable to refrain from chasing and teasing the rats and mice; even on the moon, where the sole human inhabitant has cobbled together a pacifist and vegetarian community in apparently perfect harmony, we eventually learn that the cats as a group have opted out of the agreement, and live on the planet in uneasy isolation from the greater community.
	</p>
<p>
	  But it is the relationship between animals and humans that creates the most strife and yet also constitutes an inescapable reality within Dolittle’s utopian schemes. This is not only because of the benevolent necessity of Stubbins and Dolittle to ameliorate the situation of animals both in terms of their plight and in terms of their subordination to the human race. Dolittle first learns animal speech as the result of discovering that the real ailment suffered by a cart horse is nearsightedness: it needs glasses. There are strong resonances in this aspect of the books with nineteenth-century philanthropy, as when Jip the dog uses his share of the profits from the Dolittle circus to establish the East End Free Bone Counter for Indigent Dogs in a Whitechapel cellar.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> But Dolittle’s ideas also at times exceed those conventions: Jip is able to establish his Bone Counter because the Doctor has made his circus a profit-sharing cooperative among animal and human participants alike. In other episodes, he breaks into a London pet shop to liberate the poorly kept animals within, travels across England with a disguised seal he has set free from a circus, and books passage for several of his circus animals in a specially outfitted ship to return them to their homelands in Africa. Such excessive moments in the novels make it difficult to reduce them to an allegory of class relations, of race relations, or of childhood. However, at times, the animals are represented in terms associated with these three categories: the character and speech of Cheapside the London sparrow, who lives in a nest in St. Edmund’s left ear outside St. Paul’s, resonate with representations of the nineteenth-century poor; the long oral history of Chee Chee the monkey’s family and other episodes in the African parts of the series reflect conventional representations of indigenous communities; and Gub Gub the pig’s lack of self-control and fantasies of limitless consumption of food resemble typical representations of childish desires. The ways that Lofting’s narratives exceed those conventions provide an indirect critique of the limitations of those representations and also prevent his conception from being reduced to any of these discourses, even in the moments, as Steege details in terms of colonialism, when they touch most closely on them.
	</p>
<p>
	  To imagine a world of animals set magically apart from the world of men and women, as Milne does, for example, in the Pooh books, is to imagine a world reducible to the child’s space, and that consequently must be left behind when that child, inevitably, grows up. What Lofting does instead is to reimagine the world according to a child’s  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">experience</span> of space, partly because the child’s experience is the closest he can come to approximating an animal’s experience. He does this realistically enough that we must reckon with the consequences of the reimagining rather than dismissing them out of hand as fantasy. When the Rat and Mouse Club wishes to invite the Doctor and Stubbins to their Mooniversary dinner, Lofting is at pains both to represent a fittingly mouse-like space, “rather like a bee-hive [ . . . ] a sort of thick hollow dome, in the shell of which were the living rooms, furnished apartments, private dining-saloons, committee-rooms, etc.” and find a way to fit the human guests within that space: they get the badgers “to dig a tunnel down under the foundations” and into the Assembly Room “where there was just space enough for the two of us to stand upright, very close together.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> [<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>] Like the great Rat City carved beneath the ruins of a human town in the Volcano Rat’s tale (one of those recounted at the Mooniversary dinner), the Rat and Mouse Club at once resembles a human space in its organization and institutions and is alien to that space. The dialogic nature of the presentation of this Club, like the Home for Crossbred Dogs and the tales that emerge from its spaces, withholds judgment, allowing the reader either to smile or to admire, or both at once.
	</p>
<p>
	  The series is replete with such spaces, from the hidden clearing within the bird’s island off the West-African coast of Fantippo that becomes a safe meeting-place for all the world’s birds in <span style="font-style:italic;">Doctor Dolittle’s Post Office</span> to the secret lake in the African interior where Mudface, the world’s oldest creature, lives on the ruins of an antediluvian metropolis (<span style="font-style:italic;">Post Office</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Doctor Dolittle and the Secret Lake</span>), to the library Stubbins excavates in the garden to house and preserve the Doctor’s massive collection of notebooks and leaves in charge of the mice (<span style="font-style:italic;">Doctor Dolittle’s Return</span>), to the entire utopian space of the moon (<span style="font-style:italic;">Doctor Dolittle in the Moon</span>). A number of these spaces are literally subterranean; others assume qualities associated with underground space by virtue of their occlusion from human sight and knowledge. There are also moments of conventionally Victorian subterranea, especially in the tale of Pippinella the Green Canary and star soprano of the Dolittle Opera, whose eventful life story reads like an urban mystery: she survives a revolution, works as a canary in a coal mine, and is adopted by an incognito duke who is writing a Chartist exposé on social injustice that a thief hides in a secret cellar beneath the abandoned windmill where the duke had lived before fleeing persecution by government agents. Rescued by the Doctor from a dirty petshop, Pippinella is a voice from a different, more conventional space, the Victorian diva of a serial publication apart from the Dolittle series.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> But elsewhere, Lofting appears determined to formulate a truly alternative space of pleasure and harmony out of the stark divisions of the Victorian underground.

	  Central to this alternative conception is a sense of children’s delight in the underground, and that child’s perspective is also what allows Lofting to evade the otherwise divisive conventions of the Victorianist underground. Whether strictly subterranean or not, Lofting’s alternative spaces are always otherworldly, but the way in which they are grounded in the reality of animal burrows, warrens, and tunnels prevents this otherworldly quality from being purely fantastic. Like the technological imaginations that spurred subterranean urbanism in speculative fiction of the second half of the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> century, Lofting’s utopias are fanciful musings extrapolated from given data. Rather than projected forward into the future, however, they extend backwards into the dawn of civilization, a past that is simultaneously mythic in a religious sense and earnestly scientific in its anthropology. The ambivalence and contradictions that inevitably emerge from these representations, however, are not the unconscious blind spots that make subterranean urbanism so revealing (although Lofting certainly has such blind spots in the realm of colonialism in particular), but the conscious articulation of insoluble dilemmas that is characteristic of modernist fiction. Increasingly pessimistic about the capacity of the twentieth century to frame the questions he wanted to pose, Lofting found in the nineteenth century a moment and a mode of representation in which those questions could still be framed. And while it is not characteristic of modernism as conventionally considered to find such sources for pleasure within the generally repudiated spaces of the Victorian, it is a trait Lofting shares with a number of Continental writers of the same period, for whom the nineteenth-century city was a similar source to be mined for alternative visions of the contemporary world.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

</blockquote>
<p>
	    There is a modernist tradition of taking the child’s point of view as a critical perspective, and its theoretical underpinnings are based in its unique relationship to the nineteenth century. The principal proponent of this tradition was Walter Benjamin, and he meant it to provide the historical justification for the innovative cultural history he undertook in his Arcades Project, a study of the nineteenth-century urban culture in the ruins of which he considered his childhood to have taken place. Benjamin maintained his theory of modernity to be distinct from the typically modernist rejection of their parents’ generation—think Virginia Woolf’s parody of her father Leslie Stephen’s approach to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dictionary of National Biography</span> in <span style="font-style:italic;">To the Lighthouse</span> as Mr. Ramsay’s obsession with getting past “Q” in the logically sequenced alphabet of knowledge. But Benjamin also differentiated himself from the tabula rasa approach of avant-garde movements such as the futurists and, especially, the surrealists, for whom, as for Benjamin, the buried traces of the nineteenth century were clues to the disastrous state of the present. The surrealists were invested in a buried nineteenth century that, located in the present, could point toward an alternate future, a modern mythology, as Louis Aragon put it. Benjamin shared the investment in an alternate future, as he shared the high modernist rejection of Victorianism and other nineteenth-century discourses of progress, rationalism, and imperialism; however, he believed the alternate future lay in an alternate past buried somewhere in the material and artistic culture of the nineteenth century more than in anything available in the present day.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Benjamin framed this belief under the rubric of the child, not as a subjective memory, but as an objective relationship to the past, “The fact that we were children during this time belongs together with its objective image. It had to be this way in order to produce this generation.”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Writing of the repeated descriptions of interiors that haunt the writings of Franz Kafka (born in 1883, and thus nine years Benjamin’s senior): “And this experience remains an inalienable possession of his generation, his only—and therefore ours, because only for it do the horror-furniture of incipient high capitalism fill the scenes of its most luminous childhood experiences.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Because children experience space differently than when they become socialized into its conventional meanings, their representations and memories of it provide different information about it than adults’ more conventional experience of spaces. For Benjamin, those who were children around 1900 had no rational link to the nineteenth century, only a dreaming, childhood relationship, filtered, moreover, through the half-perceived traces of their parents’ childhood in the true Victorianism of the middle of the century—the inherited furniture and décor of the interiors; the musty books; the spatial conrations of family houses and apartments. This fragmented experience of the century was made all the more unique by its having been truncated by the First World War, which was seen to have  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> sundered his generation from the certainties reflected in the accumulated generations of Victoriana. For previous generations, “To live in these interiors was to have woven a dense fabric about oneself, to have secluded oneself within a spider’s web, in whose toils world events hang loosely suspended like so many insects sucked dry. From this cavern, one does not like to stir.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> Stirred by the war and then by the great migrations of the 1920s and 30s, which saw him first a voluntary and then an involuntary exile in Paris, Benjamin combed his childhood memories not for consolation, but for encoded answers and ways in which the present somehow could have turned out differently.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Rather than displacing and dismissing these memories into the fantasy spaces of children’s literature, Benjamin sought a way to use them as theoretical tools without thereby distorting their insights. The child’s city was prophetic, but only in retrospect, Benjamin argued in <span style="font-style:italic;">Berlin Childhood around 1900</span>, an autobiographical memoir that eschews the facts of autobiography in favor of a search for an historical truth available only in the unadulteratedly lived spaces of an urban childhood. Benjamin worked on this short book, which he considered an essential pendant to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Arcades Project</span>, throughout the 1930s, publishing twelve excerpts in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Frankfurter Zeitung</span> in 1935. (Reading these in exile, fellow Berlin native, exile, and exact contemporary Erich Auerbach in a letter to Benjamin praised “your ‘Childhood’ book, being of course the book of our own childhood as well.”)<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> In brief texts such as “The Sock,” Benjamin suggested the basis of the theory of dialectical images to be realized in the tissue of quotations, metaphors, and theoretical aphorisms of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Arcades Project</span>:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      The first cabinet that would yield whenever I wanted was the wardrobe. I had only to pull on the knob, and the door would click open and spring toward me. Among the nightshirts, aprons, and undershirts which were kept there in the back was the thing that turned the wardrobe into an adventure for me. I had to clear a way for myself to its farthest corner. There I would come upon my socks, which lay piled in traditional fashion - that is to say, rolled up and turned inside out. Every pair had the appearance of a little pocket. For me, nothing surpassed the pleasure of thrusting my hand as deeply as possible into its interior. I did not do this for the sake of the [ . . . ] warmth. It was the “little present” rolled up inside that I always held in my hand and that drew me into the depths. When I had closed my fist around it and, as far as I was able, made certain that I possessed the stretchable woolen mass, there began the second phase of the game, which brought with it the unveiling. For now I proceeded to unwrap “the present,” to tease it out of its woolen pocket. I drew it ever nearer to me, until something rather disconcerting would happen: I had brought out “the present,” but the “pocket” in which it had lain was no longer there. I could not repeat the experiment on this phenomenon often enough. It taught me that form and content, the veil and what is veiled, are the same. It led me to draw truth from works of literature as warily as the child’s hand retrieves the sock from “the pocket.”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    Rather than generating a modernist manifesto of the indissolubility of form and content within the present context of the 1930s, Benjamin discovers it buried deep in a nineteenth-century wardrobe, no doubt passed down through several generations of his Berlin family, an otherwise negligible detail of a typical upper-middle class childhood. The translation makes it difficult to grasp the degree to which Benjamin’s language  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> enacts the paradox of form and content his image wants to impart, but the lineaments of the episode stand out clearly. It is a sensual, if not sexual feeling of pleasure that sends the child’s hand into the drawers in search of the socks, but all of the pleasure is in the process, since the result is “something rather disconcerting”: the disappearance of the very object being manipulated. The same gesture enfolds the greater process of remembering that Benjamin wants to enact, and the methodological tightrope he would try to walk in the Arcades Project between material traces and theoretical mediation. It equally enfolds the re of the child itself, for whom the spectacle of the awesome spaces of the nineteenth-century city fails to hypnotize as it does the bourgeois spider in its web only because the child is too mimetic not to project itself into the inanimate objects around it.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The child, for Benjamin, is like the sock, back then still piled in pairs “in traditional fashion,” both containing and constituting the buried pleasure of that “present” he wishes to tease out of its woolen pocket. If, as I argued to begin this essay, the child’s space was the only one in which the occluded truths of nineteenth-century culture could appear in their full potential, then we can understand the allure of those spaces to a critic like Benjamin who saw them as his own birthright. And we can similarly understand the gesture of Lofting (six years Benjamin’s senior) or Tolkien (born the same year as Benjamin) in working through the trauma of the war and all the modernity that lay behind it by finding a way back through its break and into a buried past that might promise a path to a different present. To be sure, a quixotic endeavor, but, as Benjamin made clear, an endeavor uniquely full of objectively true meaning for the single generation that made it.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Doubly buried, both in their place <span style="font-style:italic;">within</span> the nineteenth century and in the past <span style="font-style:italic;">of</span> the nineteenth century, these childish pleasures were dear to Benjamin or Lofting or Tolkien precisely because they were impermanent and imperiled. But how does the unique specificity of meaning claimed by these images for their writers coexist with the pull toward universality of the child’s love of dark, warm, hidden spaces? In the animal pleasures of Doctor Dolittle and the child’s epistemology of Benjamin’s theory of experience I think we are catching a last glimpse of a burgeoning modernity perceived personally—through the lived space of the child—rather than solely as representation, as modernism. For those who were children at its very end, the nineteenth century was still a great baggy monster, its exuberant richness and overwhelming plenty forming themselves in retrospect as the reverse image of everything the modernist would be: polished, precise, hermetic, and unitary. The resurgence since the 1970s of subterranean Victoriana within popular culture, especially in the many forms taken by steampunk in film, literature, and material culture, suggests dissatisfaction with the smoothly conceptual perfection of modernism as well as with the certainties of mainstream contemporary Victorianism. There is no space here to examine in detail steampunk’s perverse and playful trawl through the dusty corners and back alleys of the nineteenth century in order to generate alternative pasts and encase cutting-edge gadgets in the patina of outdated technology [<a name="5-text" href="#5">. 5 and 6</a>]. Freed of the weight of history that motivated Benjamin, Lofting, and other modernists, the ideological agenda of steampunk  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

		For an argument that Lofting’s oeuvre does indeed fit within the conventional rubric of modernist fiction, see Catherine Elick, “Anxieties of an Animal Rights Activist: The Pressures of Modernity in Hugh Lofting’s Doctor Dolittle Series,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Children’s Literature Association Quarterly</span> 32, no. 4 : 323–39. Elick bases her argument on chronology, on Lofting’s “radical, pacifist, and unconventional” protagonist , and on the paradigm shift from a human-centered world. In other words, she is arguing (and quite persuasively) for an expansion of the critical parameters of modernism rather than asserting Lofting’s place within the formal experimentation as which it is conventionally defined.
