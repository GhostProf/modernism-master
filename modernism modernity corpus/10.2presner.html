I. Introduction
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In his opening speech at the second Zionist Congress in Basel on August
28, 1898, Max Nordau invented one of German Zionism's most famous,
most fraught, and most challenging concepts: the "muscle Jew."
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 Although Nordau did not start exploring the political implications
 of his initial call for a "muscle Jewry" until a couple of years
 later, he clearly alluded, in this early speech, to the necessity
 of creating a new type of Jew&#8212;corporeally strong, sexually
 potent, and morally fit&#8212;as the precondition for realizing
 the national goals of Zionism. After providing an overview of the
 steadily deteriorating situation of Jews in Russia, Romania, and
 Galicia&#8212;what he terms "the classic countries of Jewish suffering"
 (<i>SP,</i> 2:15)&#8212;Nordau turns to France and suggests that the
 widespread anti-Semitism that sparked the Dreyfus Affair was also a
 fatal affront to the Enlightenment ideal of universally recognized
 human rights. He argues that the Jews themselves must change their
 desperate historical situation, and that it is "Zionism [that will]
 awaken Judaism to new life." He continues, "It achieves this morally
 [<i>sittlich</i>] through the rejuvenation of the ideals of the
 <i>Volk</i> and corporeally [<i>k&ouml;rperlich</i>] through the
 physical rearing of one's offspring, in order to create a lost muscle
 Jewry [<i>Muskeljudenthum</i>] once again" (<i>SP,</i> 2:24).

<p>
Nordau's idea of a muscle Jewry was not only consistent with the national
goals of the Zionist movement: simultaneously the spiritual and the
corporeal rebirth of the Jewish people, as articulated by Theodor Herzl
and other early Zionist proponents;
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>

<b></b>

it was also the crystallization of these goals on the individual
body of the Jew. National regeneration would come through moral and
physical rebirth and, recursively, moral and physical regeneration
would be achieved though nationality. Indeed, the concept of the muscle
Jew resonated immediately because it brought mythic elements of the
Jewish tradition to bear upon the turbulent historical reality of fin
de si&egrave;cle Europe, marked by both a raging political uncertainty
and a condensation of conflicting intellectual currents ranging from
decadence to social Darwinism.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 Nordau called upon both a great Jewish past and a redeemed future,
 a convergence that would give the fledgling Zionist movement its
 present direction and historical rationale. Contrary to contemporary
 anti-Semitic representations of Jews as scrawny, weak, and inferior
 (an image also internalized by many Jews through the violent mechanisms
 of self-hatred), Jews were at one time, Nordau reminded his readership,
 muscular and heroic, as the mythic story of Bar Kochba attested.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Not by chance, "Bar Kochba" and the "Maccabees" also became two of the
 names adopted by the newly formed Zionist gymnastic associations. In
 fact, Nordau would publish the first complete expression of his call for
 "Muscle Jewry" in an article in the second issue of <i>Die J&uuml;dische
 Turnzeitung</i> (The Jewish gymnastics journal), the central organ
 of the "Bar Kochba" Gymnastics Association and a key venue for the
 dissemination of German Zionism up through the end of World War I.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 In this decisive article, he describes Bar Kochba as "the last
 world-historical embodiment of a war-hardened, weapon-happy Judaism"
 as well as "a hero who refused to know defeat" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1900,
 no. 2:10).

<p>
Over the formative and tumultuous two decades between 1898 and the end of
World War I, Nordau's reinvented muscle Jew would become one of the most
emblematic res of German Zionism's "body culture." Iterations of the
muscle Jew would appear in a fascinatingly wide range of discourses on
corporeal regeneration, which simultaneously addressed the reformation
of the individual body and the reconstruction of the body politic of
the desired nation. Beyond Nordau and the pages of <i>Die J&uuml;dische
Turnzeitung</i>, these intersecting Zionist discourses extended from
the aesthetic and the therapeutic to the eugenic and the colonial. In
the visual arts, for example, the iconography of E. M. Lilien, the most
important and prolific Zionist artist of the early twentieth century,
is inseparable from the "Hellenic" athletes that inspired Nordau's
competitive muscle Jew; in medicine and eugenics, the muscle Jew
represents a radically hygienic and racially charged counterimage to the
"degeneracy" of the <i>Ostjude;</i> and in Zionist colonial discourses,
the strength of the muscle Jew is the prerequisite for successfully
building a nation in Palestine. What these seemingly diffuse discourses
share is a national investment in the images and rhetoric of regeneracy.

<p>
To illustrate this convergence of discourses, let me begin by
drawing attention to two overdetermined images produced during
the first decade of Zionism. The first image (<a name="1"
HREF="10.2presner_res.html#1"> 1</a>), produced and printed
in Berlin in 1904, is an illustration by E. M. Lilien for the first
edition of the journal <i>Altneuland</i> (Old-new land). The second
(<a name="2" href="10.2presner_res.html#2"> 2</a>),
"Auswanderung nach Pal&auml;stina" (Emigration to Palestine), was
published around the same time in the anti-Semitic slapstick journal,
<i>Kikeriki,</i> based in Vienna.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 Both images, which can be read productively in dialogue with one
 another, depict Jews migrating

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 272]</b>

to Palestine. In Lilien's illustration, we see two muscle Jews, rendered
as gigantic Hellenic athletes, carrying an even larger bounty of grapes
to the Promised Land. The two Jews walk barefoot across the top of the
earth, which is itself shaped by the rounded word <i>Altneuland</i> and
gently accented by blades of protruding grass. Their muscular res are
silhouetted in front of two spheres, outlining the earth and probably
the rising sun. In the caricature from <i>Kikeriki,</i> we see a band
of seven Jews crammed together front-to-back holding a crudely carved,
pointed spear labeled "Zionismus." The grotesquely distorted Jews have
bodies marked by exaggerated "Jewish" features including small statures,
large noses, and bulky feet.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 Their ugly countenances emerge directly from the anti-Semitic
 imagination: The first and third Jews display profiles of vapid
 eagerness; the second Jew appears conniving and mischievous;
 the fourth and fifth seem learned but petty; the sixth looks
 wide-eyed and greedy; the last bespectacled Jew has a countenance
 of unspeakable haughtiness. This motley crew wends its way through
 a dense forest&#8212;populated by preying vultures, giant insects,
 and exotic foliage&#8212;on its way to Palestine.

<p>
Lilien's illustration was published at the height of his popularity
as the foremost artist of Zionism, and the drawing shares a stylistic
resemblance to other pictures that he created for the Zionist cause
during this period.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 Although he had produced many prior images of Jews with bulging muscles
 (see <a name="3" href="10.2presner_res.html#3"> 3</a>),
 this illustration was unique in bringing the masculinity of Hellenism
 together with the Zionist national project. Except for a wreath of
 leaves in his hair, the first bearded man stands naked, his clenched
 fists and taut muscles exhibiting a sculpted male beauty; the second,
 wrapped in a partly diaphanous cloth, is slightly taller, younger,
 and more muscular. In contrast to the seven dwarflike Jews in the
 <i>Kikeriki</i> illustration,
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 the two men do not touch each other and are, instead, separated by a
 magnificent abundance of grapes. The bundle of grapes signifies the
 fertility of the land, perhaps standing in for a woman. The phallic
 rod that runs the length of the illustration not only gives an element
 of depth to the image through its diagonal placement on the two Jews'
 opposing shoulders; it also highlights and penetrates the feminine
 fertility of the lush bunch of grapes. Whereas Lilien deflects
 homosexual contact through a symbolic feminine presence necessary for
 nation building, the <i>Kikeriki</i> caricature depicts the seven male
 Jews in compromising postures holding a phallic spear that penetrates
 them all. Here, Zionism is to be interpreted as the foolish product
 of malformed, homosexual Jews.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>

<p>
But perhaps even more relevant to the Zionist project of national
regeneration is the fact that both of these images link the individual
body of the Jew to the larger project of state formation. Lilien's muscle
Jews are in the process of relocating their reproductive fertility to
the "old-new land" of Palestine, and the Jews of the <i>Kikeriki</i>
caricature are viciously mocked as silly degenerates whimsically
attempting to found a state. Even if the latter survive the hostile
terrain populated by wild mushrooms, flocking vultures, and insects as
big as their noses, surely, we are made to believe, they could never
establish a state like the great European powers.

<p>
Giving a visual illustration of Houston Stewart Chamberlain's race-based
anti-Semitic argument in his magnum opus, <i>Foundations of the Nineteenth
Century,</i> the <i>Kikeriki</i> caricature shows Jews as anything but
"world-historical" people. Not only are present-day 

<b></b>

Jews racially unfit for nation building, but Jews have, according to
Chamberlain's version of history, always been so. In this vein, after
describing the physical, religious, and cultural deficiencies of the
Jews in his chapter "On the Entrance of the Jews into Western History,"
Chamberlain turns back to the history of the Judeans to show how Jews,
unlike Germans, have never been able to found a great nation:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
They were so unwarlike, such unreliable soldiers that their king had to
trust his protection and the protection of their land to foreign troops;
they were so unwilling to undertake any endeavors that just looking at
the ocean . . . horrified them; they were so slothful that for every
task at hand one had to hire designers, production managers, and even
handworkers from neighboring countries for all the delicate work; they
were so unfit for agriculture that (as it says in many places in the Bible
and the Talmud) the Canaanites were not just their teachers but were the
only ones up until the end who worked the land; yes, even in a purely
political respect, they were such opponents of all stable, well-ordered
conditions that no rational form of government could come about by them
and they felt best from early on under the pressure of foreign rule,
something that did not prevent them, however, from burrowing underneath
it. [<i>GNJ,</i> 1:454]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Through their scheming, their "materialistic worldview," and their
"demonic genius" (<i>GNJ,</i> 1:455), the Jews have, despite (or perhaps
because of) their laziness and other deficiencies, nevertheless managed
to survive as a race under the rule of other nations; however, they remain
nothing more than a "foreign element," Chamberlain argues, quoting Herder
with approbation (<i>GNJ,</i> 1:463). Because of these transhistorical
racial qualities, Jews can never know the greatness of having their
own nation. Even Zionism, because it, too, is always already "Jewish,"
is condemned to fail, as the <i>Kikeriki</i> caricature portrays in no
uncertain terms.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 By contrast, the Germans, Chamberlain maintains, building on Hegel's
 quadripartite structuring of history, represent the pinnacle of
 "world history" because their cultural and national strength is the
 outgrowth of the great colonial empires of Greece and Rome. That
 the little Jews are depicted sauntering along on foot&#8212;rather
 than traveling by ship&#8212;is thus highly significant. After all,
 reckoning with the ocean, traveling by ship, and cultivating the
 new land are world-historical achievements that, according to both
 Chamberlain and Hegel, assure a colonial claim to national greatness.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>

<p>
Lilien's Hellenic depiction of two muscle Jews walking on top of the
earth with the bounty of fertility thus represents a very different
history of Judaism. The Jews here are great, as indicated by their sheer
scale, and quite capable of domesticating nature and cultivating the
land. But even more striking are the colonial tasks that the journal,
with Lilien's frontispiece, envisioned for itself. The title "Altneuland"
was a direct reference to Herzl's 1902 utopian travel novel of the same
name, in which Jews settle Palestine and transform it from a "desert
wasteland" into a vibrant, technologically modern nation-state.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 Jews not only cultivate the soil, they arrive by ship&#8212;just as
 Herzl did in 1898 for his famous visit to Palestine with the German
 Kaiser&#8212;to civilize this supposedly backward land. "Jewish settlers
 who streamed into this country brought with them the experiences of
 the whole civilized world [i.e., Europe]," Herzl declares in his novel.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

<p>
While Herzl imagined the novel as taking place in 1923, some two decades
after it was written, the journal <i>Altneuland</i> was founded in 1904
(the year of Herzl's death) with the express purpose of investigating
the scientific and economic conditions for the Jewish colonization of
Palestine. As the frontispiece indicates, the journal was to serve "the
economic tapping of Palestine." The first edition laid out the tasks to
be accomplished:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
We have to know the land precisely on which the house of Ahasver will
stand. . . . The journal shall collect and examine what those who
know the land best know about its climate, its soil, its fruits and
products, its laws and their operation, the customs of its inhabitants,
its health conditions . . . it will collect reports about agriculture,
business, and trade with all neighboring areas and countries with similar
natural resources and composition. . . . It shall collect and examine
what is well-known by all colonial enterprises [<i>kolonisatorische
Unternehmungen</i>] across the world. . . . Like a focal point, the
journal will bring together all of the thousands of scattered rays into
a single bundle of light in order to enlighten the half-darkened land of
two thousand years of desire, which is today only illuminated by shadows.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As the mission statement of the journal makes clear, one of the
critical prerequisites of the successful colonization of Palestine
was extensive scientific knowledge about the land, its inhabitants,
and their customs. Moreover, utilizing the rhetoric and metaphors of
the Enlightenment, the Jewish colonial effort would be consistent with
the European idea of colonization as the spread of "civilization," the
domestication of nature, and the dispensing of knowledge to those in the
shadowy darkness of the land. At the same time, as Lilien's frontispiece
shows, Palestine was not just to be scientifically studied and objectively
analyzed but also actively populated and civilized by muscle Jews
who were arriving from Europe&#8212;on foot and by ship&#8212;in the
"old-new land."

<p>
As I hope is already evident, then, Nordau's invention of the muscle Jew
cannot be adequately understood apart from the paradoxical condensation
of multiple discourses concerning the politics of regeneracy and the
deployment of sexuality for the purpose of nation formation. Strangely,
however, no study of the body culture of German Zionism has tried to
analyze comprehensively the discourses of the muscle Jew in this way. In
fact, when the muscle Jew is discussed, the concept is either largely
confined to Nordau's idiosyncratic intellectual biography or considered an
exemplary instance of anxieties over Jewish masculinity and nationality.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 In the latter camp, George Mosse undoubtedly produced the most
 substantial corpus of work dedicated to the exploration of the topos
 of masculinity within nineteenth- and twentieth-century European
 nationalisms.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 But what Mosse does not do&#8212;and this applies to all the studies I
 have encountered in which the concept is mentioned&#8212;is consider
 the muscle Jew as a discursive formation, one that both emerged from
 Nordau's aesthetic reflections on regeneration and lived on in a range
 of discourses that extended and justified the corporeal politics of
 German Zionism.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 In this article, I propose to do just that and pursue the more modest
 goal of examining the genesis of the muscle Jew discourse within
 Nordau's theories of regeneracy as well as the visual culture of <i>Die
 J&uuml;dische Turnzeitung</i>.

<p>
Critics are still somewhat split between those who view Nordau's Zionism
as a "sudden eruption" and those who see "no real division in his thought
between his Zionism and the world-view he outlined in his non-Zionist
and earlier writings."
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 I want to argue here that Nordau's articulation of the muscle Jew
 is informed by the same logic of "education," "discipline," and
 "regeneration" found in the 1892 project of <i>Degeneration</i> and,
 therefore, that his Zionism&#8212;especially his conceptualization
 of the muscle Jew&#8212;is anything but a "sudden eruption." In what
 follows, then, I first give a reading of Nordau's <i>Degeneration,</i>
 taking seriously the terms of his analysis, in order to distill

<b></b>

the corporeal and aesthetic concepts that will later inform his
understanding of the tasks of Zionism. From there, I turn to a detailed
analysis of the first years of the muscle Jew discourse vis-&agrave;-vis
the project of <i>Degeneration.</i> What I want to show is that all the
traits that Nordau attributed to the "true modern" in 1892&#8212;health
and originality of race, clarity of vision and purpose, strength of body,
depth of discipline, and ability to adapt&#8212;have been transposed
to the muscle Jew and, more broadly, the discourse of the "new Jew"
featured in the pages of <i>DieJ&uuml;dische Turnzeitung</i>.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
II. Nordau's <i>Degeneration</i>
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In 1888, in his last completed work before his collapse in Turin,
Nietzsche emblematically summed up the anxieties of the late nineteenth
century with the following words: "Nothing is better known today,
at least nothing has been better studied, than the protean character
of degenerescence."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 Through the re of Wagner, Nietzsche mounted a choleric critique
 of modernity and its voguish nihilism, arguing that decadence and
 degeneracy&#8212;ranging from cultural decline to physical sickness and
 moral turpitude&#8212;are the truest signs of this "nervous age." As
 Nietzsche suggests, signs of degeneracy were detected and studied
 everywhere, not just in cultural or artistic forms. The fast pace of
 modern life rendered the nerves of city dwellers weak;
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 the "natural" borders of races and classes had become porous, causing
 these groups to break down and merge together; the spread of venereal
 diseases and prostitution evidenced the loosening of codes for policing
 sexuality, while the eager embrace of the rhetoric of sickness and
 decadence displaced traditional moral authorities.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 But most of all, the birth of the discipline of eugenics in the
 mid-1850s
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 turned the regulation of degeneracy into an urgent racial-sexual
 imperative.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<p>
It is precisely this confluence of discourses&#8212;medicinal,
socio-economic, political, and cultural&#8212;around the concept of
degeneracy that fed the apocalyptic tone of Nordau's fin de si&egrave;cle
cultural criticism. When <i>Degeneration</i> appeared in 1892, it was
an instant success, becoming one of the best selling and most hotly
contested books of the decade. Not one for understatement, Nordau
couched his shrill diagnosis in the following terms: "The feeling of
the time is curiously confused. . . . The prevailing sense is that of
destruction and extinction. . . . In our days there has awakened in the
minds of the more highly developed a dark fear of a dusk of nations
[<i>V&ouml;lkerd&auml;mmerung</i>] in which all the suns and stars
are gradually burning out and humankind with all its institutions and
creations is perishing in the midst of a dying world."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 Nordau's solution, while definitely motivated by a desire for the
 preservation of traditional, classical values and forms, does not
 look backward to reclaim a lost character but rather prognosticates
 an evolutionary break, imbued with the ideology of social Darwinism,
 in which the "degenerates" will perish and those who are strong,
 disciplined, and well-adapted will come forward to preside over a
 new world.

<p>
Condemning virtually every contemporary artistic or literary movement
as proof of "degeneracy" (his unforgiving criticism jumps effortlessly
from particular res such as Manet and Tolstoy to entire movements
like the pre-Raphaelites, Symbolism, and

<b></b>

"Ibsenism"), Nordau argues that only the calm rationality and disciplined
logic of scientific progress can save humanity from the woes of
degeneration and its attendant horror, formlessness. In his "portrait of
the most famous leader of the Symbolists," Verlaine, he writes, "We see
a repulsive degenerate with an asymmetric skull and a Mongolian face,
an impulsive vagabond and dipsomaniac, who, because of crimes against
morality, was placed in a penitentiary; . . . a dotard, who displays
the absence of any definite thought in his mind by incoherent speech,
meaningless expressions, and frizzy images" (<i>E,</i> 1:228). In other
words, degenerates can be recognized not only by the confused content
and chaotic structure of their thoughts or artistic expressions but also
by race-based, physical deformities (such as an "asymmetric skull" and
"Mongolian face") that prevent them from adapting to the demands of civil
society. Instead of engaging in productive labor, rational activities,
and deliberate moral decisions&#8212;the cornerstones of an enlightened
society&#8212;the degenerate is lost, desperate, overly emotional,
drunk, and sex-craved. Not given to restraint (although, ironically, he
considers restraint to be a critical characteristic of the healthy and
sane), Nordau spends the next three hundred pages of his book mercilessly
castigating an astonishingly wide range of artists, literati, critics,
and philosophers, as well as anyone else who dares to question the truths
of science and the rational foundations of civil society.

<p>
His chief concern is with the "contempt for traditional views of
respectability and morality" (<i>E,</i> 1:10).
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 Established customs, old moral authorities, and traditional practices
 have, he argues, been glibly displaced by a "practical release from
 conventional discipline [<i>Zucht</i>]" (<i>E,</i> 1:10). "Discipline,"
 arguably the central term in Nordau's lexicon, had, at one time,
 insured the reliability of moral authorities, the stability of
 values, the containment of lewdness, the steadfastness of ideals
 in art, and the sublimation of base desires and greed, among other
 things. Historically, through the discipline of their form, artists,
 poets, and musicians taught us what is good, valuable, beautiful,
 enviable, and inspirational. But this is no longer the case at the
 fin de si&egrave;cle, which announces "the end of an order to the
 world that for thousands of years satisfied logic, fettered depravity,
 and in every art matured something of beauty" (<i>E,</i> 1:11). Forms
 have become blurred, boundaries upset, order forsaken, logic and values
 abandoned&#8212;all in favor of undisciplined chaos. The catchall term
 for this breakdown is <i>degeneracy</i>.

<p>
Nordau proclaims at the outset of the first chapter that, when we speak of
the fin de si&egrave;cle, we "ought correctly to say <i>fin de race</i>"
(<i>E,</i> 1:5; italics in original) since the current cultural situation
manifests not simply the end of a century, but also the degenerative end
of race. To understand his point, we might dwell briefly on the etymology
of <i>degeneration</i> (<i>Entartung</i>). The German verb <i>entarten</i>
('to degenerate') means <i>aus der Art schlagen</i>, approximately,
"to be untrue to form or kind [<i>Art</i>]." It implies a process of
withdrawal (<i>ent-arten</i>) or movement away from an ideal or, at
least, normative type. In English and French, the word <i>degenerate</i>
(from the Latin <i>degeneratus</i>) also contains the idea of a debased
movement away from a norm while implying the idea of a "natural" form,
namely a "race" or genus. Thus, to be degenerate means "to deviate from
one's race or kind."

<b></b>

<p>
To articulate his idea that degeneration is a "fin de race," Nordau
cites the seminal text of the French psychiatrist B&eacute;n&eacute;dict
Auguste Morel, <i>Trait&eacute; des d&eacute;g&eacute;n&eacute;rescences
physiques, intellectuelles et morales de l'esp&egrave;ce humaine et
des Causes qui produisent ces Vari&eacute;t&eacute;s maladives</i>
(1857 [Treaty on the physical, intellectual, and moral degenerations
of the human species and on the causes which produce these unhealthy
variations]), the first theory of degeneration as a hereditary, race-based
problem: "Degeneration has to be spoken of as a pathological deviation
from an original type [<i>Typus</i>]. This deviation, even if, at the
outset, it was ever so slight, contains transmissible elements of such
a nature that anyone bearing them becomes more and more incapable of
fulfilling his tasks to humanity; moreover, intellectual progress, which
is already inhibited in his own person, finds itself endangered in his
descendents as well" (<i>E,</i> 1:32). Building on Morel's work, Nordau
argues that degenerate organisms&#8212;as pathological deviations from
the norm&#8212;produce offspring that, to an even greater degree, suffer
from debilitation and malformations. As examples of physical degeneracy,
he names various deformities such as stunted growth, asymmetry of the face
and cranium, protruding ears, squinted eyes, pointed or flat palates,
syn- and polydactylia, all of which are meant to establish the power
and value of the norm over the deviation.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 These offspring, living among "us" today at the fin de si&egrave;cle,
 represent the "end of race": Although Nordau is optimistic that they
 will "fortunately soon become sterile" (<i>E,</i> 1:32) and die out,
 the societal risk is that degenerates will be "imitated," rather
 than shunned, as if their deviations somehow represented new social
 norms. Here, we can detect the first expression of Nordau's social
 Darwinism, something that runs throughout the entire book and will,
 later, become an essential part of his conceptualization of the tasks
 of Zionism.

<p>
Besides inspiring imitation, the other danger posed by degenerates,
Nordau asserts, is that they throw the binary organization of the world
into "mystical" disarray: good and evil, virtue and vice, right and
wrong, beautiful and ugly become nothing more than empty, "arbitrary
distinctions" (<i>E,</i> 1:35). This anxiety becomes particularly
evident in his discussion of the literary decadence of the novels of
Jos&eacute;phin P&eacute;ladan and J.-K. Huysmans. In Huysmans's novel,
<i>A rebours</i>, we not only find a radical revaluation of traditional
binary categories for ordering experience&#8212;male/female, right/wrong,
progress/decline, health/sickness, moral/immoral, true/false, and so
forth&#8212;but we encounter the representation of a world in which
binary categories themselves are no longer reliable structuring matrices
for organizing experience.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 The novel portrays the perceptions and experience of a physically
 anemic and nervous man by the name of Duke Jean des Esseintes, who,
 in Nordau's description, can no longer distinguish between dreams
 and reality, right and wrong, near and far, present and past; he is,
 instead, nothing more than the embodiment of an endless array of
 monstrous sensory experiences. Nordau sums up his discussion of Des
 Esseintes with these overblown words:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
We now have him, the "super-man" of whom Baudelaire and his disciples
dream, and whom they wish to resemble: physically, sick and feeble;
morally, an arrant scoundrel; intellectually, an unspeakable idiot
who passes his days choosing the colors of things to drape his room
artistically, observing the movements of mechanical fish, sniffing
perfumes,

<b></b>

and sipping liqueurs. . . . His complete inability to adapt reveals
itself in the fact that every contact with the world and other human
beings brings pain. . . . A parasite of the lowest level of education,
a sort of human sacculus [a parasite, Nordau notes, that is virtually
indistinguishable from the "diseased excrescence of its host's
intestines"]. [<i>E,</i> 2:119-20]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The degenerate hero of Huysmans's novel thus stands radically opposed
to Nordau's ideal of the "sane" and "healthy" man who sees clear forms,
articulates sensible ideas, acts with purpose, restrains his emotions,
adapts easily to new situations, and is morally disciplined and physically
strong. As we will see shortly, Nordau conceives of the body and the
behavior of both the "true moderns" and the muscle Jew in stark contrast
to Huysmans's re of degeneracy.

<p>
As a good social Darwinist, Nordau ends the book on a note of
"therapeutic" optimism, directed at the "highest educated classes"
(<i>E,</i> 2:545), who are not yet entirely seduced by the "ravings"
of the degenerate artists:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The weak, the degenerate will perish; the strong will adapt themselves to
the achievements of civilization or will subordinate them to their own
organic capacity. . . . The art of the twentieth century will connect
itself at every point to that of the past, but it will have a new task
to fulfill: to bring a stimulating variety to the uniformity of cultured
life, an influence that probably only science, many centuries later, will
be in a position to exert over the great majority of humankind. [<i>E,</i>
2:544]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus Nordau predicts that the twentieth century will bring an end to
both degeneracy and degenerate art; art will return to its traditional,
canonical forms, and science will combat superstition and mysticism
through the force of its truth. In the end, only the "true moderns"
(<i>E,</i> 2:562)&#8212;those who are best adapted to the demands
of modern society through discipline, rationality, and clarity of
vision&#8212;will survive. On the last pages of his book, Nordau concludes
his apocalyptic fantasy with an image of the degenerate "vermin" being
crushed and beaten to death:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Whoever believes with me that society is the natural organic form
of humanity, . . . whoever considers civilization to be a good that
has value and deserves to be defended, must mercilessly crush the
anti-social vermin [<i>Ungeziefer</i>] under his thumbs. . . . We cry:
"Get out of our civilized society [<i>Gesittung</i>]! Rove far from
us! . . . if you dare return to us, we will pitilessly beat you to death
with clubs." [<i>E,</i> 2:556-7]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The "degenerates" are no better than vermin and must be expelled or
clubbed to death in order for Nordau and the ranks of the true moderns
to secure the values of civil society according to the violent mechanisms
of social evolution.

<p>
Indeed, as other critics have pointed out, it is here that Nordau's own
ideas for social exclusion evidence a decidedly uncomfortable resemblance
to national-<i>v&ouml;lkisch</i> ideologies and their own obsession with
ridding society of its so-called "anti-social vermin." Although one can
definitely argue that certain elements of National Socialist ideology
were first conceptualized around the fin de si&egrave;cle&#8212;one
might cite Julius

<b></b>

Langbehn as an originator of <i>v&ouml;lkisch</i> nationalism, or Nordau's
diatribe against "degenerate art" as complicit with the eugenics of
social Darwinism
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
&#8212;I am not interested in attempting to trace the reception
history of Nordau's ideas past his turn to Zionism in 1895 and his
own formulation of the muscle Jew a few years later. In what follows,
then, I want to show how Nordau invented an aesthetic discourse of
regeneracy through the muscle Jew, who, like the "normal man," rises
to the challenges of modernity and does not degenerate but rather
re-embodies his race by becoming a "true modern."


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
III. Muscle Jews as "True Moderns"
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
In the speech he delivered at the first Zionist Congress in 1897,
Nordau described two kinds of Jewish suffering. The first, material
suffering, afflicted the great majority of orthodox, Eastern Jews who
lived in poverty and were legally disenfranchised, second-rate citizens
of their "host" countries; the second, moral suffering, referred to the
minority of assimilated, Western Jews, who had, by and large, abandoned
Judaism but were still not fully welcome in their countries of birth
or residence. They suffer even more bitterly, Nordau argues, because
they are forced to hide their Jewish heritage and are nevertheless
still subject to anti-Semitic aspersions. He concludes the speech with
a strangely veiled threat&#8212;directed foremost at the Jews attending
the Zionist Congress who might act as ambassadors to other Jews and to
Christians in general&#8212;that Jews could destructively "degenerate,"
like lethal microbes, if the Zionist cause were not supported:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Neither Christians nor Jews can indifferently ignore Jewish suffering. It
is a great sin to let a people degenerate [<i>verkommen zu lassen</i>]
in mental and physical need . . . it is a sin to the work of civilized
society [<i>Gesittung</i>], and the Jewish people could and would
gladly be energetic partners. And it can turn into a great danger
for everyone if strong-willed people, whose size extends beyond
the average in good and bad, become embittered through undignified
treatment and, through embitterment, become enemies to the existing order
[<i>Ordnung</i>]. Microbiology teaches us that microorganisms that are
harmless as long as they are living in open-air turn into terrible,
disease-causing pathogens if one deprives them of oxygen and, to use
the technical language, transforms them into anaerobes. Governments and
peoples had better beware of making the Jews into anaerobic beings. They
could have a high price to pay, regardless of what they do, to get
rid of these Jews who they turned into pests [<i>Sch&auml;dling</i>]
by their own guilt. [<i>SP,</i> 1:20]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
What makes this warning so striking (besides the fact that it was uttered
as part of an opening speech at the first Zionist Congress) is that Nordau
has clumsily imported the conceptual terminology of <i>Degeneration</i>
into the Zionist cause but with a defiant, Jewish twist: "Civilized
society," with its rules of discipline and order, is still the goal;
but now, if Jews are not allowed to participate in its construction as
partners, at the very least, through their own efforts at nation building,
Nordau admonishes both assimilated Jews and Christians alike that the
embittered Jews, through their strong wills, might be transformed into
disease-causing pathogens who will undermine its

<b></b>

very foundations. Whereas a few years earlier parasites, microbes, and
vermin were exclusively identified with the "degenerates" who were to
be shunned and crushed by the "true moderns"&#8212;the only rational
defenders of civil society&#8212;now degeneracy could be re-embodied,
as it were, by Jews working to subvert the anti-Semitic hegemony. Far
from the weak and ineffectually degenerate Jews of the anti-Semitic
imagination and equally far from the degenerate artists crushed to death
by the true moderns, these microbe-like "pests" would vigorously exact
revenge on civil society.

<p>
Needless to say, this formulation of the embittered Zionist Jew as
destructive anaerobe would not be Nordau's greatest claim to fame within
the Zionist movement. In fact, at the second and third Zionist Congresses
in 1898 and 1899, he would entirely forgo this revaluation of parasitic
degeneracy in favor of a mythically heroic re of regeneration,
namely the muscle Jew. To be fair to Nordau, he&#8212;very much
unlike contemporary anti-Semitic ideologues such as Houston Stewart
Chamberlain or the self-hating Otto Weininger&#8212;never considered
Jews inherently "degenerate" nor did he endorse the racial determinism
and popular conspiracy theories of the anti-Semitic imagination. Whereas
Weininger, for example, gladly co-opted Chamberlain's arguments for Jewish
inferiority in his <i>Sex and Character</i> , considering the Jew
to be "a spreading parasite, straggling all over the earth and finding
true root nowhere, . . . [able] to adapt himself to every circumstance
and every race, becoming, like the parasite, a new creature in every
different host, although remaining essentially the same,"
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 Nordau only invokes the concepts and arguments of <i>Degeneration</i>
 in order to describe the range of Jewish suffering and to advocate
 for a national solution. As Anita Shapira has pointed out with
 respect to Nordau and his contemporaneous German Zionist colleagues,
 Nordau's "acceptance of the anti-Semitic diagnosis did not entail
 concomitant acceptance of the racist deterministic prognosis preached
 by anti-Semitic ideologues."
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 Jews would only behave like "parasites" if they were working to
 undermine the oppressive social and political structures that treated
 them as such.

<p>
Nevertheless, in the early years of Zionism, Nordau and other Zionist
cofounders sometimes legitimized the anti-Semitic diagnosis of Jewish
degeneracy through their increasingly nationalistic rhetoric of moral,
physical, social, and even linguistic regeneration.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
 In 1898, for example, shortly after the first Zionist Congress in
 Basel, Nordau published an essay entitled "The Tasks of Zionism" in
 which he argues that Zionism has two fundamental goals: The first is
 "to conquer" Palestine for the Jewish people and the second is "to
 prepare" the Jewish people for Palestine.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 He considers the second to be the absolute prerequisite of the first
 and urges Jews to begin to think of themselves simultaneously as a
 single "people" [<i>Volk</i>] and as autonomous citizens who, with
 the discipline of soldiers, could contribute to the reformation of the
 fragmented whole. By depriving Jews of "organic coherence" and "unity,"
 Nordau argues, "the Galut made a chaos out of us," creating a people
 completely without the knowledge, ability, and experience to establish
 the necessary infrastructure (from police headquarters and juridical
 organizations to administrations for taxation, postage, engineering,
 and education) for building a civil society ("AZ," 323). The first
 thing that every single Jew had to learn was "to feel the affairs of
 the entire Jewish people as his own

<b></b>

personal concern and to listen with iron obedience to the leaders that
they chose; in other words, the most engaged possible participation in
the affairs of the people, and manly discipline [<i>Mannszucht</i>]"
("AZ," 324).

<p>
Through discipline, always a masculine quality for Nordau, Jews could
"relearn" lost ideals, moral principles, social behaviors, worthy customs,
and a serious work ethic before emigrating to Palestine. In order to
"become, once again, a fully entitled citizen [<i>B&uuml;rger</i>]
of his own people" ("AZ," 325), the Jew had to reform his body and
behavior patterns in accordance with the standards of bourgeois civil
society. Although he concedes that it took Moses "forty years to educate
his people" ("AZ," 327), Nordau is confident that the Zionist program of
disciplined regeneration will take place much faster. Through a rigorous
work ethic entailing the creation of order, unity, and harmony of purpose,
Jews could act "like good soldiers" ("AZ," 326), charged with vigorously
reconstituting their race and methodically establishing a new society
in Palestine.

<p>
Elaborating on the transformation of the Jew into a soldier
of regeneration, Nordau gave an inspiring speech to Jewish college
students the following year in which he allied his own Jewish heritage
with a triumphal strain of Greek history. Far from being condemned
to historical oblivion like the routed Helots, Zionist Jews&#8212;as
masculine ters&#8212;would now re-embody the heroic, martial tradition
of the Spartans.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 In this deeply personal account of his own path to Zionism, Nordau
 recounts how, in his childhood, he learned about the defeated Helots
 and even planned, at one time, to write his own "Helot tragedy" ("HS,"
 376). This never happened, he tells his listeners, and he forgot
 about the Helots until "the war howls of anti-Semitism" ("HS," 376)
 at the fin de si&egrave;cle thrust them back before his eyes: Jews,
 he feared, might become nothing more than modern-day Helots. Zionism,
 he adamantly retorts, is precisely why Jews will never become like the
 poor Helots; Zionist Jews, he concludes, "are Spartans. . . . For to be
 a Zionist means to be doubly and triply a ter" ("HS," 378). Through
 "manly discipline" and military dominance, Nordau imagined Zionism as
 an ideology of the Jew-Greek warrior.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<p>
Whereas earlier Jews and non-Jews of the Enlightenment called for cultural
<i>Bildung</i> (education) and social <i>Verbesserung</i> (improvement)
in order to achieve Jewish assimilation within German society,
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 Nordau shifts attention to what he perceives to be "a missing corporeal
 upbringing" (<i>eine fehlende, k&ouml;rperliche Erziehung</i>)
 (<i>JTZ,</i> 1902, no. 7:110). He urges Jews&#8212;in his case,
 male Jews&#8212;to become strong and muscular by participating in
 athletic associations, and argues that exercise, specifically gymnastics
 (<i>das Turnen</i>), is of the utmost importance for the health of the
 Jewish race. Due to a range of historical reasons largely connected to
 anti-Semitism and the challenges of life in the Diaspora, the Jewish
 body had been "destroyed" (<i>abget&ouml;dtet</i>). In the cramped
 quarters of the Jewish ghetto streets, Jews forgot how to move their
 limbs freely; in dark houses, their eyes blinked nervously; out of
 fear of persecution, their formerly strident voices turned to mere
 whispers (<i>JTZ,</i> 1900, no. 2:10). As a redemptive re, then,
 the muscle Jew represents both a future ideal and the return to a
 heroic Jewish tradition characterized by the likes of Bar Kochba and
 the Maccabees. In his rally cry

<b></b>

for a "muscle Jewry," Nordau proudly asserts that Zionists are rejoining
"our oldest traditions by becoming strong-chested, tautly jointed, boldly
gazing men [<i>tiefbr&uuml;stige, strammgliedrige, k&uuml;hnblickende
M&auml;nner</i>]" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1900, no. 2:10).

<p>
The Zionist muscle Jew, at least in Nordau's articulation of the re,
is a resolutely masculine ter, characterized by the drive for Jews to
become once again heroic warriors. It is here that Nordau underscores
the masculinity of the battle-ready Jew: "Our new muscle Jews have
not yet regained the heroism of their forefathers . . . to take part
in battles and compete with the trained Hellenic athletes and strong
northern barbarians. But morally speaking, we are better off today than
yesterday, for the old Jewish circus performers of yore were ashamed of
their Judaism and sought, by way of a surgical pinch, to hide the sign
of their religious affiliation . . . while today, the members of Bar
Kochba proudly and freely proclaim their Jewishness." (<i>JTZ,</i> 1900,
no. 2:11). In other words, the male members of the Bar Kochba gymnastics
association are no longer ashamed of their circumcised penis; instead,
they show off their "surgical pinch" with pride.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 The organ of Jewish virility evokes national pride.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
 Although the phallocentrism of Nordau's Zionist ideal cannot be
 overlooked in his characterization of the muscle Jew, a well-developed,
 semibalancing discourse surrounding "the need for female gymnastics"
 and female muscle Jews (<i>JTZ,</i> 1902, no. 5:76-80) also emerged, as
 we will see, in the pages of <i>Die J&uuml;dische Turnzeitung</i> around
 the overlapping themes of fertility, family, and sexual reproduction.

<p>
When <i>Die J&uuml;dische Turnzeitung</i> was founded in Berlin in May
1900 as "the official organ of the Jewish gymnastics association,"
its purpose was to realize Jewish national goals through corporeal
means. Over its twenty years, the journal published an array of
materials, ranging from historical discussions of ancient Jewish
greatness to battle songs, fitness programs, schedules and results of
various gymnastics competitions, photographs of exemplary muscle Jews
(. <a name="4" href="10.2presner_res.html#4">4</a>
and <a name="5" href="10.2presner_res.html#5">5</a>), and
medical discussions of the benefits of sun, light, and movement for a
potent sexuality. A leitmotiv that ran throughout the journal was the
"physical improvement" of the Eastern European Jew, so often pejoratively
characterized as the <i>Jammergeschlecht</i> (wretched race), with
a hunched-over body, crooked posture, awkward gait, underdeveloped
musculature, and nervous disposition. Pictures of strong Jewish
gymnasts with upright postures, elegant movements, developed muscles,
and assured confidence were not only meant to provide inspiration and
reclaim an ancient, heroic ideal; the bodies they depicted were also
hailed as the preconditions of a successful project of nation building
(. <a name="6" href="10.2presner_res.html#6">6</a>
and <a name="7" href="10.2presner_res.html#7">7</a>). In
its first edition, the journal proclaimed five goals: the creation
of a strong Jewish body, the creation of a strong Jewish community,
the reinvigoration of old Jewish ideals of heroism, the ting of
anti-Semitism, and the cultivation of a national feeling. It is no
coincidence that, as the primary means of staving off what Herzl once
called "the family affliction" of Jewish degeneracy,
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 Jewish athletic and gymnastic associations sprang up simultaneously
 with Zionism throughout many German-speaking cities. In 1903, five years
 after Nordau invented the concept of the muscle Jew, <i>DieJ&uuml;dische
 Turnzeitung</i> began carrying the subtitle "monthly for the corporeal
 improvement of the Jews." It boasted that there were already thirteen
 "national-Jewish gymnastics associations"

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 285]</b>

and that "we should strive to have every Zionist association develop
a gymnastics division" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1902, no. 1:3).

<p>
Indeed, this emphasis on corporeal regeneracy should come as no surprise
since Zionism emerged from the same fin de si&egrave;cle culture that had
spawned numerous other body reform movements, ranging from the women's
and the homosexual emancipation

<b></b>

movements to the youth, sports, fitness, and nudist movements, all of
which were striving to gain social recognition and political momentum.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 It was precisely during this period that Jewish gymnastics associations
 and Jewish <i>Wanderklubs</i> came into existence across Europe, many
 taking the German youth and body reform movements&#8212;especially
 the Wandervogel&#8212;as their shared starting point.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
<i>Die J&uuml;dische Turnzeitung,</i> for example, published
travelogues of hiking trips and other outdoor journeys that the Jewish
gymnasts undertook, as well as military songs, such as the so-called
<i>Mannerlied,</i> which celebrated their heroic masculinity.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
 And over the course of the next decade, in part because the
 anti-Semitism of the Wandervogel kept many Jews from participating
 in the German youth movement, Jewish gymnastics associations began to
 establish their own <i>Wanderklubs</i>.

<p>
In a lead article entitled "Gr&uuml;ndet Wanderklubs!" published in
<i>Die J&uuml;dische Turnzeitung</i> in 1908, Georg Arndt officially
called for the establishment of Jewish hiking clubs, arguing that such
clubs would solidify "the kernel of a disciplined, goal-conscious team,"
something that was important for "every national gymnastics" (<i>JTZ,</i>
1908, no. 7). The same year, Theobald Scholem argued that Jewish "body
culture" (<i>K&ouml;rperkultur</i>) must not restrict itself to indoor
activities since the "gymnastics hall is only a substitute" for nature:
"Above all, we need light and air and forest and fields." Responding to a
reservation on the part of Jewish gymnastics associations to supporting
patriotic hiking trips analogous to those of their German counterparts,
Scholem critically asked, "We Jews are scattered throughout the world
and forced, because of our fate, eternally to wander. Why do we not
go outside into nature? Is it that we have lost the desire to wander
because of our incessant search for a home, because wandering has
become a symbol of our misfortune? . . . There must not be any Jewish
gymnastics association which refuses to undertake hiking trips. . . . In
the forests and fields, in rain or in sun, the Jew will get to know what
he has lost for millennia, namely love of mother earth" (<i>JTZ,</i>
1908, no. 6:112). He emphasizes light, air, and free movement in nature,
all constitutive components of the rhetoric of contemporaneous German
body reform movements. In essence, he is calling for a Jewish version
of the Wandervogel, something that would actually come into existence by
1912 under the name "Blau-Weiss" (Blue-White), a Jewish youth association
dedicated to scouting, fitness, and Jewish patriotism.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>

<p>
As early as November 1900, in an article on "The Tasks of the Jewish
Gymnast," Emanuel Edelstein, echoing Nordau's ideas, postulates that
physical strength is the prerequisite of a "favorable solution to the
Jewish question." He situates the Jewish question&#8212;"at once a
social, racial, and national question"&#8212;within a neo-Hegelian
framework, which holds that world history, as it plays out in its
particular national inflections, is nothing but a history of opposition,
"a battle for nationality and a race war" (<i>einNationalit&auml;tskampf
und ein Racenkrieg</i>) (<i>JTZ,</i> 1900, no. 7:73-4). He sees these
battles for recognition occurring all over the world: in Asia, China,
the Philippines, as well as in the Spanish-American War, the impending
war between England and Russia, and, of course, the Zionist cause. Citing
Nordau's concept of muscle Jewry directly, he places the solution to
the Jewish question within these historical lineages

<b></b>

of bellicosity. In order to overcome the nervousness, degeneracy and
weakness of the Jewish race and form a robust nation, Jews need to "become
men!" (<i>werdet M&auml;nner!</i>) (<i>JTZ,</i> 1900, no. 7:74). Edelstein
calls upon the heroic male tradition in ancient Judaism, but in contrast
to the singular phallocentrism of Nordau's muscle Jew, he is also the
first author in <i>DieJ&uuml;dische Turnzeitung</i> to draw attention to
the heroic female tradition, which he links to a historical argument for
creating a stronger Jewish race: "Daughters of Israel, whose beauty has
radiated across all time since Sara and is still uncontested, recognized,
and sung today; there is a Miriam, a Deborah, a Judith, a Ruth and an
Esther for you to emulate, names that can never be erased. Take part in
everything that endows your body with power, agility, and grace. Become
a strong and healthy sex [<i>ein starkes und gesundesGeschlecht</i>]
and you, too, will play an important part in helping to solve the Jewish
question" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1900, no. 7:75).
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>

<p>
Although the discourses of Jewish regeneration and nationality were
almost completely dominated by male thinkers, the necessity of "female
gymnastics" was recognized in <i>Die J&uuml;dische Turnzeitung</i>
from the very start. In answering the charge that "gymnastics is
unfeminine, . . . [that] we don't need strong females [<i>weibliche
Kraftmenschen</i>]," the editors retorted: "Is it unfeminine to
improve the functioning of the heart and lungs, the circulation of the
blood and the metabolism through purposive strengthening movements
(if possible in the open air), to toughen the muscles, and awaken
an enthusiasm for movement, a sense of well-being, and a gaiety in
play and hiking?" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1901, no. 9:118). Although the editors
demurred somewhat with respect to the question of creating female muscle
Jews, they did argue unequivocally that "it pays off for everyone when
we recognize that one of the first tasks of today is to strengthen
and preserve the health of the female sex by giving the most serious
attention to gymnastics" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1901, no. 9:119-20). Indeed, for
the majority of the first decade of the journal's existence, the theory
of female gymnastics was primarily articulated by men. In fact, it was
not until 1911 that the journal published a speech by Betti Eger of the
woman's division of the Jewish gymnastics association in which she argues,
on behalf of the female members, "We want to contribute to the health of
our people's body [<i>Volksk&ouml;rper</i>]. We want to become strong
muscle Jews [<i>kr&auml;ftige Muskeljuden</i>]" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1911,
no. 4:75). Confirming the significant health benefits of gymnastics
that her male colleagues consistently emphasized, Eger argues that
gymnastics would not only produce healthier mothers but also beget
stronger children. For this reason, she maintains, female muscle Jews are
just as important as male muscle Jews for the creation of the new state.

<p>
Support for female gymnastics among the male representatives was never,
however, entirely liberating since the discussions in <i>Die J&uuml;dische
Turnzeitung</i> quite clearly limited the social role of women to healthy
reproduction and motherhood. Richard Blum, for example, in comparing
antique and modern gymnastics, explains that female gymnastics was
important to the Spartans because, like today, "the strength and health
of the nation is vitally dependent upon the strength and health of the
mother" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1902, no. 2:32). In a follow-up article entitled
"Girl's and Women's Gymnastics" , he argues that gymnastics is
crucial for the health and strength of the female body and, by extension,
the Jewish nation. Blum's concern is not with women's liberation

<b></b>

per se but with the role of women for the fertility of the nation. Women
need to "liberate" themselves, he argues, from the crutch of the corset
by strengthening their own back muscles and assuming a healthy posture;
this will enable, in his medical opinion, healthy Jewish women, with
strong back muscles, powerful lungs, and freely circulating blood, to
produce stronger children, in turn, "serving your sisters, your families,
your communities, and your nation!" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1902, no. 5:80).

<p>
From the very beginning of the muscle Jew discourse, then, corporeal
training was explicitly linked to the production of nationality, an
association that derived both its theoretical program and historical
legitimacy from the German "father" of gymnastics, Friedrich Ludwig
Jahn. Transferring Jahn's ideas of German fraternity, brotherhood,
and nationality to the Jewish cause, Felix Meyer, in an article on the
"Hygienic Value of Gymnastics," connects the history of German nationality
to the development of Jewish nationality: "After Prussia was defeated
by the hand of the great Napoleon, . . . men like Jahn came forward. . . [and] recognized that the foundation for a moral rebirth of the
people was to be found in personal self-defense, that a strengthening
of the courage of the individual [would do the same] for the nation"
(<i>JTZ,</i> 1901, no. 4:46). He then draws a parallel between the
situation of the German people after 1806 and that of contemporary
Jews who "have a right and a duty to be a nation" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1901,
no. 4:46). Like the German national body, the Jewish national body would
similarly be reassembled once the individual bodies of the Jews were
strengthened and regenerated.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
 Applying the ideas of Jahn directly to the Jews, Blum points out that
 modern Jews cannot "afford to close their eyes to the successes which
 the German people recorded with its gymnastics associations." To
 support his point, he quotes Jahn: "Only the beneficial training
 [<i>Ausbildung</i>] of the entire human being [through gymnastics]
 protects against any sort of corporeal and mental crippling and
 deformation" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1900, no. 6:62). In the same way that Jahn
 believed gymnastics to be necessary for the "inner elevation of the
 German fatherland and people, . . . in order to build up a new Germany,"
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
 the Zionists considered gymnastics to be necessary for the
 rebirth of a long-lost heroic ideal and the prerequisite
 for the "conquering" of Palestine (<a name="8"
 href="10.2presner_res.html#8"> 8</a>).

<p>
But the muscle Jew discourse, as conceived by Nordau and made visual
in <i>Die J&uuml;dische Turnzeitung,</i> not only built upon the
masculine heroism of the Germanic tradition, it was also suffused by
a social ethos of survival of the fittest, in which Jews, overcoming
the extenuating circumstances which had rendered them weak, could
now adapt to the new challenges of nation building and become "true
moderns" in order to thrive. As Nordau writes in his call for all Jews
to practice gymnastics in order to re-create a muscle Jewry, "Our muscles
are outstandingly capable of development. . . . No one need be satisfied
with the muscles he is given. Everyone can have the muscles that he wishes
for. Methodical, persistent exercise is all that is necessary. Every Jew
who is or believes himself to be weak can attain the musculature of an
athlete" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1902, no. 7:112). Although a cursory reading may
render these ideas more like a kind of self-help guide for achieving
the body you've always wanted, the adaptability of the Jew through the
cultivation of discipline and physical musculature explains precisely
why the Jew is not "degenerate." After all, adaptability, as Nordau
argued in <i>Degeneration</i>,

<b></b>

is both the prerequisite of social evolution and the critical
characteristic for becoming a "true modern."

<p>
In this respect, then, Nordau's 1892 argument is quite consistent
and continuous with his Zionist call for the re-creation of a muscle
Jewry. Through their heroic traditions, Jews embody precisely what
degenerates are not. In <i>Degeneration</i>, he distinguishes between
organisms and races that are degenerate and those that are capable of
adapting themselves to historical circumstances:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
As long as the vital powers of an individual as well as of a race are not
entirely consumed, the organism makes efforts, actively or passively, to
adapt itself by seeking to change injurious conditions or by adjusting
itself in such a way that conditions that cannot be changed cause as
little damage as possible. Degenerates, hysterics, and neurasthenics are
not capable of adaptation. Therefore, they are fated to disappear. They
will become irretrievably destroyed because they do not know how to come
to terms with reality. [<i>E,</i> 2:528]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Jews, on the other hand, just like their muscles, are entirely capable of
development and adaptation. Despite the historical challenges presented
by anti-Semitism, Jews&#8212; 

<b></b>

as a race&#8212;are not innately degenerate and cannot be classed along
with hysterics and neurasthenics. In fact, precisely because of their
discipline and commitment to the ethical and social principles underlying
civil society, they are capable of embodying the social Darwinist spirit
of the "true moderns."

<p>
Nordau concedes that he was at first willing to accept the anti-Semitic
stereotype of the weak Jew as a national-racial characteristic given
some historical evidence proving that Jews were "small" in stature and
that present-day Jews are "on average somewhat smaller than Germans,
Russians, Anglo-Saxons, and Scandinavians." But he is convinced that Jews
are not racially "degenerate" and that Jewish self-improvement is both
possible and desirable (<i>JTZ,</i> 1902, no. 7:111). Their small size
and ostensible physical weakness&#8212;which may, at first sight, appear
to be "evidence of degeneration" (<i>Entartungserscheinung</i>)&#8212;can
easily be explained by the fact that Jews have "necessarily lost their
ability for physical fitness, having lived for a thousand years deprived
of exercise in the ghetto" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1902, no. 7:110). To regain it,
all that is necessary is disciplined training.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
 At no point does Nordau ever situate Jews&#8212;whether assimilated,
 Western Jewry or so-called <i>Ostjuden</i>&#8212;under the rubric
 of degeneracy that he developed in his 1892 book. If Jews have
 "deviated from their race or kind," to invoke the conceptual history
 of the term <i>degeneration,</i> then it is because the "original
 type"&#8212;namely, the heroic muscle Jew of Bar Kochba and the
 Maccabees&#8212;has been "destroyed" through the violent historical
 mechanisms of anti-Semitism. Far from replicating the racial grounds
 for explaining the pervasiveness and expected death of both degenerate
 art and the degenerate artists themselves, Jews, Nordau maintains,
 represent a latent race of "Spartan" ters who will not perish by
 the challenges modernity presents. Instead, through their discipline
 and adaptability, the weak Jews will be able to evolve back into
 muscle Jews, uniting, in turn, their scattered people and founding
 a new nation with all the scientific solidity and racial strength of
 the greatest European civil societies.

<p>
Articulated around a paternal picture of himself (<a name="9"
HREF="10.2presner_res.html#9"> 9</a>), Nordau's 1902
article, "What Does Gymnastics Mean for Us Jews?" specifies precisely
why gymnastics is central to the Zionist project. Gymnastics not
only makes one healthier "by facilitating the physical development
of strength as well as beauty," but it also "teaches manly discipline
[<i>Manneszucht</i>], reciprocal adaptation to different personalities,
and carefully constructed combinations of many efforts leading to
a single, common goal" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1902, no. 7:109). Besides its
corporeal benefits, gymnastics also embodies certain ideals&#8212;such as
intellectual clarity, moral rectitude, and social competence&#8212;that
correspond with races that are well-adapted, disciplined, and healthy. It
is the perfect way of training individual Jews to strengthen their
own bodies and work together for the attainment of a shared national
goal. Jews thus gain in both physical strength and moral character. Muscle
Jews are known for their "ruthless boldness," "complete mastery of
the muscle groups," "energetic exclusion of inhibitions of an anxious
or doubting nature," and, finally, "mental nimbleness, clarity, and
sharpness" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1902, no. 7:112). In the muscle Jew, intellectual
acuity is matched by physical prowess&#8212;and it is this ideal which
is to be cultivated through the propagation of the race.

<b></b>

<p>
In conclusion, then, it is no coincidence that Nordau's description of the
muscle Jew is diametrically opposed to his descriptions of the degenerate
characters in the novels of P&eacute;ladan or Huysmans. Conceptually,
the muscle Jew is essentially the outgrowth of Nordau's "normal man,"
who, rising to the challenges of modernity, transforms himself into a
true modern and crushes the degenerates to death. This is how Nordau
describes the prototype of the muscle Jew in 1892:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The normal man, with his clear mind, logical thought, sound judgment,
and strong will, sees, where the degenerate only gropes; he plans and
acts where the latter only dozes and dreams. . . . Let us imagine the
driveling Zoroaster of Nietzsche, with his cardboard lions, eagles,
and serpents from a toyshop, or the noctambulist Des Esseintes of the
Decadents, sniffing and licking his lips . . . let us imagine these beings
in competition with men who rise early, and are not weary before sunset,
who have clear heads, solid stomachs, and hard muscles: the comparison
will provoke laughter. [E, 2:529]

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>



Just like the "normal" Jew, the normal man&#8212;able to adapt to the
exigencies of modernity and become both potent and muscular&#8212;is
characterized by clarity of perception, discipline, adaptability, and,
most of all, physical strength. He rises early and works diligently all
day long; he maintains focus and acts decisively; he works out and has
washboard abs to show for it. He is the re-embodiment of the strength
of his race.

<p>
In this respect, then, the goal of the muscle Jew discourse was not
simply the rejuvenation of the individual body but rather the creation of
a modern body politic through the aesthetics of corporeal regeneracy. On
the one hand, the muscle Jew harkens back to a bygone, mythological time
as the embodiment of "true Jewishness," a concept not entirely divorced
from other contemporaneous calls for "<i>Volkst&uuml;mlichkeit</i>"
or "true Germanness."On the other hand, the muscle Jew&#8212;through
his discipline, adaptability, and strength&#8212;represents a modern,
evolutionary break, one in which the achievements of civilization
are elevated to a higher, more refined level. Nordau concludes
<i>Degeneration</i> with these fateful words, which might just as well
describe the tasks of Zionism and the duties of the muscle Jew: "The
criteria by which the true moderns can be recognized and distinguished
from impostors calling themselves modern are the following: Whoever
preaches absence of discipline is an enemy of progress; whoever worships
his 'I' is an enemy to society. Society's first premise is love of one's
neighbor and the capacity for sacrifice; progress is the effect of an
ever more rigorous subjugation of the beast in man, of an ever tenser
self-restraint, of an ever keener sense of duty and responsibility"
(<i>E,</i> 2:562). It might well be that the concept of the muscle
Jew&#8212;through its paradoxical aesthetics of regeneracy&#8212;is
modernity's most emblematic form of discipline and social progress.

Bar Kochba led the Judeans in the revolt against the Roman Empire in
A.D. 132, which was ultimately suppressed in 135. As Yael Zerubavel
argues, "[in] Zionist collective memory the Bar Kochba revolt symbolizes
the nation's last expression of patriotic ardor and the last struggle
for freedom during Antiquity." <i>Recovered Roots: Collective Memory and
the Making of the Israeli National Tradition</i> (Chicago: University of
Chicago Press, 1995), 48. The representation of the physically inferior
and creatively stunted Jew can, of course, be found in countless
late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century anti-Semitic discourses,
including scientific and pseudo-scientific literature, historical
accounts,

and popular imagery in the press and politics. Houston Stewart
Chamberlain's <i>Die Grundlagen des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts,</i> 5th
ed., 2 vols. (1899; Munich: F. Bruckmann, 1904) represents the racist
historical-scientific imagination at its core (hereafter abbreviated

was published monthly or bimonthly in Berlin from May 1900 through the

sporadically, and it finally ceased publication in 1921.

The exact date of the caricature is unknown but is probably between
1905 and 1910. According to Eduard Fuchs in 1921, <i>Kikeriki</i>
was likely the oldest anti-Semitic journal in Austria still in
circulation. It was founded in 1862 as "a general and political comic
magazine with a specifically anticlerical critique. . . . With the rise
of the Christian-Social Party in Austria during the 1890s, the journal
gave up its original character and placed itself more and more in the
service of anti-Semitism." <i>Die Juden in der Karikatur: Ein Beitrag

Besides co-curating the first Jewish national art exhibition at the fifth
Zionist Congress in 1901, Lilien published two book illustrations prior
to completing the "Altneuland" picture: <i>Juda</i>  and <i>Lieder
des Ghetto</i> (1902/03). Schooled in the aesthetics of Jugendstil
while studying in Munich and Berlin, Lilien uses and revalues the visual
language of decadence in order to give form to the Zionist concept of
progressive regeneration. The best contemporary overview of Lilien's
work through 1903 is <i>E. M. Lilien: Sein Werk, mit einer Einleitung
von Stefan Zweig</i> (Berlin, 1903). For more recent criticism, see
Milly Heyd, "Lilien: Between Herzl and Ahasver," in <i>Theodor Herzl:
Visionary of the Jewish State,</i> ed. Gideon Shimoni and Robert
S. Wistrich (Jerusalem: The Hebrew University Magnes Press, 1999),
265-93. See also Michael Stanislawski's chapter, "From Jugendstil to
'Judenstil': Cosmopolitanism and Nationalism in the Work of Ephraim
Moses Lilien," in <i>Zionism and the Fin de Si&egrave;cle</i>. Neither
Heyd nor Stanislawski discusses the "Altneuland" illustration.

The caricature is also reformulating the legend of the "seven Swabians,"
a legend that was made popular by the Brothers Grimm fairy tale of the
same name. In transforming the bungling Swabians into Jews and turning
the famous slogan, "Hannemann, geh du voran" (Hannemann, go forward),
into a Jewish imperative, "Jakele, geh du voran," the caricature equates
the famous cowardice of the leader Hannemann and his dastardly soldiers
with the Zionist project. I thank Hinrich C. Seeba for alerting me to
this reference.

Of course, the association of Jews and homosexuals was also a part of the
stock of anti-Semitic and homophobic rhetoric of fin de si&egrave;cle
Europe. The most famous diatribe to link Jews and homosexuals by way
of a deeply self-hating and misogynistic argument is Otto Weininger's
<i>Geschlecht und Charakter</i> (Sex and Character) of 1903. For a
critical assessment of Weininger within his intellectual context,
see <i>Jews and Gender: Responses to Otto Weininger,</i> ed. Nancy
A. Harrowitz and Barbara Hyams (Philadelphia: Temple University Press,
1995).

<p>
<a name="FOOT11" href="#REF11">11</a>.
Weininger put an even finer point on what he believed to be the ultimate
flaw of Zionism: "Zionism is the negation of Judaism, for the conception
of Judaism involves the world-wide distribution of the Jews. Citizenship
is an un-Jewish thing, and there has never been and never will be a true
Jewish State. The State involves the aggregation of individual aims, the
formation of and obedience to self-imposed laws; and the symbol of the
State, if nothing more, is its head chosen by free election. . . . The
true conception of the State is foreign to the Jew because he, like
the woman, is wanting in personality; his failure to grasp the idea of
true society is due to his lack of a free intelligible ego." <i>Sex and
Character</i> (London: William Heinemann, 1907), 307-8.

Nordau's conception of the muscle Jew is well-known and mentioned in
passing in countless studies of German Zionism or histories of Jewish
masculinity. Steven Ashheim, for example, briefly mentions the muscle
Jew in his important discussion of Western Zionist conceptions of health
and vitality, <i>Brothers and Strangers</i>: <i>The East European Jew in
German and German Jewish Consciousness, 1800-1923</i> (Madison: University
of Wisconsin Press, 1982), 87-8; Sander Gilman mentions the muscle Jew
on one page dedicated to the birth of Zionist gymnastics societies in
<i>The Jew's Body,</i> 53; Michael Berkowitz gives a somewhat more
detailed discussion of the same phenomenon in his chapter "Zionist
Heroes and New Men," in <i>Zionist Culture and West European Jewry
Before the First World War</i> (New York: Cambridge University Press,
1993); John Efron ends his highly informative chapter, "The Jewish Body
Degenerate?" with a brief discussion of Nordau. <i>Medicine and the
German Jews: A History</i> (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press,
2001), 149. Although not centered on the muscle Jew discourse per se,
Daniel Boyarin's highly suggestive and controversial book, <i>Unheroic
Conduct: The Rise of Heterosexuality and the Invention of the Jewish
Man</i> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997), offers an
incisive critique of Zionist discourses of masculinity while trying to
reclaim the "sissy" tradition, to use his term, for Judaism.

In an article on the hundredth anniversary of the publication of
Nordau's <i>Degeneration</i>, Mosse makes the important connection
between Nordau's earlier cultural criticism of "degenerate art" and
his Zionist project of cultivating "respectability" and "middle-class
standards of masculinity" for Judaism. I think that Mosse's argument is
exactly on target. I draw on his work here and extend it with additional
archival and visual evidence. "Max Nordau, Liberalism and the New Jew,"

Mosse, "Max Nordau, Liberalism and the New Jew," 567. Without coming
down one way or the other, Michael Stanislawski, for example, writes that
"it is only a slight oversimplification to claim that [critical] opinion

completely contradictory to his previous views and those who see his
pre-Zionist views as seamlessly connected to his Zionism." <i>Zionism

The seminal texts to explore this are: Fritz Stern, <i>The Politics of
Cultural Despair: A Study of the Rise of Germanic Ideology</i> (Berkeley:
University of California Press, 1963); and George Mosse, <i>The Crisis of
German Ideology: Intellectual Origins of the Third Reich</i> (New York:
Universal Library, Grosset and Dunlap, 1964). Let me be unequivocally
clear about my own position: I am in no way suggesting that the ideas
expressed in Nordau's <i>Degeneration</i> led to the purifying ideology of
National Socialism; however, it is worth pointing out that the violence
of Nordau's social Darwinism and his cultural decisionism did have an
afterlife in the fervid adoption of race-science and eugenics in the
service of state formation (such as in the writings of Ludwig Woltmann)
or, later, the right-wing political theories of Carl Schmitt. Moreover,
in the twentieth century, <i>Ungeziefer</i> has consistently referred to
the abject of society, the absolutely vile deviation from the norm. Franz
Kafka famously thematized this in his short story <i>Die Verwandlung</i>
(The Metamorphosis), in which Gregor Samsa wakes up to find himself
transformed into an "Ungeziefer" and is ultimately killed by his
family for the sake of preserving bourgeois society. More ominously,
the association of Jews with parasites and vermin was a persistent topos
of Nazi propaganda, given a direct visual association in the virulently
anti-Semitic Nazi film <i>The Eternal Jew</i> .

crown of his penis. See Allen Edwardes, <i>Erotica Judaica:
A Sexual History of the Jews</i> (New York: Julian Press, 1967),
esp. chap. 9. Interestingly, Lilien's "Altneuland" illustration shows
the rear of the muscle Jew, but does not proudly display the Jewish penis.

Michael Stanislawski has also offered a similar reading of this passage,
highlighting the phallocentrism of Nordau's muscle Jew. He writes,
"the blatant and evocative image of the publicly displayed circumcised
Jewish phallus [is offered by Nordau] as the ultimate symbol of Jewish
national pride as well as newfound Jewish masculinity." <i>Zionism and
the Fin de Si&egrave;cle,</i> 93-4.

Hans Bl&uuml;her, the founder and primary exponent of the German
Wandervogel movement, later argued in his book, <i>Die Rolle der
Erotik in der m&auml;nnlichen Gesellschaft</i> (The role of the erotic
in masculine society), that "erotic," male-bonding experiences such
as those of sports competitions and the German youth movement were a
necessary prerequisite for both patriotism and state formation. Despite
Bl&uuml;her's well-known anti-Semitism, Jewish gymnastics associations
nevertheless applied certain aspects of his theories about hiking clubs,
physical fitness, and the erotic development of patriotism to the Zionist
cause. See <i>Die Rolle der Erotik in der m&auml;nnlichen Gesellschaft:
Eine Theorie der menschlichen Staatsbildung nach Wesen und Wert,</i>
2 vols. (Jena: Eugen Diederichs, 1917/19).

Its last stanzas, supposedly sung while on hiking trips, went like
this: "Men, even then, / we will not despair like cowards, / but take
the punches of destiny / we will be patient, without complaining. /
Strong is the man. / Step forward men! / Don't tremble before the
future!" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1901, no. 7/8:101).

Here, the term <i>Geschlecht</i> oscillates in meaning between 'race'
or 'lineage' and 'sex.'

In addition to Jahn's, the ideas of J. G. Fichte represent the
most significant "German" antecedents to the Zionist interest in
strengthening the individual body in order to regenerate the body
of the nation. Jahn's <i>Deutsches Volksthum</i>  and <i>Die
deutsche Turnkunst</i>  as well as Fichte's <i>Reden an die
deutsche Nation</i>  consistently thematize the reassembly
and even the resurrection of the German nation through the physical
regeneracy of the individual's body. The best discussion of this idea
in Fichte can be found in Hinrich C. Seeba, "Auferstehung des Geistes:
Zur religi&ouml;sen Rhetorik nationaler Einheit," in <i>"Nicht allein mit
den Worten." Festschrift f&uuml;r Joachim Dyck zum 60. Geburtstag,</i>
ed. Thomas M&uuml;ller, Johannes G. Pankau, Gert Ueding (Stuttgart-Bad
Cannstatt: Frommann-Holzboog, 1995), 266-82.

Nordau, of course, was not alone in both explaining what appeared
to be Jewish "degeneration" and calling for a rebirth of Jewish
heroism. See, for example, Hermann Jalowicz's programmatic article,
"Die k&ouml;rperliche Entartung der Juden, ihre Ursachen und ihre
Bek&auml;mpfung" (<i>JTZ,</i> 1901, no. 5:57-65).
