Blaise Cendrars, "Saint Paul"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Anyone entering the debate on hybridity that has transformed academic
discourse over the past decade is forced to confront two conflicting
but equally persuasive narratives of transcultural production. One is a
rather optimistic story emphasizing the types of syncretism and productive
collage that James Clifford has associated with a "poetics of process."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  According to this story, the increasingly frequent contact between
  different cultures (the

<B></B>

"syncretism" or juxtaposition of cultures that have evolved differently)
is not a phenomenon to be feared: cultural cross-fertilization merely
accelerates the historically consistent rhythm of contact, exchange,
and influence by means of which supposedly authentic and homogeneous
cultures are formed.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The second narrative exposes some of the weaknesses of this seductive
view, providing a cautionary tale in which intercultural contact,
while potentially a rich resource for the development of hybrid
identities, tends nonetheless to fortify the domination of one
culture over another. By celebrating the ongoing process of cultural
cross-fertilization, the counter-argument goes, contemporary critics like
Clifford risk erasing the often bloody history that leads to intercultural
contact in the first place. Marianna Torgovnick, for instance, has accused
advocates of postmodern syncretism of being more fashion-conscious than
scholarly. To "revel in the postmodern m&eacute;lange of us and them,"
she warns, is to risk "abjuring [our] responsibilities."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  Modernists are guilty of irresponsible and ahistoricizing
  appropriations, but postmodernists, too, may be implicated on the
  same grounds.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As opposed as these two narratives obviously are--the first places faith
in hybridity, the second is highly suspicious of hybridity's compromised
pasts and contaminated futures--they nonetheless share a common plot
structure. Each depends upon a chronological and evolutionary conceit
that imposes a sharp break between modernism and postmodernism, that is,
between a coercive modernist hybridity on the one hand, and, on the other,
a liberating postmodernist syncretism. When contrasted with Bob Marley or
the Aboriginal Warumpi Band, canonical modernists inevitably appear to be
perpetrators of exploitative appropriations, patently lacking a political
consciousness and disinterested, for the most part, in the original
contexts of the "exotic" voices they introduce into circulation. For
members of both critical camps, modernists unselfconsciously exploit third
world artifacts, na&iuml;vely believe in cultural "authenticity," and
fetishize the instinctual purity of the "primitive" (often in opposition
to what they consider to be the decadence and emasculation of "advanced"
European art).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 There are certainly many instances of modernist appropriation that appear
 to confirm the arguments outlined above. But whether all modernists
 are equally insouciant, unselfconscious, and ahistorical is a highly
 debatable question. Modernist modes of appropriation are often far
 more complicated than they initially appear. In fact, the genealogies
 of cultural cross-fertilizations are lengthy and surprisingly twisted,
 and not all modernists are unaware of the implications--historical,
 political, and aesthetic--of the further twists they add to the
 chain. The case I consider here, that of Blaise Cendrars, a Francophone
 (Swiss) poet, novelist, journalist, and screen writer, is particularly
 enlightening in this regard. Cendrars's contacts with postcolonial
 Brazil produced a set of curious writings on hybridity that raise
 some disturbing questions about modernism's relation to cultural
 cross-fertilization. Anticipating the work of Claude L&eacute;vi-Strauss,
 whose most significant ethnographic experience also took place in
 Brazil, Cendrars discovers in the former Portuguese colony an "authentic"
 alternative to Europe's cultural trajectory, yet views this "authentic"
 alternative as, paradoxically, the result of hybridization, of the
 commingling of heterogeneous elements occurring over

<B></B>

several centuries of colonial conquest and genetic and cultural
<I>m&eacute;tissage.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Cendrars demonstrates a high degree of sensitivity with respect to the
historical circumstances that produced the <I>m&eacute;tissage</I>
of Brazil's population. For instance, he refers repeatedly to the
violent intercultural contacts responsible for the palimpsestic Brazilian
cultural identities he so admires. Cendrars's aesthetic investment in such
contacts and their perverse and unexpected consequences is manifested
throughout his prose and poetic works, but nowhere as pointedly--or
as ambiguously--as in "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;"
(The metaphysics of coffee). By studying "La M&eacute;taphysique du
caf&eacute;" I intend to complicate the now dominant image of modernists
as Eurocentric collectors of deracinated non-Western exotica. I will
also provide a sense of the irreducible strangeness and singularity of
Cendrars's own role in the modern cross-fertilization of cultures. His
example suggests that in certain cases modernist hybrid production
participates in networks of contact and exchange that are far too complex
to be encompassed by the manichean categories critics sometimes employ.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  My intention is not to condemn or celebrate any particular modernist
  nor to "save" modernism, but rather to direct attention to the ways
  in which oppressive and liberating forces co-exist and interact in
  both modern and postmodern instances of aesthetic appropriation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Cendrars's first contacts with Brazil occurred before he even set foot
on the South American continent. In 1923, through his friend Fernand
L&eacute;ger, Cendrars met the Brazilian painter Tarsila do Amaral,
who was in Paris studying with the French cubist constructivists,
L&eacute;ger, Andr&eacute; Lhote, and Albert Gleizes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  Do Amaral was accompanied by her lover, Oswaldo de Andrade, a
  Brazilian modernist poet, later famous for his "Cannibalist Manifesto"
  of 1928, a provocative effort to "<I>&eacute;pater</I>" the Brazilian
  intelligentsia that placed Brazil on the avant-garde map. A friendship
  sprang up between Cendrars and the Brazilian couple, nourished by dinner
  parties in do Amaral's studio where guests included both the major
  French modernists of the day and the rising generation of Brazilian
  writers, composers, and artists (Sergio Milliet, Anita Malfatti,
  Vicente do Rego Monteiro, Heitor Villa-Lobos, and Victor Brecheret).
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 According to some sources it was through Oswaldo de Andrade that
 Cendrars made his first contact with Paolo Prado, the <I>grand</I>
 <I>m&eacute;c&egrave;ne</I> of Brazilian modernism. Prado, who had
 studied literature in Paris prior to World War I, met regularly with
 Cendrars to discuss modernism and Brazilian culture at the Librairie
 Chadenat, a bookstore specializing in the history of the Americas located
 on the Quai des Grands Augustins. It was here, in the thick atmosphere of
 erudition, that a bridge between Cendrars's brand of avant-garde practice
 and Prado's Brazilian-inflected notions of modernism was built. By
 the end of the year Prado had extended an invitation to Cendrars to
 visit Brazil that Cendrars accepted a few months later after securing
 assignments as a journalist from two French newspapers. After his arrival
 in Rio on 5 February 1924, Cendrars spent the next six months living
 with the Prados in S&atilde;o Paulo, traveling through the interior
 with groups of Brazilian painters and writers, and basking in the sun
 at his new acquaintances' coffee plantations or <I>fazendas.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Before any assessment of Cendrars's Brazilian experience can be made,
 however, it

<B></B>

must be understood that the Brazil that Cendrars encountered was
one already colored by the primitivist imagination of the early
twentieth-century avant-garde. His trip to Brazil, as well as his earliest
contacts with Brazilians, took place under the sign of France's already
well-developed fascination with third-world exotica, a fascination
that often failed to distinguish between African, African American,
and Luso-African cultures. Although Josephine Baker would not arrive in
Paris until October of 1925, the rage for African art and American jazz
had already reached a feverish pitch by the time Cendrars met Prado,
de Andrade, and do Amaral.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  At first, the Brazilians attracted Cendrars for the same reason that,
  five years earlier, African languages and jazz rhythms had interested
  him: all seemed to serve equally well as novelties to be thrown into
  the avant-garde mix.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Clearly Cendrars shared with his generation what Jean-Claude
 Blach&egrave;re has identified as a modernist nostalgia for the archaic,
 a desire for renewal in the midst of a (high) European culture seen as
 "old, sickly, inert, and bloodless."
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  Similar in this respect to his modern contemporaries, Cendrars was
  also looking for "new sources of energy" and yet the specific nature
  of his interest in the "savage" and the "exotic" was somewhat different.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
  In contrast to authors like Tzara or Cocteau, what Cendrars appreciated
  most was not the "new source of energy" provided by an idealized,
  childlike, and "authentic" Other, but rather the energy generated by
  internal division and hybridity, the productive tension that he saw
  emerging from a clash of conflicting velocities and rhythms operating
  simultaneously within a single (cultural, geographic) space. He
  did express admiration for what he considered the "savage" aspects
  of Brazil--e.g., the bush and the jungle; but far more striking to
  him, far more revelatory as a model for both aesthetic practice and
  cultural organization, was <I>contrast</I>: bush and city, "savage"
  and socialite. His devotion to Brazil was consistent with his earlier
  aesthetics of "simultaneous contrast," an aesthetics that sought a
  syncretic collage of distinct elements, each of which retained, despite
  the juxtaposition, its visual or linguistic independence. As Salvador
  de Reyes has put it, "Cendrars possessed a great love for Latin America
  because in its spectacular scenarios he saw a new world . . . full of
  <I>joie de vivre</I> and audacity, <I>a mixture of hyper-civilization
  and primitivism.</I>"
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 De Reyes's words capture well the peculiar nature of Cendrars's
 fascination with Brazil (as opposed to his general interest in things
 "primitive"). It was the hybridity and <I>not</I> the purity of the
 exotic Other that seduced him, a fact borne out by many of Cendrars's
 writings on Brazil, including "Saint Paul," the poem cited as an epigraph
 to this essay.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
  Cendrars may have expressed a desire to visit the "<I>for&ecirc;t
  vierge</I>" of the "<I>sauvage</I>," but he also hoped to reside at
  the precarious point where "[p]roducts from the five corners of the
  world turn up in the same dish, on the same dress."
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
  Faithful to the aesthetic program of <I>simultan&eacute;it&eacute;,</I>
  Cendrars emulated alterity not for its own sake, but rather for the
  sake of the startling effects that foreign elements could create when
  juxtaposed with elements drawn from more familiar European fare.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Given Cendrars's marked preference for the hybrid and the
 <I>m&eacute;tiss&eacute;,</I> it appears all the more curious that
 he ever took pen to paper to compose "La M&eacute;taphysique du
 caf&eacute;." This essay, first published in Rio de Janiero's "O Jornal"
 on 15 October 1927,
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>

<B></B>

has been treated by critics as an unqualified celebration of coffee
cultivation, a hymn to colonization, modernist standardization,
and capitalist enterprise. Alexandre Eulalio, the first chronicler of
Cendrars's travels through Brazil, considers "La M&eacute;taphysique" to
be, without doubt, "one of the most expressive documents of the Paulist
economic euphoria and the feeling of omnipotence consequent to it,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
  while Adrien Roig, without a trace of irony, calls it a "very beautiful
  text . . . of captivating realism and forceful inspiration.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
  Indeed, on a first reading, "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;"
  does appear to invert Cendrars's habitual hierarchy, jettisoning
  diversity in favor of single-crop agriculture, the most ecologically
  devastating and dehumanizing form of land management that Brazil ever
  developed. Why Cendrars would have chosen to write what appears to be
  a propagandistic piece of journalism privileging monoculture over the
  wealth of botanical diversity he praises elsewhere is a question that
  none of his critics has answered adequately.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
  "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;" is rarely mentioned in
  comprehensive studies of Cendrars's work and, if so, then only
  in passing--usually in the context of his fascination with famous
  entrepreneurs.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 The critical neglect of "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;"
 probably stems from the circumstantial quality of the piece, the fact
 that it reads somewhat like an advertisement for the industrialization
 of Brazil. Yet, paradoxically, while "La M&eacute;taphysique" seems
 to address specifically the advantages of coffee cultivation <I>in
 Brazil,</I> its first six paragraphs were in fact written for an
 earlier piece on economic development in the United States entitled
 "The Principle of Utility," published separately in 1925, then
 integrated into his epic on terrorist anarchism, <I>Moravagine,</I>
 the following year. The narrator who intones the hymn to monoculture
 in <I>Moravagine</I> can only with some difficulty be fused with the
 person of Cendrars in 1927. "La M&eacute;taphysique" is therefore far
 more equivocal than it first appears and should not be classified so
 quickly as evidence of Cendrars's fondness for large demonstrations of
 the will. The equivocal nature of the essay is due in large part to the
 tension produced between two distinct discourses, one metaphysical and
 the other economic. In a sense, "La M&eacute;taphysique" is itself
 <I>m&eacute;tiss&eacute;,</I> internally non-self-identical, and
 structured as a kind of dialogue between an advocate of monoculture
 and a poet invested in difference, as a source both of diction and
 creative energy. The ambiguity of "La M&eacute;taphysique"'s point of
 view towards both monoculture and hybridity makes it significant reading
 material, not only for specialized scholars of Cendrars, but also for
 those interested in the concept of hybridity and in the important place
 this concept has acquired in postcolonial theory.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 The best entry to the essay is perhaps provided by the subject
 matter itself: large-scale coffee cultivation, or what Cendrars calls
 "the enigma," the "force of attraction and exchange" at the root of
 intercultural contact. Coffee cultivation, however, is not simply a
 theme, it is also a symbol of the globalization of Brazil's economy and
 of its principal protagonist, Paulo Prado. This highly influential and
 powerful re was Cendrars's closest friend and constant companion
 during his Brazilian trips; he was also, however, the head of a coffee
 oligarchy and therefore part of the power structure responsible for
 the growth of monocultural agro-economics. "La M&eacute;taphysique
 du caf&eacute;" was obviously written in Prado's honor; it is in some
 sense a metaphysics of Prado

<B></B>

himself, an attempt to understand the law that could make
coffee--personified by Prado--simultaneously a force of liberation and
oppression, of intercultural and monocultural standardization.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Just who was Paulo Prado and what was the nature of his hold on
 Cendrars? In short, Prado encapsulated in his own genealogy the entire
 modern history of Brazil. The Prados arrived in the S&atilde;o Paulo
 region from Portugal in the eighteenth century, entered into livestock
 trading, slave trading, sugar growing, politics, and finally established
 ascendency in the domain of coffee cultivation. When Paolo Prado went
 to study literature in Paris before World War I, the coffee boom,
 which lasted from approximately 1840 to 1900, was already on the
 wane. But the Prado name was still firmly associated with wide-spread
 coffee cultivation, a nineteenth-century phenomenon responsible for
 an irreversible "shift," as historian Darrell L&eacute;vi has written,
 "in the nation's economic center of gravity and a major sea-change in
 Brazil's economic history."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 The cultivation of coffee imposed by oligarchies such as the one
 controlled by the Prado family resulted not only in the heightened
 prosperity and greater visibility of the Brazilian economy, but also in
 mass destruction of the Amazon jungle, the repression of an economic
 underclass, the solidification of a police state, and the eradication
 of previously isolated Amerindians and their diverse cultures. However,
 coffee was also an agent of cultural cross-fertilization. It permitted
 the Prados to travel, to establish connections with important
 European families such as the Rothschilds, and to collect examples
 of European avant-garde artworks. Finally, coffee was the indirect
 cause of the famous racial hybridity of the Brazilian population:
 during the nineteenth century, Amerindians were "domesticated," slaves
 were imported from Africa, and immigrants were seduced from Italy and
 Germany in order to supply labor power to the burgeoning coffee and
 sugar cane plantations on Brazilian soil. For Cendrars, then, Prado
 emblematized the two faces of modernity. On the one hand, he stood for
 economic development, the raw force of will allowing humans to intervene
 in the constitution of ecosystems and the migratory patterns of entire
 populations. On the other, he represented internationalism, the end of
 cultural isolation, increased possibilities for intercultural contact,
 and thus the most avant-garde tendencies in the arts and letters.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 What drew Cendrars to Prado, and what underlies the strange prose of "La
 M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;," is Cendrars's sense that everything
 valuable in modernity--the openness to the new, the desire to redefine
 the locus and function of art, and, perhaps most importantly, the
 decision to jettison originality and authenticity in favor of citation,
 pastiche, hybridity, and appropriation--in short, all that was dearest to
 his generation, was in fact predicated on a deeper principle, one that
 Prado's entrepreneurial spirit illustrated perfectly. For Cendrars, the
 dynamic responsible for modernity's richness, the impulse governing its
 two major manifestations--monoculture and hybridity, The Grand Hotel and
 the carnival--was quite simply <I>appetite,</I> the "furious appetite"
 alluded to in his poem "Saint Paul."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 In order to seize the relation Cendrars sketches between hybridity
 and conquest, heterogeneity and the implacable domination of the same,
 it is necessary to return to

<B></B>

the pages of "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;." Structurally,
"La M&eacute;taphysique" is presented as a kind of <I>mise en abyme</I>:
it contains two very distinct scenarios, a frame narrative in which
monoculture dominates, and an internal narrative in which increased
transcultural hybridization takes center stage. By means of this framing
structure, Cendrars implies the interdependence between imperialism and
hybridity, between cultural hegemony and greater "choice" (the multiple
"interpellations" to which, according to Jim Collins, the modern subject
is exposed).
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
  He begins the essay by evoking the railway, the road, and the canal,
  familiar late nineteenth-century symbols of expansionism, in order
  to suggest at once the discovery of difference and its inverse, the
  imposition of geometric regularity on previously immeasurable expanses
  of the globe:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 The opening paragraphs of "La Metaphysique du caf&eacute;" combine a tone
 of awe-- "<I>ma&icirc;trise &eacute;tonnante</I>"--with a vocabulary
 suggesting moral repugnance--"<I>dominer</I>," "<I>imposer</I>,"
 "<I>exploitation</I>," and so on. Monoculture "dissociates,"
 "disintegrates," and "masticates." Like a huge digestive apparatus
 monoculture transforms "primal matter, plants, and animals" into one
 identical substance. It is merciless ("<I>sans aucun souci</I>");
 it "prescribes" and "overwhelms," eventually "reducing" rather than
 increasing the diversity of forms of life on the planet: "In comparison
 to the vegetal overabundance of nature, monoculture only cultivates a
 very small number of judiciously selected species" .

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 All this activity of violent assimilation and mastication is motivated,
 Cendrars then explains, by man's perverse impulse to render difference
 uniform, his seemingly compulsive need to dominate nature's chaos through
 any means at his disposal: "On the part of man there is a need for
 simplification that tends to satisfy itself by any means whatsoever. And
 this artificial monotony, this monotony that increasingly takes over
 the world, this monotony that certain people deplore is actually the
 clearest sign of our grandeur" .

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 It could be argued, and indeed has been, that Cendrars was entirely
 in earnest when he wrote these words, and that, therefore, any tonal
 inconsistencies one might discern between expressions such as "artificial
 monotony" and "our grandeur"--as well as the irritating effect created
 by the thrice repeated "this monotony"--are simply inventions on the
 part of the reader. The conclusion to the essay tends to confirm

<B></B>

this reading, for it insists upon a causal link between the violent
transformation of delicate ecosystems and a "moral progression" leading
to greater civic freedoms and democratic reforms:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The optimism Cendrars expresses in this conclusion now appears
hallucinatory; however, at the time, two years before the Great Crash of
1929, capitalist expansion indeed seemed to promise a higher standard
of living, if not for the indigenous Amerindian, then at least, as
Cendrars remarks, for "the poorest colonizer." "This little coffee bean
[<I>Cette cerise de caf&eacute;</I>]," Cendrars predicts, is the capital
capable not only of financing the newest "skyscraper in the great city of
S&atilde;o Paulo," but also of supplying greater comfort and luxury, "Yes,
luxury, even to the poorest colonizer" . Only in his later, deeply
pessimistic works such as <I>Le Lotissement du ciel</I> (The parceling
out of the sky) does Cendrars fully admit the fallacy of the causal link
he had assumed previously between monoculture and altruistic reform.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Yet even "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;" shows signs of
 internal conflict; a pastiche of texts patched together, it is often
 self-contradictory on the levels of diction and tone. The conclusion
 may perhaps have been intended merely as a formal bow to the audience
 Cendrars was addressing. He should not be forgiven his formal bow,
 however; Cendrars was in fact often guilty of flirting with technocrats,
 industrialists, and repressive regimes of many colors, and thus of
 compromising his reputation as a prophet of literary and cultural
 freedoms.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
  At the same time, though, the destabilizing elements embedded in the
  essay militate in favor of a more thorough and careful reading. The
  essay as a whole is not reducible to the propagandistic bow with which

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Cendrars's first snapshot of Brazil is taken on the wharfs, from
 the vantage point of a geographically and narratively liminal region
 where the bustling traffic between Brazil and the rest of the world
 is most in evidence. The poet's first impression of Brazil is thus
 not of its autonomy and isolation but rather of the permeability of
 its borders. Brazil's cultural identity is shown to be in flux: the
 country is undergoing an invasion of commodity items, all of which
 serve as fetishes of modernity, "statuettes of Saint Teresa" in the
 tabernacle of capitalism. The wharf scene is an inversion of the scene
 that preceded it--the spectacle of monoculture's "artificial monotony"
 and "grandeur"; and yet the two scenes are clearly linked by a causal
 connection. If monoculture is a large stomach, a machine for devouring
 and transforming everything into the same, monoculture is also,
 he discovers, a catalyst for exchange and increased intercultural
 contact. Objects of consumption from all over the world mingle in a
 chaotic mosaic: from words ("newspapers from all over the world") and
 apparati ("scrap-iron" and "machines") to belief systems ("statuettes of
 Saint Theresa"), cultural product ("gramophones"), and household items
 responsible for the dramatic transformation of hygenic rituals and daily
 life ("rolls of toilet paper," "bathtubs," "tons of gasoline"). Cendrars
 even implies that he is himself a kind of <I>produit de consommation</I>
 brought over from abroad to be assimilated into the "magnificent
 disorder" of Brazilian cultural life. The repetition of the verb
 "disembark" to refer both to his own arrival on Brazilian soil and to
 that of the hundreds of thousands of immigrants who come to work on
 sugar and coffee plantations establishes surreptitiously a connection
 between the types of cultural crossings (and labor patterns) enforced
 by agro-capitalism and the types of cultural crossings celebrated as
 internationalism or the globalization of culture. Cendrars's relation
 to Brazil transforms him into a thing, a fetishized representative of
 European modernism, expected, in turn, to transport back to Europe
 an assimilable--and marketable--snapshot of Brazil. It is as though
 Cendrars had a precocious intimation that, in postmodernity, cultural
 hybridity would largely be a matter of consumption.

 Upon witnessing the spectacle of commodity diversity played out on the
 wharfs of Rio, the narrator then takes a vow that he will seek out its
 hidden motor; he will "go back as quickly as possible to the source of
 this marvelous richness and . . . go see, see with [his] own eyes, how
 this source overflows with such furious energy, such furious abundance"
 . The next section of the narrative then describes the author's
 visit to the plantation of S&atilde;o Martinho, a visit made with the
 ambition of locating the "source" of "such furious abundance." The
 original publication of "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;"
 was accompanied by a photograph of the main building at S&atilde;o
 Martinho, a detail lending a note of journalistic rigor to the piece. But

 The passage's sudden shifts in tone, style, punctuation, and diction
 correspond to the nature of the experience being described. The
 abrupt revelation of the "source" or the "force of attraction and
 exchange" is staged by Cendrars as no less than a confrontation with
 the mathematical sublime. Indeed, all the traditional elements of
 the sublime aesthetic experience are in place: he and his companion
 "contemplate" the "colossal" expanse; the identical rows of coffee-plants
 are metaphorically transformed into one of Kant's privileged res for
 the natural sublime, the ocean and its innumerable waves ("an emerald
 sea, a profound ocean"); and finally, the observers of this spectacle are
 reduced to an anguished silence ("too much grandeur strangles, stifles,
 and troubles"). Descriptive prose collapses into the exclamation "What
 a spectacle!" In the end the viewer is left speechless, resonating in
 awe to the miracle of redundancy ("I couldn't find a word to say").

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Once again, the reader is arrested by the problem of tone. Cendrars
 may delight in the spectacle of agricultural standardization but he
 also indicates that such standardization "silences," "stifles," and
 "strangles." The experience as described is thus by no means uniformly
 positive; the author depicts himself as transfixed on the spot,
 immobilized, just like a coffee plant, "<I>les pieds plant&eacute;s
 dans la terre rouge</I>." He has not been energized by the spectacle of
 monoculture; on the contrary, he has been struck dumb by it, like the
 victim of an Ovidian metamorphosis dehumanized by too intense an exposure
 to passion. At least momentarily, the sublimity of monoculture transforms
 the spectator into stone: he is now reified, transformed into an object,
 "somber, taciturn, and as if immobilized." The author experiences a
 loss of his faculties, a sense that the imagination has been overcome
 and defeated by something it cannot encompass; only after a few moments
 does this experience of silencing give way to an overflow of words,
 the repetitive, appositive sentences found in the paragraphs that follow.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Cendrars's caffeinated sublime is an implicit commentary not on
 monoculture alone but rather on its relation to the Kantian sublime and
 to the laws of Western aesthetics in general. Just as the experience
 of the mathematical sublime described by Kant involves simultaneously a
 movement of recoil and a sensation of awe, so too Cendrars's experience
 of monoculture's "artificial monotony" provokes in him sensations of
 morbidity and vertigo as well as respect and admiration. The original
 title, "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;," already evoked the
 connection between Kant's theory of Universal Taste and Brazil's
 discovery of the world's taste for coffee; however, in 1931, when the
 essay was republished as part of the collection <I>Aujourd'hui</I>,
 Cendrars solidified the connection by adding an epigraph that places
 Kant--or at least his ghost--in a direct relation to monocultural
 production. The epigraph, which I have resisted citing until now, is
 drawn from a French newspaper article that appeared four days after the
 first version of "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;" was published
 in <I>O Jornal</I>. It reads:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 In a few succinct sentences, Cendrars establishes no less than a genetic
 relation between the great German philosopher and the owner of the
 coffee plantation and, as a corollary, between metaphysical principles of
 universal taste and the geopolitics of global monoculture. The connection
 Cendrars establishes is somewhat loose, however, in that Kant's sublime
 is that of the natural wonder, whereas the experience of the sublime
 he describes is one provoked by the spectacle of man's own nature, his
 unyielding will to impress his stamp on the disorderly productivity of
 the earth. The aspect of Kant that Cendrars retains intact is this:
 a law of human nature exists commanding man to seek experiences of
 immeasurable magnitudes only to search for ways to encompass these
 magnitudes by recasting them as reflections of the immeasurability of the
 human mind. According to this law, an initial feeling of repugnance or
 fear is followed by an intimation of what the human mind is capable of
 achieving: a conception of the supersensible, of that which is beyond
 estimation or, put differently, that which can only find its measure
 in the inestimable thing man's mind is. "Therefore," concludes Kant,

the feeling of the sublime in nature is respect for <I>our own

renders, as it were, intuitable the supremacy of our cognitive faculties
on the rational side over the greatest faculty of sensibility.

 In a move that will be crucial not only to the future of Western
 aesthetics in general but also to Cendrars's specific understanding of
 the monocultural sublime, Kant shifts the locus of immeasurability from
 the Object to the Subject, thereby, in a sense, absorbing the other,
 making it a re, an equivalent of the Self. The law of the mind

<B></B>

as described by Kant turns out to be the necessity experienced by the
subject to seek out equivalences, to insist upon the fungibility of
the non-fungible:

in the aesthetic estimate of such an immeasurable whole, the sublime

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is, in other words, "for us a law (of reason), which goes to make
us what we are," Kant explains, "that we should esteem as small in
comparison with ideas of reason everything which for us is great in
nature as an object of sense; and that which makes us alive to the
feeling of this supersensible side of our being harmonizes with that law"
(<I>Critique,</I> 106).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 In essence, then, Kant proposes that our natural instinct as humans
 is to resolve every sublime experience of the external Object into
 an experience of the sublime Subject, to elevate an experience of
 terror and stifling awe to the order of an epiphany, an affirmation
 of Reason. As victims (or beneficiaries) of this law, we transform our
 silence into words, our non-knowledge into knowledge, and by doing so
 we neutralize the threat of the radically other by incorporating the
 other into ourselves. It is in this respect that the sublime can be
 seen--by Cendrars, <I>is</I> seen--as productive, capitalist, even
 cannibalistic. Our nature, Kant seems to say, is quite simply to be
 hungry, to have an appetite for--to take a "negative pleasure" in--the
 "<I>absolutely great</I>" which we then succeed in assimilating to our
 transcendental being (<I>Critique,</I> 106). It is <I>this</I> law of
 human reason, and not the little "<I>c&eacute;rise de caf&eacute;</I>,"
 that proves to be the dynamic source, the generative motor that Cendrars
 discovers in "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;."

 Cendrars; "Is it the brutishness brought on by work, by too much work,

 man's will to profit Cendrars seems to fall back on purely pragmatic
 explanations for monoculture's transformation of "each zone of the
 planet"; and yet his search does not end here. The answer to Cendrars's
 question--"Whose will made all this happen?"--seems to be located instead
 in a slightly earlier passage, one devoted to coffee in particular rather

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 In what has become a familiar interrogative mode, Cendrars suggests
 that the will (or the law) governing Brazil's economic prosperity,
 its increasing political importance, and even its new visibility in the
 aesthetic domain, is related not simply to monocultural agro-economics
 in general, but to the obsessive cultivation of coffee in particular. The
 need that causes people of all ages and locales to intoxicate themselves
 with a stimulant is, he implies, identical to the law that requires man
 to experience as fully and intensely as possible the seemingly limitless
 force and acuity of the mind. To put this in Kantian terms, we might
 say that to "pass beyond the narrow confines of sensibility," to feel
 the full scope of the mind without, however, being able to identify its
 borders, is the ultimate goal towards which all this feverish activity
 strains (<I>Critique,</I> 103). Man suffers from an ineluctable need to
 "recuperate losses," says Cendrars,
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
  just as Kant, employing a vocabulary that is, after all, arguably more
  economic than it is metaphysical, posits the sublime as a variety of
  investment, the experience of a loss that must be tolerated in order to
  create a surplus, an expansion of the self. For the experience of the
  sublime, writes Kant, provokes "a pleasure that only arises indirectly,
  being brought about by the feeling of a <I>momentary check to the vital
  forces</I> followed at once by a discharge <I>all the more powerful</I>
  [ . . . ]; the [sublime] object lends itself to the presentation of <I>a
  sublimity discoverable in the mind</I>" (<I>Critique,</I> 91-2;
  emphasis added).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 In sum, Cendrars's "metaphysics" of monoculture produces a theory of
 human nature as essentially appetitive, forever extending its reach
 to encompass what at first appears terrifyingly Other. Paradoxically,
 humans seek not to satisfy their appetite, but to stimulate it, for any
 immediate satisfaction, any cessation of longing, would place limits
 on what appetite, and thus on what the mind, could be. Monoculture,
 like Kant's Subject with a capital "S," eats up everything around it,
 reducing difference on its own soil but simultaneously permitting
 commerce with that which, up to that point, it has not been. Greedy
 as the mind, monoculture is destructive of the other, but infinitely
 re-productive of itself. Ultimately Kant belongs in Brazil because
 his theory of the mind harmonizes perfectly with the metaphysics of
 monoculture: both propose that the non-fungible can be--must be, by
 law--reduced to the fungible, and that, through the very process of
 the Other's reduction, man should be enlarged "<I>de plus en plus</I>."

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 How, then, is the reader to situate Cendrars's voice in "La
 M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;"? Exactly what attitude towards
 monoculture is one to attribute to him? There is no doubt that Cendrars
 admires the force of the law of assimilation he discovers in San
 Martinho, but it is equally clear that he appreciates its contrary, the
 non-law of uncontrolled diversity--hybrid forms such as the carnival,
 the <I>m&eacute;tiss&eacute;,</I> as well as the heteroglossic mix of
 languages and lifestyles he finds piled up along the quai. Most

<B></B>

worthy of notice is his recognition that monoculture and hybridity
are inextricably intertwined: intercultural contacts of all
varieties--ethnographic, artistic, cultural, religious, and of course
commercial--owe their existence to, and cannot take place without,
economic developments of the kind motivated by the law of the caffeinated
sublime. Although the two major forms of hybridity Cendrars confronts are
markedly different--the racial and cultural hybridity of Brazil's past
must be distinguished from the commercial hybridity of its present--both
can nonetheless trace their roots back to the same Kantian ambitions
of the agricultural entrepreneur. Cendrars does not want to relinquish
either the entrepreneurial rigor ("the need for simplification") or the
carnivalesque excess of syncretic play. The unsubstantiated premise of
"La M&eacute;taphysique" is that the former will continue to engender and
support the latter. Such a premise, however, will not be maintained as
Cendrars, like many modernists of his generation, becomes increasingly
aware of the dangers of capitalist exploitation. His attitude toward
monocultural standardization and industrial development grows increasingly
skeptical and "irreverent."
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
  And even in 1927 he can provide only weak assurance that monoculture's
  suppression of botanical, zoological, and racial difference will be
  offset by an exponential increase in the number of hybrid ways to live,
  worship, and make art.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A year after "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;" appeared, Oswaldo
de Andrade published what would become one of the major documents of
postmodern "hybridity-talk": the "Manifesto Antrop&oacute;fago" or
"Cannibalist Manifesto."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
  Brazil's first indigenous avant-garde intervention was based on a
  recuperation of the previously pejorative term "cannibal" to refer to
  the active assimilation and transformation of foreign aesthetics by
  Brazilian-born Portuguese-speaking writers. Many contemporary postmodern
  theorists place de Andrade's aesthetics of "anthropophagy" in the
  same category as Rog&eacute;rio Sganzerla's more recent "aesthetics
  of garbage," Paul Leduc's "salamander" poetics, and the phenomenon of
  American hip-hop.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
  All these examples of postmodern and, in some cases, postcolonial
  hybridity are thought to manifest the single most progressive tendency
  operating in culture today. This tendency is one that, as Kobena
  Mercer describes it, "critically <I>appropriates</I> elements from
  the mastercodes of the dominant culture and 'creolises' them."
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
  Cannibalism is an appropriate metaphor for this positively valenced
  mode of "appropriation"; it suggests the gesture of incorporation
  (otherwise known as pastiche, collage, grafting, or sampling) and
  exemplifies such an incorporation, a parodic recycling of a pejorative
  term that displaces the term's previous value.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 No one has yet thought to resituate de Andrade's "Cannibalist
 Manifesto" either in the context of Cendrars's "La M&eacute;taphysique
 du caf&eacute;" or in that of Kant's Third <I>Critique.</I> This is
 hardly surprising, given that Cendrars is not a particularly well-known
 re in postcolonialist studies and that, further, Kant's is not the
 first name to pop into one's mind when speaking about cannibalism. But
 such a recontextualization is worth attempting, for it is reasonable
 to posit that de Andrade would have been familiar, if not intimate,
 with Cendrars's "Utility Principle," and that, moreover, he would

<B></B>

have continued to follow Cendrars's career after 1924 and therefore
would have read "La M&eacute;taphysique." Intertextuality or literary
cross-fertilization is the major theme of the "Cannibalist Manifesto,"
and de Andrade makes no attempt to disguise the fact that his own peculiar
brand of avant-garde poetics is largely a cannibalization of previous
European models, including--but not limited to--that of Francis Picabia's
"Manifeste Cannibale Dada" of 1920.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
  But there is further evidence to suggest that the influence of
  Cendrars was pertinent to the thesis of "Cannibalist Manifesto":
  in de Andrade's "Manifesto of Pau-Brasil Poetry" of 1924, where
  the author first tests out ideas he will later develop in the more
  radical "Cannibalist Manifesto," he specifically mentions Cendrars
  as an important model. Moreover, the manifesto's typography, diction,
  and argument all manifest the influence of Cendrars's work, especially
  the 1919 volume, <I>Dix-neuf po&egrave;mes &eacute;lastiques.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
  Finally, both the dominant metaphor and the specific language in which
  this metaphor is articulated in the "Cannibalist Manifesto" recall
  "La M&eacute;taphysique." "Cannibalist Manifesto" is clearly another
  troping on Kant, but a troping to the second degree.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 "Cannibalist Manifesto" begins with a gesture similar to the
 one that opens Cendrars's "M&eacute;taphysique": a matter
 of taste, or what we might call culinary ritual, is declared
 to have metaphysical implications: "Cannibalism alone unites
 us. Socially. Economically. Philosophically."
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
  Critics have understood the "us" in this passage to refer to Brazilians
  in particular (and indeed, the subversive nature of de Andrade's
  transformative, appropriative gesture depends to a large extent on
  the particularity of the "us"). However, it soon becomes evident that
  cannibalism is a practice that unites not simply Brazilian writers and
  artists in search of a historically resonant, indigenous aesthetic;
  rather, cannibalism is a practice that unites the entire human race:
  "I am only concerned with what is not mine. Law of Man. Law of the
  cannibal" . "Law of the cannibal" is in fact the law of the
  capitalist, who concerns himself only with what he does not already
  possess. In quest of the not-yet-possessed, or the Other, "We push
  onward," states de Andrade . If we wish to be good cannibals, he
  continues, we must transform "the equation 'Self, part of the Cosmos'
  into the axiom 'Cosmos, part of the Self'" . This latter axiom is,
  for "us," our "Law": "Subsistence. Experience. Cannibalism" .

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 By now, an echo of Cendrars's "Metaphysics of coffee" should be
 audible. Just as Cendrars discovered the "principle" behind monocultural
 assimilation, so de Andrade articulates a "Law of Man" or of the
 cannibal who incorporates every Other into the self. But behind this
 echo it is also possible to retrieve the even fainter reverberation of
 Kant's own axiomatic metaphysics. While de Andrade's cannibal inverts
 the pantheistic "Self, part of the Cosmos" to form the proposition
 "Cosmos, part of the Self," Kant's "outraged imagination" strives,
 in its own cannibalistic "onward advance," to incorporate the sublime
 Other, to assimilate it to the sublime dimensions of the mind.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 In what way, then, does the cannibalist impulse of the manifesto
 differ from the standardizing impulse of "La M&eacute;taphysique du
 caf&eacute;"? How are de Andrade and Cendrars positioned differently
 vis-&agrave;-vis the devastating, exploitative program of modernist
 standardization? The aesthetics championed by "Cannibalist Manifesto"
 have

<B></B>

generally been associated with the subversive project of
<I>d&eacute;tournement</I>: the appropriation of, or troping on, an
element of the hegemonic order in order to create a new hybrid, an entity
situated in the "neither . . . nor" region of anti-essentialist politics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
  In the words of de Andrade's English translator, Leslie Bary,
  the manifesto "challenges the dualities civilization/barbarism,
  modern/primitive, and original/derivative, which had informed the
  construction of Brazilian culture since the days of the colony";
  "Oswald's anthropophagist," she concludes, "neither apes nor rejects
  European culture, but 'devours' it, adapting its strengths and
  incorporating them into the native self."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 The difference between a cannibalist aesthetics and a monocultural
 economics is thus not to be located in their respective underlying
 metaphysics, for the Kantian "Law of Man"-- the law of devouring
 and appropriation--underlies them both. Rather, this difference
 is to be found in the positionality of the subject who exercises
 the Kantian "Law": Does the subject exercise it from a position of
 subservience or domination, in order to resist or, alternatively, to
 oppress, in the role of "parodic" mime or "authentic" originator? At
 several clearly identifiable moments, Cendrars positions himself on
 the side of the colonizer; "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;"
 was, after all, intended to please his benefactor, the Europeanized
 intellectual and coffee plantation owner, Paulo Prado (most likely the
 "companion" to whom Cendrars refers in the text). Entire passages of
 "La M&eacute;taphysique," not to mention the full text of "The Utility
 Principle," read like apologies for empire, hymns to the pure will
 to dominate the Other. De Andrade's manifesto, in contrast, assumes
 the position of the colonized. Although de Andrade, like Prado, was a
 Europeanized Brazilian and a member of the ruling elite, he attempts
 to speak in "Cannibalist Manifesto" as a descendent of the Tupi, not of
 the Vieira, as a son of the Great Snake, not of the Bad Mother, Cornelia.

  Ironically, it was Cendrars himself who had encouraged de Andrade to
  identify more fully with the indigenous tribal past of Brazil.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
  However, as a foreigner dependent for his knowledge of Brazil's interior
  upon the very system that was destroying it, Cendrars could hardly have
  assumed the position of the colonized that de Andrade, perhaps with a
  bit of bad faith, could. As a member of the oligarchical elite, however,
  he was appropriating a cannibalist identity from a race to which he
  did not belong. The politics of de Andrade's gesture are thus a little
  less clear than they have been assumed to be. At the same time, though,
  de Andrade manages to execute a more radical gesture; he cannibalizes
  Kant <I>not</I> with the intention of mobilizing him for monoculture
  but, rather, in order to <I>hybridize</I> <I>Kant,</I> to unveil the
  "primitive," cannibalistic discourse embedded in and informing Kant's
  own, and thus to suggest that the "law of human reason"--that which
  "makes us what we are"--is the law of the sublime cannibal "only
  concerned with what is not mine" ("Cannibalist Manifesto," 39).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Whether de Andrade would have hybridized Kant without the intervention
 of Cendrars is a question worth asking. By making the link between
 a "devouring" monoculture and a Subject in search of the sublime,
 Cendrars provided de Andrade with a certain form of avant-garde
 nourishment. Because of this debt (not to mention his debt to European
 modernism in general), de Andrade can only with difficulty claim to
 speak from the position of the indigenous Brazilian cannibal. The
 equivocal position

<B></B>

in which de Andrade finds himself is not exceptional but rather typical
of the predicament encountered by many cultural producers speaking from
the position of the disenfranchised. As Gayatri Spivak has persuasively
argued, the subaltern--the truly subaltern--rarely (if ever) gets a
chance to locate himself or herself in discourse, and thus cannot lay
claim to the honor of introducing new (pure) voices into circulation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
  In this light, all cultural producers are cannibals, inevitably subject
  to the "Law of Man," the law that bids us find a language, a measure,
  for that which initially appears beyond "the narrow confines" of the
  hegemonic (European) self.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 A close reading of "La M&eacute;taphysique du caf&eacute;" and its use of
 pronouns, diction, and citation, reveals that Cendrars's authorial voice
 is hybrid as well; it does not emanate from a self-identical position
 but is instead composed of various, and sometimes opposed discourses
 in what is perhaps ultimately not enough of a "<I>critical</I>
 syncretism," a poetics of simultaneity explicitly concerned with
 exposing power relations between heterogeneous cultural traditions or
 practices. But one thing Cendrars does at least acknowledge is that
 all forms of making, speaking, and cultivating are to some extent acts
 of homogenization (they suppress radical alterity) as much as they are
 acts of hybridization that--in the vegetal as well as the commercial
 world--produce consequences never entirely predictable or subject
 to control. By placing Kant at the heart both of homogenization and
 hybridity, Cendrars introduces an irony into all attempts to maintain
 their separation (and thus to politicize them in any simple or clear
 manner). Cendrars demonstrates that even an aesthetics of difference has
 to pass through a moment of digestive recuperation, of communication
 in which discourse--monoculture, the Transcendental Subject--absorbs
 the Other and thus risks reducing this Other to the same.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 The discernably ambivalent tone of Cendrars's "La M&eacute;taphysique du
 caf&eacute;" is a bracing corrective to the kind of celebratory excesses
 of critics like Jim Collins, Iain Chambers, or Ulf Hannerz. According
 to Hannerz, for instance, multiplied contacts between first-world
 and third-world countries (contacts based, he does not mention, on
 the exploitative practices of agricultural, industrial, and chemical
 conglomerates) are not decreasing but rather increasing the number of
 cultural alternatives available to the world as a whole. "The people in
 my favorite Nigerian town drink Coca Cola," Hannerz writes, "but they
 drink <I>buru-kutu</I> too; and they can watch <I>Charlie's Angels</I>
 as well as Hausa drummers on the television sets which spread rapidly
 as soon as electricity has arrived."
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
  In the same vein, Collins writes with unalloyed enthusiasm that the
  problem of "accessibility [has] virtually disappeared"; there is no
  Grand Hotel "that somehow orchestrates all cultural production and
  reception according to one master system." Anyone can be interpellated
  by anything, and thus we are subjects without boundaries, constantly
  able to incorporate the Other as just another version of the self.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 There is reason to rejoice in the increased circulation of third
 world musics, art traditions, and hybrid practices. Still, as Robert
 Stam reminds us, hybridity "has never been a peaceful encounter,
 a tension-free theme park; it has always been deeply entangled with
 colonial violence."
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
  And Torgovnick counsels that reveling "in the postmodern m&eacute;lange
  of us and them" should not obscure other, less developed historical

<B></B>

knowledge of how, precisely, these new and exotic treats came to appear
on the dinner plate.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
  All forms of cultural syncretism must struggle to remain
  <I>critical</I>; the absorptive gesture is not arrested by creative
  re-citation; without the traumatic work of memory and productive
  alienation--without, that is, the very ruptures in tone that
  characterize Cendrars's "La M&eacute;taphysique"--such gestures can
  submit too easily to the law of the cannibalistic and homogenizing
  sublime. Resisting complete assimilation, letting the seams show (as
  Cendrars invariably did), is perhaps a peculiarly modernist way of
  registering the history that brings different cultures together and
  that too often tears them apart.

James Clifford, <I>The Predicament of Culture: Twentieth-Century
Ethnography, Literature, and Art</I> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University

economically and politically weaker microcultures will not necessarily
die out, but will instead learn to practice "strategic accommodations,"
discovering "powerful, distinctive ways to live . . . not as archaic
survival but as an ongoing process" of self-realization and renewal
. See also Edouard Glissant on "<I>cr&eacute;olit&eacute;</I>" in <I>Le

a special case; he transforms the noun, <I>hybrid</I>, into a verb,
<I>hybridize</I>, and uses it to refer to, among other things, the
process of disclosing "the struggle of identifications" within any
identity and the "strategic [discursive] reversal of the process of
domination through disavowal" (Bhabha, <I>The Location of Culture</I>

Eulalio has suggested that "La M&eacute;taphysique" expresses Cendrars's
longing for order, a longing that was satisfied in his later life
by a return to religious faith. Others have proposed that the essay
confirms the growing influence of Prado over Cendrars. The essay was
written during Cendrars's last trip to Brazil in 1926; by this time,
his relations with other Brazilian modernists such as Oswaldo de Andrade
and Mario de Andrade had become strained. Apparently, he was thinking
seriously about purchasing land and becoming a developer himself.

An important exception is Adrien Roig's "La Fazenda S&atilde;o
Martinho." Roig provides a generous historical background for the
plantation that Cendrars visited; his reading of the re of the
<I>fazenda</I> in the works of Oswald de Andrade and Cendrars is, however,
disappointing. Roig concludes that both de Andrade and Cendrars were
enchanted by the plantation's prosperity ("Prosp&eacute;rit&eacute;"
is the name of the poem de Andrade dedicated to the Fazenda S&atilde;o
Martinho in <I>Po&eacute;sie Pau-Brasil</I>); he does not attend
either to the more equivocal aspects of Cendrars's description nor
does he spend any time at all on Cendrars's use of Kant. Maria Teresa
de Freitas, "Le Br&eacute;sil en revue: 'Reportages' br&eacute;siliens

"Manifeste Cannibale Dada" was first published in the small Parisian

from Nunes to Robert Stam, have neglected to analyze the relation between
Picabia's manifesto and de Andrade's, claiming that there is, in fact,
little similarity--either in content or form--between the two. However,
Picabia's "Manifeste Cannibale Dada," a testament to and criticism of the
invasion of capitalist practices into the domain of art, appears to be
entirely pertinent to de Andrade's notion of a carnivorous, acquisitive
"Law of Man." The specular relation between cannibalism and capitalism
that de Andrade implicitly establishes may be clearly identified when
Picabia's and de Andrade's manifestos are placed side by side.

Until Cendrars came to Brazil, Oswaldo de Andrade and Tarsila do Amaral's
avant-garde aesthetic had consisted of the stream-lined cubism of
L&eacute;ger and the machinism of Le Corbusier. Cendrars encouraged the
couple to explore Brazil's indigenous forms of cultural expression. He
organized group trips into the Brazilian interior--an interior that even
de Andrade and do Amaral had never seen before. It was only after the
group made a trip together to Minas Gerais in April 1924 that de Andrade
came up with the idea for <I>Pau Brasil,</I> the movement that would
establish the necessity for a properly <I>Brazilian</I> avant-gardism and
that would spawn the "Cannibalist Manifesto" three years later. (Perhaps
this is why de Andrade wrote in the dedication to <I>Pau Brasil</I>:
"To Blaise Cendrars, on the occasion of the discovery of Brazil.") Serge
Milliet writes that "the influence of Cendrars on the Brazilian modernists
was decisive. These rich young people could travel every year throughout
Europe, but they knew nothing about their own country" (Milliet, quoted
in Pierre Rivas, "Cendrars, le Nouveau Monde et l'Homme nouveau," in
<I>Europe</I> 54, no. 566 [June 1976]: 54; my translation). Cendrars
even founded a Soci&eacute;te des Amis des Monuments Historiques du
Br&eacute;sil whose mission it was to preserve colonial ruins and tribal
artefacts from neglect, destruction, and deportation to foreign museums.
