According to a great Rabbi, Walter Benjamin recalls in his essay on Kafka,
the coming Messiah "will not wish to change the world by force but will
merely make a slight adjustment in it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
  A slight adjustment of the ordinary--this is indeed what happens
  everywhere in Kafka's texts in which daily objects, made all but
  invisible through familiarity, are transformed into enigmatic
  signs. The archetype of the enigmatic object-sign for Kafka is the
  door, and it is indeed doors that structure the parabolic and mythic
  space of his narratives. Opened and shut, locked and unlocked, peeped
  through and barricaded, they cease to be ordinary doors and become
  instead architectural elements in a theater of the unsayable. This
  is of course nowhere more true than with those doors that his heroes
  regularly confront in their search for truth: it happens to K. in <I>The
  Castle,</I> to Josef K. in <I>The Trial,</I> and, most famously of
  all, to the man from the country in the parable "Before the Law." If
  only they were able to pass through these enigmatic doors and come
  face to face with what lies behind them, these texts seem to suggest,
  they would finally be able to grasp the truth they have been seeking,
  discover the Law of their lives. Kafka's doors, in other words, hold
  out the promise of revelation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Kafka's "In the Penal Colony" is a remarkably doorless story. Instead
of the crowded attics of <I>The Trial</I> or the tenebrous landscape of
<I>The Castle,</I> "In the Penal Colony" takes place in a barren desert
valley, under a glare so intense as to prompt the explorer to shelter
"his eyes from the sun with one hand."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  It is more than sunlight, however, against which the explorer seeks
  protection. "With the strongest light," Kafka writes in an aphorism,

<B></B>

"one can dissolve the world. Before weak eyes, it gains in solidity,
before weaker ones it develops fists, before even weaker ones it becomes
bashful and crushes him who dares to look at it."
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
  The light of "In the Penal Colony" is precisely of this nature, yet
  it dissolves not the world but the image of revelation. Kafka's story
  takes us to the other side of the door. The irony of this move is that
  it erases the very topography on which the enigma of the door rests,
  the locus of the "beyond." For beyond the door lies not the territory
  of meaning but an institution that produces the illusion of a door that
  simultaneously defines and blocks access to this territory. "In the
  Penal Colony" is Kafka's attempt to traverse the fantasy of revelation
  by unveiling the mechanical nature of its production.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The passage through the door of revelation takes the form of an epic
journey red as an ethnographic travelogue. The subject of this journey
is a European explorer--a representative of Reason and Enlightenment--sent
from the mainland of the Empire to a remote island penal colony. This
spatial displacement is also a journey back in time. First, because the
passage from center to periphery is red as a passage from civilization
to a more primitive society; and second, because the colony itself
comprises two disparate temporalities.  The colony's present, embodied
in the reign of the New Commandant, and its mythic past, associated
with the rule of the Old Commandant, the inventor of the machine. The
machine, then, is placed at a double remove, distanced from the center
of the Empire by a topographical and a temporal frame. To this must be
added a third frame, an explicitly narrative one: the description of the
glorious working of the machine is given in an embedded narrative through
the words of the officer, who was the Old Commandant's assistant in all
penal matters, and who seeks to persuade the explorer to join him in his
t against the New Commandant ("IPC" 198). The effect of this triple
framing is to bracket the machine's historical character and foreground
its fantasmatic nature. The operations of the machine, if not the machine
itself, in other words, are part of an institutional fantasy. But whose
fantasy is it? Most clearly the officer's, whose fixation on the Old
Commandant reveals a resistance to the passing of time as such: that is,
to history. From the perspective of his mythical world view, the machine
embodies the very idea of justice. As for the explorer, to the extent
that he stands outside this mythical framework, he is also unaffected by
the officer's institutional fantasy. And in a way, this is indeed the
case. The explorer approaches the machine in the manner of a critical
historian, judging it, not as an idealized form of justice, but as a
brutal and outdated instrument of power. But this historical perspective
is itself fantasmatic in that it provides the explorer, under the cover of
seemingly impartial observation, with the archaic foil for his <I>own</I>
institutional fantasy of a modern, civilized, European legal system
which has outgrown the brute violence of its archaic prehistory. Another
way of putting this is to say that the fantasy of the explorer is the
Enlightenment fantasy of an historical-scientific stance <I>outside</I>
any fantasmatic frame, the stance of theoretical objectivity. Kafka's
narrative throws into doubt precisely this presumed impartiality, along
with the strict opposition between archaic and Enlightenment justice.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the center of both fantasies stands a common conception of law and
justice. According to it, justice depends on two fundamental conditions:
first, the symmetry

<B></B>

between crime and punishment; and second, the veridical subsumption
of the particular case under the universal law. But while within
the Enlightenment model these conditions--that is, of symmetry and of
veridical subsumption--are regulative ideas that orient the legal system
but can never be fully satisfied, the Old Commandant designed a machine
that transforms these ideas into physical principles. The judiciary
system of the penal settlement radicalizes the Enlightenment conception
of justice to the point of crisis. Pushed to its extreme, the symmetry
between crime and punishment gives way to identity, and the subsumption
of the particular under the universal gives way to a sacrificial logic
reducing the individual to a corporeal instantiation of the universal.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The operations of the machine induce a semantic collapse in which
the meaning of the elements proper to the conception of justice
are obliterated. Consider the officer's articulation of the a priori
character of guilt. "My guiding principle is this," he declares, "Guilt
is never to be doubted. Other courts cannot follow that principle , for
they consist of several opinions and have higher courts to scrutinize
them. This is not the case here. . . " ("IPC" 198). The officer's
principle obscures the semantic difference between <I>Anschuldigung</I>
(accusation) and <I>Schuld</I> (guilt): to be <I>angeschuldigt</I> is to
be <I>schuldig,</I> to be accused is to be guilty. Consequently, there is
no longer any need to prove the connection between crime and criminal. The
penal colony's judiciary system does away with all procedures and language
games--interrogation, litigation, deliberation, etc.--that characterize
the trial as a process of truth-finding. In fact, the system undoes
the temporal character of legal procedure, and in so doing erases the
nature of the sentence as a logical judgment reached through a process
of reasoning. Instead of the gradual subsumption of the particular under
the general, we are confronted with the instantaneous identification of
the accused individual and the Law. A similar semantic collapse affects
the notion of symmetry between crime and punishment, which is pushed
to the point where the difference between the two collapses. "Our
sentence does not sound severe. Whatever commandment the prisoner
has disobeyed is written upon his body by the Harrow. 'This prisoner,
for instance,'--the officer indicated the man--'will have written on
his body: HONOR THY SUPERIORS!'" ("IPC" 197). Where transgression and
punishment stand in such exact and predetermined relation to each other,
no human weighing need balance the scales of crime and punishment,
and no subjective judgment interferes with the working of justice.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
From this series of erasures and fusions emerges a Law devoid of any
specific meaning. The machine embodies the fantasy of a symbolism
without semantic mediation, of a supreme and transcendent language so
pure as to be untranslatable into ordinary words. I want to approach
the inner logic of this fantasy by way of a short detour through the
work of another writer who, one hundred years before Kafka, had dreamed
up a similar machine. In his short essay, "On the Marionette Theater,"
Heinrich von Kleist, one of Kafka's favorite authors, puts forth the
rather surprising proposition that the most graceful movement can be
achieved, not by a professional dancer, but by a marionette.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
  This is so, the character named C. explains, because in human movement
  there is an unavoidable split between the soul, as the principle of
  motion, and

<B></B>

the body, as its organ. This split is brought about through human desire,
which directs the soul toward an external object, thus displacing the
body's point of gravity in a way that necessarily fractures the harmony
of the body and soul and disrupts the gracefulness of movement. The
marionette, on the other hand, due to its complete absence of desire and
intentionality, knows no such internal fracture. Guided by a machinist
or, in the most advanced form, by a machine that operates according
to a set of mathematical rules, the marionette's dance is therefore
capable of realizing a perfectly formalized--and in this sense, absolutely
beautiful--movement. The dance of the marionette is the fullest expression
of grace, the complete fusion, without remainder, of matter and form. But
it is also the terrifying image of a pure motion of the soul without soul,
and of a pure expression of the body without body.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Where Kleist's marionette-machine seeks the achievement of motion, Kafka's
law-machine seeks the achievement of pure meaning. It is no accident
that, in their drive towards realization, both systems of formalization
encounter the same locus of resistance: the human organism, the life of
the body. In Kleist, this threat to the body surfaces most clearly in
a short anecdote concerning a mutilated Englishman who, after receiving
an artificial leg, was able to achieve a gracefulness of movement vastly
superior to his natural-legged countrymen.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
  As for Kafka, the machine is nothing other than a complex apparatus
  for the mechanical application of the sacred Law to the body of the
  accused. The machine does not merely apply the Law to, or inscribe it,
  <I>onto</I> the body.  Rather, it passes the Law <I>through</I> the
  body by means of registering its letters directly on the prisoner's
  nervous system. For justice to be revealed, the Law must be deciphered
  through the pain of a body subjected to mechanical torture.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
     How exactly does this work? The machine consists of three parts:
     the Designer, which contains the piece of paper with the sentence,
     written according to the elaborately ornamental design of the Old
     Commandant; the Harrow, which engraves "the sentence on the skin of
     the guilty"; and the Bed, covered with cotton-wool, to which the
     accused is strapped and which turns slowly to expose his entire
     body to the writing needles.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Can you follow it? The Harrow is beginning to write; when it finishes the
first draft of the inscription on the man's back, the layer of cotton wool
begins to roll and slowly turns the body over, to give the Harrow fresh
space for writing. Meanwhile the raw part that has been written on lies
on the cotton wool, which is specially prepared to staunch the bleeding
and so makes all ready for a new deepening of the script. Then these
teeth at the edge of the Harrow, as the body turns further round, tear
the cotton wool away from the wounds, throw it into the pit, and there
is more work for the Harrow. So it keeps on writing deeper and deeper
for the whole twelve hours. The first six hours the condemned man stays
alive almost as before, he suffers only pain. After two hours, the felt
gag is taken away, for he has no longer strength to scream. . . . But how
quiet he grows at just about the sixth hour! Enlightenment comes to the
most dull-witted. It begins around the eyes. From there it radiates. A
moment that might tempt one to get under the Harrow oneself. Nothing
more happens than that the man begins to understand the inscription,
he purses his mouth as if he were listening. You have seen how difficult
it is to decipher the script with one's eyes; but our man deciphers it
with his wounds. To be sure, that is a hard task; he

<B></B>

needs six hours to accomplish it. By that time the harrow has pierced him
quite through and casts him into the pit, where he pitches down upon the
blood and water and the cotton wool. Then the judgment has been fulfilled,
and we, the soldier and I, bury him. ["IPC" 203-4]

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To approach the logic of this passage, recall Althusser's classic essay
on interpellation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
  The essay stages a little scene in which a man on a street, anonymously
  hailed by a police officer, responds to this official call by
  turning around. By responding to the officer's "Hey, you there,"
  Althusser suggests, the man recognizes himself as the addressee of
  an institutional call: that is, he identifies his own being in terms
  defined by the authorities. Kafka's story describes a mechanism that is
  at once very similar and very different. As with Althusser, it stages a
  scene of ideological recognition: the moment of transration is the
  one when the prisoner deciphers, and recognizes himself in, the Law
  that is being inscribed onto his body. But whereas in Althusser the
  drama of interpellation takes place on the level of the psyche, this
  process now works directly on and through the body. Interpellation, in
  Kafka, occurs through the somatization of ideology; it is a mechanical
  operation through which the Symbolic is carved into the subject's body.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is also why what in Althusser's allegorical narrative is a moment
of instantaneous capture, in Kafka's story is a process that takes
its time. For the Commandment is not just registered on the body, but
<I>against</I> the body. Recall again the officer's description:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The Harrow is beginning to write; when it finishes the first draft of
the inscription on the back, the layer of cotton-wool begins to roll
and slowly turns the body over, to give the Harrow fresh space for
writing. Meanwhile the raw part that has been written only lies on the
cotton-wool, which is especially prepared to staunch the bleeding and
so makes all ready for a new deepening of the script. ["IPC" 203]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A deepening of the script. The Law is inscribed through a process
of repetitive writing that hollows out the body and evacuates its
corporeality. The writing of the Law is therefore not, as the officer
believes--and wants others to believe--a miraculous fusion of body
and meaning. Rather, it is a mechanical operation for extracting the
body's vital energies. Thus the radiating image of comprehension on
the prisoner's face is the product of a terrifying exchange; it is the
chiastic transfer of a meaning whose vitality is brought about through
the extraction of life from the body.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The point of intersection between the Symbolic and the somatic, Law and
body, is the prisoner's pain. Pain is, according to a long philosophical
tradition, the locus of private particularity, the one thing that resists,
according to Wittgenstein, verbalization and symbolization.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
  Initially, this is also the case in Kafka. The prisoner's pain marks the
  body's resistance to its material interpellation. But the operations
  of the machine slowly turn this locus of incommunicability into the
  site of revelation. For the prisoner learns his judgment through his
  wounds--that is, he deciphers the commandment not by means of a mental
  reading, but through its encryption onto the nervous

<B></B>

system. This is the core of the institutional fantasy: a machine that
short-circuits semantic mediation and directly inscribes the Symbolic
into the Real of bare life. Ironically, it is precisely through this
bypassing of meaning that the machine transforms the prisoner's body
into the revelatory site of the master signifier, the pure meaning of
Justice. The officer explains that, once the execution began,

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
No discordant noise spoilt the working of the machine. Many did not
care to watch it but lay with closed eyes in the sand; they all knew:
Now Justice is being done. . . . Well, and then came the sixth hour! It
was impossible to grant all the requests to be allowed to watch it from
near by. . . . How we all absorbed the look of transration on the
face of the sufferer, how we bathed our cheeks in the radiance of that
justice, achieved at last and fading so quickly! ["IPC" 209]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Let me pass over the theological subtext of this passage and focus
instead on the fantasmatic and imaginary quality of the scene.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
  The passage stages a public spectacle of justice centered on a
  transcendent signifier. The prisoner's tortured body becomes a public
  locus for the formation of the community's collective body. This
  collectivizing force radiates from the prisoner's "transred"
  face, which is held to bear the mark of a master signifier--the
  signifier of justice--whose meaning, due to its other-worldly origin,
  cannot be uttered in ordinary language but must be revealed through
  its embodiment. The scene of torture, then, is staged as one of
  revelation, as the disclosure of divine Law. But note that this
  revelation does not result from the prisoner's deciphering of his
  wounds, however, but from the spectator's deciphering of the prisoner's
  facial expressions. In other words, transration occurs not through
  the metamorphosis of the body but by means of an interpretation that
  reads bodily changes in terms of transration. Indeed, so strong is
  the belief of the spectators in this transration of the body that
  "[m]any did not care to watch it but lay with closed eyes in the sand;
  they all knew: Now Justice is being done!" All of this underscores my
  claim, I believe, that the machine is part of a carefully orchestrated
  institutional fantasy of encryption and decipherment, it is, in a word,
  a cryptograph. The meaning of justice is not, as the fantasy wants
  us to believe, instantiated in a transred body; rather, it is the
  product of a mechanical ritual that stages the sacrifice of the body
  as a scene of transration. The fantasy of revelation emerges, in
  short, through the double determination of the private and inaccessible
  terrain of human pain on the one hand, and its decipherment in the
  spectacle of public reception on the other. Revelation, in short, is
  shown to be the removal of a veil that it itself has created. It is not
  a self-identical truth but a two-sided form, not a transcendent meaning
  located beyond a door but a complex spectacle that first produces the
  sense of an inaccessible beyond (the private terrain of pain) in order
  then to stage its public disclosure (the moment of decipherment).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
So much, then, for the institutional fantasy of the Old Commandant. But
what about the claim that this fantasy is not restricted to the old order,
but is relevant as well to our understanding of both the penal colony and
the Empire. To argue this point, I shall, as it were, briefly traverse
Kafka's triple framing of the machine in reverse order,

<B></B>

arguing first that the operations of the machine epitomize the
workings of penal colonies as such; and second that the penal colony
is the spatial actualization of a topological dimension immanent to
Enlightenment law. As for the first move--from machine to colony--the
oppositions between Symbolic and somatic, Law and body, structuring
the working of the machine are repeated, at the level of the colony, in
the opposition between oppressor and oppressed. Moreover, this analogy
holds for the specific dynamic that links these terms. For what, after
all, is the disciplinary purpose of a penal colony if not to inscribe
into the oppressed, through a series of disciplinary operations, the
<I>character</I> of empire? Seen in these terms, the colony too is a kind
of semiotic machine akin to the cryptograph, and the reforms of the New
Commandant will at best change the specific technologies of encryption,
but not the fact of encryption as such.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As for my second claim--the structural connection between colony and
empire--the case is more complex and requires a small detour. I want
to suggest that the relation between colony and empire is equivalent
to the relation between the ordinary course of events and the state
of exception. Kierkegaard, whom Kafka admired, once wrote, "the
exception explains the universal and himself, and if one really wants
to study the universal, one only needs to look around for a legitimate
exception. . . . The exception . . . thinks the universal with intense
passion."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
  Recently, Giorgio Agamben, building on the work of Walter Benjamin and
  Carl Schmitt, has pursued this line of thought and developed a theory
  of power and law predicated on the notion of exception.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
  Every legal order, Agamben claims, is sustained by an element of
  extralegal violence. This violence brings order into existence in the
  first place, but persists throughout the law's normal operations, and
  is visible in the apparatus of law-enforcing institutions, like that of
  the police, without which no legal order can function. The topological
  structure of this extralegal violence--at once inside and outside the
  law--finds its purest embodiment in the re of the sovereign, who
  has the power, in moments of exceptional danger, legally to suspend
  the law in order to preserve the State and its Law. In such moments,
  the sovereign's word <I>is</I> Law: that is, it carries direct legal
  authority without the mediation of legal process. Borrowing a phrase
  from Gershom Scholem (which incidentally was coined to describe the
  nature of revelation in Kafka) Agamben says that the sovereign's words
  have the character of "being in force without significance."
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Being in force without significance.  Does this not describe exactly
 the structure of the Law in Kafka's machine, a Law that is devoid of
 meaning and semantic depth, and whose terrifying force is unhampered
 by legal mediation? And is not the Old Commandant, whose word is
 Law and whose rule is absolute, the re par excellence of the
 sovereign? The colony over which he exercised sovereignty, then,
 is the spatial actualization of a topological dimension immanent
 to Law. It is the territory of the exception, a space in which the
 extralegal--and hence meaningless--violence of the Law is rendered both
 visible and material. And to the extent that the cryptograph is the
 purest manifestation of this violence, the narrative passage through the
 triple frame--from empire to colony to machine--is an infernal descent
 from the apparition of Enlightenment reason to the reified force of a
 senseless legality.

"In the Penal Colony" seems to be unique among Kafka's texts in that it
makes use of a concept of redemption that draws on both Jewish <I>and</I>
Christian imagery. The story's emphasis on the <I>public</I> character
of redemption is a defining feature of Messianic thought. According
to Gershom Scholem, "Judaism, in all of its forms and manifestations,
has always maintained a concept of redemption as an event which takes
place publicly, on the stage of history and within the community. It is
an occurrence which takes place in the visible world and which cannot
be conceived apart from such a visible appearance" (<I>The Messianic
Idea in Judaism,</I> trans. Michael Meyer [New York: Schocken Books,
1972], 1). An even stronger Messianic language is sounded at the end of
the story, in the proclamation engraved on the Old Commandant's tomb:
"Here rests the Old Commandant. His adherents, who must now be nameless,
have dug his grave and set up his stone. There is a prophecy that after
a certain number of years the Commandant will rise again and lead his
adherents from his house to recover the colony. Have faith and wait"
("IPC" 226). These Messianic references, however, are intermingled with
Christological motifs. Not only does the machine's method of torture--the
piercing of the body with needles--recall the crucifixion of Christ,
but the importance of the sixth hour as the decisive turning point
is also borrowed directly from Luke's description of Christ's passion
(Luke 23:44). Indeed, the very notion of Justice the story puts forth
seems to blend Jewish and Christological elements. On the one hand, the
fact that the commandment is <I>written</I> onto the body is in keeping
with Jewish thought, which stresses the necessary link between God's
justice and its materialization in scripture. Yet on the other hand,
the fact that justice is revealed through the transration of the
sufferer's <I>face</I> strongly recalls a Christian conception, which
breaks with the Judaic link between justice and scripture by claiming,
according to Paul, that Christ's tortured body directly manifests "the
justice of God <I>without</I> the Law" (Rom. 3:21).
