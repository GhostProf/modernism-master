<p>
The name Anthony Julius is nowhere mentioned in Ronald Schuchard's
richly informative essay, but clearly the author of <i>T. S. Eliot,
Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form</i> (1995, second edition forthcoming)
was on Schuchard's mind as he assembled his brief in defense of
the poet against the charge of anti-Semitism&#8212;a charge not
original with Julius, of course, but made most forcefully by him. In
countering the Julius line, Schuchard mounts two arguments. The first,
on pages 7-11, carefully contextualizes the "offensive" poems of the
late 1910s&#8212;e.g.,"Burbank with a Baedeker," "Sweeney among the
Nightingales," and "Gerontion"&#8212;so as to show that the "dominant
motive" of these poems was not to "exercise a little gratuitous
anti-Semitism"  but to dramatize the sense of despair and failure
of Eliot's war years&#8212;a phantasmagoria in which the poet's own
consciousness is at one with that of his characters. The second argument
(11-21) concerns, not Eliot the youthful poet, but Eliot the Public Man
and Social-Cultural Presence of the post-conversion years, especially
on his now frequent visits to the United States.

<p>
Here, I shall not take up Schuchard's first argument since I have myself
recently countered Julius along somewhat similar lines. In my T. S. Eliot
Memorial Lecture (September 2002), I suggest that the notorious passage
in "Gerontion" ("the jew squats on the window sill, the owner. . ."),
obviously anti-Semitic as it appears when taken out of context, must
be understood within the frame of the entire poem, which expresses, in
the most moving and terrifying terms possible, the crisis ("After such
knowledge, what forgiveness?") Eliot underwent in the years following
the death of his beloved Jean Verdenal, <i>mort aux Dardanelles</i>
in 1915, his miserable marriage to Vivien, coupled with his knowledge

<b></b>

of and complicity in her sordid affair with Bertrand Russell, and the
sudden death in 1919 of his father, with whom he had not had a chance
to reconcile and who was never to know that his son was to become a
distinguished poet.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 Schuchard establishes a careful factual context for "Burbank with a
 Baedeker," and although I disagree with some of his particulars&#8212;I
 think, for example, that Eliot's alleged concern for post-war Vienna was
 hardly, as Schuchard thinks , a case of empathy for the displaced
 Eastern Jews pouring into that city but, on the contrary, a concern
 that the great imperial capital would be mongrelized and its vibrant
 culture destroyed&#8212;I am sympathetic to the argument for context
 that Schuchard makes.

<p>
But the second half of the essay is more troubling. Here, the focus is
on Eliot's relationship with the Jewish social philosopher, Zionist, and
New School of Social Research professor Horace N. Kallen, an intellectual
whom Eliot first met at Harvard in 1906, and whose (hitherto unknown)
correspondence with the poet has now surfaced at the Jacob Rader Marcus
Center of the American Jewish Archives in Cincinnati, Ohio. This cache
of letters&#8212;they extend from 1927 to 1960 and, as Schuchard points
out, more and earlier letters may well surface since the two men had
been close friends at Harvard from 1906 to 1911&#8212;does indeed, in
Schuchard's words "restore a missing chapter of American cultural history"
. The question is what that missing chapter tells us.

<p>
From 1927 on, when his "friendly correspondence" with Eliot resumed,
Kallen was evidently making "repeated efforts to bring [the poet]
to the [New School] to lecture and read, an arrangement that finally
materialized in the spring of 1933 when Eliot was Norton Professor at
Harvard" . Kallen was a fervent admirer of the Great Poet and was
hence honored to entertain him. At the dinner party he hosted for Eliot at
a New York restaurant, one of the guests was the Supreme Court Justice
Benjamin Cardozo. Eliot was apparently much impressed with Cardozo,
writing to his producer Henry Sherek that the Justice was "singularly
distinguished amongst all the guests," and that "I have always been
attracted by Sephardim" .

<p>
Schuchard takes such anecdotes&#8212;and he gives a number of
them&#8212;as evidence of Eliot's cordial feeling toward Jews. But
why shouldn't Eliot have been pleased to meet someone as distinguished
and famous as Cardozo? And even then, he cannot seem to take Cardozo's
accomplishments at face value: they must be related to the Chief Justice's
Sephardic origins. As for Horace Kallen himself, why wouldn't Eliot be
pleased and flattered by the fuss Kallen, obviously a man of independent
means, made about him whenever he visited New York? Kallen, after all,
was not just any Jew but a well-situated Harvard Jew who had demonstrated
his intellectual distinction. A Jew, moreover, who despite friendly
debates with Eliot on issues of religion and culture, seems never to
have voiced the slightest objection to the poet's words or actions.

<p>
The delightful visit with Kallen, in any case, coincided with the
preparation and delivery of the Page-Barbour Lectures delivered at the
University of Virginia in April-May 1933 and published in 1934 under
the title <i>After Strange Gods</i><i>.</i> It is here, of course, that
Eliot made his notorious statement that "reasons of race and religion
combine to make any large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable." "This
unfortunate

<b></b>

statement," writes Schuchard, "one of the most quoted and disdained in
modern literary and cultural studies, has pained many readers of Eliot,
including myself, and my purpose in bringing it forward again is not
to excuse it but to reconstruct a context that shows that it is not,
regardless of its appearance, an anti-Semitic statement; it is an anti
free-thinking statement" . Here, Schuchard follows Cleanth Brooks,
who declared in 1985 that "<i>free-thinking</i> [not Jews] is the key
phrase. Thus, even the ultra-conservative Old South got along with its
God-fearing Jews very well. There was perhaps less anti-Jewish feeling
in the Old South than anywhere else in the United States" (25, n.50).

<p>
As a "free-thinking" Jew married to a free-thinking Jew brought up
in the Old South (New Orleans) I have always found Brooks's statement
offensive. Who is Eliot, who is Brooks, to tell Jews that they should or
should not be "free-thinking"? That as long as they were "God-fearing"
they were acceptable in the Old South? For one thing, it isn't true:
Jews in New Orleans, for example, whether secular or religious, were
(and still are) excluded from all Mardi Gras activities which were,
in Brooks's day, at the very heart of the social and commercial life
of the city. But even if this were not the case, Brooks's remark, which
Schuchard endorses, is irritatingly patronizing, as if to say, we really
like those darkies down here as long as they know their place. Who,
after all, was telling the Christian majority in the Old South what they
should or should not believe?

<p>
Eliot's statement evidently cost him a number of friendships, including
that of the (Jewish) philosopher Franz Boas, who, Eliot told Kallen,
had been his closest friend in graduate school , and it produced a
rift between the poet and his later friend Isaiah Berlin. In response
to Eliot's remark about not wanting free-thinking Jews about, Boas
evidently wrote him, "I can at least rid you of the company of one"
(25, n.53). There is no record of a reply, but to Berlin, Eliot wrote
in 1951 that "the sentence of which you complain (with justice) <i>would
of course never have appeared at all at that time if I had been aware of
what was going to happen, indeed had already begun, in Germany</i><i>"</i>
(16, my emphasis)<i>.</i>

<p>
Schuchard takes this disclaimer at face value, noting that Eliot may
well have had in mind the "free-thinking humanism" of his friend Kallen
(whom he admired despite the aberration of his secularism), and he adds,
"though Kallen and Eliot never discuss the episode in their letters,
Kallen would certainly have understood Eliot's intention in relation to
their own dialogue on the relation of culture, humanism, and religion; it
certainly had no effect on their friendship" . But the fact is that
Kallen should have objected. For Eliot's claim that he had been unaware
"of what was going to happen, indeed had already begun, in Germany,"
strikes me as quite disingenuous. Here a few dates and facts may help
clarify the situation.

<p>
Hitler came to power in January 1933, at the very time Eliot was beginning
work on his Page-Barbour Lectures, which were delivered in April of that
year. Within weeks, all Jewish civil servants were dismissed as were all
Jewish university professors and school teachers. The number of Jewish
students at German schools and universities was rigidly curtailed. Jews
were quickly dismissed from the press, the broadcasting industry,
and the arts. By 1 April, a large-scale state boycott of Jewish stores
and businesses

<b></b>

was introduced; armed SS guards made an example of particular Jewish
shops to insure compliance with the ban. On 10 May, 1933, a public
burning of Jewish and anti-Nazi books took place throughout Germany,
anticipating the<i>Kristallnacht</i> of 1938. By July 1933, Germany had
passed a law for forced sterilization of those with "genetic" defects
and all East European Jewish immigrants were stripped of their German
citizenship. By August, Jewish lawyers were forbidden to practice law
and Jewish doctors were allowed to treat only Jewish patients.

<p>
All this was done quite openly and was reported by the newspapers
throughout Europe and the U.S. In <i>Mein Kampf</i> , for that
matter, Hitler had made no bones about his intentions so far as the Jews
were concerned, and the minute he came to power, he began to carry them
out&#8212;in the form of public edicts and laws. Indeed, in the United
States, protest on the part of American Jews was quick to come: in the
spring of 1933, anti-Nazi rallies took place at Madison Square Garden,
demanding a boycott of trade with Germany.

<p>
What then does Eliot mean when he says he didn't know what was happening
in Germany? If he read the newspapers at all, he did "know." And even
if he didn't "know" in the spring of 1933, what about the interval
between delivery of the lectures and their publication by Faber &amp;
Faber in 1934? Eliot could easily have expunged the offending sentence
from <i>After Strange Gods</i>. Or could he? Here is the whole paragraph
in which it is embedded:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
You are hardly likely to develop tradition except where the bulk of the
population is relatively so well off where it is that it has no incentive
or pressure to move about. The population should be homogeneous; where
two or more cultures exist in the same place they are likely either to
be fiercely self-conscious or both to become adulterate. What is still
more important is unity of religious background; and reasons of race
and religion combine to make any large numbers of free-thinking Jews
undesirable. There must be a proper balance between urban and rural,
industrial and agricultural development. And a spirit of excessive
tolerance is to be deprecated.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In the context of what was already happening in Germany, the demand for
cultural and religious homogeneity and the caution against tolerance
put the notorious sentence about "free-thinking Jews" in an especially
negative light. Eliot, who later confided to various friends that the
word he especially regretted in the passage was <i>race</i>,never
reprinted <i>After Strange Gods</i>. In the years that followed,
no doubt feeling somewhat guilty, he worked with Kallen to help
Jewish refugee professors&#8212;for example Karl Mannheim and Adolph
L&ouml;we&#8212;obtain jobs in the U.S. and he participated in a group
called Moot, organized in 1938 to discuss social and political issues
and, later, to plan for national reconstruction . But are such
activities different in kind from the help Ezra Pound offered to Louis
Zukofsky over the years? Indeed, in many ways Pound was more generous
than Eliot: strapped for funds himself, he paid Zukofsky's way when the
latter came to visit him in Rapallo in the mid-twenties. Pound could
forgive Jewishness in poets whose work he admired just as Eliot could
forgive it in highly cultured educated men. Both cases are no more than
variants on "Some of my best friends are Jews."

<b></b>

<p>
There is no indication that the basic views formulated in <i>After
Strange Gods</i> ever changed. Schuchard cites a commentary Eliot
wrote for the <i>Christian News-Letter</i> in 1941, protesting
the Vichy government's anti-Semitic policies, as evidence of the
poet's firm objection to anti-Semitism. But this protest is at best
equivocal. "Anti-Semitism," writes Eliot, "there has always been among
the parties of the extreme Right: but it was a very different thing, as
a symptom of the disorder of French society and politics for the last
hundred and fifty years, from what it is when it takes its place as a
principle of reconstruction." . The implication of this statement is
that anti-Semitism is natural, perhaps even inevitable, when government
is not sufficiently in control, as was the case in France throughout
the twenties and thirties, but that when it is codified as law, it goes
too far. Eliot does not seem to understand that the second step follows
logically from the first.

<p>
However warmly Eliot may have felt about this or that Jewish friend or
acquaintance, Schuchard's researches reveal that for the poet, Jews remain
Jews first, individuals later. In 1947, for example, Eliot protested
to the poet Edward Field, who had accused him of being anti-Semitic,
"I am no more anti-semitic [sic] than I am anti-Welsh or anti-Eskimo"
. This is, of course, the ultimate put-down since Eliot hardly
numbered many Eskimos among his acquaintance or among those cultivated
Western Christians he admired. Like the wild Welsh and the exotic Eskimos,
Jews remain outsiders for Eliot&#8212;people one tolerates (and sometimes
even befriends) but whom one can't quite accommodate into <i>The Idea
of a Christian Society</i> . And there the matter stood even if
Eliot admired the poetry of Isaac Rosenberg or the social philosophy of
his friend Horace Kallen.

<p>
Indeed, Eliot's later cultural pronouncements provide an interesting gloss
on his earlier poetry. I would myself argue that the overtly nasty slurs
on Jews in <i>Poems 1920</i> are much less offensive than the "humane"
position adopted by Eliot the sixty-year old smiling public man. For that
younger poet was much less given to holding "views" than to putting his
<i>feelings</i> into his poetry. From "Prufrock" to <i>The Waste Land</i>,
Eliot's poetry is nasty, cruel, painful&#8212;and utterly charismatic,
no doubt because the poet is just as hard on himself as he is on those
hated others, "Blistered in Brussels, patched and peeled in London." It
is the poet as Gerontion, after all, who "was neither at the hot gates/
Nor fought in the warm rain/ Nor knee deep in the salt marsh, heaving a
cutlass,/ Bitten by flies, fought." The verb "fought" in that last line
is almost spit out in a moment of self-disgust.

<p>
"Gerontion" and <i>The Waste Land</i> will always attract readers because
of their sheer verbal and conceptual brilliance. The poetic fabric, in
these cases, has absorbed the ideological residue. Ironically, it is not
the fiery, nasty younger Eliot but the genteel and understanding Public
Poet of the later years that is the problem&#8212;the poet who writes
those self-deprecating lines in "East Coker" about "Twenty years largely
wasted," since his every poetic attempt has been "a different kind of
failure," even as he declares that an "ideal Christian culture "can"
accommodate Jewish religion and culture"&#8212;provided, of course,
that, as Eliot wrote the Jewish publisher Victor Gollancz, Jews be
"devout and practicing" .

<b></b>

<p>
"At the end of the culture war," Schuchard concludes, "Eliot, tired of
conducting conflicts with secular humanists in no man's land, warmly
welcomed followers of the Jewish religion into his idea of a Christian
society" . Provided, of course, they <i>followed</i>the religion. For
many of us, there is nothing "warm" about this exclusionary gesture.
