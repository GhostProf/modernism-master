Archaeology and Modernity
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
Archaeology was born of modernity. Indeed, it helped shape it. There
are many ways to define modernity, but the very word indicates
that the concept of time is central&#x02014;modernity as a new way
of conceptualizing time that emerged around the sixteenth century,
specifically the perception of the present as distinct from the past:
the break with tradition.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
Alongside this temporal fracture was a new sense of history or historical
consciousness that attempted to mend this break, but which was however
faced with an inherent paradox: before modernity, understanding of
the past had come through tradition, yet in breaking with tradition,
with the past, modernity now had to find another way of understanding
it. This was a problem faced by all Renaissance scholars in whatever
field, a problem which was ultimately resolved by invoking the authority
of reason (Descartes) and the senses (Bacon) against tradition, including
religion. Understanding the past, particularly the human past of history,
presented a particularly acute instance of this paradox, for it involved
breaking from the very thing that was to be understood. The only way
to respond was either to study the past through a critical analysis
of traditional sources (history) or to find <i>other</i> sources,
another authority; and this meant, above all, <i>material culture</i>
(archaeology).
<p>
The antiquarians of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and even eighteenth
centuries played a critical role in articulating the project of modernity,
for it was they who discovered a past previously unknown to tradition
through the recognition of an ancient European


<b></b>


material culture. It is too easy to forget the specific social and
intellectual conditions which define archaeology. With all sense
of the past coming from what had been handed down, it must have
seemed near impossible to find an independent and alternative way of
understanding. The significant thing about the recognition of this ancient
material culture was that it was based on observation and comparison with
<i>contemporary</i> objects. Just as it was realized that fossils were
the remains of once living organisms, so it was realized that prehistoric
objects were the material culture of once living societies. The example of
thunderstones illustrates this perfectly. These objects were originally
interpreted as "solidified lightning" and viewed as natural objects; we
now recognize them as stone axes, dating back over four thousand years. It
was only when Europe began its global expansion and encountered people
living in very different conditions and using very different material
culture&#x02014;but one which included objects that looked like those found
buried in European soil&#x02014;that the possibility of their human origin
was raised.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>

<p>
Despite the increasing amount of empirical work conducted on ancient
remains during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the contradiction
between breaking with the past and depending upon it remained acute. In
facing this new past, which was opened up by analogies with the present,
the antiquarians did not develop the means to understand it much
further until the nineteenth century. They were, for all intents and
purposes, forced back onto what tradition&#x02014;specifically written
texts&#x02014;said, and so they fitted the new discoveries into this
framework. Classical and biblical texts spoke of stone tools, just as
the world, according to Archbishop Ussher's famous calculations, began
only in 4004 <small>B.C</small>. The idea of prehistory&#x02014;of a past
radically earlier than written history&#x02014;was unacceptable, if not
inconceivable, until the nineteenth century. The great antiquity of
the earth and of human culture was realized only when&#x02014;similarly
using analogies with the present&#x02014;the layering of rocks and
soil in the earth (stratigraphy) replaced traditional sources (such
as biblical genealogies) as a guide to chronology. Combined with
the development of typology&#x02014;the classification of prehistoric
artifacts&#x02014;antiquarians now had the beginnings of a method for
interrogating this new past; they could also give the final death blow
to the antimodernists by claiming a past which existed even before
tradition: prehistory.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p>
The idea of prehistory is in many ways the epitome of the modernist
project: the creation of a past which has no connection to traditional
history. Moreover, prehistory was not just a new past, it was also a
lost past&#x02014;lost to traditional forms of memory, whether written or
spoken. For the new historical consciousness, prehistory was perhaps the
greatest challenge and yet perhaps its greatest asset; on the one hand,
it was a past which tradition has forgotten, and no amount of critical
analysis of traditional texts would recover it. On the other, precisely
for this reason, it was a past purified of all taint of tradition. It
was a clean slate. The concept of prehistory is incredibly radical, and
yet today we do not give it too much thought. Prehistory was about a time
before text. We tend to think of prehistory as simply the recognition of a
chronological period, a time before history, where history is the written
or spoken word. Yet the "before" of prehistory is not just temporal,
it is also ontological (though the two are


<b></b>


related). Prehistory is not solely about chronological priority, it is
also about the ontological priority of material culture before text. It
was not simply that archaeologists were forced to rely on material culture
to interpret this new past&#x02014;the modernist project <i>demanded</i>
it. It was an alternative path to constructing a new authority and
foundation for understanding the past that did not rely on tradition
(i.e., texts). Let me be clear here though: I am not suggesting some
absolute priority of material culture over text, but a contingent one,
according to the disciplinary context. In absolute terms, if I can use
this phrase at all, the issue was making material culture the equal of
text&#x02014;and more than its equal: independent of it. But in the specific
context of archaeology, material culture was to have the upper hand.
<p>
While the implications of this role of material culture have been long
recognized in archaeology, they have not been connected to the concept
of prehistory. In fact, ironically, most archaeologists continue to
consider the concept of prehistory as primarily a chronological concept:
the time before writing.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
Yet to appreciate fully the radical nature of the modernist project, the
ontological status of prehistory needs to be properly considered. The
word <i>prehistory</i> was only invented in the mid-nineteenth century
and it caused some ripples at the time; other words were even considered
for this "new" past, such as <i>antehistory</i>. Given the phonetic
similarity to <i>antihistory,</i> perhaps this would have been more
apt. But then, perhaps this would have underlined the break between
traditional history and the new history too much.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Yet the break was always more than a temporal one: prehistory was, above
all, history studied through material culture, not through texts. This
characterization deliberately blurs the distinction between method and
material. It relocates the split between prehistory and history from
chronology to ontology. This means that even archaeologists studying
the material culture of the historic past&#x02014;medieval Britain or
colonial America&#x02014;are doing prehistory, not history.
<p>
That archaeologists do not think this way&#x02014;that the idea of
prehistory is reduced to a chronological concept&#x02014;is problematic. To
some, this may seem a mere question of semantics, but I think it signals
an underlying lack of confidence in the archaeological project. To insist
on the limited definition of prehistory as a time before text is to ignore
the ontological status of material culture vis-&#x000E0;-vis text. It has
been pointed out that when archaeologists suddenly opened up the vast
period of prehistory in the nineteenth century, they ironically tried to
reduce it to a simulacrum of the present through ethnographic analogies:
prehistory was peopled by societies similar to contemporary savages. For
Tim Murray, this is almost a betrayal of the initial achievement of the
discovery of a new past.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
This is an important issue, yet I think the irony is even greater than
Murray indicates: first, the discovery of this "new past" was founded
on exactly such analogies&#x02014;actualistic studies informed the very
recognition of thunderstones as stone axes, of deep stratigraphy as
long chronologies. Without such contemporary analogies in the first
place, there would have been no "discovery" of the antiquity of human
culture. Second and more significantly, the "discovery" of prehistory
was not just the discovery of a long chronology. It was the discovery of
a new method of understanding the past: the analysis of material culture.


<b></b>


<p>
What I find really interesting about the history of archaeology is
how many of its key developments were linked to the key contradiction
of modernity: the need to understand the past without relying on it
as a source of authority. Archaeology resolved this contradiction,
on the one hand, by creating a <i>new</i> or different kind of past
from that laid down by tradition: prehistory; and, on the other,
by creating a <i>new</i> way of understanding the past: the study of
material culture. The two are closely connected, especially through the
wider social context in which these concepts emerged&#x02014;particularly
capitalism. Through mercantile capitalism, the expansion of European
people around the world, particularly the discovery of the New World,
produced material analogies for those "curiosities" of the Old World
such as thunderstones. Through industrial capitalism, the development
of mass production and consumption provided a new way of understanding
material culture, through the notion of the serial object, which changes
through time. Archaeological typologies were quite explicitly inspired
by mid-nineteenth-century exhibitions of this new material culture,
which arranged objects according to series.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
These social conditions not only provided the means for one solution
to the contradiction of modernity; they also provided the context for
actually thinking in a modern way in the first place. Indeed, one cannot
really separate these issues, and in fact one might define modernity
as the persistence of this dialectic.
<p>
This can be seen in archaeology's continued dilemma about the relation
between the present and the past. As mentioned earlier, there is a
disturbing question surrounding our knowledge of prehistory: on the
one hand, it was defined as a new past, a new time, but on the other,
it can only be understood (and was created) through analogies (direct
or indirect) with the present. The concept of analogy articulates this
dialectic well. However, archaeologists are forever uneasy about such
ambiguities and concurrently developed a means to conceal this dilemma,
as if the line between past and present were not a slash but a hyphen. If
analogy represents the modernist divide of past/present, chronology
represents the modernist patch of a historical consciousness linking
past-present. In short, archaeology created its own mode of time&#x02014;a
temporalization which is not necessarily unique to archaeology (except in
its details), but which nonetheless serves to plaster over the fracture
between present and past by creating a specific time in which material
culture resides. The oldest mode of archaeological temporalization
was the narrative of evolution, which placed all material culture in
a progressive sequence from savagery to civilization. This model has
been continually refined since the eighteenth century, and is still
employed by many archaeologists today, especially in North America,
albeit in a very modified form. However, evolutionism has not always
been in favor and its popularity varies with time and the place. On the
other hand, basic chronology&#x02014;whether drawn from radiocarbon dates,
dendrochronology, or typology&#x02014;remains a fundamental part of the
discipline. Periodization in particular&#x02014;from the Paleolithic to the
Iron Age&#x02014;has remained a key device for structuring this material
culture, and even while many archaeologists may have abandoned the grand
narratives of social evolution, it is hard to imagine the discipline ever
abandoning chronology in some form. It is chronology which provides the
most successful temporalization, for it embraces all material culture
within a universal


<b></b>


temporality, and makes us believe that the prehistoric past is joined
to the present through a shared, universal time.
<p>
However, we need to be conscious of the political consequences of this
kind of historical consciousness, and the political nature of time
it incorporates.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
Archaeology has of course been closely tied to nationalism and the
formation of nation-states whether or not it is explicitly used to
create origin stories:
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
archaeology&#x02014;ironically&#x02014;as the invention of traditions. The
politics of nationalism are often&#x02014;though not always&#x02014;quite
transparent. But archaeology has always also been a modernist project,
as this paper has discussed, and one which investigates pasts beyond
national frontiers, as the science of the history of humankind. The
politics of this humanism have been less transparent. The problem
with this vision of archaeology as part of modernity and the project
of humanism lies in its politics of time&#x02014;as Foucault has so
minutely deconstructed in his genealogies of European history. For if
archaeology is seen as one of the guardians of our time-consciousness,
maintaining the temporal continuity or link with the past of humanity,
what implications does this have for archaeology vis-&#x000E0;-vis
<i>other</i> histories, other strategies of cultural remembrance? The
question is whether this concept of time-consciousness does not claim
some special and universal status, for its totalizing vision would seem
to erase or denigrate other claims to the past. Archaeology as part of
the hegemony of a Western discourse on history, a scientific colonialism,
a <i>white mythology</i>.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>

<p>
Analogy and chronology represent archaeology's two articulations of
modernity as a temporal problem. While analogy expresses the fundamental
dilemma, chronology represents the primary solution. But what about
material culture? It is very much caught between these two articulations,
for on the one hand it represents something of both the past and the
present <i>simultaneously,</i> and on the other, it is captured within
time, belonging to a particular point or period: the stone axe as both
metaphor and concept. The textual articulation of material culture,
which has become a dominant feature of much archaeology since the 1980s,
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
is perhaps a little ironic given the association between material
culture and prehistory discussed earlier. Indeed, we need to remind
ourselves of a key axis in the concept of prehistory: as a time before
writing&#x02014;not "before" in a chronological or temporal sense,
but "before" in an ontological sense. Of course one needs to be
wary of associations with Heideggerian concepts of primordiality,
for the priority being asserted here&#x02014;as I have already
mentioned&#x02014;is not absolute but contingent, and related to a
methodological strategy. But as with the restricted, chronological
conception of prehistory, I think many archaeologists are also
working with a restricted conception of material culture that makes
it secondary or supplemental to language, or "mental culture" if you
like. To illustrate this, I want to turn towards the archaeology of
modernity, towards an archaeological analysis of modernity. For here it
is possible to see how archaeology has for a long time either ignored
or marginalized an archaeology of the modern period. In doing this,
I hope to return to the question of material culture with a revitalized
sense of its significance to archaeology.

Archaeologies of Modernity
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
The grating of metal teeth on concrete, the pounding of a breaker,
dust and noise&#x02014;typical sights and sounds on the initial stages of
any urban excavation, as mechanical excavators rip up modern surfaces
and foundations. It is normal practice on archaeological excavations,
particularly those in cities and so-called "brownfield" (i.e., built-up)
areas, for the upper layers of a site to be machined or dug away in order
to get down to the "archaeology." Tarmac surfaces, concrete foundations,
or service pipe trenches all constitute what is often called "modern
disturbance" and if they are recorded at all, it is as a blank zone, their
sole importance defined as an area of truncated archaeology&#x02014;that
is, of <i>no</i> archaeology. On reflection, one should of course ask
why these features are excluded from consideration as archaeological
remains, and the usual answer is, "they are <i>too</i> modern." But what
is "too modern"? The question is critical because by default, it also
raises the question of what is "the archaeological." Indeed it is as if a
major barrier separates the modern from the archaeological gaze. Why are
archaeologists usually uninterested in such material remains&#x02014;is it
a question of chronology, disciplinary boundaries, or is there a more
concealed issue of ontology and temporality implicated in this simple
phrase&#x02014;"too modern"?
<p>
Ironically, throughout most of its history archaeology has not given
much attention to the material culture and remains of the very period
in which it was born and grew up, its contemporary past. Indeed, it
has only been since the late twentieth century&#x02014;that "postmodern
period"&#x02014;that anything like an active research interest in this
vein has developed. Of course in different countries there are different
responses to this problem&#x02014;in Europe, archaeologies of the modern
world are very poorly developed ("too modern" is regularly applied as
far back as the eighteenth century);
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
but in North America, by contrast, the archaeology of the eighteenth,
nineteenth, and twentieth centuries is a thriving subdiscipline. Indeed,
explorations of the role of material culture in the development of
capitalism and global expansion&#x02014;the very processes connected to
the rise of modernity&#x02014;have formed a core part of some of the most
exciting archaeology being done in the United States.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
The reasons for this regional disparity no doubt relate to broader social
issues about the role of archaeology in society. Is it any coincidence
that North American archaeologists&#x02014;mostly white, of European
descent&#x02014;should start using archaeology to explore their "own"
past? Indeed, one might suggest there is a clear postcolonial geopolitics
operating in this focus on the archaeology of the modern world: globally,
the most active research of the modern period occurs precisely in those
former colonies where the European-derived population is or has been
politically or numerically dominant (such as North America or Australia)
in contrast to those where the indigenous population regained power
(such as India or other countries in southeast Asia).
<p>
Yet the more insistent question is perhaps not why the archaeology of
the past three centuries is stronger in some former colonies than others,
but why it is so weak in the colonial homeland of Europe. This is slowly
changing, but it is a long time coming and the resistance is not so much
active as passive: it never really occurred to us that this


<b></b>


was an important avenue for archaeology. Not that there has not
been&#x02014;and still is&#x02014;some active resistance, especially
when faced with issues of priority; I have no doubt that if you
asked ten archaeologists what was more important, a Neolithic or a
nineteenth-century site, nine of them (if not ten) would probably say
the former&#x02014;without hesitation. Yet why do we value the remains
of the past in this way? Is it simply that <i>older is better?</i> Or
is it perhaps something else&#x02014;a fear of getting too close to the
present? There is, I suppose, a threat of ridicule entangled in this fear
of the present, because no matter how much archaeology might be defined
by its set of methods and its focus on material culture, it retains a
strong sense that its subject matter is the past; indeed, that instead of
moving forward in time, it should be moving backward in time, exploring
the darkest depths of prehistory. But at the same time, putting a date
on the limits of archaeology also seems ludicrous. Why stop at 1750,
1800, 1900, or 2003? Indeed, given the variability in national, local,
and individual responses to the archaeology of the past three hundred
years, it should already be clear that this cannot be a chronological
question. That is, there can be no date or time after which we might
say that this is no longer archaeology, even though many archaeologists
routinely do this in practice, if not on principle. But if it is not a
question of chronology, then what is it that creates such resistance to
an archaeology of modernity?
<p>
A typical response is often: "We have masses of textual and testimonial
sources from which to address the history of the recent past, so why
bother with archaeology?" I have heard many people&#x02014;archaeologists
and nonarchaeologists&#x02014;use this argument, and I think it is an
irony bordering on tragedy. What happened to the radical project of
modernity and its attempt to put material culture on an independent
basis for understanding the past? It is as if these people have no idea
what archaeology is about. For if you use this argument, then you also
accept that archaeology will always be in the shadow of documentary and
oral-led history or ethnography and is effectively the poorest and most
pathetic of all historical or social disciplines. If you use this line,
you should not be an archaeologist at all. Many archaeologists had to
go through this argument in the mid-twentieth century, whether they were
studying medieval Britain or colonial America, and I would hope that few
would actually maintain this position today. Yet it is still heard, even
from within the discipline. This is not to deny the value of using textual
and other sources in historical archaeology. Rather the point is the power
of material culture. I mention this moreover not so much to lament the
theoretically vacuous position some might hold, but to highlight the close
relationship material culture has with textuality, or discursivity. I want
to explore the nature of material culture and the project of archaeology
through this opposition; to put it in rather negative terms&#x02014;using
negativity as a <i>positive</i> concept&#x02014;to explore material culture
as the nondiscursive, the nontextual.
<p>
The one place to explore this question best I believe is to focus on
an archaeology of modernity as contemporaneity: the archaeology of the
present, or, as it has been called elsewhere, the "contemporary past."
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
For even while many archaeologists may accept the importance of an
archaeology of the modern period, even of twentieth-century archaeology,
some still stop when it comes to doing the archaeology of <i>now</i>. Is
it


<b></b>


even possible to do this kind of archaeology? Does the archaeological
context not have to be, by definition, <i>dead?</i> Archaeology as
autopsy. Consider this: even if archaeologists decided to pay attention
to the very surface of an urban site&#x02014;the tarmac, the service pipes,
the concrete&#x02014;why should it stop there? Why do the archaeologists
leave the site once all the cultural material traces have been dealt with,
when new ones might be being constructed in their place? What would it
be like if archaeologists stayed to analyze the construction of the new
building being erected on that urban plot&#x02014;and then stayed to examine
its occupation and use . . . and possibly its eventual destruction and
replacement by another building. An archaeologist could devote her whole
life to the material history of just one site.
<p>
This is a provocative idea, though some skeptics might question whether
such a project is archaeology. Well, actually I do not care. And I am not
sure many people care that much about disciplinary purity, which is surely
the only reason for engaging in such debate. Archaeologists have been
borrowing for decades and are increasingly exploring interdisciplinary
spaces&#x02014;just look at this volume. What is more important here is the
nature of material culture in relation to the archaeological method. What
does it mean to perform archaeology on a living context rather than a dead
one? Archaeology has routinely been doing this since the 1960s, and less
systematically before that time. What is called <i>ethnoarchaeology</i>
is an established subfield of archaeology where archaeologists study
living societies to help them interpret dead ones. In such a case,
ethnoarchaeology is largely seen as methodological: it helps us to
reflect on our methods. But an archaeology of a living society also has
a very different role. It reflects back, not on the discipline but on
contemporary society at large. The archaeology of the present might be
characterized as a two-way mirror: on the one hand, we could just see
it as a mirror, held up to our own discipline (as in ethnoarchaeology);
on the other, we could try to see it as a window onto wider society,
albeit an obscure rather than a transparent one. This use of archaeology
is much harder; it requires much more effort, for we have first to ignore
its reflective properties and, second, to struggle to see through to the
other side. Indeed, ironically, it is perhaps the reflection of ourselves
which is the most difficult obstacle to overcome in this process.
<p>
What kind of archaeology looks through the mirror? There are any number
of examples one could choose,
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
but let me focus on just two: garbology and forensic
archaeology. Garbology is the study of people's rubbish, pioneered
by William Rathje, from which critical understanding is gained of a
community's habits of consumption and waste.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
One of the more interesting aspects of this "project" is the frequent
incongruity between what people said and thought about their consumption
habits and what they actually did, as revealed by an examination of their
trash cans. It is not simply about people lying or deluding themselves;
it is about the significance of nondiscursive behavior in people's
lives. It is about material culture. And what applies on an individual
level applies equally on a social level, as similar studies of landfills
have demonstrated. Forensic archaeology involves a similar revelation,
but in the field of criminal behavior. Archaeologists are increasingly
being drawn into cases of civil and war crimes, where they serve as
part of the judicial process. Archaeologists have,


<b></b>


for example, worked on the bodies and graves of serial killers' victims,
or have participated in the excavation and analysis of mass graves around
the world.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
Once again, it is dealing with contexts in which discursivity is either
absent or intentionally suppressed.
<p>
The nature of archaeology in these examples might be described
as a presencing of absence&#x02014;or making discursive the
nondiscursive. Archaeology as exploring the prehistory of the present,
where the word "prehistory" invokes the radical ontological meaning given
earlier in this paper. For our world is not transparent; it is not fully
constituted: there are gaps, shadows, silences, and absences which are
not simply outside of discourse, but are often structurally excluded
by discourse. And here I want to introduce a notion of archaeology as
<i>an engagement with the unconstituted present</i>. If we can call
this unconstituted present a prehistory, then I would suggest even
further that this is exactly what all prehistory is, indeed what all
archaeology engages with, whether excavating Neolithic burial mounds
or late-twentieth-century landfills. The objects that archaeologists
study are unearthed and existing <i>in the present</i>&#x02014;even
if they can be said to have been made and buried in the past. To be
clear: this is not to deny the age of objects, or their historicity,
merely the temporal bracketing which would reduce the temporality
of an object to <i>another</i> time&#x02014;such as the Bronze Age or
the Neolithic. Prehistoric artifacts are <i>contemporary objects</i>,
as much as the latest Nokia cell phone or BMW. Indeed, archaeologists
routinely bring new things into the world through their excavations, and
these add to the material culture of contemporary society&#x02014;even
if they are tightly contained in museum cases, or concealed in
archives. Archaeologists, above all, engage with the unconstituted
present and attempt to make it part of a discourse.
<p>
How is this constitution performed? Critically and most momentously,
through the act of fieldwork. Archaeology is a materializing
activity&#x02014;it does not simply work with material things,
it <i>materializes</i>. It brings new things into the world; it
reconres the world. The public watches on as slowly over the weeks
a Viking longhouse emerges from the soil. To the public&#x02014;indeed
to archaeologists&#x02014;the rhetoric of the dig is about exposure,
uncovering what has been buried. But this seriously misrepresents the
creative process of excavation. A rhetoric of sculpture, of design, might
be equally apt. The archaeological site as a gestalt image: sculpted
or buried? Would the passer-by be able to tell? Would you? Of course
in a Platonic epistemology, the sculptor is only uncovering what was
already there anyway, inherent in the material; perhaps archaeology is no
different. But I think the issue is not about the end product as much as
the process; not about what is made, but the process of making. Moreover,
archaeology viewed as an act of materializing also incorporates the act
of translation, which is often less noticeable. The passer-by now sees
an archaeologist making a drawing of the sculpted/buried remains, making
notes, taking photographs. She witnesses the process of translation from
object to image/text.
<p>
This is not simply a case of representation either, despite
what archaeological orthodoxy would say. Rather it is a <i>double
materialization</i>, where both excavation and translation constitute each
other. The way the site is excavated is largely performed with reference
to the way it will be recorded; for example, sections of earth are cut


<b></b>


vertically in preparation for drawing the layers; pegs are put in the
ground to reference gridded drafting paper; lines are scored around
layers, like pencil on paper. Which is representing which? Excavations
and even laboratories are the sites where this unconstituted present
is engaged, and made discursive. The nature of this discursivity is
not given in the nature of the materials either but is something which
has to be performed; archaeology is just <i>one</i> performance. Others
are possible: even on the same site other materializations could take
place. The question is, should archaeology be worried by this possibility?

Modern Archaeology
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>

<p>
Ultimately, this brings us back to the beginning of this paper and the
contradictions of modernity. The core dilemma of modernity was how to
understand the world without turning to tradition&#x02014;how to find a new
authority which resided outside of tradition&#x02014;effectively, outside
of time. As part of this search for a new authority in studying the past,
archaeology developed the analysis of material culture which subsequently
produced in the nineteenth century the concept of a new past. Prehistory
was this new past, unrelated to tradition and paradoxically, a <i>very
modern</i> past. Yet its meaning was always rendered ambiguous through
the connection to the present, through analogy, an ambiguity which is
concealed by chronology. An archaeology of the present, of modernity
as the contemporary, however, raises a new conception of prehistory. It
unsettles the role of chronology by once again focusing on analogy. Only
instead of seeing an archaeology of the present as analogical (i.e.,
ethnoarchaeology), it demands we see it as an engagement with the
unconstituted present. The present is no longer an analogy for the past,
it is the field in which pasts are constituted. Prehistory should no
longer be viewed as a new past, but rather a new present&#x02014;rather the
performance of presencing. The significance of material culture is no
longer about a new authority or foundation for understanding the world
(specifically the past), but about a critique of any absolute authority
or foundationalism. Depending on your perspective, this is archaeology
as an antimodernist, postmodernist or, simply, late modernist project.
<p>
The implications of this conception also explode the restricted notion
of archaeology as the search for knowledge. Archaeology is often seen
as simply an academic discipline, producing authoritative knowledge
about the past. But however you characterize or contest the nature of
such knowledge (or the past), it is also important to recognize that
archaeology is a mode of cultural production: a cultural work.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Archaeology is important to most societies in the world today because
it contributes to a broader educational project about national and
even universal identities: who are we? It can be exploited to support
nationalistic ideologies (as was the case in Nazi Germany)
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
or critique them. It also serves more recreational functions as
entertainment, either directly (e.g., a day at the museum) or indirectly
(e.g., technical advice on the latest Hollywood movie). One could no
doubt cite more roles; however, the route from the very specific and
highly specialized job of excavating, say a Viking house, to the wider
social reception of archaeological knowledge affecting people's lives
is long&#x02014;


<b></b>


often too long. Indeed, insofar as archaeology enhances people's lives
and society in general, its major impact might be said to lie in popular
culture rather than any noble vision of improving self-awareness. One
could debate the relative merit of these different roles of archaeology
in society&#x02014;should it be emancipatory or is it enough to be
entertaining? I do not want to address such questions here (though they
are exceedingly important), but rather argue that however one views its
cultural role, an archaeology of the present opens up a much broader
forum for cultural work, and one whose relevance is potentially immediate
rather than distant.
<p>
In many ways, it is through exploring the interstitial spaces between
cultural projects that archaeology can expand most; conventionally,
by viewing itself primarily as an academic discipline, archaeology
has perceived its limits to lie on the border of other academic
disciplines&#x02014;history, anthropology, or geography, for example. But
archaeology's limits go far beyond academia&#x02014;it can equally explore
its relation to other fields of cultural production, such as art or
theater. Indeed, these have been explored through dialogues between
individuals from their respective fields, such as Colin Renfrew and Mark
Dion on art,
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
or Michael Shanks and Michael Pearson on theater.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
And then why not similar dialogues between archaeologists and
construction engineers or architects? (I am not talking about
practical issues of conservation or mitigation, but about theoretical
issues regarding the significance of the built environment.) The
possibilities are endless, as is the field of archaeology. Moreover,
such a perspective deconstructs the hierarchy of knowledge, which
privileges the didactic role of archaeology. For the cultural value of
archaeology lies not solely in the grand narratives of the past. It
is not just in synthetic works, popular books, museums, or heritage
sites that archaeology performs its cultural work. Any segment or
part of archaeological practice, even its most scientific, mundane
operations, is potentially able to participate in a wider cultural
project. The projects I discussed earlier, garbology and forensics,
have much broader and rather different cultural implications and
social relevance than traditional archaeology. Extending the notion
of archaeology to a more generalized concept of cultural critique and
redemption, archaeology can be likened to an act of therapy on a social
level. It can help a community or even a whole nation come to terms with
and understand key social problems, such as a sudden tragic event (e.g.,
war crimes) or a more long-term, structural malaise (social deprivation
and inequality). This is archaeology breaking the boundaries of its
normal role in cultural work. This is modern archaeology.
