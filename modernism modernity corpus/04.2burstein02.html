We all to-day (possibly with a coldness reminiscent of the insect-world)

The fascist body is a forgery. That is, it is wholly constructed,
meant for circulation, and stands in for a previous incarnation, the
v&ouml;lkish body, that of the people. The fascist body is fabricated,
renovated, reconstructed, consisting of extensions and projections. It is
frequently said that all bodies are constructs, but there's an original
sort of forgery at work in the fascist body, because it's a forgery of
a forgery, a stand-in for a prototype that never existed, the double
of a fake. I will anatomize the body presented in two texts written by
Wyndham Lewis, <I>Hitler</I>  and <I>Snooty Baronet</I> . In
order to do this, I must take two things for granted, neither of which
is true. The first is that there is a fascist aesthetic, and the second
is that Wyndham Lewis labored under it. I would like to propose that we
collaborate with such dreams of coherence and necessity, that we strap
them on artificially in the name of building a better understanding of
a particular strain of literary modernism.

<B></B>

<P>
My account of the fascism-modernism nexus is based on a belief that some
writers were indeed articulating artistic structures that served the
ideological interests of particular social groups. Whereas I can agree
with Robert Casillo that these structures sometimes evince pathology, I
want to track the aesthetic at work in the artistic structures articulated
by Lewis and to argue for a coherence of perspective that does not reduce
to either the ideological or the pathological.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 I will use prosthesis as a way to articulate a form of embodiment that
 encompasses but is not limited to the collaboration between modernism
 and fascism. From my vantage point on these two terms, prosthesis
 is central to an alternative strain of modernism in which character,
 identity, narrative-functions, and the bodies that move through these
 modernist fictions are constituted so that embodiment can be dissembled,
 reworked, reproduced, and rendered either unintelligible or unmotivated.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 My contention is that our most authoritative "genealogy of modernism"
 is incomplete, and that there is a competing line of descent that has
 everything to do with bodies, ossature, and carapace, and little to do
 with psychology, motivation, or desire.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 I will refer to prosthesis as a way to understand--and not just to
 supplement--the body in two texts written by two writers, Lewis and,
 briefly, Ernst J&uuml;nger, both of whom have uneasy relationships to
 fascism, specifically to National Socialism, and to modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>

<P>
In 1930 Lewis went to Berlin in order to write about the rise of National
Socialism. During this last gasp of the Weimar Republic, Lewis wrote
what came to be <I>Hitler.</I> He returned to England and two years
later, in 1932, published the novel <I>Snooty Baronet.</I>

<P>
Ernst J&uuml;nger, who is one hundred and two this year, fought in
both world wars and received numerous decorations as well as literary
acclaim for his "Front-experience" book, <I>The Storm of Steel.</I>
"Total Mobilization," the essay with which I want to supplement Lewis's
textual world, appeared in an anthology called <I>War and Warrior</I>
that J&uuml;nger himself edited in 1930. "Total Mobilization" is a
pr&eacute;cis of <I>The Worker,</I> published the same year as <I>Snooty
Baronet,</I> 1932. J&uuml;nger looks to a future in which the individual
is ennobled by a ferocious relationship to labor, entirely integrated into
the landscape of a society for which mobilization is both means and end.

<P>
Lewis's novel concerns a one-legged and extremely snooty baronet who
writes scientific treatises on <I>People Behaving,</I> which is the title
of his first popular book. He calls these books "behaviorist" tracts;
they are a snooty science, artfully rendered (or so his loathed public
decides). Snooty wants to study "Man upon exactly the same footing as
ape or insect" (<I>SB,</I> 64) and writes two books that come to be
acclaimed, much to the author's chagrin, as "Works of Art" (<I>SB,</I>
65), rather than as science. Snooty is recruited by his literary agent,
Humph, to go to Persia on a publicity stunt: ostensibly to study the
cult of Mithras, but really to be kidnapped by native brigands, and then
heavily ransomed. The point is to provide Snooty with publicity. Snooty
cooperates, reluctantly, and takes with him the woman he loves to loathe,
Val, who is immensely unattractive, but at the moment rich. He hopes to
set up Humph, whom he also loves to loathe, with Val, and is disappointed
when it turns out that Humph already hates Val. Eventually Snoots and
Val go on to Persia, where they meet up

<B></B>

with Humph, and set to loathing each other in new ways. The fake
kidnapping commences and, because this is a Lewis novel, Snooty suddenly
shoots his literary agent twice in the back, killing him. Snooty
ultimately returns to England, where he becomes famous because of the
kidnapping, and writes the book that we now read, <I>Snooty Baronet,</I>
in order to clear his name--that is, to prove that he knew exactly what
he was doing when he shot Humph dead. He does not regret his action in
the least.

<P>
Michael Levenson has written about what he calls the condition of
"transitivity" in Lewis's novel <I>Tarr,</I> where any one character
can assume another's characteristics. Lewis's concept of character
is even more radical than that; transitivity is simply a symptom of
having artificially to extend one's self. Attendant upon this dynamic
is a routine dislocation of character, moments when character becomes
unhinged, when the most literal aspects of "integrity"--and by this I
mean bodily wholeness as well as rectitude--not so much dissolve, for
there is no mush in Lewis, as unfasten.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 This process is literalized in <I>Snooty Baronet,</I> where the
 protagonist first appears as a stranger to itself. "Not a bad face,"
 begins the novel, "flat and white, broad and weighty." (<I>SB,</I>
 15) And then, "The face drew back. The door opened. Grasping the
 forward jamb, a large man thrust out one leg, which was straight and
 stiff. Pointing the rigid leg downward, implacably on the sidewalk, the
 big man swung outward, until the leg hit terra-firma. . . . The face
 was mine." (<I>SB,</I> 15) And the leg is his. Or is it? We are called
 back to the moment of the double, of Sigmund Freud encountering his own
 face in the train compartment: "I at once realized to my dismay that
 the intruder was nothing but my own reflection in the looking-glass of
 the open door."
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 This is the uncanny, the site of confusion between the organic and the
 inorganic, the unsettling moment when the animated is inorganic, when
 the leg is as foreign to Snooty's body as it is its essence. Indeed
 by the end of the novel, Snooty will be countering accusations that
 he is "<I>unhinged</I> (that is the expression, as if I were a door)"
 (<I>SB,</I> 252). Freud mistaking himself for a door, or vice versa, is
 the mirror image of what is in fact the case for Snooty: he is unhinged.

<P>
The European Unhinged underwent a great deal of reworking in the twenty
years before the appearance of <I>Snooty Baronet,</I> the years during
and following World War I. The war created "a new constituency of
disabled people."
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 Bodies were mutilated at a new rate and in novel ways, while
 psychological trauma was brought to a new level of visibility. More than
 41,000 British men had limbs amputated after sustaining new kinds of
 wounds. The new frequency and forms of mutilation were due both to new
 weaponry like hand grenades, high explosive shells, pointed bullets, and
 artillery fire, and to particular conditions of warfare--mud, lice--that
 encouraged infection. Given the numbers of the wounded requiring
 treatment simultaneously, "within three days of a battle, a casualty
 clearing station might be swamped with 1,000 injured men and mutilated
 limbs sometimes had to wait days before being amputated." (<I>DM,</I>
 34) The smell at these clearing stations was much remarked upon; the
 gas that gangrene produces smells sweet, or "mouse-like,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 and in a world before penicillin, the smell of the infected and decaying
 flesh was overpowering. In addition to the new visible effects of war
 on the body, there was a new less immediately recognizable

<B></B>

consequence for the soldier's body: in 1916, 40 percent of combat
zone casualties were due to shell-shock. Overall, neurasthenia was
responsible for one-third of the discharges from the British army
(<I>DM,</I> 109). The debate over the cause of psychological ill-health
initially inclined toward the organic, but over the course of the war,
shell-shock was viewed as stemming from psychological causes.

<P>
All of this had the combined effect of introducing a segment of the
population that had never before been so populous, so visible, and so
altered; following World War I, the population of Britain was left to
integrate a huge population of amputees and shell-shock victims.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 The effects were felt from art to orthopedics. While industry accounted
 for a certain level of mutilation within Britain, and birth defects too
 accounted for many missing limbs, these segments of the population were
 either working-class or, in the case of children, unenfranchised. The war
 fed into society a tremendous number of men with class standing, full
 citizen status, and even some social distinction, initially conferred
 by their wounds; a transfer of the resources garnered during the war
 resulted: the "gigantic plant . . . to help the disabled," the "army
 of people whose livelihood was dependent on maintaining a supply of
 cripples" (<I>DM,</I> 51), was redirected toward the general population.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 The industry for production and distribution of artificial limbs was
 radically altered. The limbs were hard to come by; in 1919, a wooden
 artificial limb cost anywhere from &#163;15 (for arm amputations above
 the elbow) to &#163;22 (for an amputation through the hip joint), while
 the average wage for a skilled craftsman was &#163;2 a week (<I>DM,</I>
 45). An artificial limb made of aluminum alloy, which was lighter and
 thus preferable, cost &#163;80 during the same period. By 1922, however,
 after the British government agreed to examine the relative benefits
 and costs of wooden versus metal limbs, a government committee concluded
 that, given the relative lifetimes and maintenance costs of each item,
 the metal limb was more cost-effective and thus superior. While a wooden
 limb's lifetime was four years and cost &#163;120 every twelve years,
 a metal limb lasted six to eight years and cost only &#163;96 every
 twelve years (<I>DM,</I> 46). In consultation with the government the
 producers of artificial limbs agreed to lower the cost of their product
 and the metal limbs were increasingly distributed to ex-servicemen.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>

<P>
My argument is this: the prosthetic body, that is, the body once
fragmented, now made new with supplemental forms of prosthesis, is
more than the sum of its parts; the soldierly body went through a
transformation from a historical, wounded body into a nonhistorical,
aestheticised body. This new body, the prosthetic body, succeeds
where the previous body failed. My claim is that the prosthetic body is
uniquely modern, has functioned in a way that counteracts the absorptive
tendencies of cultural transmission, and, finally, that it is an index
to a cold modernism.

<P>
In the beginning was the "mere body," prewar, cloaked only in flesh,
retroactively understood as fragile.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 This is the "tiny, fragile human body" Walter Benjamin describes suddenly
 finding itself in the middle of the battlefield of World War I, but it
 is that body before discovering itself in that alien landscape.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 The second position, that of the armored body, is the soldier at war. The
 prosthetic body is the third position in a genealogy of body-positions
 available before, during, and after World War I.

<B></B>

The prosthetic body is as historical as the mud in the trenches of the
Somme. Certainly prosthesis is not a modern invention, but it is in an
important sense the apotheosis of modernity, a fantasy about the modern
body beyond the merely compensatory. But the prosthetic body, the mere
body after war plus prosthesis, is not reworked into another element at
all; it emerges first as historical symbol, then is stripped naked, or
as close to naked as the armored body can be, and reborn as an exemplary
instance of the new man, the modern body, and a body of literature. The
prosthetic body is a product of historical circumstances, but it embodies
an ahistorical promise, making available a new and quintessentially
modern image. As an embodiment of the uncanny, resting on the seam
between organic and inorganic, between flesh and metal, it literalizes an
aspect of the relationship between war and art, or history and culture,
that preserves its original contours as much as it gestures toward its
dissolution. The prosthetic body is balanced on the edge between the
pleasure principle and the death drive, a product of trauma built on
the promise of repetition. While prosthesis first emblematized, even as
it sought to resolve, a trauma that had fragmented the body, it came to
operate as a culture's fantasy of proof that the body not only survived,
but had been born better.

<P>
Any artistic movement is bound to absorb, with varying measures of
intention and wit, the culture that surrounds it. Modris Eksteins's
<I>Rites of Spring</I> gives us an image of dada dancers juxtaposed
with an "armored lookout man" from World War I; his point is to show
that dada took a particular kind of historical body and incorporated it
into its own aesthetic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Eksteins sketches the profound transformations that World War I had
 on the history and art that followed; it was the "event," and what
 ensued--dada, Charles Lindbergh, shingled hair, World War II--was the
 "consequence" (<I>RS,</I> xvi). Mud speaks: Eksteins argues that the
 landscape of battle was in essence avant-garde <I>avant la lettre:
 </I>"The whole landscape of the Western Front became surrealistic before
 the term <I>surrealism</I> was invented by the soldier-poet Guillaume
 Apollinaire. . . . A panorama of devastation confronted the soldiers
 in the major battle zones" (<I>RS,</I> 146). The mud that the soldiers
 struggled through and died in, "a kind of stagnant river, too thick to
 flow, yet too wet to stand," which "you left no tracks in . . . they
 all closed over, and you went in over your boots at every step and
 sometimes up to your calves,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 was transformed by the war experience into a feature of modern
 life. Eksteins quotes T. S. Eliot:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_poetry-->
. . . Words strain,
<BR>
Crack and sometimes break, under the burden,
<BR>

Will not stay still.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Eksteins concludes, "It was as if words had become like the mud on
the Somme." (<I>RS,</I> 218) Prosthesis too speaks as both context
and formulating principle, but while mud became a symbol of culture's
quagmire, prosthesis emerged in culture formulated, retroactively, as
a unifying principle for the modern body.

<P>
The question of what appendages engage directly with the speaker in
<I>Snooty Baronet,</I> whether things in fact are or are not Snooty,
is a recurrent issue. The prosthetic device of his leg is lavished
with a measure of syntactical care that no other object in the novel
receives--and I number characters among those objects.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 The leg is called variously "my mechanical knee" (<I>SB,</I> 44, 76),
 "fitted with clockwork" (<I>SB,</I> 22), and "a nickel nether limb"
 (<I>SB,</I> 22). Snooty's prosthetic device is most certainly his
 (but perhaps only because no one else wants it); it is most his when he
 unfastens it, and later has to hop around looking for it; this usually
 happens before and after sex, which not surprisingly, since this is a
 Lewis novel, is supplemented by an explicitly unpleasant return to the
 organic: Snooty's character is augmented not only by a nickel nether
 limb, but by a silver plate in his head, which embedded itself during
 the war, and this plate has the effect of making Snooty retch following
 sexual climax. The first time we see this, Snooty's character is again
 dislocated by a return to the third person. Ten minutes after hopping
 into bed with Val, "a one-legged man hopped out. He was as naked as God
 ushered him into the world. . . . Sitting down . . . and bending over
 the gilt-flowered slop-vessel, this man proceeded to be ill. . . . That
 one-legged man . . . was me." (<I>SB,</I> 49) Engagement is awarded
 only to the leg--it is the only thing that truly engages Snooty; he is
 forever interposing his mechanical leg between the fleshier parts of
 his body and those of his paramours. This has the effect of rendering
 mechanical even those fleshier bits:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
As I spoke I went to meet her--as I started my mechanical leg giving out
an ominous creak (I had omitted to oil it, like watches and clocks these
things require lubrication). I seized her stiffly round the body. All of
her still passably lissom person . . . gave. It was the human willow, more
or less. It fled into the hard argument of my muscular pressures. Her
waist broke off and vanished into me as I took her over in waspish
segments, an upper and a nether. . . . With my live leg . . . I attacked
the nether half of my aggressive adversary, and wound it cleverly round
her reintegrating fork. (We were now both suspended upon my mechanical
limb.) [<I>SB,</I> 48]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This bachelor comes already hitched. At first it would appear simply that
his body subsumes hers--the latter "flees" the former; he disarticulates
her, literally, breaking apart her "segments." The segment of most
interest to Snooty is the "nether half," the lower region, which is
also the trickiest, requiring some level of cleverness in dealing
with its containment. This is the half that inspires in him the role
of the "adversary": at that point--the point on the body, the point in
the sentence--the moment of contest is clearly articulated. Val's body
moves from being fluid, "passably lissom," to being armored, at first in
response to Snooty's own "hard argument" but then in relation to her own
bodily construction: she is divided into "waspish segments." Val's body,
then, comes to echo Snooty's, articulated as it is in differing registers:
she, lissome, then waspish and aggressive, he stiff, then wending and
suspended. The blur of who is what--both seem at once mechanical and
fleshy, bipedal and pseudopodial--is paralleled by Lewis's organization
of units of time, and action:

<B></B>

bodies can flee without moving, and in fact here Val flees and vanishes
precisely insofar as she does not move; while integration ("her
reintegrating fork") is staged on a stilled body's petiole. The moment
of integration--again both topographically and syntactically--signals
the moment of the battle's climax, which finds both Val and Snooty
"suspended" atop the latter's leg.

<P>
Being disengaged from one's body parts, one's name, and one's own
character are repeated signs of disorientation. Many people end
up being "snooty," with a lowercase <I>S,</I> throughout the novel
(Humph, for instance, so antagonizes Val at one point that "He really
became Snooty"--note the capital <I>S</I> [<I>SB,</I> 205].). There's
no sense of a character's stability; <I>Snooty Baronet</I> is peopled
with duplications, or at least pale copies. The plot grinds out two
prostitutes named Lily, one from London, and one of the Eastern variety,
"whose name was <I>Lily</I> in Persian," Shushani (<I>SB,</I> 220).
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 Character is not only "transitive"; it is contagious, with the result
 that entire characters are reproducible, courtesy of something like a
 character machine.

<P>
And as reproducible as character is, what it lacks is integrity--that
is, what might be conceived of as psychological intactness, a density
of thought and insight--pith. Snooty himself is aware of this odd lack,
aware that he does not quite <I>get</I> things; that ideas have no
resonance for him. He explains the odd look his face sometimes has, a
"heavy puzzled look" (<I>SB,</I> 134).

<P>

I have literally to drill holes in this sheep's head of mine before it
can get an at all difficult notion, or sometimes any at all, into it
properly. In all but purely mechanical things, of an external order
. . . I am a profoundly dense person, I can hardly help it. Mine is
anything but a quick mind.--This may be why I am a <I>behaviorist.</I>
. . . A notion goes <I>so far</I> in with me and not an inch farther. That
is what is oddest of all. It seems to stick in the surface shell. It
remains embedded in the bone, quite hard and fast. . . . Ideas come out
of the blue, fiercely to get us, like wasps, or like a bacillus or a
weevil dropped on a cork. I can feel one <I>strike</I> me. Then I feel
it get stuck . . . [<I>SB,</I> 134].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This is a wonderful description of what being a bonehead, literally, feels
like, if the word "feels" can be used here. Ideas, like wasps--this is
the blooming, buzzing confusion of reality (and remember those "waspish
segments" [<I>SB,</I> 48] of Val's buzzing body). But for Lewis, as not
for a Virginia Woolf character, one's access to interiority is wholly
impoverished; nothing quite penetrates the ossature that surrounds us.

<P>
Engagement with one's environment, however, has a nasty habit of
slipping in, and this makes the speaking subject-positions in Lewis
so slippery. Isolationism constantly needs to be reconstructed and
reiterated; the banquet that the narrator hosts for his puppets is
repeatedly disrupted because these dead things keep aiming their faces
in our direction, and it looks as if they are looking at us. You--the
author--have a habit of answering back, knowing all the while that there
is no one else in the room. It's just you and wood. But the conviction
in your own voice, that these things are so very dead, works to animate
you, and comes to animate them. Your animus animates them. At one point
in the novel Snooty stands transfixed by an automaton in the window
of a haberdasher, a machine in the shape of a man who tips his hat to
the public.

His character interested me at once. It is absurd to say these things
(if you insist on calling them <I>things</I>) have no character. Those
that are made to-day are, like characters in books, often much more
real than live people. . . . It was impossible as one watched him not to
feel that he was in some real sense <I>alive.</I> At certain moments of
course the imperfections of the apparatus would betray him. But is this
not the case . . . with the best of us? [<I>SB,</I> 133]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This is as close to a cri de c&#156;ur as Lewis gives, and who wants
anything more plaintive, except some people who really like dinner
parties, who actually believe that other people are listening to them?

<P>
Snooty gives what he reluctantly calls his own behaviorist "cry from
the heart" (<I>SB,</I> 252) on the novel's final page when he demands
justice, which is to say he argues for continuity in his behavior and
continuity in our understanding of his behavior: he is not, he protests,
to be misunderstood or "whitewashed" by Val as simply a "dirty dog"
(<I>SB,</I> 252). His behavior, Snooty means, is consistently without
internal motivation, or consistently habitual. The cable that Val sends
him, accusing him of being "a dirty dog," is what Snooty calls "snooty"
(<I>SB,</I> 252); the nightmare of behaviorism, then, is that behavior is
infinitely iterable. If all actions are generated by a human motor (more
of this below)--if there's no pressure to be individually motivated,
or unique--then an essentially Fordist notion lies at the heart of
humanity, which means we can all be built, and indeed we are all built
alike, which in turn (in this assembly-line logic) means that what I do
you can be, and so Val becomes snooty. Or, more formally, as Snooty says
in the novel's penultimate line, "If you are a true behaviorist . . . you
behave as I have behaved!" (<I>SB,</I> 252) The dynamic of this discourse
separates Snooty from his own situation: first, because by virtue of the
behaviorist theorem no narrative position is unique--you can't argue for
the importance of Bloom's day as it occurs to Bloom since, according to
behaviorism, you or I (you and I) will react in exactly the same way,
given the same circumstances. Second, Snooty articulates (in the sense
of enunciating the joints of an object/argument so distinctly that they
are readily divisible) himself out of what might crudely be called the
subject-position. In articulating his position as a true behaviorist,
he divides himself from the behaviorist position, since given the
behaviorist position there's nothing essential about being present to
an occasion (Val might as well be Snooty and in fact is). Snooty thus
ends by addressing an antagonistic audience comprised of behaviorists,
a roomful of snooty replications: "Put that in your pipe and smoke it,
all you professors of this implacable doctrine!" (<I>SB,</I> 252).

<P>
It's important that Snooty's last line is a parting shot, in a novel of
parting shots, because it enacts what Lewis's syntax insists on, that
we are all angrily and loudly leaving a room filled with people who are
unaware of our having entered it, because we bear an eerie resemblance
to the other partygoers. The syntax loudly declares its difference from

<P>
Lewis's syntax is wonderfully obdurate, and its hard-as-nails quality
replicates the structure of the bodies in his fictions. His syntactical
ossature works toward a form-echoes-function maintenance of indifference
and stasis; for instance, in response to

<B></B>

Humph's initial proposal to travel to Persia to learn about the cult
of the bull, Snooty makes "a rather violent gesture of deprecation--to
superadd to utter ignorance desire for continuance of same." (<I>SB,</I>
75) This is the literary incarnation--with the syntax enacting the
obdurate quality it describes--of the fin-de-si&egrave;cle nexus of
over-stimulation, nervous exhaustion, stasis, and modernity, all of
which Freud drew on when he likened the ego to a single-celled organism,
constructed with a thick layer with which to deflect nervous shock. The
combination of violence and stasis, an abstruse syntax evoking at
once the asceticism of science ("desire for continuance of same," with
its three-fold elision of articles), and a mannered affectedness (not
repeating "ignorance," instead substituting "the same" as if one were
too weary even of ignorance to sully one's diction with it twice) is
familiar--this syntax puts the "duh" in "fin de si&egrave;cle." Anyone
who has read Max Nordau's wildly stimulating book <I>Degeneration</I>
 will recognize the symptom of nervous excitement--because of wars,
because of cities--as indicative of the disease of modernity, with all
its concomitant pathologies. Georg Simmel too saw humans as guarding
against and shaped by the city; urbanity is the source of a particular
kind of degenerative effect, producing a new form of personality, one
driven by an increased "intellectualistic quality."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 In "The Metropolis and Mental Life"  he says that "the metropolitan
 type . . . creates a protective organ for itself against the profound
 disruption with which the fluctuations and discontinuities of the
 external milieu threaten it" ("ML," 326). This increased intellectualism
 is, then, a psychic buffer, one akin to what Freud described in 1920,
 in <I>Beyond the Pleasure Principle.</I>

<P>
Simmel's city--Berlin--produces a community of individuals who have
in common "a sphere of mental activity which is least sensitive and
which is furthest removed from the depths of the personality" ("ML,"
326). This "increased intellectualism" is paired with what Simmel
calls the "blas&eacute; attitude" ("ML," 329); both are the result of
a submersion in an overstimulating environment, and both are at once
compensatory and formative.

Just as an immoderately sensuous life makes one blas&eacute; because
it stimulates the nerves to their utmost reactivity until they finally
can no longer produce any reaction at all, so, less harmful stimuli,
through the rapidity and the contradictoriness of their shifts, force
the nerves to make such violent responses, tear them about so brutally
that they exhaust their last reserves of strength and, remaining in the
same milieu, do not have time for new reserves to form. ["ML," 329]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This blas&eacute; attitude is coupled with, Simmel says, the tendency
to experience one's environment in terms of equivalencies, while
"distinctions between things . . . are experienced as meaningless"
("ML," 330).

<P>
Both of these propensities, the blas&eacute; attitude and the calculus of
similitude, Simmel attributes to the effect of money on the metropolitan
economy. "Money economy and the domination of the intellect stand in
the closest relationship to one another. They have in common a purely
matter-of-fact attitude in the treatment of persons and things in which
a formal justice is often combined with unrelenting

<B></B>

hardness." ("ML," 326) "Unrelenting hardness" is of course the result of
seeing things in terms of their exchange value, rather than their meaning.

[E]xchange value . . . reduces all quality and individuality to a purely

Qualitative discrimination interrupts the flow of pure exchange,
forcing the subject into making an evaluative judgment for which he
isn't neurologically equipped; the metropolitan citizen is incapable of
"react[ing] to new stimulations with the required amount of energy"
("ML," 329). He becomes, in other words, snooty:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Indeed . . . the inner side of this external reserve is not only
indifference but more frequently than we believe, it is a slight
aversion, a mutual strangeness and repulsion which, in a close contact
. . . can break out into hatred and conflict. . . . Our minds respond,
with some definite feeling, to almost every impression emanating from
another person. The unconsciousness, the transitoriness and the shift
of these feelings seem to raise them only into indifference. Actually
this latter would be as unnatural to us as immersion into a chaos of
unwished-for suggestions would be unbearable. From these two dangers
of metropolitan life we are saved by antipathy which is the latent
adumbration of actual antagonism since it brings about the sort of
distantiation and deflection without which this type of life could not
be carried on at all. ["ML," 331]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Antipathy saves us from languishing wholly in the blas&eacute; and
its opposite, a chaotic welter of absolute empathy. Simmel takes the
characteristics with which Lewis fashions Snooty--the blas&eacute;
attitude, an "unrelenting hardness," and a literal investment in
antipathy--and produces a type; Lewis produces a novel. This is not to say
that Lewis read Simmel. The novel absorbs the monetary structure to which
Simmel refers, making Snooty a baronet with limited financial resources,
a writer who banks on aversion as the basis of his career. Money is an
important sign in Lewis, both of biographical predicaments (the author
never had it), and of a structure for narrative relations. It is the gold
standard of modern relations--a smoothly functioning system erected on,
and producing, aversion and indifference.

<P>
Snooty is chronically blas&eacute;. He yawns constantly--he is forever
bored, even by death--and we may look to his hearty gasps of boredom
as a key to his quintessentially modern ailment. Snooty is modern
man: ex-soldier, part clockwork, partly running down, but nonetheless
wholly functional, wholly productive; he is fully a member of the money
economy. Snooty is in fact one of the few artists in early Lewis fiction
who produce anything--<I>Tarr</I> has great descriptions of the artists
who receive visitors rather than work.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Lewis's artists tend to be anything but transitive. Anson Rabinbach
 traces a compelling supplement to the genealogy of neurasthenia and
 fatigue, with fatigue being not a detriment to civilization, as Nordau
 and others have it, but on the contrary a reason for its success:
 theorists of the fin-de-si&egrave;cle postulated that fatigue was a
 way to ensure overall productivity, avoiding wasted energy.

<B></B>

Fatigue was seen as one of the mechanisms of an inner clock that regulates
what Rabinbach calls "the human motor."

<P>
With labor as our hinge, let's pivot here to J&uuml;nger's "Total
Mobilization." In the quotation above, J&uuml;nger looks to the
investigation of what lies behind progress; he wants to determine
what animates the puppets of history. This concept of progress
bears further dissection, and, having emerged from the War To End
All Wars, J&uuml;nger decides that the place to conduct the analysis
is the battlefield. "Mobilization" is the process by which a society
gears itself up to t a battle. General mobilization, when enlisted
subjects are recruited and sent into battle, has now, J&uuml;nger says,
"the character of a <I>partial</I> measure." ("TM," 125). To embrace
true progress, to realize politics as "the art of the possible" ("TM,"
126)--J&uuml;nger here quotes Bismarck--and completely reevaluate the
basis of an economy, J&uuml;nger envisions a process of mobilization
that is temporally and philosophically all-encompassing:

this unlimited marshalling of potential energies, which transforms
the warring industrial countries into volcanic forges, we perhaps
find the most striking sign of the dawn of the age of labor
[<I>Arbeitszeitalter</I>]. ["TM," 126]

<P>
The worker-soldier is to be subsumed into a landscape premised entirely
on an economic and cultural mobilization that produces itself as its own
end, rather than relying on the all too temporal flux of occasional war
as a social stimulant.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 Benjamin, in his "Theories of German Fascism" said that this "new theory
 of war . . . is nothing other than an uninhibited translation of the
 principles of <I>l'art pour l'art</I> to war itself."
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 The relationship of the individual body to the battlefield is
 all-encompassing. "In order to deploy energies of such proportion [as
 total mobilization requires], fitting one's sword-arm no longer suffices;
 for this is a mobilization [<I>R&uuml;stung</I>] that requires extension
 to the deepest marrow, life's finest nerve." ("TM," 126) This work for
 its own sake, <I>mobilisation pour la mobilisation,</I> brings up two
 parallels with the case of Lewis: the odd aestheticism of a yawning
 baronet who works--the blend of reactionary decadence and labor--and
 the subsumption of individual integrity into a landscape of supplements,
 a prosthetic work ethic: the sword now does not extend merely from the
 arm, but from the deepest reaches of the self.

<B></B>

<P>
There's a clock ticking inside <I>Snooty Baronet</I> that drives
this fiction to stasis--not to resolution, but to the "continuance of
same." That's why the book that we read, <I>Snooty Baronet,</I> is the
one that Snoots writes, as he tells us at the novel's close. At the end
of the plot begins the writing of the totally mobilized novel, grinding
out itself. Complete production, total baronet. Prosthesis can structure
the individual's relationship to its context, to the point even that
the seam between flesh and metal, or soldier and landscape, or plot
and character is entirely reworked, or disappears entirely. The novel
that begins at the amputated end of the book looks a lot like <I>Snooty
Baronet,</I> but this is a counterfeit ending, referring us simply to
its own body's beginning. The book seems amputated because its ending
is false. Snooty has to counter the lies told about him by Val, and does
so by writing this book, which ends with those lies.

<P>
Two years before writing <I>Snooty Baronet,</I> Lewis, as I said,

 a "man of peace." (Unless, that is, you publish a recantation of your

 Berlin looking for Nazis. Here is what he finds instead, when he wanders

Lewis has found transvestites. Far from being a diversion, this moment
is essential to the construction of the fascist body, the fascist body
both in the sense that the bodies Lewis was searching for in Germany
were those of National Socialists, and that the bodies are constructed
along the lines of the aesthetic we don't entirely believe in but are
compelled to account for. The moment is formally essential in that
the Eldorado Bar sequence--this is where Lewis strikes gold--is the
first part of the book. What he and the reader find (or are forced to
find--there is a grudgingly tantalized play in whether this spectacle
was the intended one) are bodies that are not at all what they seem to
be: they are "trompe l'oeil"; a breast is revealed to be a "wire cup,
with cloth stretched over it" (<I>H,</I> 25). The game, though, is not
terminated by a semantic distinction between metal and flesh; for Lewis,
you can't go home again, because the problem exceeds its construction. "It
is too true to nature by far" (<I>H,</I> 24); the joining of this metal
with that flesh does not allow for later distinctions, for nature has
now been trumped, or <I>trompe</I>'d, with the creation of a prosthetic
sexuality that exceeds nature by becoming far <I>too</I>
true.

J. G. Ballard says that prosthetics is "the castration complex raised
to a level of the art form."
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 However compelling that idea, a genealogy of castration is itself
 a prematurely amputated endpoint: I am arguing for a prosthetic
 supplementation to the body of modernism as we now have it, for extending
 it to encompass a wilder body, to paraphrase Lewis. This body acts and
 reacts in accordance with mechanical impulses that are not regulated by
 desire or need. If, as Michael Levenson says, explaining the shock of
 a Lewis character abandoning his double, "it is difficult to imagine
 Marlow abandoning Kurtz to pursue business upriver" (<I>MF,</I> 139),
 how much more difficult is it to imagine Marlow suddenly growing bored
 by Kurtz, and <I>shooting</I> him--without either malice or regret?

<P>
One way of taxonomizing this cold modernism is to call it a "reactionary
modernism," following Jeffrey Herf. Another way is to label it a fascist
modernism, as Andrew Hewitt has.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 But these terms do not get at the excesses of this modernism, the
 modernist body that is entangled with the hard metals of politics and
 sexualities that are mechanized by something far less familiar, far
 more unsettling, and something that we, at this fin de si&egrave;cle,
 are beginning to recognize as our own, mistakenly believing that we
 have constructed it for the first time.

<P>
Lewis's transvestites are twins of the soldiers on J&uuml;nger's sprawling
battlefield; they are workers in a landscape where beginning and end have
become moot points, archaic remnants of a narrative teleology; in this
case the narrative is sexuality. As Hewitt has shown, Lewis's politics
are bound to an understanding of sexuality that hinges on the wavering
boundary between the natural and constructed.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 This is not simply to say that Lewis anticipates Judith Butler's
 pronouncements on the constructedness of gender; rather, it is to
 point to a historical nexus of fantasies about the corporal and the
 corporeal, in which labor is reworked as functionally anticlimactic,
 where production is so ongoing as to outweigh the object of production,
 and bodies are seamless elaborations of their surroundings.

If, as Walter Benn Michaels suggests, modernism is the
"research-and-development division of identitarianism," Wyndham Lewis
is the rat on which to test the applicability of that theorem.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Here's our rat: nationalism, race, and gender each are technologies
 that can be dismantled and reassembled at . . . not "will," because
 that implies a coherent agency supervising individual narratives, but in
 accordance with the demands of local circumstances. Identity-formation
 is reconstructed to fit circumstances; if you are German, you commit
 suicide, and if you commit suicide, you're German. In <I>Tarr,</I>
 agency is reworked as an attribute of the couple; in his <I>Mrs. Dukes'
 Million,</I> character becomes a crowd. In <I>Snooty Baronet,</I> the
 protagonist becomes most literally assembled; the ties that bind are
 readily unstrung; you can take off your leg or take off your literary
 agent. They are equivalent acts; both are without
 significance.

<B></B>

<P>
And what does it mean to have race, gender, or psychology
equally unprivileged, each so readily adjustable? The aesthetic
proposed is of total collaboration; identitarianism is simply no
longer the issue. In Lewis's cold modernism, the permutations of
available characteristics--race, sex, nationalism--are radically
rescripted. Identity and identitarianism--being a particular citizen of
a particular country--just don't work. They are both secondary concerns
beside a methodology lodged between satire on the one hand and the
modernist commitment to exploring the relationship between a sign and
its referent, a name and its subject, on the other. According to cold
modernism, you start at the outside, where resonance, be it psychological,
narrative, or ideological, dissipates. To probe any deeper is to ask
an automaton how it feels, "to superadd to utter ignorance desire for
continuance of same" (<I>SB,</I> 75).

<P>
Consider Lewis's much-remarked upon concern with the world's confusing
him with other Lewises, Wyndham Lewises, C. S.'s, and D. B.'s. Hugh
Kenner warns his readers away from the frequent confusion of the Lewis
under discussion with "another namesake, Mr. D. B. Wyndham Lewis."
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 Lewis was concerned throughout his life with the possibility of
 misattribution, with all those other writerly Lewises; in 1948 he said
 that after his death, "My books . . . would be shared out among various
 writers. D. B. W. L. would get two or three more, Day Lewis be given a
 couple probably and the <I>screw-tape</I> Lewis have attributed to him
 'Time and Western Man.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>
 The preoccupation with other people crowding in on the raft of
 a single name, the attendant anxiety of being misrecognized and
 forgotten, is continuous with the aesthetic that constructs agency
 from the outside. Lewis's 1930 diary is a compelling document in this
 light. Consider first that the diary is a reconstruction twice over: it
 is in fact a 1931 desk diary that Lewis wrote over, crossing out the
 days of the week to write in the corresponding ones for the previous
 year. In addition, the diary does not appear to have been kept at the
 time of the events it records, but reconstructed belatedly, at least
 in part, seemingly in order to assemble a narrative regarding the
 commission and execution of a portrait of one Lady Glenapp, when the
 finances turned sticky after the subject grew dissatisfied in 1931 with
 the results of the 1930 sitting. Other meaningful events--meaningful
 for our author--are recorded, among them, on 24 February, "When name
 was mentioned at dinner a man cried out 'Which W. Lewis.'"
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 And on 11 September, "Was it about this time that she [Lady Glenapp]
 started calling W. by his Christian name?" And, in a stirring moment
 that brings to bear the best that paranoia has to offer:

Prosthetics do not simply extend what is possible (a metal hand
replacing a fleshly one), but articulate an altogether new set of
possibilities. Susan Buck-Morss proposes that early cinema was a form
of prosthetic cognition. The movie screen did not simply extend the
possible; it was a "prosthetic organ," rescripting potentiality.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Tied historically to the development of modern warfare, cinema gave us
 new perspectives, literally, on "phenomena of the crowd" such as war
 and the street demonstration.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 It shapes a new body with which to experience violence, positioning us,
 anaesthetizing us, sensitizing us. Politics is the art of the possible,
 as Bismarck, speaking through J&uuml;nger, has it; prosthesis is an
 extension of a political way of conceiving new solutions to problems
 and deadlocks.

<P>
The prosthetics of modernism give us a new genealogy, a line of
bodies embedded in narratives that rework the possible scenarios of
character--political character, ideological limits, modes and degrees
of identification, and integrity--into an entirely new script. The
bodies that Lewis gives us are cold, wild, and regulated by an ethos of
supplementation--a prosthetic work ethic that reworks interiority into
an aspect of what it means to function. Just as early cinema installed
in its audience a prosthetic mode of cognition, Lewis's cold modernism
contrives a new model of character in which prosthesis is the heart
itself. What is at the heart of <I>Snooty Baronet,</I> and Lewis, is
a prosthetic device that beats out laughter at regular intervals. It
ticks and talks and regulates the flow of narrative, but it does not
yield to more lissome, recognizable, or organic notions of empathy or
identity. Identitarianism belongs in this case to an outmoded set of
assumptions about stability and limits that cold modernism not so much
disregards as incorporates, reworks, and renders unintelligible.

In the mid-1930s the young pup of the Coll&egrave;ge de Sociologie,
Roger Caillois, published "Mim&eacute;tisme et psychasth&eacute;nie
l&eacute;gendaire" in the avant-garde French journal <I>Minotaure.</I>
Caillois discusses various instances of insect mimicry--of environment
(bug as leaf), of other species (bug as cat), of confederate (bug as
other bug)--and the various ends to which mimicry leads--escape, surprise,
fecundation. He speculates too about the roots of the phenomenon: did the
insect world once contain a species especially adapted to imitation, did
insects gravitate toward environments that matched their bodies, or were
the matches fortuitous? He discards the notion of fortuitous "similarity"
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 on the grounds that successful mimicry involves a particular quality of
 relationship between the insect and its environment. We are dealing not
 simply with "combinations like any others," with mimicry being simply a
 randomly successful (in whatever terms that success is defined--fleeing,
 feeding, or mating) amalgamation of attributes that might well
 have led to death or celibacy; what we have is instead a "mutual
 organization," a "reciprocal topography" ("MLP," 23). Caillois says
 that the tendency to imitate--in this case the tendency of a butterfly,
 the Kallima, to resemble its environment, a kind of shrubbery--may be
 the behavioral vestige of "a set of cutaneous organs" that disappeared
 "once the resemblance was achieved" ("MLP," 23). That is, the Kallima
 butterfly once had a physiological system capable of molding the
 insect to any environment, but it froze, &agrave; la Lamarck, into
 a particular arrangement when the insect settled among a particular
 group of shrubs. "Morphological mimicry could then be . . . an actual
 photography, but of the form and the relief, a photography on the
 level of the object and not on that of the image, a reproduction in
 three-dimensional space with solids and voids" ("MLP," 23). The organ
 whose job it was to photograph the environment has evolved into something
 like an appendix, and this vestigial quality of insect physiology is
 important, because "luxury" ("MLP," 25) is the true concern of Caillois
 (and of the other members of his Coll&egrave;ge).
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>

<P>
The surplus of activity that mimicry involves--it is often ineffective
or less effective as a survival mechanism than other behavior--leads
Caillois to link it formally and thematically to magic. That mimicry can
lead directly to death, that sympathy issues in cessation (an insect
looking like the leaf it eats, and being pruned by a gardener or even
consumed by its fellows as a result) leads Caillois to speculate on the
importance of the law of contiguity:

insects move in a sticky world, extricating themselves from one
glutinous mass of characteristics after another. We respond to this with
fascination, in the strict sense of the word; fascination is the correct
response, for the result of magic is to freeze the victim, who is then
sacrificed, which, in the phagocentric cafeteria of the Coll&egrave;ge,
usually means eaten.

<P>
Insectkind suffers from "a real temptation by space" ("MLP," 28) in that
it offers multiple instances of the reorientation of the insect body
in such strict accordance with its environment that the insect body is
itself not merely drawn to that which resembles it, but finally freezes
into place as a conclusion of the environment.

Here instinct completes morphology: the <I>Kallima</I> places itself
symmetrically on a real leaf, the appendage on its hind wings in the
place that a real petiole would occupy; the <I>Oxydia</I> alights at
right angles to the end of a branch because the arrangement of the spot
representing the middle veining requires it; the <I>Clolia,</I> Brazilian
butterflies, position themselves in a row on small stalks in such a way
as to represent bell flowers . . . ["MLP," 27].

<P>
It is no longer redundant or doubled; it completes. This succumbing to
space is not limited to the insect world; Caillois goes on to examine
the "protective coverings" ("MLP," 28) fashioned by spider crabs, who
"collect on their shells the seaweed and polyps of the milieu in which
they live" ("MLP," 28). He quotes Eug&egrave;ne Louis Bouvier, who says
that for spider crabs "the disguise seems like an act of pure automatism,"
meaning that the <I>process</I> of augmentation is meaningful, and, as
with insects who engage in this form of augmentation, "the nature of the
bodies producing the contact is of little importance" ("MLP," 28). It
doesn't matter what you put on your shell, just that your shell has
things on it.

<P>
In the seemingly less leafy human world, Caillois concludes, we
find individuals who suffer from "legendary psychasthenia," in which
"the feeling of personality, considered as the organism's feeling of
distinction from its surroundings, of the connection between consciousness
and a particular point in space [is] . . . seriously undermined." ("MLP,"
28)

To these dispossessed souls, space seems to be a devouring force. Space
pursues them, encircles them, digests them in a gigantic phagocytosis. It
ends by replacing them. Then the body separates itself from thought, the
individual breaks the boundary of his skin and occupies the other side
of his senses. He tries to look at himself from any point whatever in
space. He feels himself becoming space. . . . He is similar, not similar
to something, but just <I>similar.</I> And he invents spaces of which
he is "the convulsive possession." ["MLP," 30]

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The possession here is entirely different from the oceanic feeling that
the Romantics described as available to those who climbed mountains
in order to survey and surrender to the horizon. That was sublime;
this is stasis. Caillois ends by noting that all mimicry works "in a
single direction: the animal mimics the plant, leaf, flower, or thorn,
and dissembles or ceases to perform its functions in relation to
others. <I>Life </I>

<B></B>

<I>takes a step backwards.</I>" ("MLP," 30) This may well be Caillois
playing Freud (if that's going backward); the debt to the 1920 <I>Beyond
the Pleasure Principle</I> is clear, if not noted: "alongside the instinct
of self-preservation, which in some way orients the creature toward life,
there is generally speaking a sort of <I>instinct of renunciation</I>
that orients it toward a mode of reduced existence, which in the end
would no longer know either consciousness or feeling--the <I>inertia of
the &eacute;lan vital,</I> so to speak." ("MLP," 32)

<P>
The muddy puddle of attributes in which Caillois's insects and psychotics
swim is homologous with what I have called cold modernism. Intellectuals
too re into the nexus of the bodies that dissemble by playing dead all
too effectively. He takes up the relationship between the intellectual's
renunciation of self and imitating the environment later in the 1939
"Sociologie du clerc" (Sociology of the intellectual), which is a response
to Julien Benda's 1927 <I>La Trahison des clercs</I> (The treason of
the intellectuals).
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 The treason in question for Benda is the betrayal of "the purely
 disinterested activity of the mind" in favor of the adoption of
 "political passions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 The modern "clerk" "is determined to have the soul of a citizen" and will
 "descend to the market place" along with the masses.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 For Caillois, the idea of treason is far more ambiguous. The job of the
 cleric is to efface himself completely; he is "not a man, but . . . an
 organism where his person disappears. . . . Because in eliminating
 himself the cleric makes room within himself for the Church."
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
 As Denis Hollier points out, such self-abnegation paradoxically results
 in the same thing as the pursuit of pleasure: the loss of the self's
 boundaries; "clerical ordination does not leave the subject in possession
 of himself any more than did the pleasure this ordination opposes."
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 Both positions are mechanized by the loss of self, the "pleasure in
 playing dead."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 These bugs and bodies are constructed to suit environmental
 pressures. They are extensions of locality, but their localities aren't
 at all specific or particularly meaningful: as in the world of the
 spider crab, it doesn't matter what you have on your carapace, just
 that your carapace mimics something local. The possibility of political
 and intellectual resistance from such a position is minimal. These
 bugs and these literary characters are not interested in explicit
 conflict (shooting someone in the back is aggressive, but it isn't
 confrontational); they are more or less artful collaborators. The
 prototype for these bodies is that of the insect, or more properly,
 the fantasy of the insect body.
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>

<P>
Most of the characters in the story I've been telling were fascinated by
insects. J&uuml;nger's entomological tendencies are well recorded; in
the epigraph above, he comments on his fascination and identification
with insects. Lewis owned and annotated a copy of John Lubbock's
<I>Ants, Bees, and Wasps: A Record of Observations on the Habits of
Social Hymenoptera;</I> he was also acquainted with the work of the
entomologist Henri Fabre, referring to him at the outset of <I>Snooty
Baronet,</I> and in two earlier pieces.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 It's quite likely that Lewis encountered Fabre in <I>The English
 Review,</I> which gave them both early exposure to English audiences,
 Lewis's first published short story, "The 'Pole,'" appeared there in
 May 1909; beginning in November 1912,

<B></B>

the <I>Review</I> published translations of extracts from Fabre's
ten-volume <I>Souveniers entomologiques</I> (Entomological memories)
that had "not yet appeared in England" alongside articles on August
Strindberg and poems by F. S. Flint.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 The first article, "The Weaving Spider: The Banded Epeira," promised "a
 series of six chapters from his 'epic of the insect world' . . . in the
 course of the next few months"; the series was apparently so successful
 that Fabre's articles on maggots and pond life appeared regularly for
 the next ten years, until 1922.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 Bug-hungry modernists didn't languish unfed that year, however, for Boni
 and Liveright commissioned a "rush order" from their translator, Ezra
 Pound, for Remy de Gourmont's <I>Physique de l'Amour;</I> <I>The Natural
 Philosophy of Love</I> came out in 1922, complete with a publisher's
 disclaimer for the American edition.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Although de Gourmont's work is devoted to the entire scope of the animal
 kingdom--his aim is to show "that the games of love, preludes, caresses,
 combats are in no way peculiar to the human race"--precedence is awarded
 to the insect, who receives more attention than do humans.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 While de Gourmont states that "on nearly all rungs of the animal ladder,
 . . . the male is the same, the female is the same" (<I>NP,</I> 127), the
 comparisons between species are often piquant because of the variations:
 "in the insect world the male is the frail elegant sex, gentle and sober,
 with no employment save to please or to love" (<I>NP,</I> 35). The most
 remarkable feature of insect society is the dominance of the female; most
 brutally put, "the male is an accident: the female would have sufficed"
 (<I>NP,</I> 60).
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 "[T]he social evolution of the insect has led to functional
 differentiations extremely complicated, and if not unknown, at least
 abnormal, to humanity. Bee society has the female for base, human
 society has the couple." (<I>NP,</I> 53) What these females <I>do</I> to
 these males is a subject of endless fascination for de Gourmont; <I>The
 Natural Philosophy of Love</I> provides wonderfully lurid descriptions
 of "headless nuptials" (<I>NP,</I> 126), the results of mating with "an
 ogress" (<I>NP,</I> 115): "cannibalism in sex" (<I>NP,</I> 120), and the
 economic advantages of "getting . . . both bed and board" simultaneously
 from your spouse (<I>NP,</I> 126); this latter is occasioned by observing
 the female mantis on her honeymoon. Devouring your partner "at both ends"
 (<I>NP,</I> 126) is simply the clarification of a slightly more woolly
 economy. De Gourmont was enough to sate even the most ravenous public
 for a while; between <I>The Natural Philosophy of Love</I> and <I>The
 Waste Land,</I> Boni and Liveright had the 1922 entomology/modernism
 market cornered.

<P>
The historical connection between modernism and the modern field of
entomology is at once striking and frustratingly suggestive. The surge in
the English appetite for books on bugs was concurrent with the period of
literary experimentation: from 1898 to 1900, 11 books were published in
England with the word "insect" or "insects" in the title; from 1901 to
1905, 8; but in the period 1906-1910, 23 books appeared; and from
1911 to 1915, 25; from 1916 to 1920, 22. The peak came in the period
1921-1925, with 29.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 While no one force determines the contours of public imagination
 (happily), the turn to insects, like the turn to artistic experiment,
 began just before World War I and developed immediately before and
 after the war too, as did modernist art. The English penchant for
 knowing more about insects, turning as

<B></B>

it did in the period from 1911 to 1915, is bound to the battlefield. The
public taste for entomology was not born with war--historically this does
not hold--but the militarization of British society was concurrent with
the fascination for culture's carapaces, for things with "the works on
the outside": French locomotives, insects, soldiers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>

<P>
Modernism's orchestration of the embrace of insects and the machine
was evident to Pound. While his speculation in the postscript to <I>The
Natural Philosophy of Love</I> that the brain is a "sort of great clot
of genital fluid"
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 is notorious, the more important statement there may be rather his
 explicit connection of the human world and that of the hymenoptera:
 "In his growing subservience to, and adoration of, and entanglement in
 machines, in utility, man rounds the circle almost into insect life."
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 Pound sees the connection between entomology and the machine age,
 between bugs and Vorticism. What qualifies as a machine? The biomorphic
 technologies of the Futurists looked to the Vorticists like objects
 of worship, mediterranean Romanticism recast with a tinny glaze. The
 notion of utility was lost beneath idolatry; <I>Blast</I> called this
 "Automobilism" and dealt with the depiction of cars in the Italians'
 paintings by simply noting that "Motor cars go quickly."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 That is, the simple fact of the machine is its use value. Pound's remark
 is certainly ambivalent, and in this speaks directly to one aspect of
 what was compelling about the imagination of a homology between man
 and insect: the idea of absolute performance, of total utility. How
 attractive the insect world must be to a culture in which the bodies
 of its young have returned harmed, only distantly recognizable as
 human. That the recycling of Fabre in the pages of <I>The English
 Review</I> continued beyond its initial projection of several months
 is explicable in light of the war. The insect body becomes nature's
 attempt at prosthesis. Ants, bees, and wasps don't bruise.

<P>
Prosthesis is at the heart of cold modernism, and in mimicry we have
the heart of the insect world, and its fascination for modernists.
<SUP><a NAME="REF63" HREF="#FOOT63">63</a></SUP>
 Mimicry embodies the prosthetic relationship to the environment: it
 extends the self beyond the mere body's "nature." It is the total
 mobilization of the self, which becomes so thoroughly jointed into
 another horizon that it disappears. While the fascist body is a forgery,
 the insect body comports itself as counterfeit. The praying mantis,
 J&uuml;nger's glass bees,
<SUP><a NAME="REF64" HREF="#FOOT64">64</a></SUP>
 Lewis's "demented arthropod:"
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
 all emerge from a space where "there is no background, only intersecting
 planes where . . . the manner of intersection is violently rendered."
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 The prosthetic imagination is inherently violent, born as it was on the
 battlefield, and built as it is from the mere body's amputation. When
 the wound has cooled the machine can begin.

Andreas Huyssen, for example, states that "J&uuml;nger is no modernist"
("Fortifying the Heart--Totally: Ernst J&uuml;nger's Armored Texts,"
<I>New German Critique</I> 59 [spring-summer 1993]: 5). His argument
is wonderfully argued if, alas, wrong. Huyssen states,

<BLOCKQUOTE>

If modernist writing is consistent experimentation in the search of a
new language, the invention of new modes of narrating, the aesthetic
articulation of the conditions of representation within representation
itself, then J&uuml;nger with his often pretentious overwriting, murky
and pompous philosophizing, and persistent lapses into the jargon of
the officer's mess is a highly defective stylist, often closer to the
late 19th-century B-literature than to Flaubert, Baudelaire, or Kafka. [7]

Certainly J&uuml;nger's ties to nineteenth-century literature are
strong, perhaps lamentably so. But one of the things Huyssen fails to
take into account (or perhaps is explicitly opposed to), is the existence
of a B-class modernism. That is, just because J&uuml;nger's writing is
frequently--let's not be shy here--terrible doesn't mean it isn't deeply
rooted in modernist imperatives.

The writer D. B. Wyndham Lewis and our Wyndham Lewis at times received
each other's mail; the Lewis collection at Texas contains a 1927
letter from D. B. Wyndham Lewis in response to a letter sent him by the
British Sexological Society, forwarded to our Lewis; "I very much fear
you are mistaking me for my namesake the artist." He adds in a note,
"quite understandably, of course." (Wyndham Lewis Papers, Harry Ransom
Humanities Research Center, University of Texas, Austin)

Lisa Tickner points out that one of Lewis's seminal paintings,
<I>Kermesse,</I> is now lost after its owner, one (Richard) Wyndham
became so irritated that another Wyndham (Lewis) had copied him, and
copied him badly--or at least satirically--into a book about the failure
of mimesis, <I>The Apes of God;</I> the first Wyndham was so irritated
at the misrecognition that he sold the painting. Fortunately, several
fraternal twins of the painting survive in the forms of studies; one of
them is on the cover of this issue. See Lisa Tickner, "The Popular Culture
of <I>Kermesse:</I> Lewis, Painting, and Performance, 1912-13," in
this issue.

Given that Caillois takes a quick jab at the relationship between
the field of scientific inquiry and the body of the professional as it
occupies that field ("for science everything is milieu" ["MLP," 28]), it
is worth noting that this description, Caillois tells us in a note, is
drawn from observations he made himself during a "deliberately aggravated"
attack brought on "for purposes of ascesis and interpretation" ("MLP,"
30). That is, we see Caillois's own body disappearing into the verdure
of the sociological field, or more properly, we see him displaying his
own invisibility. Whether we choose to notice (and beyond that, whether,
having noticed, we believe he is gone) depends on where we stand in
regard to the Coll&egrave;ge de Sociologie, or less locally and more
interestingly, to professionalism.

"[T]he <I>screw-tape</I> Lewis," C. S. Lewis, writes in his autobiography
that his childhood was close to perfect, with the sole exception of
having bad dreams:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
My bad dreams were of two kinds, those about specters and those about
insects. The second were, beyond comparison, the worse; to this day
I would rather meet a ghost than a tarantula. . . . As Owen Barfield
once said to me, "The trouble about insects is that they are like
French locomotives--they have all the works on the outside." <I>The
works</I>--that is the trouble. Their angular limbs, their jerky
movements, their dry, metallic noises, all suggest either machines that
have come to life or life degenerating into mechanism. You may add that
in the hive and the anthill we see fully realized the two things that some
of us most dread for our own species--the dominance of the female and the
dominance of the collective. . . . Much later, in my teens, from reading
Lubbock's <I>Ants, Bees and Wasps,</I> I developed for a short time a
genuinely scientific interest in insects. Other studies soon crowded it
out; but while my entomological period lasted my fear almost vanished,
and I am inclined to think a real objective curiosity will usually have
this cleansing effect. [C. S. Lewis, <I>Suprised By Joy: The Shape of
My Early Life</I> (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1955), 8-9]

<P>
Both Lewises, then, read Lubbock. If C. S. Lewis is one of Wyndham Lewis's
evil twins, he is so by virtue of being the "good" Lewis, the one who
was put off by insects. This might be read as their differing opinions
as to the possibility for successful conversion: other hymenopterous
variations in their respective oeuvres include angels; both wrote
theological science-fiction trilogies (C. S.'s <I>Perelandra;</I>
Wyndham's <I>Human Age</I>).

The translation led to a contract between Pound and the publishers, who
advanced him five hundred dollars a year for his services. The books
were chosen by Horace Liveright, and Pound was free to reject any book
if he so chose. Under this agreement, Pound translated the de Gourmont
and &Eacute;douard Estauni&eacute;'s <I>L'Appel de la route</I> 
as <I>The Call of the Road</I> , the dust jacket of which gives
the translator's name as Hiram Janus; the two-faced Janus had conflicting
feelings about the commission, given that neither Pound's nor Janus's name
appeared on the volume itself, presumably in accordance with the rights
of the translator not to sign his name to any work he deemed (so read
the contract) "a disgrace to humanity or too imbecile to be known." (See
Donald Gallup, <I>Ezra Pound: A Bibliography</I> [Charlottesville:
University of Virginia Press, 1983], 35; and Humphrey Carpenter, <I>A
Serious Character: The Life of Ezra Pound</I> [Boston: Houghton Mifflin
Company, 1988], 385. Carpenter however errs on two points, stating
that <I>The Natural Philosophy of Love</I> was commissioned under this
contract and that Pound "could reject anything he did not like" [385]. The
contract was drawn up on 4 January 1922, following the completion of
the de Gourmont translation; and there is no mention in the contract of
the translator rejecting a commission, merely of his having the right to
remain anonymous.) The fact that the publishers, rather than Pound, chose
the de Gourmont further emphasizes the marketability--the availability--of
insects to the public imagination in the early part of this century.

It is important to note that a wide variety of modernists have been
fascinated with mimicry--witness T. S. Eliot's calling his poem "He
Do the Police in Different Voices" before Pound, as authorized Possum
impressionist, ventriloquized a new title; and Zora Neale Hurston stating
that "the art of mimicry is better developed in the Negro than in other
racial groups" (Zora Neale Hurston, "Characteristics of Negro Expression,"
in <I>The Sanctified Church</I> [Berkeley: Turtle Island Foundation,
1981], 60). Thank you to Robert von Hallberg for making this point.

Ernst J&uuml;nger's novel <I>Gl&auml;serne Bienen</I> , available in
English as <I>The Glass Bees,</I> trans. Louise Bogan and Elizabeth Mayer
(New York: Noonday Press, 1991), was written too late to fall within the
historical scope of this essay, but, given its author, is not surprisingly
an almost made-to-order collaboration of soldierly aesthetics, entomology,
mimicry, and prosthetics. The eponymous objects are transparent automata,
larger than the average bee, and far more efficient, if difficult to
locate; indeed, the hives themselves are transparent, and only the
glitter of glass in sun gives them away. These "glass collectives"
 are manufactured by an "invisible master" , Giacomo Zapparoni,
who also heads a movie studio. The studio specializes in manufacturing
robots, rather than housing human actors; these machines include not
only extraordinarily attractive simulacra of human movie stars, but also
"fantastic creatures" such as "an Angel of the Annunciation through whose
transparent body and wings the surrounding objects could be seen." 
The connection between amputation, technology, and the insect is explicit,
as the narrator muses on improvements he can make to the glass bees:
