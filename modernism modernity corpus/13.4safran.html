<p id="lead">At the beginning of the twentieth century, European artists created works evincing their fascination with what they called the "tribal" or the "primitive," a trend that has been studied thoroughly by art historians over the past few decades.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  While primitivism has been seen primarily as an art historical category, modernist writers were also inspired by the ideal of the primitive, which they associated with vitality and energy, as opposed to what they considered to be the decadence and decay of their own world. They found examples of the primitive in distant places such as Africa and Polynesia and in the distant past of their own or other nations, and they reached out to it in various ways in their writing. In this paper, I consider the paradoxical status of the Jews in regard to literary primitivism. On the one hand, they might be seen as an ancient people, identified with the past of the Hebrew Bible, or as an Eastern people, preserving a mystical religion (Hasidism) and a patriarchal way of life in their <i>shtetlakh</i>.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  On the other, they might be imagined as the consummate moderns, ably adapting to the capitalist system and fully at home in urban space.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  How did Jewish writers grapple with this conundrum in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century? In confronting it, did they create a specifically Jewish form of modernism?<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  I respond to these questions by examining the writings of and the myths surrounding a Russian and Yiddish writer, revolutionary, and ethnographer, S. An-sky (Shloyme-Zanvl Rappoport, 1863&#x2013;1920), author of the play <i>The Dybbuk </i>, the cornerstone of the modern Hebrew and Yiddish theatrical repertoires. This endeavor involves shifting the geographic focus from the art of Western Europe to the Russian empire 

<b></b>

 (and, as a counterexample, the United States), where both the Jews and modernism developed along distinct paths. </p>

<p>Literary criticism on primitivism has developed in recent years and conflicting arguments have emerged about it. Some scholars focus on the political implications of representations of colonized peoples by writers from colonial powers, while others counter the postcolonial critique with the insistence that modernist writers inevitably represent the West as well as the exotic other as "a play of projections, doublings, idealizings, and rejections of a complex, shifting otherness."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  In the view of Marjorie Perloff, "It is the essence of modernism &#x2026; that it encodes the uncertainties of [the dialogical nature of the ethnographic encounter] at the heart of its procedural self-consciousness."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  That is, Perloff argues that modernist writers were deeply concerned with the contradictions produced by their own self-representations vis-&#x00E0;-vis the primitive subject.  </p>

<p>In her nuanced revision of the critical debate around modernist primitivism, Perloff cites Russian examples (Gumilev, Akhmatova), and her conclusions are particularly germane for the Russian context. In the Russian Empire and Eastern Europe&#x2014;as in the United States&#x2014;modernist writers were consumed by issues of national identity. Slavic modernists worked to re-anchor that identity in folklore and depictions of the local primitive. Stylization&#x2014;or, as Alexander Ogden points out, the slightly different Russian term, <i>stilizatsiia</i>, meaning "the purposeful reproduction of <i>someone else's style</i> as a defined aesthetic and ideological position in a new artistic context"<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> &#x2014;was an important tactic for the Russian modernists, who refashioned their poems and prose, and often even their speech and dress, after now one, now another model chosen from other times and places.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  The sense that life was like text and could be refashioned according to aesthetic criteria typified the era. The literary historian Alexander Lavrov notes that the "most characteristic feature of the Symbolist attitude toward reality" was "to perceive the world as a quasi-artistic phenomenon, to attribute to reality the qualities of an artistic text."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  The Russian modernists were not, in fact, doing anything new in imitating peasant styles of speech and behavior; after all, the realist or naturalist writers of the generation before had done so as well. As Ogden observes, the notion of an elite borrowing folkways evokes many images in the Russian context:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Slavophiles mimicking peasant dress, the mindset of the 'repentant nobleman' articulated by Nikolai Mikhailovskii, Alexander Blok's bowing down at the height of his celebrity before an unknown peasant writer (Nikolai Kliuev), and the <i>ukhod</i> (departure) to join the narod [folk] on the part of Aleksandr Dobroliubov, Leonid Semonov, or Lev Tolstoi himself.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Among the many examples of literary stylization in Russia, primitivism developed most strongly in the years from 1908 to 1913 among Futurist writers and painters. Futurist theorists such as Alexander Shevchenko and Natalya Goncharova were troubled by the thought that in turning toward the primitive, they might be imitating Western European artists, and they sought to claim native, "Eastern" sources. Goncharova asserted, "Now I shake the dust from my feet and leave the West, considering its vulgarizing significance trivial and insignificant&#x2014;my path is toward the source of all arts, the East."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  The Futurists defined the art of the "East" broadly, from Slavic village culture 

<b></b>

 to the mysterious, ancient "stone women" that dot the steppes to the native cultures of Siberia, with particular interest in the shamanistic art and rituals of the Buryats and other peoples.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Their works typify the fascination of Russian modernists with Siberia, drawing on a number of tendencies in the Russian cultural imagination. The lure of Siberia was particularly strong in the early 1910s, precisely when An-sky was writing his first, Russian drafts of <i>The Dybbuk</i>.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>   </p>

<p>It is not surprising that when Jewish writers such as An-sky began writing fiction in Russian, they, like the Russian writers on whom they modeled themselves, experimented with primitivist stylization. The best-known example of this is Isaac Babel, whose <i>Red Cavalry Stories</i> chronicle precisely a Jewish Red Army officer's attempts to stylize his speech and behavior on the model of the Cossacks with whom he worked. But more than the Futurists, more than Mikhailovsky, Blok, Tolstoy, or Dobroliubov, Babel drenched his primitivism in irony, pausing repeatedly to gesture toward the absurdity and improbability of his narrator's efforts at self-refashioning.  </p>

<p>Both Babel's primitivism and his irony resemble those of the Jewish writers at the other margin of Europe, American Jews who experimented with American Indian images. American Jewish writers in English and Yiddish, from Nathanael West and Henry Roth to the Russian-born Abraham Cahan and An-sky's friend Chaim Zhitlowsky, juxtaposed images of native American clothing, songs, bodies, rituals to images of Jewish clothing, songs, bodies, and rituals. The poet Yehoash translated Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's faux epic <i>Hiawatha</i> into Yiddish, and Zhitlowsky wrote a preface in which he defended the project of translation from European languages into Yiddish in general and argued for the significance of <i>Hiawatha</i> in particular, as a way to give the Jewish reader access to nature, "general-human poetry," and empathy for all humanity.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Alan Trachtenberg, in a book on the functions of <i>Hiawatha</i> in American culture, notes that American Jews used this particular mock-Indian poem to imagine themselves differently.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  As Rachel Rubinstein points out, Native Americans could function "as a flexible, unfixed signifier that could address, embody or challenge certain ideas of what it meant to be both a modern and a native American. &#x2026; [Through] the binding together, against the grain, of Indian and Jew, [Jewish American writers] could imaginatively inhabit the bodies both of Indians and aspirers to Indianness, both natives and aliens, primitives and moderns."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  Fully recognizing the attendant paradoxes, they "engaged in a conversation about the possibilities for a modern, national literature."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  Such writers exemplify the modernist irony about the primitive that Perloff describes. Rubinstein reads the interest of American Jewish writers in Native Americans&#x2014;particularly the decision of the editors of the Yiddish literary periodical <i>Shriftn</i> (first published in 1912 and associated with the modernist poetry group, Di Yunge) to include Yiddish translations of Indian chants&#x2014;as on the one hand a way of participating in a general American modernist use of Native American images and on the other a way to challenge that modernism's assumption that Jews could not belong to a truly native-based American literature. She sees <i>Shriftn</i> as attempting "to initiate a kind of literary dialogue with a young American avant-garde whose purview seemed to leave them out, and which wasn't talking back."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>I now turn to the ways in which An-sky himself and his memoirists engaged in a similar kind of dialogue by linking up images of Jews with images of another primitivist fascination, the peoples of Siberia.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  An-sky's most overtly primitivist text is his signature work, <i>The Dybbuk</i>. The question of whether or not <i>The Dybbuk</i> is a modernist play mattered for its first critics. A drama set in a shtetl, it has been seen as evidence of the cultural maturation of the Jews of Eastern Europe, in spite of its plot that valorizes the past over the present. To summarize it, the hero Khonen and heroine Leah were promised to each other in marriage before their birth, but after Khonen is orphaned, Leah's wealthy father forgets his promise and seeks a well-off groom for his daughter. The young couple yearns for each other, and after Khonen dies, his soul possesses the body of his beloved; she speaks in his voice&#x2014;but also, it seems, for herself&#x2014;in rejecting the groom her father has chosen. A mysterious "Messenger" appears at key points in the play to explain the mystic significance of what has occurred. Khonen and Leah's rebellion against the father is also a revolt against the centrality of money and for an older set of values. Written first in Russian between 1913 and 1919 and produced after An-sky's death in Yiddish in 1920 by the Vilna Trupe in Poland and in 1922 in Haim Nahman Bialik's Hebrew translation by the Habima theater in Soviet Russia, this play demonstrated that theater in Jewish languages and on Jewish themes could appeal to enthusiastic audiences, Jewish and non-Jewish, religious and secular, high-, middle-, and low-brow.  </p>

<p>Seth Wolitz argues that <i>The Dybbuk</i> appeared so satisfyingly up-to-date in the 1920s because it offered a Jewish-themed example of the theatrical trends of the era, in particular the mystical, Symbolist theater of Maurice Maeterlinck and Richard Wagner.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  In St. Petersburg in the first decades of the twentieth century, as An-sky drafted the play, Maeterlinck's <i>Pell&#x00E9;as et M&#x00E9;lisande</i> was performed in a new translation by the Symbolist poet Valery Briusov; Stanislavsky's student Vsevolod Meierkhol'd staged Wagner's <i>Tristan und Isolde</i> at the Mariinsky theater; and An-sky's friend Fedor Sologub wrote mystical, folkloric plays about love and death. An-sky reported that when Stanislavsky read <i>The Dybbuk</i> for the Moscow Art Theater, he praised precisely its mysticism as "more original than the mysticism of Maeterlinck," and Sologub saw An-sky's play as a new, "true and unique form of theatrical mystery play."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  It seems logical to understand An-sky as deliberately fashioning a Jewish theatrical modernism, plugging Jewish folkloric images into a format he admired on the Petersburg stage, following Sologub, Maeterlinck, and Stanislavsky in trying to turn the theater into a quasi-religious experience and a mystical portal to other worlds. The Russian Symbolists, the dominant modernist school in Russia in the first decade of the twentieth century, believed that art should play this mystical function, and an excess of this kind of trendy mysticism was precisely the critique that Zionist writers leveled against An-sky's play at a mock trial in Palestine in 1926.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>   </p>

<p>However, this view of <i>The Dybbuk</i> contradicts much of what we know about An-sky himself. A one-time prot&#x00E9;g&#x00E9; of the Populist writer Gleb Uspensky, An-sky retained the Russian Populist suspicion of art-for-art's-sake; he consistently advocated realist literature and theater that would improve the lives of the masses, rather than simply 

<b></b>

 entertaining urban elites (such as the Symbolists and their circles).<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  He himself seemed to find it difficult to reconcile his artistic politics with the fashionable mysticism that readers found in <i>The Dybbuk</i>. Even as he happily repeated Stanislavsky and Sologub's praise, he wrote to the brilliant, unpredictable intellectual Zhitlowsky, that he had not set out to write a mystical play.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>My play, needless to say, is a realist drama about mystics. Its only non-realist element is the Messenger, not Leah's dialogue or visions. I've deliberately limned the Messenger with mystical features. Actually, he was not in my original version. It was Stanislavsky who advised or rather told me to add him, and I thereby automatically broadened my original conception, adding a higher level beyond the theme of the 'lovely and pleasant.'<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Although he admitted that in taking Stanislavsky's suggestion, he gave his play a mystical level, An-sky was skeptical that the play as a whole was the sort of mystic drama the Symbolists created. As he argues, he believed that <i>The Dybbuk</i> was fundamentally realist, with all the <i>engag&#x00E9;</i> political implications of that category in Russia.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>   </p>

<p>An-sky's letter to Zhitlowsky makes it difficult to categorize his play as modernist based on its Symbolism and mysticism. Thus I propose understanding his modernism as primarily primitivist, and thinking about the meanings that adhered in An-sky's time to the identification of Jews with a primitive people, specifically with Siberian natives. In An-sky's conversations, essays, and experiences over his adult life, he returned to images of Siberia and Siberian peoples, each with its own set of meanings: Nietzschean, pedagogic, imperialist, and revolutionary. After surveying An-sky's Siberian encounters, I consider <i>The Dybbuk</i> as a stylized, "Siberianized" representation of Jewish culture, before concluding with a late essay where An-sky questions the value of the primitive fantasy&#x2014;whether for Jews or anyone else. In the process, I hope to offer a new and nuanced picture of Jewish modernism.  </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
Shashkov
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Let us begin with a depiction of An-sky himself as a Jew refashioned into a Siberian native. In a memoir set in the early 1890s, two decades before An-sky began to write <i>The Dybbuk</i>, Zhitlowsky recalls a discussion of his own ideas about a renewal of Jewish mass culture by means of folk culture.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Zhitlowsky portrays An-sky as fascinated by this nationalist dream and tentatively sympathetic to it, able to appreciate it in an aesthetic sense even though he could not commit himself to it ideologically. According to Zhitlowsky, An-sky said that if he ever did decide "to return to the Jewish people," he would do it "completely (&#x2026;) like Shashkov." This statement stimulates Zhitlowsky to a meditation on Siberian primitivism and its implications for modern Jews. Shashkov, Zhitlowsky explains, was a Siberian writer, "a Yakut or Buryat or from some other half-wild tribe in wide Siberia." He enjoyed a successful literary career in St. Petersburg, but suddenly "left the heights of civilized life and returned to his Yakuts or Buryats in Siberia and became 'savage' again with them. Together with them he got drunk, in yurts, 

<b></b>

 together they cried out their folksongs in voices that seemed possessed. He even threw off his European clothes and went around, like his brothers, overgrown and dirty. 'He became Buryat (or Yakut), once and for all.'<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  &#x2026; European civilization &#x2026; was just an outer coat of lacquer, while inside he remained the same wild Buryat." </p>

<p>Zhitlowsky then offers three explanations for Shashkov's (and, implicitly, An-sky's) return to folk culture. One is that people are uneducable. He offers as proof first a Talmudic line ("No matter how you throw the stick, it will land on its root"<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup> ) and then a Russian proverb ("No matter how much you feed the wolf, he still looks back at the forest"<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup> ). That is, no matter how thoroughly a non-Russian masters the outward forms of Russian culture, he can never become Russian. The flaw is not in Russian culture, but rather in its student, who can never eradicate the desire to return to the "forest" of his native culture, even though its inferiority may be obvious. Zhitlowsky's second explanation shifts the blame to Russian culture. Although the Shashkov he describes had once imagined Russian culture as superior to Buryat (or Yakut) culture, he then realizes that "the forms of civilized life are quite insignificant surface things, that the heart of humanness can be better attained when one allows oneself to fall into the mysterious depths of one's own soul and when one molds oneself mystically there with the world-spirit that prevails in it." By returning to his Buryat (or Yakut) ways, savage though they might seem to an outsider, Shashkov could get at something that Russians, with their sophistication, could never attain; it follows that An-sky, with his return to the Jewish folk, could do the same thing. In his third reading of the story, Zhitlowsky derives an ethical imperative. The most important thing, he asserts, is not mastery of a Western culture, but rather "compassion and love" for one's own people. Shashkov&#x2014;and by extension An-sky and any other subaltern intellectual&#x2014;should choose to go back to the people of his origin, rather than remaining in the metropolis and aping the ruling classes. This return, Zhitlowsky suggests, is a mystical act, a key into "mysterious depths." At the end of the anecdote, Zhitlowsky abruptly switches genres, turning An-sky from a repentant son into a passionate lover:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Perhaps love for his own people had risen in him to the level that is sung about in the wonderful Yiddish song, 'Tell me, you beautiful girl' [Zog mir, du sheyn meydele], where the lover is ready to take on the most difficult things for his beloved, 'So long as I can be together with you' [Abi mit dir ineynem zayn]? Let it be wild, let it be dirty, let it stink, 'So long as I can be together with you.' &#x2026; His remark &#x2026; that he would return 'like Shashkov' meant, therefore, that he would cleave to the Jewish people entirely, in his practices and his beliefs, no matter what they consisted of, no matter how far they might be from our own ideas about progressive human life: 'So long as I can be together with you.'<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Zhitlowsky's metaphors merit further investigation, as do his facts. His inability to distinguish between Buryats (a largely Buddhist people in Southeastern Siberia) and Yakuts (a mostly shamanistic people far away in Northeastern Siberia) suggests that his information might not be reliable. And indeed, the real Serafim Serafimovich Shashkov (1841&#x2013;1882) was a writer from Irkutsk who published in liberal journals in St. Petersburg but had trouble making a living. He went back to Siberia to teach and 

<b></b>

 lecture, returned to St. Petersburg, was exiled to Shenkursk (near the Arctic Circle), and died there of tuberculosis. As his name and patronymic suggest, he was neither Buryat nor Yakut but ethnically Russian, the son of a Russian Orthodox priest.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Zhitlowsky (or An-sky in their conversation) may have confused Shashkov himself with characters from Shashkov's writings. In a historical essay, Shashkov described the fates of two Siberian intellectuals, the Buryat Dordzhi Bandzarov and the Kirghiz Sultan Chekkan-Chinghisovich Valikhanov:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Bandzarov, when he went to Irkutsk, began to associate in a friendlier and friendlier way with ignorant and dirty lamas, whom he had earlier despised, he practically converted back to Buddhism, although he had not formerly been a believer, he began to drink, and he drank himself to death! &#x2026; Meanwhile, Valikhanov &#x2026; contracted tuberculosis and was obligated to go to the steppe, where tuberculosis killed him. This was the fate of the two Siberian natives who were the only ones to receive a European education!<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Unlike the real Shashkov, who finds the fate of Bandzarov and Valikhanov tragic, Zhitlowsky discovers inspiration and beauty in the story of return to the Far East. His metaphor of An-sky (or "Shashkov") as the prodigal son, diving back into the yurt, echoes not just the Russian fashion for Siberian mysticism and shamanism and the broader European enthusiasm for Nietzschean self-re-creation, but the specifically Russian Symbolist admiration of a person who rejects ordinary bourgeois behavior for an entirely new way of acting.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Zhitlowsky's characterization of An-sky as a Jewish Shashkov falls short as fact, fundamentally based as it is on a case of mistaken identity, but it offers significant evidence about the meaning of the connection between Siberian and Jewish images. Zhitlowsky's memoir of his friend&#x2014;written in the United States in the 1930s&#x2014;indicates that when he sought out metaphors for a situation in which an acculturated Jew such as An-sky "returns" to the folk by, among other achievements, writing a popular play on folk themes, he found Siberian images ready and waiting. His use of them demonstrates that just as American Jewish modernist writers were drawn to experiment with identifying American Jews and Native Americans, so it seemed to make sense to identify Russian Jews with Siberian natives, in the service of a modernist project. Zhitlowsky's Siberian primitivism here recalls the ideology of the critics of <i>The Dybbuk,</i> who sought in the exotic a mystic access to other worlds. </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
"Eskimos" in Bordeaux
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>The Buryat (or Yakut) who Zhitlowsky describes joyously tearing off his Western clothes, running back into his yurt, drinking, dancing, and singing wild songs with his Siberian brothers, is evidently a fantasy. But in his ecstatic prose poem identifying the Siberian primitive with a renewed Jewish identity, Zhitlowsky touched on questions that were crucial for An-sky during a formative period in his life, the eight years (1892&#x2013;1900) that he spent in Paris. There An-sky encountered and produced Siberian images with meanings quite different from those Zhitlowsky found&#x2014;meanings related to science, empire, and radical utopia. An-sky worked in Paris as a journalist, literary agent, revolutionary 

<b></b>

 activist, and the private secretary of Petr Lavrov, a Populist theorist and the <i>eminence grise</i> of the radical Russian emigration. Through Lavrov, he met Grigory Nikolaevich Potanin, the best known Siberian writer, explorer, and ethnographer of his time, in Paris to research connections between European literature and Siberian epics. Potanin was a Siberian regionalist, a cultural and political radical who wanted to increase Siberian autonomy and to that end studied native Siberian peoples, wrote about them, and worked to exhibit their cultures.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Soon after they met, Potanin began to share An-sky's small apartment, and long after Potanin had returned to Russia, An-sky hosted his Siberian friends.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  </p>

<p>As an intimate of Potanin's, An-sky was an attentive observer of displays of circumpolar cultures. In Bordeaux in 1900, he found himself at a seedy nightclub, where he was surprised to see what he at first took to be fellow subjects of the Russian Tsar: "Eskimos, men and women in their furs, sat and attentively watched the play." He tried to speak to them in Russian, but they did not understand, nor did they respond to the obscenities of some French guests.  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>They looked [at us] naively and calmly and smiled good-naturedly, understanding nothing. These simple, na&#x00EF;ve faces seemed so good, pure, and sweet next to the soiled faces of the representatives of a higher race and the painted faces of the women. How did they get here? I asked a man who was speaking to them. It turned out that it was he who brought them from Labrador for "shows." He had brought a "whole village" of men, women, and children, 26 people in all. He was also transporting a few dozen American Indians. He had been with them in England, Germany, Austria, and now had come to France. Along with the Eskimos he brought their dogs, yurts, all their poor equipment. So in the garden they had set up a whole Eskimo village rather nicely. During the day the Eskimos give performances, ski, hunt seals, play with balls, shy small coins with whips. The Indians lasso wild horses, sing, and so on. All of this is very poor, very pitiable, and finally offensively cruel.</p>
<p>The entrepreneur, who turned out in conversation to be a serious person, complained that in France there was less interest in these people than anywhere else.</p>
<p>"You see, that's all they care about. They speak to them in obscenities, they bother the women. In Germany there was much more interest. Scholars, anthropologists looked at them with a lot of interest. &#x2026; &#x2026;</p>
<p>"They don't suffer from the heat too much?"</p>
<p>"Terribly. It's sad to watch. Two already died &#x2026; and their bodies were sent back to Labrador. That was the agreement. &#x2026; You know, they're like children, they don't understand what's going on around them, but they are very wise, calm, kind, and warm-hearted. They are dying out. Now there are only 3,000 of them. There are only 2,000 words in their language. But they have learned how to speak. But they are confusing English and French words. You see that girl over there?" He pointed at a three-year-old girl. "She is the daughter of a French officer and an Eskimo woman. A remarkably talented and intelligent child."</p>
<p>It was hard to see all of this.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup></p>

<p class="continued">These "Eskimos"&#x2014;presumably Labrador Inuits from Eastern Canada&#x2014;may have had some distant connection to Siberia: archeologists believe that their ancestors immigrated to North America from Asia.

  </p>

<p>An-sky's reactions to the exhibition of Labrador Inuits in Bordeaux display the differences between his and Zhitlowsky's attitudes toward the primitive. On the one hand, An-sky's words recall Zhitlowsky's ecstatic appreciation of "Shashkov." He presents the Inuits as virtuous precisely by contrast with the French: their faces seemed "so good, pure, and sweet next to the soiled faces of the representatives of a higher race and the painted faces of the women." This sounds like the ideal Zhitlowsky identified with An-sky himself, the fantasy of a Western intellectual who decides to abandon degenerate modern culture to return to an idealized folk. On the other hand, An-sky does not simply admire the Inuits' "naivet&#x00E9;" and stop there, as Zhitlowsky uncritically relayed the improbable story of "Shashkov." Rather, he inquires into the circumstances that brought the Inuits to Bordeaux, the difficult physical conditions under which they lived, their suffering from the heat, and pronounces it all "very poor, very pitiable, and finally offensively cruel." He notes that the Inuits' shows do not even succeed as education: the audience is unmoved by and uninterested in their songs and hunting techniques. Whereas both An-sky and Zhitlowsky described the contrast between what they saw as Western decadence and primitive purity, An-sky's focus on the flaws of the potentially pedagogic encounter between Frenchmen and Inuits complicates the picture and suggests that An-sky's primitivism was more nuanced. Rather than imagining that display or knowledge of a primitive group could simply infuse energy and purity into a decadent Western culture, An-sky was intrigued by the ways in which that encounter turned out to be abortive or blocked. Tellingly, unlike Zhitlowsky who confused Buryats, Yakuts, and the real Shashkov, An-sky quickly noted his own mistake in confusing the Labrador Inuits with Eskimos from the Russian Empire. As in his other writings, An-sky avoided oversimplification and expressed ambivalence about the dichotomy of primitive versus degenerate (he also questioned his era's certainty that French culture was degenerate).<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  </p>

<p>It is not surprising that An-sky wrote with such interest about the effectiveness of ethnographic exhibits. The Russian &#x00E9;migr&#x00E9; community in which he lived was composed largely of students or would-be students, many, like An-sky, fascinated by the social sciences and especially by the radical theory of the time.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  An-sky observed the founding of the International Institute of Sociology by R&#x00E9;n&#x00E9; Worms in 1894 and was close to one of the participants, M. M. Kovalevsky, a Russian historian and jurist who had publicly criticized the tsar and been forbidden to continue teaching in Russia.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  An-sky himself worked among Russian social scientists in the Russian pavilion at the 1900 Paris World's Fair.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  His memoirs indicate that this exhibit involved cooperation between antagonistic forces: the Tsarist government, anxious to display the Empire's economic and political strength as impressively as possible, and the radical &#x00E9;migr&#x00E9; community (on whom the Russian secret police kept strict tabs) that apparently staffed the exhibit. </p>

<p>This exhibit, so big that it was housed not on the rue des Nations but at the Trocad&#x00E9;ro, contrasts intriguingly with the display of Inuits at the nightclub in Bordeaux. Although the Bordeaux entrepreneur had few resources beyond the bodies of his captives and the Trocad&#x00E9;ro exhibitors could draw on the fabled riches of the tsars, both conceived of the far Northeast as the proper subject of display. The Russian pavilion included 

<b></b>

 architectural elements meant to evoke the Southern and Eastern edges of the Empire (a Turkish kiosk, a pagoda). At the pavilion of Asiatic Russia, visitors sat in a train car meant to represent the Trans-Siberian Railroad, which was under construction since 1891 (it would be completed in 1905). Using something like a form of early cinema, painted scenes of the Caucasus, the steppes, and Siberia passed in front of the windows. A visitor remembered, "We crossed great rivers dotted with floating logs, traversed huge forests of pine and larch, sped through vast deserts strewn with Mongol tombs." At the end a Chinese boy served jasmine tea and shouted, "Peking!"<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  The impressive display of Siberian landscapes at the World's Fair recalls the sad performances of the Labrador Inuits in Bordeaux: In both cases, An-sky was part of a crowd that witnessed the mobilization of images of the north in the service of a kind of cultural pedagogy. While the Bordeaux display endeavored to attract interest in the residents of the polar region (not, as An-sky complained, all that effectively), the World's Fair pavilion displayed northern landscapes with the evident goal of impressing the viewer with the physical vastness and natural resources of the Empire. </p>

<p>Whereas the display of a circumpolar people represented science or education for the Bordeaux entrepreneur and the display of northern landscape represented power at the World's Fair, for the sociologists in An-sky's own circles, Siberia stood for the questions at the heart of the <i>Dybbuk's</i> plot: marriage, family structure, and the tension between old and new ways of life.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  The Siberian landscapes that rolled past the train windows at the Russian pavilion depicted an area rich in resources but unpopulated; the imperial painters neglected to picture the native peoples of Siberia or the many colonists who had arrived from Russia. Least of all did they care to represent the residents of Siberia who had the most in common with An-sky: the political exiles. Following the assassination of Tsar Alexander II in 1881 by members of the Populist group Narodnaia Volia (People's Will), his nervous successor, Alexander III, rounded up Populists at the slightest provocation and sent them East. Populism encouraged the study of peasant culture&#x2014;not just peasants' statements about their likelihood to support revolution, but also their songs, costumes, and rituals&#x2014;and many of the exiled radicals were amateur ethnographers who were reading the same social theorists as their friends in Paris. Once these young men found themselves isolated among Siberian peoples, they refocused their ethnographic energies on them.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  Lev Shternberg, exiled to Sakhalin, wrote a monograph about the Gilyak (or Nivkh); Vladimir Bogoras, the Chukchi; Vladimir Iokhel'son, the Yugakir. The radical ideology of these writers accounted for what they found in Siberia. As Populists, they were already convinced of the significance of the peasants for their dream of Russia's revolutionary future. They were certain that <i>pace</i> Marx's vision of an industrial proletariat leading the world to communism, in Russia's case the rural folk, recalling their own traditionally communal institutions, would embrace the revolutionary cause. When men such as Shternberg, Bogoras, and Iokhel'son encountered the Siberian peoples, they found even more inspirational evidence of communal institutions. 

<b></b>

  </p>

<p>The enthusiastic discovery of proto-communist institutions in Siberia is best exemplified by the intellectual interactions between Friedrich Engels and Shternberg. Arrested in 1886, Shternberg was in jail when he read Engels's 1884 book, <i>The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State</i> (actually a cellmate translated it aloud for him from the German).<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  There Engels argued that the variety of family structures found throughout the world can be plotted in an evolutionary sequence, proving that humans had evolved from a matriarchal and communal system to a patriarchal and capitalist one. In the process, women had turned from respected workers into powerless slaves, the property of their husbands: "The overthrow of mother-right was the <i>world historical defeat of the female sex</i>. The man took command in the home also; the woman was degraded and reduced to servitude, she became the slave of his lust and a mere instrument for the production of children."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  The contemporary institution of monogamous marriage replaced the polygamy of the past because it could ensure patrilineal descent and thereby protect the property of men. As Engels explains: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>In the beginning, people were already born married&#x2014;married to an entire group of the opposite sex&#x2026;. And when, with the preponderance of private over communal property and the interest in its bequeathal, father-right and monogamy gained supremacy, the dependence of marriage on economic considerations became complete&#x2026;. Not only the woman but also the man acquires a price&#x2014;not according to his personal qualities, but according to his property.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Although the bulk of Engels's examples came from North American Indian groups, he also found evidence for his theories in the Russian Empire and the Slavic sphere. In his revised 1891 fourth edition, he cited An-sky's friend Kovalevsky, whose work showed that communal familial organizational structures still existed among Slavs.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Inspired by Engels, Shternberg knew what to look for when he arrived on Sakhalin. And to his delight, he found it: evidence in the kinship terms of the Gilyak that they still practiced a form of plural marriage, namely cousin marriage, whereby children are assigned before birth (or at their birth once it becomes clear whether they are girls or boys) to specific cross-cousins as spouses. Shternberg wrote an article about his findings that was published in Russian in 1892, and Engels was overjoyed to read it. He arranged for its publication in German and eventually included a discussion of Shternberg's work as an appendix to a revised edition of his own book.<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Both the image of betrothal of infants before or at birth (which the Gilyak actually practiced) and the image of plural marriage (which they did not) represented for Shternberg and Engel the powerful vision of a society in which the claims of groups (or families) take precedence over the claims of individuals and accumulated wealth has no effect on human fates. The fantasies he associated with Gilyak marriage practices must have given the exiled Shternberg the sense that his own suffering on Sakhalin had a tremendous meaning, allowing him&#x2014;and eventually his readers&#x2014;the hope that since these communal institutions still existed, even in the most remote part of the world, it might be possible for people everywhere to return to that seemingly so much more virtuous form of life.

<h1 class="sec-headA">
The Dybbuk
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Given the interest in Siberian natives expressed in An-sky's conversations and writing, it seems worthwhile to speculate about the meaning of Siberian primitivist imagery for him and his work. Zhitlowsky's comparison of his friend to "Shashkov" represents speculation of just this sort. Following Zhitlowsky, I will offer four readings of <i>The Dybbuk</i> as stylized in Siberian fashion, and consider what they offer&#x2014;both individually and taken together&#x2014;to the project of understanding Jewish modernism.  </p>

<p>I begin with Zhitlowsky's vision of Jewish culture, like Siberian culture, as a primitive source of mystic wholeness, to which the assimilated intellectual needs to return. He makes this argument about the play, as well as about An-sky himself in his discussion of "Shashkov." In his introductory note to the English translation, he explained that An-sky had succeeded in recreating the "richness of spirit" associated with the mystical Jewish movement of Hasidism, characterized above all by "the longing to fuse the soul with the divine Source of the world ... [to release oneself] through holy living from the illusory world, and [to attain] the True World of mystic powers." He lauded the Hasidim for living "a life hovering on the boundary between two worlds, the world of reality and the faith-created world of supernatural forces."<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  This description of an artist who succeeds in penetrating from the ordinary world of everyday life into a mysterious, fascinatingly primitive other world recalls Zhitlowsky's vision of Shashkov's equally mystical national reawakening, when he realizes that "the forms of civilized life are quite insignificant surface things, that the heart of humanness can be better attained when one allows oneself to fall into the mysterious depths of one's own soul and when one molds oneself mystically there with the world-spirit that prevails in it." Zhitlowsky's language here owes much to the Russian Symbolists as well as to Nietzsche, whose <i>Thus Spake Zarathustra</i> he had translated into Yiddish<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup> . Moreover, his evaluation of An-sky and his memoir points to the connections between the primitivism he celebrated and the mysticism that Stanislavsky and Sologub found in the play. </p>

<p>But this is not the only way of relating An-sky's Jewish primitivism to the Siberian model. To draw on a different set of Siberian images, <i>The Dybbuk</i> might be seen as representing Jewish culture with the same goals as the second of An-sky's encounters with the far North, the entrepreneur displaying Inuits in Bordeaux for (as he argued) educational purposes. As Benjamin Lukin explains, An-sky was increasingly interested in the project of creating a Jewish museum precisely during the period when he wrote the play. He wanted to study, preserve, and display all aspects of traditional Jewish life, folklore, rituals, history, and artifacts, both in order to nourish a strong secular Jewish identity among assimilating Russian Jews, and in order to foster understanding and sympathy among non-Jews, something that seemed particularly urgent in the light of the negative publicity about Jews during the Beilis blood libel trial of 1911&#x2013;1913.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Indeed, the first known Russian draft of the play reveals that An-sky started out by loading up his play with folklore and customs, making it into a living ethnographic diorama suitable for display at a World's Fair.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  The action pauses as his characters sing songs, tell folktales that are sometimes irrelevant to the plot, and enact rituals, such as a scene in which Leah marks her impending wedding by giving a hand-sewn shirt to 

<b></b>

 Baba Khana, the midwife who attended her birth. Baba Khana responds by donning the shirt, singing a song, and offering passers-by cookies from a tray; they take them and give her coins in return.<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  Rather than a classic play with a unified theme, <i>The Dybbuk</i>&#x2014;particularly in draft form&#x2014;recalls the Bordeaux Inuits, who, as we recall, gave performances, skied, hunted seals, sang, and so forth. An-sky's Bordeaux notes make it clear that he was troubled by this kind of performance and questioned its pedagogical value, and in his revisions of his own play, he ultimately drew back from this sort of ethnographic vaudeville (he removed the midwife and her song, for instance). Nonetheless, the pedagogic intent that he discerned in Bordeaux remained in his play, and it is likely that he hoped in his own work to do a better job than the ethnographic entrepreneur he had met. </p>

<p>While one might not expect that An-sky's plays on Jewish themes would fill the same function as the third of our Siberian representations&#x2014;the World Fair's illustration of the cultural variety and thus implicitly the size and power of the Russian Empire&#x2014;Seth Wolitz makes precisely this argument. He asserts that An-sky was an "Empire Jew," whose articulation of Jewish culture was predicated on Jews being one of many ethnic groups making up the heterogeneous Empire; he argues that An-sky was ideologically committed, in spite of his radicalism, to that very Empire, and most powerfully to its heterogeneity. In his persuasive and original reading of <i>The Dybbuk</i>, Wolitz defines <i>The Dybbuk</i> as belonging "to the conscious creation of a secular Jewish East European identity as part of the Russian empire's authentic nationalities." He locates elements of the play that display the rootedness of the Jews and work to represent Jews as one of a set of nations of the Empire, each different but each in place.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting way in which the depiction of Jewish culture in <i>The Dybbuk</i> mirrors Siberian primitivism has not yet been explored in the criticism: the connections between the plot of the play and the radical hope to find Siberian examples of a communalist past. Although An-sky was friendly with Kovalevsky,<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  read Engels with interest,<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  and worked with Shternberg on the design of the questionnaire for his own ethnographic expedition to the provinces of Volhynia and Podolia in 1912&#x2013;1914,<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  there is no record in his published or private writing that he consciously engaged with the radical meaning of Siberia, that is, with the notion that Siberia and its people contain the best living examples of the communalism of the past and thus might give hope for the revival of communalism in the future. Nonetheless, I would like to speculate about the possibility that these connections and the general ideological atmosphere in which An-sky functioned are reflected in <i>The Dybbuk</i>, which thus might combine modernism and radical politics. </p>

<p>The love plot, as we recall, is based on the promise made by Leah and Khonen's fathers, Sender and Nisn, that if the wife of one of them gives birth to a girl and the wife of the other gives birth to a boy, the two children will be married. In the play, Nisn dies soon after making this promise and before the children are born. Sender, whose wife has given birth to Leah, makes no effort to find out if Nisn's widow had given birth to a boy. After Sender becomes wealthy, he decides to find his daughter a wealthy husband, even though the Hasidim in his town criticize him for abandoning the 

<b></b>

 tradition dictating that a wealthy man should seek out a good scholar as a son-in-law. But ultimately, Leah proves unwilling&#x2014;or unable&#x2014;to go through with the marriage to Menashe, the wealthy groom chosen by her father. Rather, she announces at the end of the second act that she can only marry Khonen, her <i>basherter</i> (fated one)&#x2014;and she makes this announcement in the voice of Khonen, who has died and whose soul has possessed her body. </p>

<p>This plot, it seems to me, shows the traces of the ideology of Engels and Shternberg. Although Eastern European Jews were known (and powerfully criticized) for betrothing children and for early marriage, betrothal of unborn children was rare or non-existent.<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  By making this practice the center of his play, An-sky makes his Jews like the Gilyak, as they appear in Shternberg's descriptions of the system assigning children before birth to cross-cousins as spouses. This equation makes it more possible to imagine the Jewish past as containing the germ of an ancient communalism that&#x2014;like the radicals' fantasy of the Siberian past&#x2014;gives hope for a socialist future. The rebellion of Leah and Khonen thus expresses the potential radicalism of these young people (even if clothed in traditionalism), their yearning for an older system, the "primitive communism" of the past, rather than the capitalist system of the present, with its overwhelming concern with property. And Leah's objection to the groom chosen by her husband makes perfect sense in light of Engels' theories. As Engels argues, in the capitalist system based on money&#x2014;the value that governs Sender's actions&#x2014;women become more like property, owned by fathers and husbands; therefore, it is not surprising that they would prefer the older system.  </p>

<p>I am not arguing here that An-sky's play is a Siberian-style fabrication from start to finish. An-sky was a genuine expert in Jewish folk culture, but in his play, he chose to emphasize aspects of it in a way that reflects the ideology of the anthropologists of his era and his circle. As he began writing <i>The Dybbuk </i>at the end of 1913 and developed a plot that centered on marriage in a traditional society, he may have been influenced by the discussions of archaic marriage practices that had been going on around him for the past twenty years. Just as Shternberg unwittingly distorted the marriage customs of the Gilyak in a way that suggests that the "primitive communism" in which Engels and his followers believed was still extant somewhere, so An-sky in his depictions of traditional Jewish culture made changes that brought it closer to the ideal of the pre-capitalist society and values.  </p>

<p>It may be easier to understand An-sky's urge to display Jewish culture as traditionally anti-capitalist when one recalls that Jews were seen as the quintessential capitalists. Among An-sky's earliest writings are critiques of Jewish businessmen who underpaid or abused their Jewish or non-Jewish workers; as a Populist, he seems to have believed&#x2014;at least when he was young&#x2014;that the Jewish business class posed a danger to the Russian peasants, a danger that needed to be controlled.<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  Thus the depiction of the capitalist Sender in <i>The Dybbuk</i> as a new element, one in some way foreign to the shtetl, suggests that An-sky was creating a plot that allowed him to grapple with and disarm the prevalent notion of Jews as <i>inherently</i> capitalist and exploitative. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>Again, with the depiction of Jewish culture as anti-capitalist as with the depiction of the betrothal of unborn children, I am not arguing that An-sky completely distorted the Jewish culture that he knew, in the interest of a political ideology. Rather, from the enormous sea of Jewish culture, he chose elements that corresponded to his ideas, though he never did so entirely to the exclusion of cultural elements that did not support his ideas. In the first act of the play, the <i>batlonim</i> (regular prayer-readers) in the synagogue are telling stories about Hasidic rebbes who were famous for their wealth, including Dovidl of Talna and Reb Yisroel of Ruzhin: "Reb Yisroel of Ruzhin, of blessed memory, lived like a monarch. An orchestra of twenty-four musicians played at his table and when he traveled his carriage never had less than six horses." The visiting Messenger responds, "The holy Reb Zushe of Annopol was poor all his life: he wore a peasant's blouse tied with a rope around his waist and had to beg for alms. Yet his good deeds were no less worthy than those of the rebbe of Talma or the rebbe of Ruzhin."<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  In each of these cases, An-sky's characters are describing real historical res, whose lives gave rise to many legends. Although An-sky presumably preferred the ascetic Zushe of Annopol to the wealthy Yisroel of Ruzhin&#x2014;and the viewer of the play eventually realizes that the Messenger is a more reliable voice than any other in the cast&#x2014;he displays the contradictory variety of Hasidic tradition. </p>

<p>To what degree, then, does the primitivism of <i>The Dybbuk</i> speak for a clear political ideology? Engels read Shternberg's depiction of the Gilyak optimistically: Although he did not imagine a bright future for the Gilyak themselves, he saw Shternberg's "evidence" of cousin marriage as indicating that the human race as a whole was once capable of a kind of communism and thus would be able to evolve toward a brighter future. Should <i>The Dybbuk</i>, with its suggestion that traditional Jewish marriage practices were similarly communal (and not capitalist), be seen as equally optimistic, whether about the fate of the Jews or humanity in general? Leah succeeds in rejecting her father's innovative marriage priorities. The <i>Tsaddik</i> (Hasidic leader) Reb Azriel attempts to annul the betrothal of Leah and Khonen, but he cannot do so. He imposes a punishment on Sender for betraying Nisn's trust, but even that does not restore order in the world of the play. At the end of the fourth act, Leah and Khonen willingly die together. Their death might be seen as the triumph of their communalist ideology over Sender's capitalism. Indeed, the image of revolutionaries who renounce marriage, progeny, sex itself in the name of a higher ideal appears frequently in the radical Russian prose tradition, including Chernyshevsky's <i>What Is to Be Done?</i> and Gorky's <i>Mother</i>.  </p>

<p>But An-sky did not ultimately want to characterize his own work as so simply political. In a 1920 letter to Zhitlowsky, he was uncertain about who in the play could be seen as having won a moral victory. "In the end Khonen and Leah are victorious. But is the <i>tsaddik </i>in the wrong?"<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>  If Khonen and Leah stand both for the primitive past and for revolution, then An-sky sounds skeptical here about the redemptive value of that revolution. It seems that even though he toyed with stylizing his Jewish folk culture after the model of the Siberian primitive that so fascinated his friends, An-sky, as he himself recognized, ultimately created a work that was not neatly ideological, that revealed doubt that this primitive would provide a real solution.

We Shed No Blood
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Such pessimism echoes through An-sky's last Siberian-themed article, written after he had stopped working on <i>The Dybbuk</i> and seen his political party, the SRs (Socialist Revolutionaries), first triumph after the February 1917 Revolution and then be chased out of Russia after October. Dying in Warsaw&#x2014;where he had fled&#x2014;An-sky found himself revisiting memories of the 1890s in Paris, returning to the primitivist conceit of the Jews as an Eastern people with mystical access to the "world spirit." He touched on this fantasy in one of the last pieces he ever wrote. In "We Shed No Blood" (Bay undz fargist men nit keyn blut), posthumously published in late 1920, An-sky recalled the most unusual Siberian visitors that Potanin sent him: Avgan Dzhordziev, a Tibetan lama with shaven head and yellow robe, and Buda Rabdanov, his Buryat translator. An-sky hints at a potential equation of the "East" and traditional Judaism: the lama's hat, he tells us, is "something like a <i>shtraymel</i>" (the traditional head covering of Hasidic men), and the title the Buryat uses to address the lama is "like we say Rebbe."<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>   </p>

<p>As An-sky, Rabdanov, and the lama strolled through the Paris streets, their conversation turned to criminality. When the lama asked An-sky how criminals were treated "by you" (meaning outside of Tibet), An-sky, ever the social scientist, launched into a disquisition on Western criminal law, concluding with a description of the guillotine. The lama's response, as relayed by Rabdanov, surprised him: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>"Khamba-lama is very surprised that you shed human blood!"</p>
<p>I must admit that I was a bit embarrassed. The whole time, in my interactions with the lama, I had been feeling like the representative of a higher culture, and now suddenly this question. This half-savage Asian cannot understand how we shed human blood. I began to explain to the lama that a great movement against capital punishment was arising in Europe; this barbaric punishment was already gone in several countries and one could hope that soon it would also be eliminated in France. But my speech made no impression on the lama, and again, through Rabdanov, he repeated, "Khamba-lama is very surprised that you shed human blood."</p>
<p>It occurred to me to ask the lama a question. "And what so you do in Tibet with serious criminals?"</p>
<p>Buda Rabdanov relayed my question. The lama straightened up and spoke proudly.</p>
<p>Buda Rabdanov, who always imitated the lama's motions, then straightened up and said proudly, "Khamba-lama says, 'In Tibet we shed no human blood! Where we live, they are strangled!'"<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>In this essay, An-sky evokes and then mocks the orientalizing metaphors of Siberia as a symbol of Jewish tradition and the East as man's "natural" home, the healthy alternative to a degenerate West. He follows the canonic European high modernist artists who turned to ethnography for inspiration, but his subversion of his own Siberian primitivism recalls the nuanced use of the image of American Indians among American Jewish writers. As Zhitlowsky would do in his memoir, An-sky imagines a rejection of the West and return to "the East," motivated by something like the third of Zhitlowsky's explanations of the Shashkov story: the moral superiority of primitive 

<b></b>

 culture. But with his ironic ending, An-sky steps back from primitivism itself, from the ideology defining return&#x2014;to any East&#x2014;as redemption. He suggests that to attribute higher "civilization" to the seemingly primitive is, ultimately, only dangerous self-delusion. Thus, An-sky's anecdote about the lama's visit to Paris draws attention to the distance between Zhitlowsky's portrayal of his childhood friend as "Shashkov" and An-sky himself, suggesting simultaneously that to read <i>The Dybbuk</i> simply as a radical political statement or as an ideological Jewish primitivist pastiche <i>&#x00E0; la Siberienne</i> would be wrong. Rather, the play&#x2014;and, indeed, An-sky's biography itself&#x2014;might be read as an ironic meditation, both profoundly modernist and quintessentially Jewish, on the limits of primitivism. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT4" href="#REF4">4</a>. This question has recently attracted critical attention. For an argument that literary texts of various periods and languages can be categorized as "Jewish literature," see Ruth R. Wisse, <i>The Modern Jewish Canon: A Journey through Language and Culture</i> (New York: The Free Press, 2000). For a discussion of Hebrew and Yiddish modernisms that privileges their access to the minor and the marginal over International Modernist texts written in French, German, or English, see Chana Kronfeld, <i>On the Margins of Modernism: Decentering Literary Dynamics</i> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996). This article proceeds from both of these works. Following Wisse, I attempt to locate that which is usefully and universally Jewish in a text written first in a non-Jewish language; following Kronfeld, I investigate the Jewish modernist engagement with the marginal, though the margin I consider is geographic, rather than linguistic. </p>
