What is <B><I>modernity</I></B>? What is or was
<B><I>modernism</I></B>? Why is the energetic, expanding,
multidisciplinary field of modernist studies so filled with contestation
over the very ground of study? Definitional activities are fictionalizing
processes, however much they sound like rational categorization. As
such, I will begin with three stories, allegorized but rooted in my own
experience in an evolving field.

Story 1: Where Have All the Rebels Gone?
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Imagine a young woman starting graduate school in 1965 in an American
land grant university. Remember the suburban dream of the 1950s for
middle-class (white) girls: the penny loafers and saddle shoes;
the poodle skirts and prom chiffon; the cheerleaders and Elvis
screamers; college for the MRS degree; the station wagon and four
kids. NO books. NO art. NO ideas. NO passion. Conformity was the name
of the game. Conformity and materialism. Then. The first butts of the
Berkeley Free Speech Movement. Fuck. Shit. Sex. Pot. Buttons. Pierced
ears. Long hair. Unisex style. Civil Rights. Vietnam. Pigs. Feminism. Gay
Rights. Welfare Rights. Union Rights. "What was modernism" to a graduate
student in English and American literature in the heady days of the
1960s? Modernism was rebellion. Modernism was "make it new."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
  Modernism was resistance, rupture. To its progenitors. To its
  students. Modernism was the antidote to the poison of tradition,
  obligation.

Story 2: What Does a Cyberpunk Really Want?
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 Picture an aging scholar in 1995, past the half-century mark,
 entering into her first graduate seminar on modernism in a land grant
 university. "What was modernism?" she asks. A circle of eyes and
 silences. A couple to the side shift uncomfortably. She has cropped
 purple hair and kohled eyes. He wears fishnet stockings and thick buckled
 Pilgrim heels. A tidy tail of silky golden hair flows down his back. So
 thin in black, so pale in whiteface, they are their own shadows. They
 know "what modernism was." Modernism was elitism. Modernism was the
 Establishment. "High Culture" lifting its skirts against the taint of
 the "low," the masses, the popular. Modernism was the supreme fiction,
 the master narrative, the great white hope. To its Po-Mo descendents,
 Modernism is the enemy. Postmodernism is the antidote to the poison of
 tradition, obligation.

Story 3: What's a Poor Student to Do?
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Listen in on an exchange between two scholars, the one graying and
the other balding in the wisdom of their seniorities--she a cultural
critic, he a social scientist. Children of the 1960s, teachers of the
1990s. It is 1995 as their manuscripts cross through snail mail. "What was
modernism?" they ask, both acknowledging it as a historical phenomenon,
but neither willing to assert that it is fully over and done with. For
both, modernism both was and is. But <I>what</I> was modernism? She
knows. It is the (illusory) break with the past, a willed forgetting
of tradition, continuity, order. It is the embrace of chaos. It is the
crisis of representation, fragmentation, alienation. It is indeterminacy,
the rupture of certainty--material and symbolic. It is the poetics of
modernity--change--and the aesthetic inscriptions thereof. (<I>Pace</I> cyberpunks, for whom modernism no longer "is" as it recedes into
the deadness of postmodernism's past.)

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
He knows too. Modernism is state planning. Modernism is totalization,
centralized system. Modernism is the Enlightenment's rational
schemata. "Progress"--"Science"-- "Reason"-- "Truth." Modernism is the
ideology of post-Renaissance modernity--conquest--and the inscriptions
thereof. (<I>Pace</I> cyborgs, modernism still lives in the danger of
ever-forming centralized hegemonies and utopian totalitarianisms.)

The opposition of meanings produced over time (from Story 1 to
Story 2) morphs into a binary of oppositions existing across space
(Story 3). In toto, the stories represent a conjuncture of temporal
and spatial oppositions. So. Let's move from storytelling to another
kind of conjuncture: parataxis--the juxtaposition of things without
providing connectives. <I>Parataxis</I>: a common aesthetic strategy in
modernist writing and art, developed to disrupt and fragment conventional
sequencing, causality, and perspective. <I>Parataxis</I>: the opposite
of <I>hypotaxis</I> in linguistics, thus the opposite of hierarchical

its center was a supreme self-confidence about continued linear progress,

<B>Moral 1:</B> As terms in an evolving scholarly discourse, <I>modern,
modernity,</I> and <I>modernism</I> constitute a critical Tower of
Babel, a cacophony of categories that become increasingly useless the
more inconsistently they are used. We can regard them as a parody of
critical discourse in which everyone keeps talking at the same time in
a language without common meanings. When terms mean radically different
or contradictory things to people, then their use appears to threaten
the project of scholarship/teaching altogether.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Moral 2:</B> As contradictory terms resisting consensual definition,
<I>modern, modernism,</I> and <I>modernity</I> form a fertile terrain for
interrogation, providing ever more sites for examination with each new
meaning spawned. As parody of rational discourse, their contradictions
highlight the production of meaning possible by attention to what will
not be tamed, by what refuses consistency and homogenization. Their use
ensures the open-ended ongoingness of the scholarly/pedagogical project
whose first task is to sustain the continuation of interrogation, to
ensure, in short, its own perpetuation.

<P ALIGN="CENTER">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<I>Modernisms</I> is one thing, but <I>modernism</I> as absolute
contradiction is quite another. Definitions spawn plurality
in the very act of attempting to herd meaning inside consensual
boundaries. Definitions mean to fence in, to fix, and to stabilize. But
they often end up being fluid, in a destabilized state of ongoing
formation, deformation, and reformation that serves the changing needs
of the moment. They reflect the standpoint of their makers. They emerge
out of the spatio/temporal context of their production. They serve
different needs and interests. They accomplish different kinds of cultural
work. They change dramatically over time and through space. Definitions
wear the mask of synchronic abstraction, but they are always subject
to diachronic histories and spatial geographies of continuity, change,
and difference. I have no expectation, therefore, of determining or
discovering a fixed meaning for terms like <I>modern,modernity,</I>
and <I>modernism.</I> I expect differences.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But opposition of meanings is something else. It goes beyond difference,
beyond resistance to totalizing metanarratives, beyond the provisional,
strategic, fluid, permeable, and situationally adaptable meanings that
characterize the most useful definitional exercises. I don't seek fixity
or plurality. I seek instead to confront directly the contradictory
status of meanings.

The stories began with the problematic of <I>modernism,</I> but drew
us inexorably into a web of words--<I>modernism</I> and its siblings,
<I>modern, modernity,</I> and <I>modernization.</I> Not only does
the meaning of the concept deny fixity but so do its grammatical and
semantic aspects. The root word <I>modern</I> is both noun and adjective,
whether signifying descriptively or normatively. The different suffixes
herd the word into different grammatical functions that carry semantic
weight. The <I>-ity</I> of <I>modernity</I> limits the word <I>modern</I>
to a noun--a status as a thing or condition that is distinguishable
from other things or conditions. The <I>-ism</I> of <I>modernism</I>
turns the noun <I>modern</I> into an advocacy, a promotion, a movement
presumably centered around a systematic philosophy, politics, ideology,
or aesthetics. The <I>-ization</I> of <I>modernization</I> signifies
a process, an evolution or revolution from one condition to another,
with modernity as the condition achieved by modernization.

Once upon a time, literary and art critics used
<I>modernism</I>--especially with the orthographic marker of the
capital, <I>Modernism,</I> or the intensifying adjective <I>high,</I>

in loose affiliations or parallel developments. In contrast, social
theorists, historians, and social scientists used <I>modern,modernity,</I>
and <I>modernization</I> to refer to historical periods, conditions,
and processes. But now, such disciplinary boundaries have ceased to
function, as people appropriate all forms of the root concept to serve
their different purposes.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Symptomatically and provocatively, the interdisciplinary journal
 yokes two of these terms, as if the slash
between them signaled their interchangeability on the one hand and
yet their permanent separation on the other. The slash is a bar that
forever connects and disconnects (like the Saussurian/Lacanian bar
between signifier/signified). This is yet another contradiction that

<I>modern/modernity/modernism/modernization</I> with all its cognates

<B>A Psychoanalytic Detour:</B> The family romance of squabbling siblings and
cousins invites a psychoanalysis of definitional debate. The dissonance of
meanings--particularly the opposition of meanings--opens the possibility
of a psychodynamic reading that looks for the irrational and covert
processes of repression, return, and transference in modernist studies
across the disciplines as these processes reflect unresolved complexes
within modernity itself.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The scene of analysis for Freud is a psychodynamic one, a stage onto which
the analysand and the analyst transfer repressed desires and complexes
long since seemingly forgotten. Transference (and countertransference)
in analysis involves the repetition of what cannot be consciously
remembered, the reenactment of repressed patterns not yet consciously
faced. Freud's clinical practice involved the deliberate incitement
of the transference so that the drama of repetition could become the
grounds for analysis itself.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The terminological quagmire of modernist studies may be the result of a
transferential process in which people become caught in a repetition of
the unresolved contradictions present and largely repressed in modernity
itself. The stories and parataxes of this essay deliberately stage this
dissonant drama to shift the focus from the debate about signifieds for
the disputed terms to an analysis of what produces the dissonance in
the first place. I am adapting and blending Julia Kristeva's notion of
the "textual unconscious," Fredric Jameson's concept of the "political
unconscious," and Shoshana Felman's psychoanalytic interpretations of
contentious critical literatures on Edgar Allen Poe and Henry James's
<I>The Turn of the Screw.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 Particularly heated and unresolvable debates about literary meaning,
 Felman argues, can be read as transferential scenes of resistance and
 repetition. Such scenes, often confrontational and even bitter, have an
 "unconscious" that can be read psychoanalytically as a "case history"
 that brings to light hidden complexes repressed and unresolved in the
 original literary texts. Adapting Jameson's notion of the political
 unconscious for this scenario allows for a reading of how oppositional
 views encrypt a politics not immediately evident or intended.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Similarly, multidisciplinary modernist studies spawns terminological
debates that reenact contradictions already present within the
terms and the phenomena to which they allude. What then is hidden
within the proliferation of meanings for <I>modern,modernity,</I> and
<I>modernism</I>? How might the dissonances and oppositions constitute
fault lines inviting interpretation in and of themselves? What might such
fault lines tell us about the contradictory and complex-ridden meanings
and politics of the phenomena to which the terms refer as they change
and vary in different historical moments and spatial locations?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Pathways in the Wanderland of Modernist Studies:</B> How to enter into and
perhaps emerge out of the maze of contestation and opposition in modernist
studies? I suggest two routes for definitional excursion--the first,
grammatical and philosophical; the second, political and cultural. They
engage the issue of oppositional meanings in complementary ways. Without
resolving anything, they open up different routes to the contradiction of
meaning, different ways of negotiating definitional debate, each necessary
in its own way. Without resolving or silencing it, they clarify what is
at stake in the debate and why interrogating what produces it can loosen
fixed loyalties to partial meanings.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">



<B>Grammatical/Philosophical Route:</B> This pathway starts with the recognition
of the difference between nominal and relational modes of definition--that
is regarding the terms (the siblings, <I>modern/modernity/modernism</I>)
as <B>nouns</B> with a specific, definable content (however debated) and viewing
them as <B>adjectives</B> implying comparison to some other condition of being.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
  The difference between these approaches to definitional tasks
  accounts for some of the opposition in modernist studies, but not
  all. Contradiction exists not only between the modes but within each
  mode as well.

Nominal Mode--The Noun
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In nominal terms, the words <I>modern, modernity,</I> and <I>modernism</I>
signify a specific content: a set of characteristics with particular
material conditions and spatio/temporal locations. This is not to say,
however, that there is always agreement about this specific content. But
for those working within or seeking a nominal framework, the definitional
project centers on fixing the categories to a set of meanings to which
others might be persuaded. Whether canonical or revisionist, such projects
assume the nominal status of modernism or modernity: it is a noun, with
a specific meaning, albeit subject to disagreement about its potential
explanatory power.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Nominal discussions of <I>modern/modernity/modernism</I> tend to be
very field specific, with definitional dissonance and even outright
contradiction developing as a result of disciplinary boundaries and
considerable isolation of disciplinary discourses from each other. The
most radical disjuncture of nominal meanings exists in the chasm
between the social sciences and the humanities. Social theorists,
political scientists, sociologists, and anthropologists tend to follow
the lead of historians of Europe, who typically periodize their field
into the subfields of classical, medieval, early modern, and modern, thus
defining <I>modern</I> as the initial break with medieval institutions and
outlooks that evolved over time. Within this context, <I>modernity</I>
signifies a specific set of historical conditions developing in the
West, including the industrial revolution, conquest of and expansion
economically and politically into other continents, the transition to
urban culture, the rise of the nation state, and growing power of the
bourgeoisie. Consistent with this periodization, philosophers often regard
the theories of reason in Locke, Kant, and Hegel as the embodiment of
a distinctly modern secularism and humanism. For political scientists,
modernity often involves the development of specific kinds of political
systems, away from feudalism to limited monarchies, democracies, and
various autocracies; for economists, types of markets, capital, or
labor; for anthropologists, the eradication or (forced) assimilation of
traditional cultures through conquest or encroachment by nation states,
market systems, more "advanced" technologies, or hegemonic cultural
groups. Postcolonial theorists often link modernity with imperialism and
the national struggles for emergence within the contradictory conditions
of hybridization and continued dependence on the colonial power. And
so forth.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In the humanities, on the other hand, modernity and modernism are most
often associated with the radical <I>rupture</I> from rather than the
supreme embodiment of post-Renaissance 

<B></B>

Enlightenment humanism and accompanying formations in the
West. Artists and writers, within this view, constitute an avant-garde of
change, seeing sooner and more searchingly the profound significance and
future effects of epistemological, ontological, political, technological,
demographic, cultural, and aesthetic transformations. The dating,
location, and forms of rupture associated with a modernist style sometimes
overlap, sometimes vary considerably. Critics of modernist poetry often
identify a poetics of fragmentation, parataxis, image, and idiosyncratic
rhythms and sound patterns. Art historians often focus on the rupture from
realism in the heightening attention to form, especially pure geometric
shapes and planes. Architectural historians often look to the stark,
functionalist minimalism of Bauhaus design or cityscape towers as the
expression of modernity and its aesthetic in the age of the machine. For
music historians, the embrace of primitivism and atonality in a composer
like Stravinsky might constitute modernism. Media critics look to the
radical impact of the new mechanical means of reproduction--photography,
radio, cinema, television--for the sights and sounds of modernity. And
so forth.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
 However debated, modernism in the context of the humanities is most
 often understood as the loosely affiliated movements and individuals in
 the arts and literature that reflect and contribute to the conditions
 and consciousness of modernity in Europe, Britain, and the United States.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
  Periodization, however much it varies among different subfields, differs
  sharply from that proposed by social theorists and historians. Moreover,
  the epitome of modernity for those in the social sciences is precisely
  what modernity dismantles for those in the humanities.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At first glance, this definitional divide seems arbitrary, produced
through the accident of disciplinary location and isolationism in
the academy and thus not particularly interesting for definitional
interrogation. However, several factors challenge such a view.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
First, the opposition between the social sciences and the humanities
cannot be so easily dismissed as arbitrary or insignificant because some
fields like cultural anthropology, history, geography, political theory,
media studies, ethnic studies, women's studies, and postcolonial studies
are multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary. They exist on the liminal
threshold between the two divisions, equally engaging in questions
of representation, theory, social organization, power relations,
and empirical as well as imaginative formations. Consequently,
the oppositional meanings of <I>modern/modernity/modernism</I> often
coexist within certain disciplines, fields, and institutional units in
the academy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Second, the borders between disciplines and divisions of knowledge
have become increasingly porous in the past thirty years with the
re-legitimation of interdisciplinarity. Such cross-disciplinary work
with modernity produces rich hybridities, but also some confusion. For
example, in his collection <I>Modernist Anthropology,</I> Marc Manganaro
(who holds an appointment in a literature department) brings together
anthropologists and literary critics to examine the interplay between
literary modernism and modernist anthropology in the first half of the
twentieth century. The result is an exciting interdisciplinary examination
of the intermingling of aesthetic and ethnographic

<B></B>

projects in the period. But the term <I>modernism</I> slips and slides
between oppositional meanings--from rational ordering sought in Boasian or
Malinowskian anthropology to anarchistic disordering found in avant-garde
art and poetics. This oscillation is never directly confronted anywhere
in the volume and is even reproduced in many individual essays. The
collection intensifies rather than illuminates the definitional problems
evident in an uninterrogated mixing of social theory and aesthetic
meanings of <I>modernism.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
To take another example, the geographer David Harvey begins his
influential book, <I>The Condition of Postmodernity,</I> with an
invocation to Charles Baudelaire's notion of modern life as "the
transient, the fleeting, the contingent," cites the literary critic
Marshall Berman on modernism and modernity in <I>All That Is Solid Melts
into Air,</I> and then quotes W.B. Yeats's paradigmatic modernist lines in
"The Second Coming": "Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; / Mere
anarchy is loosed upon the world" (<I>CP,</I> 10). Firmly entrenched in
the conventional literary meanings of <I>modernism</I> as disruption,
Harvey develops his discussion of postmodernism with a thoroughgoing
association of modernism, particularly what he calls High Modernism,
with the Enlightenment project of the "development of rational forms
of social organization and rational modes of thought" (<I>CP,</I>
12). Having detailed the formalist ruptures of modernist epistemology,
ontology, and representation, he then cites Ihab Hassan's famous schematic
chart asserting the absolute break between modernism and postmodernism
over modernism's supposed alignment with the Cartesian subject and
Enlightenment reason (<I>CP,</I> 42-44). In his splendid book,
influential across the disciplines in modernist studies, Harvey slides
back and forth between "anarchy" and "organization" as the defining
modes of High Modernism with only occasional allusion to the tension
between these meanings.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Third, the insistence on arbitrary disciplinary difference obscures
what is shared across the social sciences and humanities--namely,
the emphasis on rupture from the past; debate about the politics of
modernity/modernism, and a pervasive Eurocentrism. Just what "past"
modernity abandons differs, but transformative change is a constant
component of definition. Social theorists and art critics alike argue
fiercely among themselves about the value of modernity and modernism in
debates that are more similar than different across the methodological
divides. Is modernity or modernism liberating or oppressive, progressive
or regressive, something to be reinforced or dismantled? Do its
ideas and ideals require the oppression or exclusion of some for the
benefit of others? Or do they open doors for ever-expanding, ever-more
inclusive conditions of freedom and plenty? The questions are similar,
whether addressed to issues of revolution and slavery or avant-garde
art and mass culture. Some defend modernity/modernism; others attack
it. Underlying all these nominal debates is the problematic assumption
that modernity/modernism originated in the West and is either forced
upon or imitated in diluted form by the Rest. Given these similarities,
the dissonance in the core meanings of <I>modern/modernity/modernism</I>
is deafening.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A nominal approach to defining <I>modern/modernity/modernism</I> presumes
the possibility of consensual agreement about the meanings of the terms
as nouns with a

<B></B>

specific content: a set of characteristics existing within discernable
boundaries of meaning, space, and time. However, a closer look reveals
little consensus, either across disciplines or within them. This capacity
of the nominal approach to spawn diverse and even opposite meanings
undermines the naming function of nouns. If what a noun signifies cannot
be consistently named, of what use is it as a category?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<H3 ALIGN="LEFT">
<!--_a-head-->
Relational Mode--The Adjective
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A relational approach to the meaning of <I>modern/modernity/modernism</I>
looks for the latent structure rather than the manifest contents of the
root term. Instead of locating modernity in the specific time of the
post-Renaissance or post-Enlightenment West, a relational definition
stresses the condition or sensibility of radical disruption and
accelerating change wherever and whenever such a phenomenon appears,
particularly if it manifests widely.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
  What is modern or modernist gains its meaning through negation,
  as a rebellion against what once was or was presumed to be. Just as
  adjectives such as <I>tall</I> or <I>big</I> have meaning only in
  reference to other adjectives like <I>short</I> or <I>small,</I> the
  relational meaning for <I>modern</I> (and its siblings) exists within
  a comparative binary in which the opposite is <I>traditional.</I>
  Neither term has a fixed or universal meaning in and of itself, but
  rather acquires meaning only in relation to its implied opposite. Where
  tradition signals the unfolding of the future within the continuous
  pathways of the past, modernity calls for perpetual subversion of the
  past as the precondition of the future.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Relationally speaking, modernity is the insistence upon the Now--the
present and its future as resistance to the past, especially the immediate
past. It establishes a cult of the new that constructs retrospectively a
sense of tradition from which it declares independence. Paradoxically,
such a tradition--or, the awareness of it as "tradition"--might come
into existence only at the moment of rebellion against it.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Precisely because a relational definition does not seek the fixity of
nominal definitions, modernity need no longer reside solely in a specific
set of institutional, ideological, or aesthetic characteristics emergent
in the post-Renaissance West, radiating globally along the pathways
of empire and postcoloniality, and appearing as pale copies of western
genius. Instead, a particularized modernity located in space and time
could potentially emerge wherever and whenever the winds of radical
disruption blew, the conditions of rapid change flared up, or the
reflexive consciousness of newness spread--whether these were eagerly
sought or resisted; whether imposed from without or developed within.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
But the relational approach to defining <I>modern/modernity/modernism</I>
raises as many questions as it appears to resolve. First, there is the
impossibility of perpetual disruption or revolution as change becomes
institutionalized. What begin as multiple acts of rebellion against
prevailing hegemonies become through their very success a newly codified,
often commodified system. Margins become centers with the proliferation
and dissemination of rupture. In intellectual and aesthetic realms,
for example, outsiders become insiders; pariahs become icons; the rebels
become the Establishment.

<B></B>

The new science of the Enlightenment that overturned the symbolic order
based on religious faith itself became the hegemonic norm based in a
faith in Reason. The avant-garde artists initially greeted with hoots
of derision--the impressionists, postimpressionists, cubists, abstract
expressionists--are now the great masters whose works are mainstays of
museums and sell for fabulous sums. Rejected, banned, ridiculed, and
often unread in the beginning, res like Freud and Joyce are for many
the supreme avatars of the age, essential reading in any history of ideas
and literature. As Raymond Williams argues, the antibourgeois origins of
modernism are lost as modernism is canonized in the post-World War II era.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
  As the principle of disruption, the more widespread modernity
  becomes, the more codified and authoritative it becomes, thus
  undermining its character as the spirit of explosive rebellion and
  change. Institutionalized, the avant-garde of rupture becomes the new
  Establishment to be revoked in the making of new avant-gardes. The
  very success of modernity (and its modernist expressivities) evident
  in its institutionalization accomplishes its demise--the imperative
  of postmodernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Second, for all its insistence on the new, a relational modernity is
inevitably part of a generational dynamic. Modernity rebels against
its parental precursors, only to be rebelled against by its inheritors:
yet another form of the family romance. It occupies an uneasy location
between the <I>pre</I>-modern that it disrupts and the <I>post-</I>modern
that disrupts it. Never fully stable, it exists in the middle of a
prepositional chain, defined by its coming <I>after</I> the traditional
and <I>before</I> the postmodern.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Third, this chain of prepositions in generational succession
challenges the relational assumption of freedom from history. The
(self)consciousness of modernity--the sense of radical rupture from
the immediate past--refuses the principle of historical continuity and
evolution in its insistence on origin, newness, and revolution. Indeed,
it denies its own production as a historical formation. History produces
change as well as continuity; the new cultural and institutional
formations of modernity are themselves the product of historical process.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Moreover, the relational notion of modernity tends to resist just the
immediate past, often leapfrogging the prior generation in a reinvocation
of a more distant past as an inspiration of rebellion. To justify this
rejection, inaccurate or heuristic readings or even demonizations of
one's recent precursors are common, much as the modernists (inaccurately)
condemned the Victorian realists to epistemological and psychological
na&iuml;vet&eacute;, much as the postmodernists (inaccurately) reduce
the modernists to mere makers of Enlightenment grand narratives. As
Paul de Man suggests in echoing Nietzsche, modernity involves a form of
"ruthless forgetting," the "<I>desire</I> to wipe out whatever came
earlier," not the actual erasure of the past.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
  As such, the relational consciousness of modernity is based in
  historical illusionism--an insistence on "making it new" as a manifesto
  that refuses to acknowledge the presence of the past in the present
  and future. The more modernity protests its absolute newness, the more
  it suppresses its rootedness in history. And the more that history is
  repressed, the more it returns in symbolic forms to haunt and disrupt
  the illusionary and ideological mythology of the new.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
A relational approach to defining <I>modern/modernity/modernism</I>
presumes the possibility of consensual agreement about the meanings
of the terms as the structural principle of radical rupture--wherever,
whenever, and in whatever forms it might occur. Freed from the fixity
a noun suggests, the relational definition appears to garner more
agreement across and within disciplines. However, a closer look reveals
a pattern of contradiction just as the nominal approach does. Like the
noun <I>modernity,</I> the adjectival form slips and slides between
meanings rooted in the possibility and impossibility of "making
it new." If the adjectival form of <I>modernity</I> signifies both
revolution and evolution, both the break from history and its return,
of what descriptive use is it?

<P ALIGN="CENTER">
* * *

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Both nominal and relational meanings of <I>modern/modernity/modernism</I>
end in contradiction, signaling a phenomenon that signifies both the
formation of hegemonies and their dissolution, the production of grand
narratives and their dismantling. As noun and adjective, <I>modernity</I>
is a term at war with itself, a term that unravels its own definition,
a term that codifies the principle of indeterminacy and in so doing
opposes its own commitment to perpetual change.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
   In sum, the grammatical/philosophical approach to a definitional
   project confirms the partial and misleading nature of any definition
   that focuses on only the nominal or only the relational meanings of
   modernity. Modernity is not solely a fixed set of characteristics
   that might have appeared in a given space and time, such as the
   European Enlightenment or the twentieth-century avant-garde in the
   arts. Nor is modernity exclusively the principle of rupture. Modernity
   is best grasped as a set of meanings that encompasses both the
   specificities of nouns and the relational structures of comparative
   adjectives. Additionally, this combined approach suggests that meaning
   does not lie exclusively with either the formation of hegemonies or
   their dismantling. Instead, modernity encompasses both centripetal
   and centrifugal forces in contradiction and constant interplay. I
   pose this neither as a concept of historical stages nor as a utopian
   dialectic. Rather, I insist upon a meaning produced liminally in
   between, a dialogic that pits the contradictory processes of formation
   and deformation against each other, each as necessary to the other.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Political/Cultural Route:</B> The grammatical/philosophical excursions lack
historical and geographical contextualization, lack reflexivity about the
production and consumption of meaning, lack attention to issues of power
and the institutionalization of knowledge in the definitional project
itself. Definitions don't come into being or function in an abstract
cosmos of pure reason or arbitrary signification. (<I>Pace</I> linguists
and philosophers: decontextualized definitions have their place, but only
a partial one in the arena of contestation.) The textual unconscious of
definitional debate is also a political unconscious. More issues must be
posed under a broadly defined umbrella of cultural studies in historical,
global, and comparative contexts.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We need to ask: Who is producing a given set of meanings for
<I>modern/modernity/modernism</I>? For what audience? From what position
or standpoint in space and time?

<B></B>

For what purpose and with what effect? What cultural work do these
meanings perform? In what way was and is modernity a set of cultural
formations with diverse parts and functions, manifesting differently in
various temporal and spatial situations, with different effects? How do
power relations condition the production, dissemination, and reception of
contested meanings? In short, how do questions of power and politics shape
both the concept of modernity and the historical phenomena to which the
term refers? These are questions upon which a cultural studies approach
to definitional power relations focuses.

Modernist studies tends to produce three distinct conrations

The definitional act itself typically depends upon a binary of inclusion

belong to the category of <I>modern,modernity,</I> or <I>modernism.</I>
Other phenomena do not. By definition. Definitional acts establish
territories, map terrains, determine centers, margins, and areas
"beyond the pale." Attempts to establish permeable borderlands instead
of fixed boundaries and liminal spaces of considerable intermixing
between differences diffuse to some extent the territorial imperative of
definition but cannot ultimately eliminate the function of categories to
demarcate some phenomena in opposition to others which do not belong. As
Toni Morrison writes about canon formation (a type of definitional act
in literary, art, and religious history), "Canon building is Empire
building. Canon defense is national defense. Canon debate, whatever the
terrain, nature and range . . . is the clash of cultures. And <I>all</I>

their roots in specific characteristics of European history and have few
parallels in prior periods or in other cultural settings. If, in close
conjunction with one another, they have since swept across the world,
this is above all because of the power they have generated. . . . Is
modernity distinctively a Western project in terms of the ways of life

To what extent does this definition reflect the western standpoint of

definitional binary of inclusion/exclusion is profoundly Eurocentric, all
the more so when the approach is more nominal than relational? (No.) Such
Eurocentrism is pervasive in the field whether the writer is celebrating
(like Habermas) or critiquing (like Harvey) western modernity. Left
intact is a center/periphery model of globalization in which the West
invents and exports, while the periphery assimilates and copies. Left
unexamined is the degree to which the production of western forms of
modernity resulted from the heightened interaction western societies
had with nonwestern others--with the Other of the western imaginary;
and, with the real, heterogenous, multiplicitous others outside the
West. Also left unexplored is the production of different modernities
through the histories of nonwestern peoples.

Listen to the difference between Giddens's binarist logic and that evident

I have tried to argue that modernity is historically a global and
<I>conjunctural</I> phenomenon, not a virus that spreads from one place
to another. It is located in a series of historical processes that brought
hitherto relatively isolated societies into contact, and we must seek its
roots in a set of diverse phenomena--the Mongol dream of world conquest,

societal change brought about by a combination of new technologies,
knowledge revolutions, state formations, and expanding intercultural
contacts contribute to radical questioning and dismantling of traditional
ontologies, epistemologies, and institutional structures? What about the
Tang Dynasty in China, with its great metropolis as the cultural/political
center of a vast empire (about 600-900 a.d.)? Or Mughal India? Or

  Defining historical periods and conditions or movements in the arts and
  writing depends upon a circular process. Definers often identify the
  characteristics of the <I>modern, modernity,</I> and <I>modernism</I>
  by describing the qualities of the phenomena that they have already
  assumed to exist within the boundaries of the category. Put differently,
  definitional mapping relies upon prior

assumptions of where the boundary belongs, assumptions that reflect the
preexisting beliefs or standpoint of the mapmaker. Such circularity has
a politics--all the interests are vested, as Morrison says.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Take for example the literary history of modernism. Periodization,
canonization, and the naming of the defining characteristics of
modernism are all based on a pool of tenets, people, and/or events whose
selection depends upon preexisting notions of the period. Thus, Hugh
Kenner declares that expatriate internationalism is a central defining
characteristic of High Modernism and uses writers like Pound, Eliot,
and Joyce to demonstrate his assertions. On this basis, he asserts that
Williams, Faulkner, and Woolf are "provincial" or "regional" writers,
not modernists. But if he had included these writers in his pool of
modernists to begin with, his generalizations about modernism would have
been different. So might his concept of the internationalism of modernism
if his pool had included writers from Africa, South America, and Asia.

The case of the Harlem Renaissance in modernist studies is even more
striking. The literature, arts, and music of African Americans centered in
Harlem in the 1920s and 1930s are simply missing from conventional maps of
modernism. Not even represented with an occasional token re, as female
modernists like Woolf and Stein sometimes are. Simply not there. Picasso's
primitivism, Fitzgerald's Jazz Age, Eliot's apelike Sweeney, Sherwood
Anderson's "dark laughter," Faulkner's racially divided South--all
exist on the terrain of canonical modernist studies. But not the primary
producers of jazz, not the black artists turning to an imaginary (or real)
Africa, not the blues singers and the folk, leaving the rural South for
the urban North in the Great Migration, not the soldiers returning from
a brutal war to demand more freedoms. Their linguistic and rhythmic
experimentation, intertextual "signifyin,'" Africanist mythmaking,
parodic mimicry, revolutionary fervor, and self-identification with
the New do not seem to qualify them for literary modernism in most
histories of the movement even though these same histories frequently
list formalist experimentation, citation, mythic analogues, irony, and
self-reflexivity as definitional markers. Since the Harlem Renaissance is
largely absent from the pool of texts out of which literary historians
generate definitional characterizations of modernism, the particular
formulations of modernity produced by African Americans are also missing.

Another form the politics of definition takes is the identification
of certain res or qualities to stand for the whole. This metonymic
substitution of the part for the whole is widespread in the establishment
of the reigning characteristics of the historical condition of modernity
or the aesthetic constellation of modernism. To some, Locke or Rousseau
are supreme embodiments of Enlightenment modernity; to others, Joyce
is the defining icon of modernism. Similarly, some might characterize
western modernity in terms of the rise of the bourgeoisie, democracy,
and science; others might define modernism in terms of utopian social
planning or the poetics of disruption. Common to all such definitional
generalizations is the heuristic tendency to characterize

<B></B>

the whole in terms of what the historian retrospectively believes to be
its most influential or significant components. In this way, categories
like modernity and modernism govern or contain different cultural
formations, absorbing their specificities within the definitional
boundaries of the privileged metonymic part. And such categorical
discipline returns us to the locational question of who is producing
these metonymic histories. Who and what has been left out? For what
purposes? With what effects?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The tendency of binarist, circular, and metonymic definitional
acts to reproduce the play of power relations within institutions
of knowledge might lead some to affirm the need for epistemological
anarchy--the elimination of all such periodizing categories. However,
the problematic of definitional history should not, in my view, result in
its abandonment. Rather, as Jameson writes, "The problem of periodization
and its categories, which are certainly in crisis today . . . seem to
be as indispensable as they are unsatisfactory for any kind of work
in cultural study" (<I>PU,</I> 28). Without historical categories, we
would face an infinity of singularities, an approach to knowledge that
requires some form of selection that is no more politically neutral
than the heuristic construction of historical narratives. Without some
definitional categories, the politics of choice would be driven further
underground, rendered even less visible.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Given our need for definitional categories, however imperfect they are,
what, then, does the political/cultural route have to offer? I regard the
binarist, circular, and metonymic problems inherent in definitional acts
not as dead ends but rather as opportunities for interrogation that lead
right into the heart of the dialogic meanings of <I>modern, modernity,</I> and <I>modernism.</I> They insist upon a recognition of how such
terms are themselves historical constructions--with their own history,
development, function, and effect, all of which invite interpretation and
critique. Different conrations of modernity reflect the different
positionalities of their producers, serve different interests, and
have different effects. It is this which returns us to the question of
politics--how power relations inform not only the cultural artifacts of
modernity but also the subsequent readings of them.

Whether the BangClash of definitional contestation produces such
transformative beauty is doubtful. But this excursion--through the byways
of story, parataxis, hypertextual detour, aphorism, and collage--has
an end point. I have been resisting the desire to come up with my own
product, yet another definition of <I>modernity</I> and

<B></B>

<I>modernism</I> for others to argue about or ignore. (Resistance is
never easy. The magnetic slide toward fixed meaning feels irresistible
at times.) Instead, I have attempted to shift attention to the processes
and patterns of definitional contestation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In these terms, there is a conclusion of sorts to be made. Definitional
dissonance matters. The fact of not only diverse but downright opposite
meanings signifies. These differences should not be ignored as accidental
or arbitrary, the ordinary product of disciplinary background or semantic
disagreement. Nor should they be tamed within the deceptive inclusiveness
of pluralism. In practice, the pluralization of <I>modernity</I> and
<I>modernism</I> runs the risk of covertly reinstating a center/periphery
pattern in which a hegemonic norm is covertly privileged over marginal
variations.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
  Instead the BangClash should be confronted directly.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The grammatical/philosophical and political/cultural
routes I explored suggest that the oppositional meanings of
<I>modern/modernity/modernism</I> point to the contradictory
dialogic running through the historical and expressive formations
of the phenomena to which the terms allude. Order and disruption are
symbiotically necessary to each other for each to have its distinctive
meaning. The center comes into being as it dissipates. Modernity's grand
narratives institute their own radical dismantling. The lifeblood of
modernity's chaos is its order. The impulse to order is the product of
chaos. Modernism requires tradition to "make it new." Tradition comes
into being only as it is rebelled against. Definitional excursions into
the meanings of <I>modern,modernity,</I> and <I>modernism</I> begin and
end in reading the specificities of these contradictions.

In ways different from my own, others have noted contradictions in
passing or in an attempt to resolve the conflict. See for example Rita
Felski's <I>The Gender of Modernity</I> (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard
University Press, 1995), where her succinct summary paves the way
for her advocacy of a cultural studies approach to western modernity
from the Enlightenment to its break up in the early twentieth century
(12-3); hereafter abbreviated as <I>GM</I>; Bernard Yack's <I>The
Fetishism of Modernities: Epochal Self-Consciousness in Contemporary
Social and Political Thought</I> (Notre Dame, Ind.: Notre Dame University
Press, 1997), where he reviews four distinct concepts of modernity in the
West (philosophical, sociological, political, and aesthetic) and argues
that for all their differences they share "an emphasis on innovation and
challenge to traditional authority" (35, 1-40); hereafter abbreviated
as <I>FM</I>; Eric Rothstein emphasizes the heterogeneous distributions
of modernity within the modern while refusing nominal, relational,
and stagist approaches in "Broaching a Cultural Login of Modernity"
in <I>Modern Language Quarterly</I> 61, no. 2 : 359-94; and
Marshall Berman's <I>All That Is Not Solid Melts into Air</I> resolves
the contradictions with a notion of evolutionary stages within modernity.

I do not examine the term <I>modernization</I> because there is more
consensus about its basic meaning as the process that brings about
<I>modernity</I> (however that may be defined); debates about the causes,
effects, and politics of modernization of course abound.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a NAME="FOOT19" HREF="#REF19">19</A>.
The relation between the terms <I>modern/postmodern</I> and
<I>modernism/postmodernism</I> is as contested as the meanings of the
root words and beyond the scope of this essay. Many social theorists use
<I>postmodern</I> or <I>postmodernism</I> to refer to the rupture from
Enlightenment modernity, regarding the aesthetic dismantlings of this
modernity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as early harbingers of
the change to come later and more broadly in the twentieth century. What
many others understand to be modernity and modernism are thus folded into
postmodernism. See for example Lyotard, <I>The Postmodern Condition</I>
and Harvey, <I>The Condition of Postmodernity.</I> Because of the
inconsistency in terminology, their critiques of societal modernism
are often misunderstood to be attacks on aesthetic modernism as
well. The difficulty in determining whether postmodernism represents an
intensification of modernism or a radical rupture from it is compounded
by these differing uses of the terms <I>modernity/modernism</I> and
<I>postmodern/postmodernism.</I> Left unexplored is the possibility that
the most significant break from modernity is just now in the making,
through the knowledge revolution instituted by the computer and the
related effects of accelerating globalization.

Although some scholars invoke one mode rather than the other, many use
both. See for example Anthony Giddens's nominal assertion in <I>Modernity
and Self-Identity: Self and Society in the Late Modern Age</I> (Stanford,
Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1991), 14-5: "I use the term
'modernity' in a very general sense, to refer to the institutions and
modes of behavior established first of all in post-feudal Europe, but
which in the twentieth-century increasingly have become world-historical
in their impact. 'Modernity' can be understood as roughly equivalent to
'the industrialised world', so long as it is recognised that industrialism
is not its only institutional dimension." But in a relational mode,
he writes, "Inherent in the idea of modernity is a contrast with
tradition." <I>The Consequences of Modernity</I> (Stanford, Calif.:

The association of modernism and modernity with Europe and the United
States in the humanities not only excludes nonwestern locations but
also contains peripheries within "the West"--including, for example,
margins based on gender, race, and geography, namely those of women,
ethnic and racial minorities, and locations such as Spain, Portugal, the
Balkans and Eastern Europe, Brazil, and the Caribbean. See for example

In developing a "scalar" model of modernity in "Broaching a Cultural
Logic of Modernity," Eric Rothstein works with a relational mode in
describing societies as "hot," "warm," or "cold" in reference to how
intense or pervasive the phenomenon or phenomenology of rupture are in
a given time and space. His relational approach to periodization takes
into account the heterogeneity within any so-called period at the same
time that some measure of nominal generalization is acknowledged.
