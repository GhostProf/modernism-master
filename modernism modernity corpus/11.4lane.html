Although critics have tried parsing Lawrence's philosophical claims, turning them into coherent propositions, his fiction not only thwarts these efforts but renders them futile, even obsolete. The four protagonists in <i>Women in Love</i> can't decide, for instance, whether the apocalyptic scenarios plaguing them herald their extinction or promise tentative forms of renewal. Coupled with Lawrence's episodic and repetitious style, their rancorous exchanges yield only fleeting clarity. Viewed overall, the novel appears contradictory, the characters flailing as they try to specify what they think and want. In themselves worth studying, these effects can mask the novel's best points about personal and impersonal forms of violence.
</p>

<p>
Completed in 1916 at the height of World War I, <i>Women in Love</i> shares with near-contemporaneous works by Saki (H. H. Munro) and Wyndham Lewis an acute fascination with its protagonists' specific and inchoate hatreds, as well as with humanity's extinction. Far from protecting us from such enmity, these works 

<b></b>

almost recklessly embrace it, insisting, as Rupert Birkin does in Lawrence's novel: "What people want is hate&#x02014;hate and nothing but hate."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Turning such arguments against jingoism and toward an almost ethical relation to other people, Birkin adds that profound disaffection with humanity and a willingness to renounce the world display intellectual honesty and even moral courage. "People don't really matter," he tells Mrs. Crich in the second chapter, "It would be much better if they were just wiped out. Essentially, they don't exist, they aren't there" (<i>WL,</i> 73).
</p>

<p>
While domestic rancor, sexual strife, and interpersonal contempt partly account for this animosity, the novel's inchoate forms of hatred end up representing violence as a metaphysical attribute&#x02014;a "palpable revelation of mystic otherness" (<i>WL,</i> 403). Somewhat paradoxically, given the unavoidable presence of World War I, Lewis in particular joins Lawrence in releasing suffering and violence from military conflict, freeing them to represent apocalypse oxymoronically, as peaceful and painless. One effect is to countermand notions of democracy by highlighting their reliance on hypocrisy and cant. Thus Birkin tells Hermione during one especially explosive incident, "Your democracy is an absolute lie&#x02014;your brotherhood of man is a pure falsity" (<i>WL,</i> 161). Another, more paradoxical effect is to recast anti-Semitism and other forms of prejudice by advancing impersonal perspectives on hostility. Lawrence developed this last emphasis in <i>Women in Love</i> by twinning eschatology with mindlessness, a happy reprieve from the "anguish of consciousness" (<i>WL,</i> 432).<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  As the war's carnage was unprecedented, resulting in the death of some 8.5 million soldiers and up to 13 million civilians, this approach to violence&#x02014;whether provocative or callous&#x02014;deserves careful examination.
</p>

<p>
Later sections of this essay indicate how Lawrence's and Lewis's similar perspectives on violence depart from Edwardian patriotism and fears that Germany might invade Britain, the latter helping to intensify the country's xenophobia and anti-Semitism. William Le Queux's <i>Invasion of 1910,</i> Erskine Childers's <i>Riddle of the Sands,</i> and H. G. Wells's <i>War in the Air,</i><sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  popular in their own right, drew for inspiration on such cautionary works as Lord Balfour's <i>Decadence: Henry Sidgwick Memorial Lecture</i> , published three years after he'd served as Prime Minister; Archibald Hurd's "England's Peril&#x02014;Invasion or Starvation"; and Elliott Mills's anonymous 1905 Tory pamphlet, <i>The Decline and Fall of the British Empire,</i> a satirical "account of those causes which resulted in the destruction of our late Ally, together with a comparison between the British and Roman Empires. Appointed for use in the National Schools of Japan. Tokio, 2005."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Reviewed prominently by several mainstream newspapers, the latter text circulated widely.
</p>

<p>
Several legislative measures also point to the Edwardians' growing xenophobia. The 1905 Aliens Act&#x02014;based on the Report of the Royal Commission on Alien Immigration, two years earlier&#x02014;recommended curbing immigration, weakening the legal status of so-called "undesirable aliens" in Britain, and excluding Jews.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  A resurgence of British anti-Semitism occurred several years later, too, owing partly to the 1909 "Tottenham Outrage," which resulted in three deaths and sixteen injuries, and especially to the 1911 Sidney Street siege, also occurring in East London, in which two Latvian immigrants (part of the Gardstein gang) held out against almost one thousand 

<b></b>

policemen, marksmen, and armed artillery.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Three police officers died during the bungled robbery that led to the siege and roughly two thousand rounds of ammunition were fired in a matter of days. Aided by the absurd presence of Winston Churchill, then Home Secretary, the press used the event to turn national opinion against "the abuse of this country's hospitality by . . . foreign malefactors."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  The police received little assistance from local residents, many of them Jews from Russia and Latvia, who had fled from persecution abroad; hundreds of Londoners in fact turned out to witness the battle. Several months earlier, the classicist George Frederick Abbott had alluded to the "Tottenham Outrage" in "The Jewish Problem," published in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i> in April 1910. And despite favoring the country's acceptance of Jews, he pointed skeptically to multiple signs, political and social, that anti-Semitism was too widespread in Britain to enable their full integration.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
These and other events help contextualize the works I'll discuss, especially as comparable prejudice sometimes punctuates Lawrence's and Lewis's fiction. Completing his anti-Semitic story "The Unrest-Cure" the year that the Sidney Street siege erupted and a few months after "The Jewish Problem" appeared in print, Saki arguably went furthest among the three writers in dramatizing xenophobia, thereby narrowing a gap between cultural and psychic violence that Lawrence and Lewis tried strategically to widen. Yet none of them merely echoed ideas reverberating in their culture, and invoking the context of prejudice is helpful only to a degree, because their literature surpasses it, raising broader questions about national loyalty, group ties, and responsibility to the world at large. Lawrence, in particular, insisted that aspects of life display an "untranslatable otherness," something which historicist criticism tends to ignore.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Conceptually rich and nondoctrinaire, his fiction indicates with Lewis's and Saki's how, during wartime, imaginary violence is both over- and underdetermined, freeing readers from history and catastrophe while also binding us to a different set of cultural and psychic concerns&#x02014;the consequences, in particular, of our noxious pleasure and misanthropy. As Lawrence fulminates in <i>Fantasia of the Unconscious</i> , "Oh, ideal humanity, how detestable and despicable you are! And how you deserve your own poison-gases! How you deserve to perish in your own stink!"<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Here, as elsewhere, his anger oscillates between two extremes, disparaging cultural ideals that exhort us to attain impossible perfection while heaping contempt on humanity's ongoing, hubristic bid to attain that goal. Like his characters, too, Lawrence's fiction distinguishes only hazily between personal and impersonal violence. Still, it's necessary to engage his, Saki's, and Lewis's claims about hatred, and to resist the urge to dismiss their fantasies as politically grotesque. My essay hews this vexed, sometimes nebulous line. While dismissing works distances critics from what we analyze, generating false comfort, it replicates a problem that Lawrence especially tried to solve. A stolid commitment to engaging such fantasies is thus, I believe, the only responsible way to understand not only imaginary violence, but also why anti-Semitism and pre-Holocaust fantasies flourished in wartime fiction.
</p>

<p>
Voicing "radical antagonism" (<i>WL,</i> 335) with relentless persistence, <i>Women in Love</i> complicates two modernist principles that critics have tended to idealize: a notion of 

<b></b>

flux, on the one hand, and literature's alleged ability to save us from the catastrophes of history, on the other. Lawrence thwarts both principles by augmenting his characters' petty rivalries into fierce clashes of impersonal will. He styles rivalry, as do Saki and Lewis, as a volatile dialectic between freedom and commitment, movement and stasis, violence and tranquillity&#x02014;an "eternal see-saw," as the narrator puts it, with one person "destroyed that the other might exist, one ratified because the other was nulled" (<i>WL,</i> 542).<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  One aspect of this seesaw is that Lawrence nudged his characters toward radical forms of self-divestiture. The narrator of <i>Sons and Lovers</i> calls Paul Morel "infinitesimal, at the core a nothingness, and yet not nothing"; indeed, after his mother dies, Morel feels "press[ed] . . . into extinction."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  A similarly spare conception of subjectivity drives <i>Women in Love</i> and Lawrence's other postwar works (Harold Bloom calls this his "apocalyptic vitalism").<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  What remains hauntingly open-ended in Lawrence's fiction is the relationship between these forms of violence and the meanings&#x02014;and even ethical principles&#x02014;that he ascribes to them.
</p>

<p>
If we wanted examples of petty rivalry in his fiction, we wouldn't have very far to look. Describing the first signs of domestic misery in Walter and Gertrude Morel's marriage, the narrator of <i>Sons and Lovers</i> alludes to a "bloody battle," (<i>SL,</i> 22) before using the noun or verb <i>battle</i> twenty-two more times in that novel, just a few times less than the noun/verb <i>torture</i> and the adjective <i>tortured</i> (at thirty-two times).<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Prone to similar hyperbole, the narrator of <i>Women in Love</i> calls Birkin's engagement argument with Ursula "a crisis of war" that erupts after "the old way of love" is pronounced "a dreadful bondage, a sort of conscription" (<i>WL,</i> 387, 269). Their row turns an ordinary patch of woodland into a "memorable battle-field" (<i>WL,</i> 393), and so on. Nevertheless, the "war" in both novels loses psychological specificity rather than gaining it. So although the context of militarism underwrites Lawrence's argument in the later novel, interpersonal friction governs his overall conception of the social, not the reverse.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> <i>Women in Love</i> adopts military rhetoric when theorizing social antagonism, that is, but forms of impersonal violence overwhelm the conflict and possible victory. Critics interested in the context of Lawrence's writing often view this emphasis as one of his most irritating, but the argument here is better inverted: Lawrence's willingness to bracket social determinants in fact gave him new ways of conceptualizing human relations, based precisely on their "untranslatable otherness," their inchoate difficulty.
</p>

<p>
Violence in <i>Women in Love</i> tends to connote a force independent of persons, with the power to erase deficiencies in humanity and thus to bring about a blissful state of nonbeing. "Mindless at last" is the supreme achievement of Birkin and Gerald's "gladiatorial" wrestle, because it lets them "wait . . . dimly, in a sort of not-being, for many uncounted, unknown minutes" (<i>WL,</i> 349, 350). Lawrence admires this ontological unraveling; it leaves the men "vague and unestablished" and results in general formlessness, as though "the world [were] sliding, everything [were] sliding off into the darkness" (<i>WL,</i> 351, 349). By pressing violence beyond psychological causes, the narrator credits it with significance surpassing group and individual motivations. Paul Morel describes a similar phenomenon in <i>Sons and Lovers</i>: "To be rid of our individuality, which is our will, which is our effort&#x02014;to live effortless, a kind of conscious sleep&#x02014;that is very beautiful, I think&#x02014;that is our after-life&#x02014;our immortality" (<i>SL,</i> 331-2).

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
These elliptical claims highlight the effort required to live effortlessly in Lawrence's imaginary worlds, but merely invoking that paradox doesn't alter its efficacy in his fiction. <i>Women in Love</i> in particular styles impersonal violence ascetically, as a path to self-divestiture and nonbeing; it also harnesses several determinants, including acute misanthropy, to achieve these ends. The novel lets the characters extend domestic conflict into a realm that is "stark and impersonal and beyond responsibility," because personhood is no longer relevant there (<i>WL,</i> 208). Assessing Ursula's "exquisite force of hatred" for Rupert after his bungled proposal of marriage, for instance, the narrator observes: "Her relation was ultimate and utterly beyond words, the hate was so pure and gem-like. It was as if he were a beam of essential enmity, a beam of life that did not only destroy her, but denied her altogether, revoked her whole world. . . . It stunned and annihilated her" (<i>WL,</i> 267, 268).<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Even when described metaphorically, with Lawrentian hyperbole, these fantasies often glide into genocidal contemplation as characters train murderous rage into apocalyptic visions. The idea of ridding the planet of humanity intoxicates especially Birkin, because it seems to promise an ecological harmony that's impossible without humanity's extinction. He speculates as well that the impulse to rob others of life is exquisitely pleasurable and even ethically defensible, because it stems from contempt for their noxious joy. Nor is he alone in voicing this fantasy or experiencing a rage so extreme it briefly obliterates consciousness. In the novel's opening chapter, in which Ursula and Gudrun observe a local wedding, Gudrun is overwhelmed by disgust at the townspeople: "A sudden fierce anger swept over the girl, violent, and murderous. She would have liked them all to be annihilated, cleared away, so that the world was left clear for her" (<i>WL,</i> 59-60). Still, Birkin tries to depersonalize these fantasies, musing periodically that his hoping for "a world empty of people, just uninterrupted grass, and a hare sitting up" is "the most beautiful and freeing thought." "I would die like a shot," he later tells Ursula, "to know that the earth would really be cleaned of all the people. . . . Then there would <i>never</i> be another foul humanity created, for a universal defilement" (<i>WL,</i> 188; italics in original).
</p>

<p>
Although it's tempting to connect these statements to Lawrence's antitechnological modernism&#x02014;apparent in the opening paragraphs of <i>Sons and Lovers</i> and in "Odour of Chrysanthemums" &#x02014;such claims are only partly correct and by no means limited to his work. Similar, intense beliefs haunt other examples of Georgian literature, provoking in post-1918 writers the retrospective fantasy of an Edwardian Arcadia, whereby the fantasy becomes all the more urgent because the desired serenity is impossible to recover.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  As Lawrence put it elliptically, "Something very good, and poignant to remember, now the whole world of it is lost."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Calling "'16, '17, '18, '19" "awful years," he inveighed against the "terrible, terrible war" that created a "sudden presence of murder in the air," letting loose on England "a wave of criminal lust."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Countless poets and novelists voiced analogous claims about prewar culture, trying mentally to replace the carnage with images of a pastoral sanctuary. Among such idealizations are Siegfried Sassoon's memoirs, Rupert Brooke's "Soldier"  and, to a lesser degree, Robert Graves's "To Robert Nichols," which asks its addressee, in plaintive recognition of all now lost:

<b></b>

<blockquote class="poetry">

</blockquote>

<p>
But Lawrence arguably went furthest in tying such "recollections" to almost Edenic conceptions of <i>non</i>being. As Birkin explains, "I want to be gone out of myself, and you to be lost to yourself, so we are found different" (<i>WL,</i> 255). This shift in emphasis highlights our interpretive difficulty: While intense fantasies about prewar life seem proportional to perceptions of devastation outlasting the conflict, Birkin's belief in global perfectibility can't finally integrate or curb the novel's austere misanthropy, its yearning for a "humanless world" (<i>WL,</i> 188).<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Accompanying Lawrence's account of impersonal violence is his attempt at reconceiving character, a logical extension of his intellectual aims: "You mustn't look in my novel for the old stable <i>ego</i>&#x02014;of the character," he told Edward Garnett in a well-known letter, disdainful of nineteenth-century thoughts on motive and personality. "There is another <i>ego,</i> according to whose action the individual is unrecognisable, and passes through, as it were, allotropic states which it needs a deeper sense than any we've been used to exercise, to discover are states of the same single radically unchanged element."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  Here, Lawrence revokes, rather than reforms, conventional ideas about self-strangeness by pushing subjectivity into a different experiential register. Similar aesthetic impulses recur in <i>The Man Who Died,</i> his last novel, where the narrator describes the violence of "men and women alike . . . mad with the egoistic fear of their own nothingness," (<i>MWD,</i> 38) and in the late poem "Death Is not Evil, Evil Is Mechanical," where the speaker calls "the obscene ego"
</p>

<blockquote class="poetry">

<br />

<br />

<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Once we dismiss such orthodox notions of character, Lawrence implies, the ego can no longer recognize itself or its place in the world. The individual must develop new relations to others, based paradoxically on a willingness to forgo self-understanding&#x02014;even if this hastens death.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  The narrator of <i>Women in Love</i> calls this "lapsing out" of familiar selfhood (<i>WL,</i> 94, 245, 320, 353, 399), repeating a phrase from <i>Sons and Lovers</i>;<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  and Birkin endorses this idea when insisting, somewhat confusedly: "At the very last, one is alone, beyond the influence of love. There is a real impersonal me, that is beyond love, beyond any emotional relationship" (<i>WL,</i> 207-8). For other writers, "impersonal me" would be oxymoronic. That Lawrence yoked these terms highlights competing tensions that his novel explored but can't ultimately resolve.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Despite his frustration with Lawrence's didacticism, Lewis shared his belief that postwar attempts at restoring selfhood were misleading&#x02014;indeed, repressive and de-sexualizing. "To 'develop the personality' is an alluring invitation," he observed in "An Analysis of the Mind of James Joyce" , "but it invariably covers some process that is guaranteed to strip a person bare of all 'personality' in a fortnight. This does not seem to me necessarily a bad thing. I am only pointing out that this excellent result is obtained by fraud. So we must not take that fraud too seriously, however much we may applaud its aims."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  That Lewis was thoroughly critical of Lawrence, calling him a "preacher" and "insufferable moralist," doesn't obviate their shared conceptual goals, as I'll explain in the final section of this essay.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
How, then, do impersonal, self-divesting impulses manifest in their fiction, and why in Lawrence's case do they so often fail? Leo Bersani explains that Lawrence viewed the drives motivating individuals as "attempts to enlarge on or to obliterate the very field in which the anecdotes of personality are possible."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  "Attempts" is the operative word. Impersonality is Lawrence's imaginary path to nonbeing, an ideal representing nonviolent detachment, but neither outcome is possible without the type of agitation or unrest that strips individuals of their fantasies and attachments. Unrest is part of the alleged "cure," in other words, because it compels the ego to relinquish all self-serving illusions. All the same, stasis is a condition his characters attain only fleetingly, and&#x02014;doubtless related&#x02014;Lawrence was generally more adept at critiquing the ego than imagining what might replace it. Self-divestiture therefore tends to be gestural in his work, an aspiration his characters forestall in fierce reenactments of will; overall, <i>Women in Love</i> alternates between canceling individuality and restoring a type of oneness that reinstates fantasies of self-harmonious and proprietary consciousness.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Exemplifying the latter tendency, Hermione Roddice, Birkin's first serious lover and a satirical portrait of the bohemian patroness Lady Ottoline Morrell, garners most disdain in the novel by epitomizing an alternative, idealized, yet ultimately ego-bound notion of harmony. Striving to conceive of equality between men and women, and among humankind, she exaggerates the possibility of eventual peace: "<i>If</i> . . . we could only realise, that in the <i>spirit</i> we are all one, all equal in the spirit, all brothers there&#x02014;the rest wouldn't matter, there would be no more of this carping and envy and this struggle for power, which destroys, only destroys" (<i>WL,</i> 161; italics in original). When contradicted by Birkin, though, she erupts in rage, looking "at him with leering eyes, along her cheeks. He could feel violent waves of hatred and loathing of all he said, coming out of her" (<i>WL,</i> 162). Hopelessly confused and self-ignorant, Hermione grasps Birkin's thoughts on the fiction of democracy only "in her unconscious self" (<i>WL,</i> 162).
</p>

<p>
Yet the sadistic fantasies that erupt after Hermione's "humiliation" not only shape this novel, but also generate a form of enjoyment that Lawrence views as inseparable from hatred and, later, as its tautological explanation. Since all his protagonists experience joy when contemplating what's most nauseating about other people, they indicate the centrality of this phenomenon in affairs both amorous and political, showing in the process how psychic concerns can thwart democratic aspirations. Arguably more 

<b></b>

self-oriented than even the other characters', Hermione's excitement is so ebullient that she almost swoons at the thought of anticipated vengeance:

<p class="noIndent">
As Hermione strikes Birkin repeatedly with a stone, the act gives her "unutterable satisfaction" (<i>WL,</i> 163). Indeed, guilt, reason, and above all love fail to restrain her: "She must smash [his head], it must be smashed before her ecstasy was consummated, fulfilled for ever. <i>A thousand lives, a thousand deaths mattered nothing now,</i> only the fulfillment of this perfect ecstasy" (<i>WL,</i> 163; emphasis added).
</p>

<p>
This "voluptuous" joy often recurs in Lawrence's, Saki's, and Lewis's fiction, generating apocalyptic scenarios spawned by their characters' insatiable hostility. One sees the philosophical effects of such depersonalized perspectives, too, in paintings like Paul Nash's <i>We Are Making a New World</i> (1918; <a href="#1"> 1</a>) and Lewis's disturbing <i>Inferno</i> (1937; <a href="#2"> 2</a>). In the former&#x02014;a polluted but otherwise empty landscape by the First World War's official British artist&#x02014;the rising sun, shorn of conventional symbolism, spotlights an ownerless, unmappable terrain that repeated military conflict seems to have desecrated. The land is thus inimical to life. The repetition of forms in Nash's painting blocks regeneration, illustrating the fundamental paradox of his title: the new world we are making may have no place for us. In Lewis's painting, completed shortly before the outbreak of World War II and thus both prescient and retrospective in its haunting vision of hell, a heap of corpses with grinning skulls seems to embrace&#x02014;and perhaps also to strangle&#x02014;faces and bodies that are featureless, sexless, and barely human. One can't establish whether some of them are sleeping or dead, the others laughing in erotic pleasure or orgiastic violence. Any exit from Lewis's inferno is blocked, moreover, by another group of formless, unidentifiable bodies.
</p>

<p>
Both paintings represent ideas similar to Lawrence's fiction, though the latter differs from Nash in accepting that "voluptuous" joy is both a precondition for intimacy and an unpleasant residue limning our relation to other people. Lawrence also indicates in <i>Women in Love</i> that <i>less</i> (not more) consciousness might thwart our reliance on such volatile ecstasy. While attempting to curb its symptomatic power, that is, he augments a desire for integrity based, as in Nash's and Lewis's paintings, on nonbeing. Torn between these irreconcilable aims, the novel's desire for integrity clashes with its interest in "self-obliterat[ion]" and "lapse[s] into unknowingness" (<i>WL,</i> 65, 94).
</p>

<p>
But because Lawrence shows how easily Hermione's ecstasy would let her ignore "a thousand deaths," he clarifies&#x02014;without endorsing&#x02014;the psychic constituents of a holocaust. Educating us erratically in crises of propinquity through its diligent exposure

<p class="noIndent">
of unexamined hatred, <i>Women in Love</i> may in fact be viewed as a defense against militarism and fascism. Granted, this reading differs from literalist approaches to his work, in which the representation of ideas seems equivalent to their authorial endorsement (Lawrence apparently must condone what he describes). But, crucially, Lawrence represents a space between fantasy and act; his characters' dilemmas aren't simple substitutes for his own; and what is discussed&#x02014;and sometimes enacted&#x02014;in his fiction is preventable in life.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Above all, in discussing humanity's impulse to commit atrocities, Birkin spotlights a painful gap between what we claim to advance (democracy, brotherhood, interpersonal union) and what we secretly hanker for (apocalypse, extinction, nonbeing). His claim that violence springs partly from a murderous dimension of joy also probes self-directed antagonism and what many assume is a better remedy: repression-induced tolerance. The latter downplays mundane acts of complicity and passive acquiescence, rendering exceptional such complex factors as the obscene "ecstasy" that can accrue from another's suffering.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  As long as we repress this unpleasant truth, implies Lawrence's protagonist, humankind will reel from one bloodbath to another, oblivious to the tragic reasons for this repetition.
</p>

<p>
We secretly yearn for mass destruction, claims Birkin, whose insistence on this "seeth[ing]" quality of desire rebukes progressivist assumptions underlying such disparate philosophies as Benthamite Utilitarianism, Comtean Positivism, and Christian teleology (<i>WL,</i> 238). "We always consider the silver river of life, rolling on and quickening all the world to a brightness, on and on to heaven, flowing into a bright eternal sea, a heaven of angels thronging," he tells Ursula sardonically, "but the other is our real reality . . . the dark river of dissolution.&#x02014;You see it rolls in us just as the other rolls&#x02014;the black river of corruption" (<i>WL,</i> 238). Once estranged from this destiny, a result of our commitment to identity, we are, according to Birkin, more likely to provoke destruction unthinkingly.
</p>

<p>
Before we champion the examined life as our panacea, however, Lawrence complicates matters by representing consciousness as part of the problem. Birkin's philosophy hinges on both meanings of <i>integrity</i>&#x02014;honesty and completeness&#x02014;and though the first quality in <i>Women in Love</i> (and in <i>Fantasia of the Unconscious</i>) is conceptually precise, the second (wholeness) is not. Birkin holds tenaciously to both meanings when developing his thoughts on nonbeing, but by the end of the novel honesty and completeness seem mutually exclusive, and even self-canceling. One reason for this is Birkin's psychic and conceptual problems marrying another's self-completion to his own. As Michael Levenson observes, Birkin finds it easier to tolerate nothingness, oneness, and even multiplicity than duality. Another's self-regard disgusts him when it collides with his own.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Hermione's outburst against all "unthinkable evil obstruction[s]" certainly influences&#x02014;and, to some extent, justifies&#x02014;Birkin's contempt for humans' bad faith (<i>WL,</i> 163). But as he inveighs against this dishonesty, acute misanthropy overwhelms his argument, tipping it toward an apocalyptic extreme that isn't vastly dissimilar from Hermione's. Inadvertently endorsing her "voluptuous ecstasy," Birkin allows contempt 

<b></b>

for the horde to trump his own commitment to self-divestiture. Alluding to the war, he invokes the forces marshaled for national defense, suggesting these be used against a population crying for more violence while it pretends to advocate peace:

<p>
Voicing many of Lawrence's thoughts on democracy's "absolute lie" (<i>WL,</i> 187) as well as his profound despair at the "idiocy" of the war, Birkin could seem merely an authorial puppet here.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Partly owing to the horror of this war, and Lawrence's ill-health, increasing poverty, and bitter frustration at the immediate suppression of <i>The Rainbow,</i> he and Frieda Weekley left Britain in 1919, returning later, sporadically, but only for brief visits.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  Frieda's nationality was itself a political issue, of course, and while still in Britain she and Lawrence were treated like German spies. This may have heightened his sense of national betrayal, as well as the violent collisions that <i>Women in Love</i> stages between Eros and politics. Before the war, he and Frieda traveled in Germany and across the Alps, but thereafter they moved restlessly from Italy to Sicily, Ceylon and Australia to New Mexico, and from Mexico back to Italy, with Lawrence concluding his life in the south of France. Presumptions about Lawrence's exact relation to his fiction are, however, misleading. Although Lawrence was interested, around August 1915, in developing an ideal community (Rananim) in Florida, later relocated in 1921 to Taos, New Mexico,<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Birkin shuns such aspirations and promptly returns us to the obstacle of other people's noxious joy. His fantasy of renewal reinforces, rather than discredits, Hermione's ecstatic disregard for other people and Gudrun's fleeting dream of a global massacre.
</p>

<p>
<i>Women in Love</i> forks when engaging these pleasures. One strand continues associating impersonal violence with eschatology, but the other strand, repsychologizing this violence with a vengeance, ties it explicitly to Judaism. When expounding on this joy, then, the novel appears most anti-Semitic. In "Cr&#x000E8;me de Menthe," an earlier chapter satirizing vacuous hedonism in bohemian London, the character Pussum denounces a man for whom Gerald conceives a mild erotic attraction, calling Julius a contemptible Jew (<i>WL,</i> 124).<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  And in Birkin's second statement about "dirty" humanity, he pronounces a fervent desire to "be rid of the most ghastly, heavy crop of Dead Sea fruit, the intolerable burden of myriad simulacra of people, and infinite weight of mortal lies" (<i>WL,</i> 187). The allusion is somewhat elliptical, referring to the ancient cities of Sodom and Gomorrah (built by the shores of the Dead Sea, too salty to sustain life), but the metaphor reinforces anti-Semitic associations running throughout the novel. When decrying the "apples of Sodom," Birkin also implies that the annihilation of Sodomites&#x02014;a noun originally denoting the inhospitable&#x02014;would help precipitate global serenity.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
This dynamic recurs at various points in the novel, showing how quickly the "eternal see-saw" of human relations can degenerate into warlike conditions among competing groups and societies. The novel's conception of nature doesn't soften this problem, but exacerbates its effects by insisting that competition and strength are appropriate correctives to otherwise forceless characters and enfeebled relations. Similar notions recur in <i>Fantasia of the Unconscious,</i> especially in the chapter "The Lower Self," and one of many examples in the slightly earlier <i>Women in Love</i> is Gerald's reactionary commentary on patriotism and race. Unlike Birkin's well-marked fantasies of self-obliteration, however, Gerald's operate in the service of the ego, as triumphant contempt for weaker people and nations. At such moments, the novel's impersonalist conception of violence reverts clumsily to an ego-based psychology, and thus to all of the problems stemming from proprietary consciousness:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
"A race may have its commercial aspect," [Gerald] said. "In fact it must. It is like a family. You <i>must</i> make provision. And to make provision you have got to strive against other families, other nations. I don't see why you shouldn't." . . .
<p class="blockquote">
"I must say," said Birkin, "I detest the spirit of emulation." . . .
<p class="blockquote">
"But," Gerald insisted, "you don't allow one man to take away his neighbour's living, so why should you allow one nation to take away the living from another nation?"
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p>
If readers accept Gerald's vexed simile that a "race . . . is like a family," must they also "make provision" for a family's or nation's surplus enjoyments? This question stems from the novel's foundational metaphors and perspective on interpersonal friction, obliging characters to recognize why they experience other people's lives and satisfactions as abhorrent, repulsive. Hermione is surely right to ask whether "the patriotic appeal [is] . . . to the racial instinct," but Gerald wins the argument at its most elemental (<i>WL,</i> 77). "If I go and take a man's hat from off his head," he responds, "that hat becomes a symbol of that man's liberty. When he ts me for his hat, he is ting me for his liberty" (<i>WL,</i> 78). Hermione might well accuse him of vulgar materialism and Birkin later insinuate that Gerald suffers from barely repressed violence, but by that point we know that Hermione's and Birkin's idealisms betray extreme fantasies of their own. "Sometimes you talk pure nonsense," Gerald insists when responding to the charge of repressed violence. "As a matter of fact, none of us wants our throat cut, and most other people would like to cut it for us" (<i>WL,</i> 82). Freud, to name just one influential thinker, would later base much of <i>Civilization and Its Discontents</i> (1929, revised 1930) on a similar idea. When engaging, as does Lawrence, with the biblical commandment to love thy neighbor as thyself, Freud responded provocatively with blankness: "Why should we . . . ?"<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
"To make provision you have got to strive against other families, other nations": this sententious idea strengthens Gerald's reactionary politics, forging an imperialist link between his patriotism and the novel's account of nature. Birkin and Gudrun can offer only misanthropy or dreams of humanity's extinction as weak alternatives. The novel can't resolve this principal difficulty, as I mentioned earlier, since its model of ego-based violence and impersonal conception of character pull in contrary directions.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Unable to resolve this impasse without lapsing into fractiousness, <i>Women in Love</i> highlights the repercussions of not leaving room for other people's enjoyment. When the two primary couples travel to the Tyrol, in southern Germany, Gudrun's disgust resurfaces as violent contempt for Gerald. She flirts extensively with Loerke, a German sculptor whose work, displaying "a frenzy of chaotic motion," at first seems inimical to Gerald's vision of the world (<i>WL,</i> 517). Birkin, Gerald, and eventually Ursula despise Loerke's granite frieze, but Lawrence leaves us in no doubt that Loerke's fascination with "org[ies] of enjoyment" reproduces, in distorted form, their aversion to others' noxious pleasure. He represents, that is, what they merely enunciate.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The voluptuous joy guiding Lawrence's account of hatred also recurs when Gerald and Birkin, ruminating on "stages further in social hatred" (<i>WL,</i> 522), try to explain Gudrun's fascination with the sculptor. Having insisted that "women want . . . some satisfaction in basic repulsion" (<i>WL,</i> 522), Birkin says that Loerke "lives like a rat, in the river of corruption, just where it falls over into the bottomless pit. . . . He <i>hates</i> the ideal utterly, yet it still dominates him. I expect he is a Jew&#x02014;or part Jewish" (<i>WL,</i> 522-3; italics in original). When Gerald agrees, owing partly to jealousy, Birkin finds the hitherto missing "logic" of his assumption, the conclusion making unpleasant sense of his fantasy: "He is a gnawing little negation, gnawing at the roots of life" (<i>WL,</i> 523).
</p>

<p>
We might be tempted to leave things here, dismissing Birkin (and perhaps Lawrence) as anti-Semitic. Given the latter's and other writers' concern with group antagonism, their characters' phobic fantasies are easily perceived as projections of "the Other," a term conflating sundry monsters of alterity. This reading isn't entirely wrong: Lawrence, Lewis, and others do sometimes negate Jews and many others, and among Lawrence's preposterous statements in <i>Fantasia of the Unconscious</i> is his apparent belief that "the Jewish mind insidiously drives us to anarchical conclusions," a statement appearing just after his admiring claim that "the Jewish intelligence for centuries has been picking holes in our ideal system&#x02014;scientific and sociological" (<i>FU,</i> 181). But such emphasis fails to grasp the psychic rationale for Lawrentian antagonism, tending also to imply that the principles motivating Christian men differ qualitatively, even structurally, from those galvanizing other groups. According to <i>Women in Love,</i> by contrast, everybody lives in a state of near-constant antagonism with everyone else.
</p>

<p>
Rather than advancing unequivocal prejudice, then, <i>Women in Love</i> arguably educates us in crises of propinquity. Lawrence tracks the paths of his characters' perverse excitement and violence as they t to sustain ecstasy at the expense of others&#x02014;often the very people they claim to love and need most. At this interpersonal level, the effects can be facile, even tediously predictable. When expanded (as the novel encourages) into a general statement about failed sociability and a metaphor for international conflict, however, the argument is bracing and poignant. Like several of his contemporaries, Lawrence finds it impossible to conceive of intimacy devoid of violence. So, rather than taking a superior stance and denouncing the novel's anti-Semitism and misogyny, we might read the novel's ceaseless antagonisms as indicating why individuals and groups fail to coexist, despite striving otherwise, because their identities impinge on and deplete those with whom they joylessly collide.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Recognizing that this dynamic surfaces in works pushing for a similar redefinition of character, let me pause and glance back at a text that is less ingenuous about its motives and the paradoxes it unearths.

<p class="noIndent">
Noting humanity's complex multiplicity in his <i>Commonplace Book,</i> Saki stressed the resilience of several peculiar traits. "Man was a being with myriad lives and myriad sensations," he declared with Wildean overtones, "a complete multiform creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and passion, and whose very soul was tainted with the monstrous maladies of the dead."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  As partial confirmation of this statement, Saki wrote brilliantly crafted tales and novellas whose key trait is gleeful malice. His witty dandies frequently humiliate hapless strangers, distant relatives, and unwelcome guests. Less well-known is a quasi-genocidal fantasy he wrote in 1911, "The Unrest-Cure," which represents its imagined violence as a boyish prank upsetting a sedate English village. Like <i>Women in Love</i> and Lewis's <i>Apes of God</i> , Saki's story highlights disturbing eschatological impulses and impersonal forms of violence.
</p>

<p>
Hector Hugh Munro (pseudonym Saki; 1870-1916) was a complex re who renounced his homosexuality as a symptom of fin de si&#x000E8;cle decadence. Before he died ting in World War I, he promoted an austere, almost fascistic love for Britain and its waning empire. His 1914 novella <i>When William Came</i> joined Le Queux's <i>Invasion of 1910</i> and other texts in predicting that unless Britain adopted harsher military policies, Germany would soon occupy London and England's southern counties.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  A nostalgic paean for Victorian imperialism, the novella also wrestles with a belief that Germany is superior to Britain and better suited to world rule.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  This identification with power recurs in Saki's other fiction: <i>Beasts and Superbeasts</i> , his fifth collection, turns stories about various animals into allegories of human treachery. These works mix Saki's urbane dandies, incongruously, with the militaristic fervor that punctuates Munro's contemporaneous journalism.
</p>

<p>
"Nearly every red-blooded human boy has had war, in some shape or form, for his first love," Munro intoned in one article, adopting the kind of rhetoric that Lawrence would later parody.
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
If his blood has remained red and he has kept some of his boyishness in after-life, that first love will never have been forgotten. No one could really forget those wonderful leaden cavalry soldiers. . . . There were other unforgettable memories for those who had brothers to play with and t with, of sieges and ambushes and pitched encounters, of the slaying of an entire garrison without quarter, or of chivalrous, punctilious courtesy to a defeated enemy. Then there was the slow unfolding of the long romance of actual war, particularly of European war, ghastly, devastating, heartrending in its effect, and yet somehow captivating to the imagination. . . . The thrill that those far-off things call forth in us may be ethically indefensible, but it comes in the first place from something too deep to be driven out; the magic region of the Low Countries is beckoning to us again, as it beckoned to our forefathers, who went campaigning there almost from force of habit.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup> 

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Munro tries to soften his admission that war "may be ethically indefensible" by declaring that violence in "nearly every red-blooded human boy" derives "from something too deep to be driven out." Joining numerous militarists, he uses the second claim to argue that war is fit, even inevitable, and thus implies that it is ethically <i>defensible.</i> The word "nearly" is also a crucial qualifier in his argument, as Saki elsewhere berated effeminate men for treating the First World War as theater: "The 'Boys of the Lap-dog breed' remain trilling their songs, capering their dances, [and] speaking their lines as complacently as though no war was in progress." "They have set themselves as something apart," he opined, "and after the War let them be treated as something apart, something human and decorative and amusing; but something not altogether British, not exactly masculine, something that one does not treat as an equal."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  "It is inconceivable," he added in a different article dating also from 1915, "that these persons were ever boys, they certainly have not grown up into men; one cannot call them womanish&#x02014;the women of our race are made of different stuff. They belong to no sex."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  Here, strangely, Saki sounds very much like Lawrence in <i>Fantasia of the Unconscious</i> and <i>Aaron's Rod.</i>
</p>

<p>
But complicating Munro's resolve is his self-incarnation as "Saki," borrowed from the last stanza of <i>The Ruba'iyat of Omar Khayyam</i> (first English translation 1859), which plays archly on his own homosexuality (Saki was an Oriental Ganymede). His heroes, confirmed bachelors, are liminal res testing the separation of masculinity and femininity, as well as childhood and the adult world. To this extent, Munro's pen name and most of his fiction epitomize the "trilling" and "capering" he later would denounce.
</p>

<p>
This oscillation between dandyism and militarism points to a tension in not only Munro's identifications, but also British culture at the turn of the century. Consider Ford Madox Ford's willingness to echo Kipling's famous mantra, published a decade earlier, about the White Man's Burden. In his 1909 editorial to the <i>English Review,</i> Ford exhorted readers to assume "the duty of an Imperial race," since in his words Britain stood "in a different plane of civilisation from almost all our neighbours," and should thus "be prepared, for the sake of humanity to be able, not only to maintain ourselves but to maintain the integrity of the nations most allied to us in the love for peace and civilisation."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Other signs of this cultural shift and increased conservatism include the trials and imprisonment of Oscar Wilde, legislative efforts to curb homo- and heterosexual prostitution in London and other British cities, and a bizarre libel case following the first performance in England of Wilde's decadent play <i>Salom&#x000E9;,</i> fully eighteen years after he had died.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  At one point in 1918, the trauma Wilde allegedly had caused England in 1895 scandalously was invoked as a reason the country was losing the war.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
When he alludes to the "monstrous maladies" tainting man's "soul," Saki seems unconsciously to repeat how Wilde represented his imprisonment, in <i>The Ballad of Reading Gaol</i>  and <i>De Profundis</i> , and to corroborate his own journalistic assertion that the "ethically indefensible" is "too deep to be driven out."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Indeed, Saki's phrase highlights both his identificatory dilemmas and those of the time (he and Wilde shared several friends, including Robert Ross and publisher John Lane). His 

<b></b>

appeal to depth may appear antimodernist, but "monstrous maladies" captures some of the Imagists' contempt for the ornamental. Overall, Saki was obsessed with the "ethically indefensible," and mined it for all its comic and macabre potential.
</p>

<p>
Yet even in comparison with his other fiction, "The Unrest-Cure" takes this principle to an extreme. The story is disturbing and jarringly effective, because it toys with the effects of under- and overreading: Downplay its subject and one risks trivializing the prejudice it exploits; focus only on its anti-Semitism, by contrast, and one misses its comic pretensions. The narrator archly insists that two key elements of English life, the Church and Boy Scouts, foster iniquity rather than purity. To that end, the story is mordantly funny. Still, Munro's almost fascistic politics complicates any formalist pleasure this light-hearted "masterpiece" can generate. No&#x000EB;l Coward makes this point when introducing Saki's <i>Complete Works,</i> and his assessment is notable because most Saki critics avoid mentioning, much less discussing, the story.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  Munro's biographer merely adds, imprecisely, that the protagonist "thinks he is safely entombed in the country, and then a religious war breaks out on his doorstep" (<i>SLM,</i> 214).
</p>

<p>
The story begins in a train compartment. Clovis, one of Saki's recurring heroes, overhears a conversation between an unnamed friend and J. P. Huddle, who is visiting his sister in a quiet English village. Mr. Huddle admits to his friend that although his life is dreary, change upsets him: "I'm not much over forty, but I seem to have settled down into a deep groove of elderly middle-age. My sister shows the same tendency. . . . We both feel that . . . change is unnecessary, and just a little irritating" (<i>CS,</i> 127). The friend responds: "You've heard of Rest-cures for people who've broken down under stress of too much worry and strenuous living; well, you're suffering from overmuch repose and placidity, and you need the opposite kind of treatment" (<i>CS,</i> 128).<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  Asked for examples, the friend suggests visiting one of the Apache quarters of Paris or giving lectures in Berlin claiming Gambetta wrote most of Wagner's music.
</p>

<p>
Clovis decides to concoct Huddle's "Unrest-cure" by pretending to be Prince Stanislaus, secretary to the local bishop. After sending Huddle two contrived telegrams, Clovis persuades him that the Bishop will soon visit to plan a local massacre. "Tonight is going to be a great night in the history of Christendom . . . We're going to massacre every Jew in the neighbourhood" (<i>CS,</i> 129). Dumbstruck and indignant, Huddle first insists that the Bishop is "tolerant, humane," then exclaims, "He will be hanged!" before concluding: "But there aren't thirty Jews in the whole neighbourhood" (<i>CS,</i> 129). "We have twenty-six on our list," Clovis-as-Stanislaus responds. "We shall be able to deal with them all the more thoroughly" (<i>CS,</i> 129).
</p>

<p>
"Most of the killing will probably be done on the staircase," he adds breezily, insisting that he has sent "to the <i>Martin</i> and <i>Die Woche</i> . . . some photographs of [Huddle] and [his] sister" (<i>CS,</i> 130). When Sir Leon Birberry, "one of the most respected [Jews] in the country," arrives following Clovis's second telegraph, a "now thoroughly panic-stricken" Huddle hauls an astonished, "protesting" Birberry upstairs (<i>CS,</i> 131), while Clovis, sipping tea alone, plans his next move. After several hours, he tells Huddle that the Bishop will kill only with cold steel: "The Bishop does not see why a man should not be a gentleman as well as a Christian" (<i>CS,</i> 132). Clovis then vanishes, his unrest 

<b></b>

cure successful, leaving his now-hysterical victims to guess the meaning of his practical joke. Apparently, they grasp it none too quickly, and in mock-gothic language the narrator explains why: "[Al]though [Clovis] had left them for ever, the lurking suggestion of his presence haunted the lower regions of the house during the long hours of the wakeful night, and every creak of the stairway, every rustle of wind through the shrubbery, was fraught with horrible meaning" (<i>CS,</i> 132).
</p>

<p>
These plot details crystallize our interpretive dilemma when reading this macabre tale. While the suggestion of a massacre in a quiet English village is deliberately incongruous, "The Unrest-Cure" exploits many ironies, only the most obvious of which is its horrific anticipation of the Holocaust. That Saki's story should predict a similar event in 1911 as the "absurd" culmination of widespread Edwardian anti-Semitism sadly is not, as we've seen, especially remarkable.<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  Yet since English villages are, to some, the last places one would expect to find extreme violence, they are for comic purposes the most appropriate. Saki stages their repressive manner as a form of quiet viciousness requiring only the right catalyst to explode.
</p>

<p>
"The Unrest-Cure" strikes a frivolous tone, perhaps eliciting nervous laughter in readers, but should we read it only as a farce? If the joke is innocuous in Clovis's and Saki's minds, why are its final elements "fraught with horrible meaning"? Why, too, does Huddle's exclamation, "This thing will be a blot on the Twentieth Century!" draw from Clovis the disturbing rejoinder: "And your house will be the blotting-pad" (<i>CS,</i> 131)? Since anti-Semitic pamphlets were circulating as Saki was writing, claiming that "members of a foul Asiatic breed, composed of swindlers, thieves, anarchists and socialists . . . have captured and corrupted our Press, debased our politics, lessened our commercial fame, tainted our social life, filled our cities with vice, crime, and disease, and in other ways played the ingrate and traitor to the people they batten on, and the country they plague," his story arguably appealed to several constituencies as horrific wish fulfillment.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  For contemporary readers incapable of reading this story without judging it prescient, on a scale involving not one village, but millions of Jews from across central and eastern Europe, "The Unrest-Cure" represents the Holocaust as possible&#x02014;even desirable&#x02014;in a "civilized" community of rural England. One wonders, with hindsight, whether a different end to World War I, with the Treaty of Versailles generating crippling poverty and hyperinflation in Britain, could have sparked more anti-Semitic bloodshed in that country.<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Although such juxtapositions downplay the story's formal strengths and ghoulish humor, "The Unrest-Cure" works (as its title promises) by denying us interpretive comfort. The story's debt to <i>schadenfreude</i> isn't apparent without some relation to historical context yet, as in <i>Women in Love,</i> context alone can't explain, or fully absorb, its complex fantasy structure. Additionally, as in works by Lawrence and Lewis, Saki highlights a volatile gap between "character" and fantasy that manifests forms of exuberance and cruelty generally inimical to Edwardian society. In the story "Esm&#x000E9;," for instance, a hyena slinks around southern England, waiting to maul unwatched babies (<i>CS,</i> 101-5). At the end of "The Interlopers," wolves set upon squabbling neighbors (<i>CS,</i> 452). The list of examples proliferates, showing how Saki capitalizes on gleeful

pleasures that accrue from others' misery, one reason readers find his work amusing, even disturbingly satisfying. As we saw earlier in <i>Women in Love,</i> there is pleasure in depleting another's joy, especially if that joy is perceived as ill-gotten. Hence the anti-Semitic pamphlet, cited above, referring not only to outright theft and parasitism, but also to Jews as "receivers, perjurers, forgers and swingers." Indeed, as Abbott notes in parentheses, after representing these terms, "([t]here follow twelve more epithets of like flavour)," all signaling a reckless&#x02014;even ecstatic&#x02014;multiplication of synonyms.<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>  Strikingly, the three writers examined here aren't simply preoccupied with this dynamic; they base new conceptions of character on its precarious outcome.
</p>

<p>
The narrator of "The Unrest-Cure" distinguishes firmly between persons and entities, telling us that luggage belonging to "'J. P. Huddle, The Warren, Tilfield, near Slowborough'" sits atop "the human embodiment of the label" (<i>CS,</i> 127). In this way, he alerts us to a gap between Huddle's ontology and his social role.<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  The tale exploits this gap to Gothic effect, creating a monstrous antidote to English village life, but in doing so it magnifies a dimension of fantasy reducible to the control of neither the subject nor those who "enjoy" the imagined outcome. Clovis saunters off at the end, eschewing responsibility for his prank and the suffering it causes, but such narrative open-endedness in Edwardian fiction is notable. Perhaps it's also more ethical than at first it seems.
</p>

<p>
Reminding us that noxious enjoyment can arise from identity's radical incompletion, "The Unrest-Cure" exposes the havoc that fantasies like Clovis's can create. To that end, we could read the story counterintuitively, in ways similar to Lawrence's postwar narrative, as alerting us to the catastrophe it seems to presage. Like <i>Women in Love</i> and <i>The Apes of God,</i> "The Unrest-Cure" draws on eschatology without countenancing extinction; it does so by nudging Huddle and his sister toward "self-abolition" while ultimately protecting them from that catastrophe. The postman's arrival the next day "finally convince[s] the watchers that the Twentieth Century was still unblotted," but of course we can't read this line (or the story overall) and share the characters' relief (<i>CS,</i> 133). Perhaps only in hindsight, Saki's short story resembles a "hygienic practice of nonviolence," a phrase that Leo Bersani uses when arguing that the ego represents difference as a menacing threat to its specious coherence. "As soon as persons are posited," he declares, "the war begins."<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  The point for Bersani is that anti-identitarian fiction&#x02014;a term including the three central texts I discuss here&#x02014;does more than betray the ego's violent appropriation of reality; it also compels the subject to establish a new relation to the world.

Also intelligible in light of Bersani's argument, Lewis's <i>Apes of God</i> offers similar antifascist means of coping with propinquity. It does so not despite, but because of its endless fascination with the noxious pleasure of proximate groups. Such claims may strike Lewis's readers as preposterous, even as complicit with his apparent disdain for Jews, suffragettes, homosexuals, and so on. Many of these statements surface in <i>Tarr</i> 

<b></b>

 and recur in <i>The Art of Being Ruled</i>  and <i>Men without Art</i> . In the second text, Lewis amplifies the apparent "R&#x000F4;le of Inversion in the War on the Intellect" and calls "The 'Homo' the Child of the 'Suffragette'"; in the third text, the paradigm flips as he forges outrageous links between homosexuality and aggression: "And I suppose if you are homicidal, or homosexual, it is the same thing, it is all for the best or worst in the best or worst of all possible worlds."<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  Yet Lewis also shows that group antagonism is the norm rather than the exception (see, for example, his 1937 antiwar design, reprinted in <i>The Revenge for Love</i> [<a href="#3"> 3</a>]); and, like Freud, he asks us to consider whether demanding peace is less appealing, psychically, than professing outright enmity.<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Above all, Lewis's obsession with stereotypes makes him a brilliant commentator on group fantasy. This counterintuitive approach to his work differs, I grant, from those who avoid reading or teaching him because his stereotypes are offensive. Lewis has in this regard suffered a fate worse than Lawrence's, but such responses preempt discussion without resolving anything. One hardly need add that if texts aren't read or published&#x02014;or even if they are burned&#x02014;the scope of related fantasies isn't markedly diminished.
</p>

<p>
After Lewis traveled in Germany, explains Hugh Kenner, he saw Jews and Gentiles as people who "had cheerfully turned themselves into racial stereotypes," a statement that helps explain Lewis's rationale in <i>The Apes of God.</i><sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  "I think [it could] quite safely be claimed," Lewis added, "that no book has ever been written that has paid more attention to the <i>outside</i> of people."<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>  Stressing externality, Lewis eschewed "the <i>inner method"</i> of characterization as inappropriate for satire.<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>  Careful to avoid missing a mannerism, he also devoted over six hundred pages to perfecting his stereotypes, the result being a curious blend of satire and affection. Finally, like Lawrence and Saki, he opens a crucial interpretive space between stereotypes and the res they designate, which makes Lewis more radical than most contemporary critics seem willing to admit.
</p>

<p>
One critic has called <i>The Apes of God</i> "an outburst of mirth at our expense," but the expense is really to identity as such.<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>  Calling such laughter "caddish,"<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>  Lewis used it to skewer British affection for its aesthetic gods, falsely elevated in his mind, whose work and aims are entirely self-serving. Many of these false gods are Jewish and homosexual, signaling Lewis's attack on Bloomsbury and its allies ("Pierpointeans" in the novel, after the mysterious Pierpoint, who never appears). Bloomsbury was the main target of his "fiction-satire," because that group generally rejected satire and by his lights promoted a tepid definition of the artist and writer; but snobbery and parochialism riled Lewis most. "A sort of clinical religion is being built up to accommodate us," he explained in <i>The Art of Being Ruled,</i> four years earlier. "In every case it is our weakness, our smallness, our ignorance, or our dementia that is catered for."<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
According to Paul Edwards, Lewis's "analysis is ideological, and implies no disapproval or approval of actual women, homosexuals or others except insofar as particular people allow themselves to be uncritically socially determined by the ideological stereotypes Lewis identifies."<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>  Although well taken, this point represents the novel as 

<b></b>

satirical <i>and</i> politically correct, a defense that's especially futile because Edwards determines exactly whom Lewis was satirizing (his afterword supplies a list). Like many other satires, <i>The Apes of God</i> exults in being politically offensive. Still, Edwards implies correctly that homosexuality and Judaism weren't in themselves Lewis's target: what irked him was conceit and complacency, attributes irreducible to any single constituency.</p>

Rather than gauging the novel solely at the level of content, then, it seems more useful to determine what Lewis's preoccupation with homosexuality and Judaism tells us about the terms of his irritation and enjoyment. As before, with Lawrence and Saki, this approach insists that fiction isn't a loose conration of authorial wish-fulfillments (Lewis conceived of character and art in anti-intentionalist ways) and that fiction engaging an inhuman or impersonal register <i>neither reproduces nor corresponds to subjectivity.</i> "<i>Deadness</i> is the first condition of art," explains the eponymous protagonist of <i>Tarr.</i> "The second is absence of <i>soul,</i> in the sentimental human sense." 

<b></b>

"The lines and masses of the statue are its soul," he continues, repudiating Paterian impressionism; "No restless, quick flame-like ego is imagined for the <i>inside</i> of it. It has no inside. This is another condition of art; <i>to have no inside,</i> nothing you can <i>see.</i>"<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>  Such anti-identitarian statements not only break with anthropomorphism, as <i>Women in Love</i> tried and ultimately failed to do, but also compel us to read Lewis's work in nonmoral ways. To put this another way, critics reading his work through the lens of identity politics inevitably generate misprision.
</p>

<p>
Hostile to Stalinism and capitalism, as well as to modernists' belief in the redemptive power of art,<sup><a name="REF68" href="#FOOT68">68</a></sup>  Lewis tried to destroy authoritarianism in all its obvious and insidious guises. "I believe I am alone among writers today," he declared,

in advocating no partisanship in the political field. Most adopt one of the two conventional extremes&#x02014;Marxism or royalism. But I am neither a King's Man nor a Collectivist. I am sure that no royalist's king today can be anything but a dangerous and mercenary puppet&#x02014;that is as far as I go. Bad as Marxism may be (and it is now openly proclaimed&#x02014;and lauded by those who sponsor it&#x02014;as the terrorist absolutism of a Ghenghiz Khan), it cannot be much worse than the feudal and post-feudal monarchies of Europe. <i>Human life had better, here and now, and once and for all, be accepted as a very bad business indeed.</i><sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup>

Lewis wrote this in 1933-34, shortly after traveling to Germany, where he completed <i>Hitler,</i> a journalistic report published in 1931, two years before Hitler came to power. Profoundly depressed by the onset of World War II, he concluded <i>Men without Art</i> by saying that "we are merely <i>talking</i> monkeys . . . [but] enabled . . . to <i>know</i> that we are animals" (<i>MWA,</i> 231-2; italics in original). Later recanting in <i>The Hitler Cult</i>  and in his intellectual autobiography <i>Rude Assignment</i> , he called his short-lived interest in fascism "well-meaning imbecility . . . occupied . . . with the great and futile effort to avoid" war.<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup> <i>Rude Assignment</i> is itself partly an attack on Hitler's "idiotic hatred of the Jews."<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>  For many critics, then as now, the damage done by <i>Hitler</i> was irreparable, tarnishing Lewis's career and work. Yet, ironically, while his frustration with orthodoxy and identity politics gives his work fresh relevance today, Lewis's work actually warrants rereading in a less ideological light.<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In Part I of <i>The Apes of God,</i> Archie Margolin, a young Jew from London's East End, supplants the nineteen-year-old simpleton Daniel Boleyn as the object of Horace Zagreus's affection. (Mr. Zagreus, considerably older, fawns on beautiful young men, and Lewis based him partly on Virginia Woolf's friend Horace de Vere Cole.) When he learns this news, Boleyn's "perfectly handsome features" express "the deepest melancholy" (<i>AG,</i> 42). For much of this picaresque novel, we follow Boleyn (probably based on Stephen Spender) from one disastrous encounter to the next; he can neither make sense of his treatment nor stop being a victim to manipulative older men. We also learn predictable things about Archie Margolin, "the jew-boy from the slum," who seems "ill-assorted with the feminine gold of the crimped head and the insignificance of the body" (<i>AG,</i> 44, 45): "At the thought of gain"&#x02014;that is, of earning commission selling Dick a new wristwatch&#x02014;Archie is said to "bark" with a "small short cough of 

<b></b>

half-rabid waggishness, the militant slum-Jew in excelsis" (<i>AG,</i> 46). The narrator corroborates: "Hush! The instincts of the race probably at work&#x02014;he was <i>valuing!</i>" (<i>AG,</i> 50; italics in original).
</p>

<p>
Numerous quotations amplify these grotesque stereotypes, yet no sexual, ethnic, or racial group is exempt from Lewis's "cruel caricature" (<i>AG,</i> 53). Later chapters treat us to portrayals of lesbian "apes"&#x02014;"boy-scout spinster masculine rake[s]" living in a "monstrous colony" (<i>AG,</i> 222, 226, 233)&#x02014;and to anti-Semitic accounts of Julius Ratner (John Rodker), who "coo[s]" as a "very siamese-kittenish Joo" and "wail[s] . . . very very naughty, old Joo coyly&#x02014;[giving] his bed-clothed person a horrid homosexual waggle" (<i>AG,</i> 147, 149). As in Saki's and Lawrence's fiction, such racial and sexual stereotypes doubtless make readers wince, but they force us to rethink vexed&#x02014;and even frictional&#x02014;relations among character, identity politics, and impersonal violence, in ways that content-based literary criticism and cultural politics can make impossible. Fredric Jameson helped initiate this rereading by distinguishing between Lewis's and Lawrence's models of sexuality: "The peculiarity of Lewis' sexual ideology is that, while openly misogynist, and sexist in the obvious senses of the word, it is not for all that phallocentric."<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Lewis's own statements, cited earlier, show that he was keenly aware of stereotypes in political life, and used them primarily to shatter groups' self-consoling illusions. Such perspectives are more salient than many have acknowledged. Satirizing the conspiracy theories that as Abbott showed in 1911 inform anti-Semitism, Lewis, to give just one example in <i>The Apes of God,</i> comically redefines their phobic object. We're told that James, uncle to Dick Whittingdon (the latter probably based on the painter Richard Wyndham), "has always been a man of very strong antipathies. . . . The old man's dislike of his mother-in-law was very marked at the outset. It gradually extended to the whole Scottish nation." Dick's aunt explains why:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
He became convinced that the Scottish People were aiming at a new world-hegemony, of an oppressive character that beggared description, with the noble weltstadt of Glasgow as its capital and main port, that was his persuasion, the fruit of a great deal of obscure and I fear not very creditable meditation. In every land they are to be found, he argued, in positions of the highest trust: England, he would doggedly affirm, is run by Scots&#x02014;that of course was why it was going to the dogs&#x02014;and he predicted freely that the day would come when all nations of the earth would eat porridge and worship in a kirk!

<p>
Transposing the object of Uncle James's phobia from Jews to Scots doesn't revoke the underlying basis of his fantasy, but the bathos helps diffuse it. After all, the English assert in many national jokes that Scots are mean and conniving, the English in turn playing the butt of other countries' jokes about generosity (just ask an American bartender how well English tourists tip). That Lewis cleverly displaces the phobic object in Uncle James's fantasy reappraises the potency of conspiracy theories, underscoring an obvious but still cogent point: they need no reliable basis in fact. The conflicts fueling these theories appear credible only because their advocates are impervious to evidence and contradiction. Rather than offering what Lewis called a "moralist['s]" 

<b></b>

critique of prejudice, then, <i>The Apes of God</i> satirizes how phobias with widespread political effects often stem from ridiculous notions.<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>  But while moralists, in Lewis's words, have "a strange propensity to side with the stronger and more orthodox party: they cannot even be depended on not to betray what is ostensibly their own client,"<sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>  his own brand of satire is iconoclastic. Highlighting the etiology of prejudice in a twofold joke (at Scots as well as at English perceptions of Scots), Lewis distinguishes between phobic objects and the fantasies that give them a strange patina of credibility, thereby forcing us to rethink conventional (egoic) patterns of identification.
</p>

<p>
According to Jameson, Lawrence's famous letter to Garnett "echoes Lewis' insistence on the nonmoral thrust of [satire's] externalizing discourse."<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>  This much seems substantively correct, though surely not as Lawrence's <i>echo</i> of Lewis. The former's letter dates from June 1914; Lewis's essay "Is Satire Real?"  began life two decades later as <i>Satire and Fiction,</i> a defensive appendage to <i>The Apes of God.</i> Still, as both writers address the amoral implications of impersonality, I'll conclude with Lawrence's letter on this subject: "Somehow&#x02014;that which is physic [<i>sic</i>]&#x02014;non-human, in humanity, is more interesting to me than the old-fashioned human element&#x02014;which causes one to conceive a character in a certain moral scheme and make him consistent. The certain moral scheme is what I object to."<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Ursula, in <i>Women in Love,</i> shares this perspective, insisting, "the universe is non-human, thank God!" and observing with Birkin: "How stupid anthropomorphism is!" (<i>WL,</i> 343). One sees here, once more, how impersonality helped Lawrence's and Lewis's characters thwart an ego-based humanism intent on "painting the universe with [its] own image" (<i>WL,</i> 343). What intrigued both writers was the recurrence of "non-human" impulses in humanity, an effect betraying our steadfast presumptions about what it means to be a person. Nevertheless, considering the ego's resilience and the lengths to which Saki, Lawrence, and Lewis went to destroy its false assumptions about the world, we might still wonder whether their cure&#x02014;unrest&#x02014;ended up quelling or exacerbating the disease they so cleverly maligned.

The novel makes this point most intriguingly when Winifred Crich's rabbit, Bismarck, scores Gudrun's and Crich's forearms with its relentless kicking. Alluding unmistakably to the authoritarian prime minister of Prussia from 1862 until 1890 and founder and first chancellor of the German Empire, the narrator also can't resist attaching symbolism to this domestic drama, the "long red rent" of Gudrun's forearm apparently searing Crich's brain and "the surface of his ultimate consciousness, letting through the forever unconscious, unthinkable red ether of the beyond, the obscene beyond" (<i>WL,</i> 317). Although the narrator's language is undeniably pretentious here, the example makes clear that in <i>Women in Love</i> even specific allusions to the war become conduits to the metaphysical.

The persecution and killing of Jews is centuries old, and clearly did not begin with Saki or Edwardian England. I am suggesting, however, that Saki's frivolous depiction of anti-Semitic violence and his reliance on glee partly transformed this prejudice by binding it to noxious enjoyment. Despite the growing body of literary and political criticism on British anti-Semitism&#x02014;and increasingly sophisticated approaches to Saki&#x02014;"The Unrest-Cure" remains curiously overlooked. One recent example of the latter approach (still ignoring the story in question) is Simon Stern, "Saki's Attitude," <i>GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies</i> 1, no. 3 : 275-98.

It is possibly the proximity of that insight which threatens him so much that it leads him to undermine his own conscious intent in this book: to demonstrate that he is not in fact an anti-Semite. <i>The Jews, Are They Human?</i>, an attempt to dispel his reputation as an anti-Semite, merely cemented it" .
