Djuna Barnes's notoriously difficult work has received numerous critical explications, all of which have dealt, in one way or another, with the problem of style. The most salient characteristic of Barnes's work is an ornate, circular, obscure, rambling, hyperbolic style, a style which is non-communicative and transgressive, and which is the major source of the anti-realism of Barnes's work. Barnes's writing flaunts its artificiality, the ral character of its discourse, opening up a space of unreality in a way that suggests that perhaps pure language is the real subject of her work. Any recognition of reference or content is embedded in a play of deception and truth that questions the very principle of representation. The case I wish to make here is that Barnes's transgressive and ornate style was shaped by the neobaroque, a mode recuperated from the "obsolete" styles, forms, and themes of the historical baroque by twentieth-century writers in Europe and in the Americas. 
</p>

<p>
As is well known, Barnes criticism has seen two broad phases or orientations: first, Barnes's early and high modernist critics, following her publisher and long-time friend T. S. Eliot's lead, developed the importance of style and, in keeping with New Critical readings of modernism as experimental formalism, stressed the technical design of Barnes's work. Because of its organization into static symbol patterns reminiscent of poetry, <i>Nightwood</i>, for example, was declared the paradigm of the modernist novel's "spatial form" by critic Joseph Frank.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  A new wave of feminist and new historicist critics, beginning in the 1970s, has emphasized the political and subversive aspects of her work&#x02014;her gendered modernism, critique of the patriarchal family, portrayal of lesbian culture, and parody of contemporary sexological 

<b></b>

theories (the notion of homosexuality as sexual "inversion").<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  While formalist readings of Barnes tended to focus exclusively on her so-called "masterpiece," <i>Nightwood</i>, recent criticism has brought all of Barnes's work into visibility, from her early New York journalism to her 1958 play <i>Antiphon</i> and late poetry. As a result, the Barnes canon has expanded to comprise four "major" works: the autobiographical novel, <i>Ryder</i> ; her allegorical portrait of Paris's lesbian expatriate counterculture,<i>Ladies' Almanack</i>, (also 1928); her novel <i>Nightwood</i> , and her verse play and family tragedy, <i>The Antiphon</i> .<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Reviewing the shift from "formal considerations" to "content" in Barnes criticism, Victoria Smith recently observed that "[w]hile some of these latter critics have negotiated the twin difficulties of Barnes's obscure yet beautiful language and her radical insights into the nature of history and sexuality, few have attempted to show the content of Barnes's form&#x02014;that is, what her radical narrative style might be in the service of."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Like Smith, who decodes Barnes's indirect and trope-laden style as the language of melancholia, I identify her deviant style with the neobaroque, fusing formal as well as historical and ideological considerations. To insist on the centrality of style in Barnes's work seems pertinent given that, as more than one commentator has noted, it is style, more than content, which lends unity to her work.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Furthermore, the neobaroque can establish a conversation between formalist, feminist, and new historicist readings of Barnes. It can address the question of Barnes's experimental style as well as, as Smith put it, the content of Barnes's form. 
</p>

<p>
Among the four works mentioned above, I will focus on Barnes's two "queer" texts, <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> and <i>Nightwood</i>, which are set in non-normative socio-sexual subcultures. They form the affiliative counterparts to Barnes's two fables of filiation, <i>Ryder</i> and <i>The Antiphon</i>, whose plot and characters are allegorical representations of Barnes's own biological family. Critics have noted the complementary pairing of the filiative and the affiliative, heterosexual and homosexual worlds, in all four texts.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  The result is a bifocal structure that is further developed by the simultaneous "darkening" of both the world of the patriarchal and birth family and that of the affiliative homosexual community. Between the earlier 1928 texts and the later works, the mood darkens from ironic playfulness and (especially in <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>) witty and bawdy exuberance, to utter tragedy. All four works end with the death or destruction of a major re (Dame Evangeline Musset in <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>, the grandmother re Sophia in <i>Ryder</i>, the lover Robin in <i>Nightwood</i>, and the daughter re Miranda in <i>The Antiphon</i>). The absence or loss at the center of each narrative forms the basis of a decentralizing structure of signification.
</p>

<p>
Barnes faces loss by writing, simultaneously filling in empty spaces and articulating&#x02014;reaffirming&#x02014;the void. Indeed, the motif of the empty center, the horror of the vacuum (<i>horror vacui</i>), represents one of the most common topoi of baroque representation. Here a surface display of stylistic extravagance is linked to its opposite, a hidden insufficiency. The revival of the baroque as neobaroque was enabled by Swiss art historian Heinrich Woelfflin's pathbreaking studies, and has informed the work of Catalan philosopher Eugenio d'Ors, French philosopher Gilles Deleuze, U.S. writer 

<b></b>

William Faulkner, Cuban writers and essayists Alejo Carpentier, Lezama Lima, and Severo Sarduy, and Mexican writers and critics Carlos Fuentes and Gustavo Celorio. 
</p>

<p>
The baroque was vilified in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as an aberration; its rediscovery in the twentieth was linked to the crisis of Enlightenment rationality and its master narratives. During the formative years when Barnes lived as an expatriate in Paris, the baroque's modernity, that is, its validity as a response to the epistemological and religious crises of the Scientific Revolution and the Reformation, was discovered. In the wake of the twentieth-century crisis of metanarratives, the baroque, which now-discredited positivism and the na&#x000EF;ve belief in technological and social progress stigmatized as deviant, newly appears as a viable alternative. Recovered as neobaroque, the baroque, as a non-exclusive, de-centering principle, joins, however self-consciously and awkwardly, contradictory impulses of the premodern and the modern, faith and reason, the scientific and the mythic, marking the crisis and outer limit of modernity. The neobaroque recovers the historical baroque's alternate, pre-Enlightenment modernity, a transitional, ex-centric modernity and alternate rationality not reducible to the quantifying rationality that gained ascendancy in the eighteenth century. Discussing the baroque as a symptom of modernity in his influential 1962 study on the poetics of the open work, Umberto Eco writes: "[F]or the first time, man opts out of the canon of authorized responses and finds that he is faced (both in art and in science) by a world in a fluid state that requires corresponding creativity on his part."<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Reviewing Barnes criticism, one could make a long list of casual comments on seventeenth-century expressive forms and themes in Barnes's work that both formalist and feminist critics, in a curious convergence of sensibility, have made but never fully explored. The initial and most influential observation comes, of course, from T. S. Eliot's introduction to the first edition of <i>Nightwood</i>; he states that the novel has "a quality of horror and doom very nearly related to that of Elizabethan tragedy" (<i>N</i>, xvi). In her recent psychoanalytic reading of <i>Nightwood</i>, Victoria Smith describes the novel's supposed "Renaissance tragic idiom" as a symptom of melancholia. The "great age of melancholia [ . . . ] began in the Renaissance," and, we might add, culminated in the baroque seventeenth-century ("SBI," 201). Thus, Smith decodes Eliot's pertinent observation as a mode of self-representation defined by loss: "The melancholic ego<i>[ . . . ] is dependent on loss as a means through which it can represent itself</i>" ("SBI," 201).<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  Similarly, in <i>Djuna: The Life and Work of Djuna Barnes</i>, Barnes biographer Philip Herring writes of <i>The Antiphon</i>&#x02014;written in blank verse!&#x02014;that "the play's idiom suggests Jacobean tragedy" and is written "in vaguely Jacobean verse form, strongly flavored with Shakespearean drama."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> <i>Antiphon</i> is a family revenge play, where the dead and absent father's sins are shown to fester, like an open wound, in present relations between mother and children, leading to the tragic murder of the daughter by the mother. <i>Antiphon</i>'s idiom resembles <i>Nightwood</i>'s in its violent images of pain and ostentatious lamentation. Because their theatrical lamentation contrasts with what Walter Benjamin calls the silences of Greek tragedy, both works, as I will show in more detail in my subsequent discussion of <i>Nightwood</i>, have much in common with the 

<b></b>

"unclassical" seventeenth-century German tragedies Walter Benjamin discusses in his 1928 study of the baroque, <i>Origin of German Tragic Drama</i>.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  The baroque appeal to the emotions and the shift from absolute clarity to dramatic movement and subjective impressionism is a trait shared by Barnes's later works. Finally, and to put an arbitrary end to this open list of passing references to the baroque characteristics of Barnes's work, let me cite Dianne Chisholm's recent description of "a darkness in <i>Nightwood</i>" via "Barnes's affection for Burton's <i>Anatomy of Melancholia</i> ," which, once again, summons the ghost of the baroque in Barnes, calling for a fuller exploration ("OM," 176).<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
One major reason why Barnes's neobaroque recuperation of seventeenth-century expressive themes and forms has been neglected is the unpopularity of the baroque as a period term in England, the U.S. and English-language literary criticism.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Skeptics are right to point to the dangers of overly systematic translations and applications of this art historical period term in literature.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>  On the other hand, the antithetical definition of the baroque (as the counter-principle of classicism) offered in Woelfflin's influential stylistic typology is illuminating. Woelfflin highlights a crucial shift of sensibility between the classic and the baroque, revealed in a persistent trend away from self-contained objectivism (the classic) and towards de-centering subjectivism and emotionalism (the baroque), from static wholes in repose to dynamic wholes in endless flux.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  This approach is fruitful, as long as the contrasting relation between the two styles is conceived not as an absolute rupture (problematic because the historical transitions between the Renaissance and the Baroque, and the Baroque and the Enlightenment were gradual) but as a mixture of rupture and continuity. 
</p>

<p>
My own approach is related to Woelfflin's definition of the baroque as an anti-classical principle in recognizing that the historical baroque intervened as a parenthesis (to use Gonzalo Celorio's term) between one classical age and another, between the Renaissance and the Enlightenment.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  With Michel Foucault, we acknowledge in addition that the baroque is not only preceded, but also succeeded by a classical age, the Enlightenment. Contrasting the baroque to what follows it, Enlightenment modernity, in <i>The Order of Things</i>, Michel Foucault famously claimed that the episteme of modernity was first articulated in the seventeenth-century baroque: "At the beginning of the seventeenth century," Foucault writes, "during the period that has been termed, rightly or wrongly, the baroque, thought ceases to move in the element of resemblance."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  According to Foucault, the Baroque was a transitional period, which saw the first articulation of modernity, and contained the emergent elements of what would become Enlightenment rationalism as well as the residual, premodern knowledge that was losing authority. If placed under the optic of Foucault's theory of the baroque as the expression of an epochal and epistemic threshold, the characteristic disharmonies of baroque representation enumerated in formalist morphologies of the baroque such as Woelfflin's are historicized <i>and</i>validated at the same time. Well-known topoi of baroque theorizing, such as the yoking of opposites within fragmented, unbalanced, and open wholes (<i>coincidentia oppositorum</i>); movement; and the impulse to break up static forms and transgress boundaries, all resonate with the epistemic break posited by Foucault. The content of baroque form grapples with the crisis of modernity in an 

<b></b>

ambivalent way, which can be characterized by the inclusive logic of both/and, rather than the dualistic logic of either/or. 
</p>

<p>
Foucault's case for the baroque as an alternate modernity is stated even more urgently by Gilles Deleuze in his 1988 study of seventeenth-century philosopher Gottfried Leibniz.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  For Deleuze, the baroque offers a unique response to the modern problem of the loss of traditional principles and beliefs: "[W]hat happened in this long history of nihilism," Deleuze asks, "before the world lost its principles?" 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

At a point close to us human Reason had to collapse, like the Kantian refuge, the last refuge of principles. It falls victim to "neurosis." But still, before, a psychotic episode was necessary. A crisis and collapse of all theological Reason had to take place. That is where the Baroque assumes its position: Is there some way of saving the theological ideal at a moment when it is being contested on all sides, and when the world cannot stop accumulating its "proofs" against it, ravages and miseries, at a time when the earth will soon shake and tremble . . . ? The Baroque solution is the following: we shall multiply principles&#x02014;we can always slip a new one out from under our cuffs&#x02014;and in this way we will change their use. We will not have to ask what available object corresponds to a given luminous principle, but what hidden principle responds to whatever object is given, that is to say, to this or that "perplexing case." [ . . . ] A case being given, we shall invent its principle.

<p class="noIndent">
According to Deleuze, Leibniz's philosophy represents an alternate rationality because his thinking enacts the multiplication, rather than the reduction, of principles&#x02014;in contrast to systematic Enlightenment rationality. "The Baroque is just that," Deleuze adds, "at a time just before the world loses its principles. It is the splendid moment when Some Thing is kept rather than nothing, and where response to the world's misery is made through an excess of principles, a hubris of principles . . . ." (<i>F</i>, 68). Deleuze's phrase, the excess of principles, echoes throughout the following discussion of the baroque as the rhetoric of abundance that is at the same time, as Deleuze implies and others claim explicitly, a rhetoric of insufficiency. 
</p>

<p>
The twentieth-century recuperation of baroque representation, therefore, is not a nostalgic gesture towards lost premodern unities and beliefs, but the opposite, a critical genealogy of modernity whereby the very principles of modern knowledge and representation are subjected to a deconstructive transformation. Following Cuban theorist and novelist Severo Sarduy in his 1972 essay, "The Baroque and the Neobaroque," I understand the neobaroque as a critical revision of the historical baroque, the first articulation, as both Foucault and Sarduy agree, of signification as artifice and the definition of meaning and identity through difference.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
My goal here is also to explore the transnational dimension of Barnes's modernism&#x02014;not the international style variety, but Barnes's affinities with the baroque countermodernity as theorized by Foucault, Deleuze, Sarduy, and others. Between her arrival in 1921 as a newspaper correspondent and her final departure for New York in 1940, Barnes lived in Paris and other European cities.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  The post-World War I period saw the rediscovery of the historical baroque across Europe's literatures and cultures: the 1927 centenary of the death of Spanish poet Don Luis de G&#x000F3;ngora heralded 

<b></b>

the revival of "Gongorism," previously considered "decadent," by poets of the "Generation of 1927." The influence of Barnes's lifelong friend and editor, T. S. Eliot, stimulated the rediscovery of Donne and the Metaphysical poets in the 1920s.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  German Expressionists celebrated their affinity with the baroque, based on transhistorical parallels.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Intellectual historians of the totalizing <i>Geistesgeschichte</i> variety, such as German philosophers Wilhelm Worringer and Oswald Spengler, and Catalan philosopher Eugenio d'Ors, have popularized the idea of the baroque as an ahistorical "late style" and a constant of the human spirit that recurs across different geographies and historical periods.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  (This dissociation of the baroque from a distinct historical period term and its identification with a recurring trans-historical style, of course, prepared the ground for the recognition of affinities between, say, Expressionism and the baroque in the first place.) Finally, in the 1920s, literature departments in Europe, especially (but not exclusively) in Germany and Switzerland, experienced a vogue for scholarship on the baroque, which Walter Benjamin documents.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
But perhaps the most important factor in the twentieth-century revival of the baroque is modernist writers themselves. As Mexican critic and poet Octavio Paz remarks in his study of the seventeenth-century Mexican poet, Sor Juana In&#x000E9;s de la Cruz, the relevance of the baroque in the twentieth century is due to "striking similarities between the aesthetic doctrine of the baroque . . . and the ideas of the avantgarde."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Paz continues:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The coincidence between baroque and avant-garde poetics is not a question of influences but rather a question of an affinity operating as much in the sphere of the intellect as in sensibilities. The baroque poet hoped to astonish and astound; Apollinaire proposed exactly the same thing when he extolled surprise as one of the basic elements of poetry. The baroque poet attempts to discover the secret relationships among things, exactly as affirmed and practiced by Eliot and Wallace Stevens. . . . Vicente Huidobro, the initiator of modern poetry in our language [Spanish], preached an art of invention in which the image created a reality independent of and even contrary to natural reality. Not unrealism or surrealism, but antirealism, or better, metarealism. His was a poetics that sought to turn its back on nature and reality. G&#x000F3;ngora, D&#x000E1;maso Alonso has said, created metaphors that were equations raised to the third degree: his raw material was neither spoken nor literary language but, rather, the metaphor of the metaphors of those languages. This describes exactly the images of Huidobro and the Hispanic avant-garde.

It was no coincidence, Paz reminds us, that avant-garde movements and writers, like Eliot and the "Generation of 27," initiated the revival of the historical baroque. In the following, I hope to show that we may count Djuna Barnes among this circle of avant-garde aficionados of the baroque.

<i>Ladies' Almanack</i> : Parodic Queer Hagiography
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Barnes criticism has firmly situated <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>  in the lesbian expatriate counterculture of Left-Bank Paris: the little calendar book, with text and drawings by Barnes, is a biographical roman &#x000E0; clef. It is concerned with the members of Barnes's 

<b></b>

lesbian circle, of which Barnes's best friend Mina Loy ("Patience Scalpel") was the token heterosexual member.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Apparently beloved by the women it features (such as Natalie Barney, Uma Troubridge, and Janet Flanner ["ST," 167]), but only reluctantly acknowledged by Barnes herself (who published the treatise anonymously, attributing authorship to the pseudonym "Lady of Fashion," and who also does not appear in it as a character), this short text poses severe stylistic obstacles to the reader that are only partially explained by the in-group character of the biographical allegory. Even after the identities of the historical personages are revealed (Dame Musset is Natalie Barney, Lady Buck-and-Balk and Tilly-Tweed-In-Blood are Uma Troubridge and Radclyffe Hall, respectively, to mention only a few of its more than a dozen characters), the meaning of the text remains relatively inaccessible. This inaccessibility is the effect of Barnes's signature ornate, indirect, hyperbolic style. One obvious and often advanced reason for its use is censorship: Barnes's subject matter, lesbian identity, sexuality and culture, remained under threat of publishing bans throughout the 1920s.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
While self-censorship may explain pseudonymous publication, the virtual absence of the term "lesbian" (only used once, in the phrase "lesbian eye" [<i>LA</i>, 35]) and a good deal of circumlocution around the details of lesbian sexuality, it does not explain the persistent stylistic exaggeration, the use of outlandish conceits, of archaisms, of capitalization, of narrative chapter titles.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  Susan Lanser vividly describes the book's bawdy illustrations as "baroque cherubs, medieval grotesques, parodic iconography, feminized zodiacs, sexual caricature, and other emblems archaic and arcane" ("ST," 157). <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> summons what Severo Sarduy calls neobaroque "artificialization" in order to escape the realist claims of turn-of-the-century scientific sexological discourse and its dominant "objectivist" constructions of deviant lesbian identity and sexuality. <i>Nightwood</i>, as Dana Seitler has pointed out (and this is true for <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> as well) "relies on, even as it perverts, medical and evolutionary tropes for sexual alterity informed by the conception of the mannish lesbian. . . . In fact, Barnes takes much pleasure in ironically redeploying early twentieth-century sexual politics, sometimes through a series of hilarious gender inversions" ("DAF," 544).<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  Many characters, major and minor, in both of Barnes's "queer" texts (I use "queer" merely as a neutral and descriptive term for their setting in non-heterosexual subcultures) are parodic clones of the so-called "invert," the scientific re of the "third sex." Among them are Robin Vote, "the girl who resembles a boy" (<i>N</i>, 135), the crossdressing Doctor O'Connor, who cherishes "in his heart the wish for children and knitting" (<i>N</i>, 91), and the chief protagonist of <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>, Dame Evangeline Musset, whom the frontispiece describes as "carrying a pole and a muff" (<i>LA</i>, n. pag.). Barnes's discourse on any referential "subject" of the outside world, including and especially sexuality, is avowedly artificial and non-realistic. It summons baroque associations between resemblance, artifice, and deception to dismantle the truth claims of scientific sexology by opening up a subversive, self-consciously metafictional space of representation.
</p>

<p>
According to post-structuralist Cuban theorist Severo Sarduy, the baroque is 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
an overflowing cornucopia, renowned for its prodigality and dissipation . . . a mockery of all functionality, of all sobriety. . . . Hence, its mechanism of periphrasis, of digression and 

<b></b>

detour, of duplication and even of tautology. Verbiage, squandered forms, language which, because of its excessive abundance, can no longer designate things but only other designators of things [ . . . signifiers] which enfold other [ . . . signifiers] in a mechanism of signification which ends by designating only itself, revealing its own grammar. . . . Language which speaks of language, the baroque superabundance is generated by the synonymic supplement . . . ." ("BN," 124)<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Sarduy sees the baroque as revolutionary literature because of its grand refusal of all "service," all functionality outside itself, including that of communication, referentiality, realism, political or religious orthodoxy, etc. Because of its anti-functionalism, the baroque is allied to eroticism, for like eroticism, baroque language is "no more than a parody of the function of reproduction, a transgression of the useful, of the 'natural' dialogue of bodies" ("BN," 130). Yet how does the baroque conduct this verbal squandering in the exercise of playfulness and pleasure? Offering a structuralist model of signification, Sarduy distinguishes three mechanisms in the process of artificialization: substitution, proliferation, and condensation. The second, proliferation, is the most useful for our purposes. More radical than substitution, which replaces one signifier (literal) by another (ral), proliferation describes a (theoretically) infinite "chain of [ . . . signifiers] which progresses metonymically and which finally circumscribes the absent [ . . . signifier], tracing an orbit all around it" ("BN," 118). Sarduy calls this process a "radial reading" ("BN," 118), for the circularity of the baroque signifying process that orbits around an absent signified, not to mention referent in the outside world. It should be clear by now that the Foucault of the <i>History of Sexuality</i> would not agree with Sarduy's premise of a liberation from institutional discipline through (neo)baroque language, obscene/bawdy or otherwise, as Dianne Chisholm reminds us in her illuminating discussion of intersections between <i>Nightwood</i> and surrealism ("OM," 169).<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Indeed, the dark and nihilistic tone of <i>Nightwood</i> is much less conducive to Sarduy's celebration (if not his linguistic analysis) of the subversiveness of metaphoric and metalinguistic discourse. Yet, I would argue, <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> is; this little book easily lends itself to a Sarduyan revolutionary liberation from utilitarianism through the anarchy of neobaroque hyper-ral language.
</p>

<p>
Generically, <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> is a parodic hagiography, a parody of the account of medieval saints' lives so popular during the baroque in Catholic and Counter-Reformation Southern Europe. Saints' Days and festivals link the cult of saints to the ritual calendar of Church liturgy. Hence the almanac structure of Barnes's book, which follows the months of one year, marking seasonal festivals. A second temporality&#x02014;not cyclical, but historical time&#x02014;traces a linear narrative from Dame Musset's birth (told in a preface before the annual cycle begins) to her death in the month of December. Barnes uses the genre of hagiography and its Catholic iconography to construct a lesbian culture. Dame Evangeline Musset is a saint with a difference, a queer saint. The reasons for Barnes's recourse to Catholic (rather than Protestant) iconography are fairly obvious. To begin with, Protestant iconoclasm and rejection of the cult of saints as intercessors between God and the believers erased all feminine res from Christian religion (most importantly, the Virgin Mary). Although saints are predominantly 

<b></b>

male (historian Stephen Wilson reports that the proportion of women among the Roman Catholic canon of saints "never rose above 20 per cent until [ . . . the twentieth] century," a significant imbalance since "women seem always to have participated fully in saints' cults"), saints seem to largely escape the normative binary gender system.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Once canonized, female saints command as much reverence and power as male saints (the Virgin Mary being most powerful of all). Since saints are commonly known for their cures and their miraculous intercession on behalf of humans (thus, all fulfilling stereotypically "feminine" caretaking functions), gender characteristics do not affect the election of female as opposed to male saints&#x02014;in one sense, all saints are feminine. Being highly "specialized," furthermore, saints give aid and patronage to various groups and issues, such as 1) toothache, 2) specific countries and towns, 3) fireters, 4) lost and stolen objects, 5) pregnant women. Dictionaries of saints offer long lists of the principal patronages of saints and their iconographical emblems, which reveal an astonishingly exotic taxonomy that seems to be principally infinite and non-exclusionary.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  Each and every place, group, or person on earth can potentially have their saint: what prevents Left Bank expatriate women writers from having theirs? Here would probably be one major reason why Barnes chose the genre of hagiography and the saint as a parodic model of lesbian selfhood: it is a way of escaping the all-encompassing dichotomies of gender and sex that enforce constructions of lesbian subjectivity as lack or deviance.

There is an anarchic element in saints' cults: they spring up locally, as part of popular religion; the organized Church and the clergy, on the other hand, can only partially control this spontaneous process through canonization procedures. There is a transgressive excess in the cult of saints that seems to escape the panoptic power of the Foucauldian disciplinary confessional: believers in need may go on a pilgrimage instead of seeing a priest, thereby escaping ecclesiastic power. Wilson discusses the histories of saints' cults as vehicles of political opposition within the Church.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  "As saints are persons possessed of a charisma that is potentially dangerous and anarchic," Wilson explains, "so pilgrimage cuts across geographical and social boundaries, takes people out of their established places, mixes social strata and the sexes, allows individuals to wander like vagabonds. . . . The pilgrimage route . . . became a regular vehicle for cultural exchange. . . ." (<i>STC</i>, 14). The apocryphal legend of Dame Evangeline Musset, narrated anonymously by "a Lady of Fashion," suggests&#x02014;or rather, simulates&#x02014;the popular creation of a heroine outside of official institutions and history. In <i>Nightwood</i>, Doctor O' Connor explains the difference between history and legend, the history of the dispossessed: "[T]hink of the stories that do not amount to much! That is, that are forgotten in spite all man remembers . . . merely because they befell him without distinction of office or title&#x02014;that's what we call legend and it's the best a poor man may do with his fate; the other . . . we call history, the best the high and mighty can do with theirs" (<i>N</i>, 15). The subaltern genre of legend resignified by Barnes in <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> holds another explanation for its pseudonymous publication. This explanation takes some pressure off "all the questions," which Karla Jay urges us to "ask about Barnes's absence" as a fictional character from the artificial world of Dame Musset 

<b></b>

("OAE," 193). Less than an "author" or a "known contemporary," Barnes merely assumes the anonymous persona of a popular follower of her heroine who records, rather than invents, a collective oral legend.

<p>
Patron saints are venerated by their devotees; by analogy, Dame Musset's queer sainthood implies the existence of a community, a lesbian community. The preface addresses this community, introducing <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> as the book "which all Ladies should carry about with them, as the Priest his Breviary, as the Cook his Recipes, as the Doctor his Physic, as the Bride her Fears, and as the Lion his Roar!" (<i>LA ,</i> 9). The cult of saints thus constructs a collective, public subjectivity, a public, adult identity defined independently of the Freudian family and its known polymorphous perversions. The conceit of hagiography allows Barnes to draft a narrative of physical and spiritual love that steers clear of the script of modern scientific psychoanalytic and sexological discourse (whose constructs of the "mannish lesbian" and feminine "lack" are also distorted parodically, as we shall see). Premodern and early modern narrative is resuscitated to deflect the panoptic gaze of modern science. <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> mixes premodern and scientific knowledge, juxtaposing the "faith" of the cult of saints to modern science's reductive and mechanistic classifications. In this respect, it resembles the works of some seventeenth-century scholars, such as the Englishman Robert Burton (author of Barnes's favorite book, <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i> [1621]), the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz, or the Mexican <i>savant</i> Carlos Siguenza y G&#x000F3;ngora, who sought to reconcile scholasticism (the doctrine of revealed authority), and classical and modern science, or faith and reason.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Similarly, Dame Evangeline's devotees worship their "wonder worker" saint (depicted in the frontispiece) in a way that modern science would dismiss as superstition. Upon the death of Dame Musset, Barnes's narrator reports,

The funeral cortege, on its way to Evangeline's final resting place, is greeted by wild animals who join the human chorus of mourning, testifying to the cosmic repercussions of the saint's death: "a bird came, and in passing, crowed lamentably," followed by a "Mountain Goat," which also "lamented bitterly," which in turn is followed by a "Night'owl" who said, "'Oh! God!'" (<i>LA</i>, 83). The list goes on, drifting, once again, into the hyperbolic. To be sure, the na&#x000EF;ve faiths of popular Catholicism and animism Barnes incorporates here are slanted parodically, but this is not the same as invalidating the Evangeline legend as "irrational." 
</p>

<p>
In the fictional world of <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>, the marvelous is as real as that which is not marvelous&#x02014;a simply given fact. Barnes's narrative incorporates the fantastic and the miraculous to critique the exclusively rational concept of reality, the reductive 

<b></b>

materialist realism of modern science. In <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>, the miraculous aspects of Dame Evangeline's life are treated as seriously, or as non-seriously, as the myths of modern sexology&#x02014;both are subjected to neobaroque procedures of artificialization and exposed as fictions. For example, the book offers two "origin myths" of lesbianism, one rational, the other, fantastic. The first explains that "Evangeline Musset . . . had been developed in the Womb of her most gentle Mother to be a Boy," therefore, when she "came forth an Inch or so less," she "paid no Heed to the Error," fulfilling her prenatal destiny (<i>LA</i>, 7). The second, narrated in the March chapter, tells of the miraculous birth of "the first Women . . . with a Difference" from an egg, hatched, in less than nine months, by a gathering of angels (<i>LA</i>, 24-6). The first, an allusion to the modern pseudo-scientific myth that, as Karla Jay puts it, "lesbianism was caused by parents who strongly desired a son" ("OAE," 186) invalidates the second as much as the second invalidates the first: both stories are exposed as fictions, myths.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup> <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>'s opulent fabulations critique the reductive and mechanistic rationality of modern science, echoing Deleuze's description of the baroque thought of Leibniz. They multiply, rather than reduce, principles of understanding. 
</p>

<p>
Here, I would suggest, lies one major explanation for Barnes's baroque circumlocutions with regard to the subject of lesbianism.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  The Sarduyan substitution of terms such as "Ladies" or "modern Girl" (<i>LA</i>, 22) for "lesbian" fashions an artificialization that distances the fictional world of <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> from denotation and realism. The proliferation of metaphors ("first Woman born with a Difference") describes a Sarduyan "radial reading" around the absent signified (lesbianism), which enables the knowledge created in the text to elude reduction to a vehicle of denotative communication. The baroquely spiraling language of <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> takes pleasure in its prodigality and transgression of conventional realism. Thus, in the April section, notice the following parody of the medical classification of the symptoms of the unnamed "distemper": 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Acute Melancholy is noticeable in those who have gone a long Way into the matter, whereas a light giggling, dancing Fancy seems to support those in the very first Stages; brief of Thought; cut of Concentration; a Tendency to hop, skip, and jump, and to misplace the Eye at every single or several Manifestation of Girl in like Distemper. Chill succeeds, and Restlessness at Night, of unaccountable Tabulation of unimportant Objects. . . . This gives place, in from six to eight Weeks, to a Sobriety that includes thoughts of Transmigration, Levitation, Myopia and Blight. The Eye trickles, the Breath is short, the Spleen distended, and the Epiglottis rises and falls like the continual swallowing of the Heart. Whereupon the Veins are seen to lift themselves, the Nerves twitch, the Palms become moist, the Feet lose their activity, the Bowels contract, and, as in the old Days when a Person in the last stages of Hydrophobia sometimes found small Whelps in the Urine, in the Waters of such is seen the fully Robed on-marching re of Venus no larger than a Caraway Seed, a Trident in one Hand and a Gos-Wasp on the Left Fist.

Dame Musset's given name, Evangeline, speaks to her tireless proselytizing in the service of her cause. The story of her life is the story of her conversions, by seduction, of new members for her cult. The February chapter lists Evangeline's "saints days" 

<b></b>

(<i>LA</i>, 14), one for each month, detailing the good works for which she was sainted: "When well thirty," we learn, "she, like all Men before her, made a Harlot a good Woman, by making her Mistress" (<i>LA</i>, 15-7). This particular "miracle cure" can be traced to a definite episode in the life of the young Natalie Barney, who had indeed seduced a "known courtesan"&#x02014;but only by expert readers who are familiar with the biographies of the writers portrayed, many of whom were unable to identify themselves.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  By all appearances, Barnes took pains to obscure even the allegorical references to her writer-friends' lives, signaling that not even in <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>'s dimension as a closet biography did the referential function play a prominent part.
</p>

<p>
Barnes pointedly avoids using one popular plot of saints' lives&#x02014;the story of martyrdom&#x02014;signaling her refusal to employ the tragic plot for lesbian identity that appears in Radclyffe Hall's <i>The Well of Loneliness</i>. But she does use another&#x02014;the plot of conversion, the story of sinner become saint. As always, Barnes resignifies codes: Dame's queer saint herself was, pointedly, never converted, but born into the condition. Most of her followers, on the other hand, are the products of Evangeline's conversion-seduction. Born with "an inch or so less" (<i>LA</i>, 7), Dame Musset parodies the post-Freudian psycho-biological discourse of feminine "lack." To her father's lament about observing "fatherly sentiments" in his daughter, Evangeline replies, "'Thou, good Governor, wast expecting a Son when you lay atop of your Choosing, why then be so mortal wounded when you perceive that you have your Wish? Am I not doing after your very Desire, and is it not the more commendable, seeing that I do it without the Tools for the Trade, and yet nothing complain?" (<i>LA</i>, 8).<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
As each saint has her or his unique iconography and attributes, so does Dame Evangeline. In a mixed genre of word and image, text and drawings, the frontispiece introduces the heroine as "a Wonder Worker [ . . . who] was perhaps at her very best when, carrying a pole and a muff, and sporting an endearing tippet, she stepped out upon that exceedingly thin ice to which it has pleased God, more and more, to call frail women, there so conducting herself that none were put to the chagrin of sinking for the third time" (<i>LA</i>, n. pag.). We should see Dame Musset's "pole" within the premodern and early modern hagiographic convention of constructing subjectivity, as well as within the Freudian post-romantic psychoanalytic tradition. In this light, the charged pole is not just what it seems to be for the post-Freudian reader, a phallic substitute: it is also, and simply, Musset's emblem, just as Mary Magdalen's emblem is an ointment jar (a reference to her former life of luxury) or Saint Francis of Assisi's emblem is birds. The post-Freudian sign is psychological and interiorized; the emblem is not, but typically refers to an episode in the saint's life and works&#x02014;in Musset's case, it is an allusion to her miraculous cures. The pole's ambiguous status is another example of the Sarduyan procedure of artificialization, as well as of Deleuze's process of the multiplication of principles: one signifier has been superimposed upon another, introducing a gap between sign and meaning whose effect is the subversion of literal, communicative language. 
</p>

<p>
<i>Ladies' Almanack</i>, then, subverts the modern scientific discourse of "phallic" insufficiency by parodically recuperating a medieval and early modern iconography which 

<b></b>

circumvents the traps of the modern sexual system and scientific sexological discourse. The book ends with another of Barnes's hilariously bawdy episodes, in which Dame Musset's famed "tongue," with which she has converted and seduced women during her life, becomes her relic after her death. As Dame Musset is cremated for her burial in the December chapter, her tongue will not burn, but "flamed, and would not suffer Ash, and it played about" (<i>LA</i>, 84), giving pleasure after her death. Here, Barnes heretically appropriates the pentecostal imagery of holy tongues given to the apostles to inspire their work of conversion. Similarly, Musset's tongue comes upon the mourners at her funeral who honor her life and work. Typically, as Stephen Wilson points out, the cult of saints is the cult of the dead; saints' cults are oriented around their tombs and relics. Their healing power is posthumous, and saints' cults contain a great deal of necrophilia (<i>STC</i>, 9-10). On the one hand, Barnes has resignified the conventions of popular Catholicism by shifting the accent from death to life, and canonizing her fictional saint during her lifetime. On the other, Dame Musset bodily remains yield a relic, which, like so many saints' bones, is coveted by devotees. And the final illustration in the book is a drawing of Evangeline's tomb, the shrine where her devotees continue to worship.

<i>Nightwood:</i> Melancholic Knowledge and Baroque Curiosity
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
Like <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>, <i>Nightwood</i> is set in a world on the margins of official history: its protagonists, including its minor characters, are social outsiders&#x02014;homosexuals, Jews, artists and circus people. As if to emphasize the non-normative character of its social world, almost all of the episodes are set at night or in dark interiors. However, what one critic has called Barnes's "anatomy of the nightworld" reaches beyond its confines: more ambitious than <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>, <i>Nightwood</i> aims to deconstruct the social and discursive authority that, in the metaphoric language of the novel's symbol patterns, divides "night" from "day"&#x02014;or rationality, consciousness, domesticity and order from its Others: madness, desire, grief, dreams, perversity. In <i>Nightwood</i>, Djuna Barnes deconstructs the disciplinary authorities of language and society. My claim is that hyperbolic baroque signification, or the procedure Sarduy calls artificialization, brings about this deconstruction. 
</p>

<p>
As most of <i>Nightwood</i>'s commentators have noted, the novel offers only a minimal plot and sketchy character development: set in the U.S., and European capitals Paris, Berlin and Vienna during the 1920s, <i>Nightwood</i>'s spare plot is propelled forward by Robin Vote's promiscuity, centering on her tormented relationships with her lovers. Jewish convert to Catholicism and false Baron Felix Volkbein meets the unlicensed gynecologist and scholar Doctor O'Connor, who introduces him to Robin Vote, a young American. They marry and have a child, but Robin soon abandons Felix and goes to America, where she meets the artist Nora Flood. Nora and Robin settle in Paris, but Robin soon takes to wandering again, and meets Jenny Petherbridge, with whom she leaves for America. Nora, disconsolate, seeks out the Doctor in his quarters in Paris for advice and comfort. Before moving to Vienna with his mentally disabled son Guido, 

<b></b>

Felix does the same. Three of the final chapters are driven by the interminable talk of the Doctor, who falls silent in the end before the magnitude of pain. His monologue breaks off with the words, "now <i>nothing, but wrath and weeping</i>" (<i>N</i>, 166). Powerless to control or order the tragic reality it describes, language yields to silence and grief. In the last chapter, Robin, adrift once again, turns up in an abandoned chapel on Nora's property in the U.S. In an enigmatic and disturbing scene the novel describes as "obscene and touching" (<i>N</i>, 170), she falls to barking and running with Nora's dog. Here, the arc of collapse that the plot has been charting through its symbol pattern of "descent" and through the spiritual defeats of all the major characters culminates in Robin's regression to an animal state. 
</p>

<p>
This scene of "human becoming-animal" harks back to an earlier complementary scene of animal becoming-human, Robin's "awakening" by the Doctor. <i>Nightwood</i> traces a circular trajectory for Robin that shows her to first appear, and then finally disappear, at the boundary of the primitive, the mythic, the archaic. Robin is said to be "outside the human type," a "wild thing caught in a woman's skin" (<i>N</i>, 146). As Felix puts it, "The Baronin had an undefinable disorder, a sort of 'odour of memory,' like a person who has come from some place that we have forgotten and would give our life to recall" (<i>N</i>, 118). Robin is a supernatural character even more marginal than the others because she is the embodiment of everything that is alien and deviant in the human social order: an emblem of the female Other in Western culture, Robin represents the empty center of <i>Nightwood</i>'s tragic narrative. She is both the paradigmatic object of the characters' desire and the focal object of the novel's baroque ornate, proliferating discourse. Robin has a primal vitality that makes her irresistible to humans; but driven by anarchic desires for nomadic wandering and promiscuous sexuality, she cannot be domesticated by her lovers. Neither is the Doctor's considerable erudition and volubility able to bring order into the chaos Robin leaves in her wake. 
</p>

<p>
Robin's status as the enigmatic object of representation is partly the result of a subtle management of narrative technique and devices of distancing and closeness. Barnes refuses to reflect or focalize the story through Robin's mind, although she grants an inside view of Felix, the Doctor, and especially of Nora. Robin does not speak more than a few phrases and expresses herself through silent gestures, as when, after giving birth to her son, she screams, "I didn't want him!" (<i>N</i>, 49) or upon meeting Nora in the circus, she exclaims, "Let's get out of here!" and "I don't want to be here" (<i>N</i>, 54-5). Spoken for and seen through the consciousness of others, Robin is never represented through psychological realism, one of the achievements of modernist experimentation. In general, <i>Nightwood</i>'snarration is unabashedly authorial, deviating from the mainstream of modernism in its refusal to abandon omniscient narration for subjectivist representation and psychological realism. Typically, Barnes's narrator describes her characters from the outside, speaking from a position aloof from the narrated events. <i>Nightwood</i>'s distinctive lack of interiority is a baroque feature, for, as Octavio Paz explains in a discussion contrasting the baroque with Romanticism, "baroque transgression focuses on the object. Romanticism liberates the subject; the baroque is the art of the metamorphosis of the object. . . . Romantic transgression culminates in the apotheosis 

<b></b>

of the subject or in its fall; baroque transgressions lead to the appearance of an unheard-of-object. . . . [T]he subject disappears in the baroque object" (<i>SJ</i>, 154).
</p>

<p>
When we first encounter Robin in the chapter named for her hybrid being, "La Somnambule," she is lying unconscious on a bed, surrounded by proliferating plants, where she is "brought to life" by the Doctor's dubious and magical ministrations: 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

The woman who presents herself to the spectator as a "picture" forever arranged is, for the contemplative mind, the chiefest danger. Sometimes one meets a woman who is beast turning human. Such a person's every movement will reduce to an image of a forgotten experience; a mirage of an eternal wedding cast on the racial memory; as insupportable a joy as would be the vision of an eland coming down an aisle of trees, chapleted with orange blossoms and bridal veil, a hoof raised in the economy of fear, stepping in the trepidation of flesh that will become myth; as the unicorn is neither man nor beast deprived, but human hunger pressing its breast to its prey.

<p class="noIndent">
Here, the baroque discourse layers conceit over conceit, without ever reaching a conclusion. The reader witnesses, as Paz puts it, the metamorphosis of the object; Robin's subjectivity has "imploded" into her object-hood as the archetypal Other and object of desire and representation. Consider the metonymic succession of signifiers referring to Robin: "the beast turning human" "image of a forgotten experience" "mirage of an eternal wedding" "vision of an eland" "unicorn" "an infected carrier of the past" "eaten death returning." To begin with, this process epitomizes the "radial reading" Sarduy describes in his essay on "The Baroque and the Neobaroque": the dynamic movement of language generates "a chain of signifiers which progresses metonymically and which finally circumscribes the absent [ . . . signified], tracing an orbit all around it" ("BN," 188). The baroque proliferation of signifiers works to obscure meaning rather than clarify it; for, as Sarduy explains, the substitution of metaphors by other metaphors amplifies the distance between sign and meaning, thus highlighting the gap between them. To call Robin, a young woman the Doctor knows and treats, a "vision of an eland coming down the aisle of trees," to link her to such dissimilar objects as elands or unicorns is to bury "natural" and literal signification under successive layers of artifice. The result, as Sarduy points out, is anti-realism, the creation of a reality independent of natural reality, the "mockery of nature" ("BN," 116).
</p>

<p>
Here, we reach an interesting impasse: notice the difference between Robin's supposed primitive nature, the essence of her desirability and "damnation," and the chain of signifiers that links Robin to ever more surreal instances of primitivism and perversity. <i>Is</i>Robin the incarnation of animalism and polymorphous perversity, <i>or</i> is it all baroque make-believe, a device for trapping the reader in an artifice, a labyrinth of signs, an all-encompassing fiction? One of the first glimpses of Robin compares her sleeping re to "a painting by the <i>douanier</i> Rousseau, she seemed to lie in a jungle trapped in a drawing room . . . thrown in among the carnivorous flowers as their ration" (<i>N</i>, 35). Her first meeting with Nora (who later remarks that "Robin is incest too; 

<b></b>

that is one of her powers" [<i>N</i>, 156]) at a circus performance again associates her with the primitive: "a powerful lioness come to the turn of the bars, exactly opposite the girl [Robin], she turned her furious head with its yellow fire and went down, her paws thrust through the bars and, as she regarded the girl . . . her eyes flowed in tears that never reached the surface" (<i>N</i>, 54). The caged lioness weeps tears of pity for Robin, recognizing a bond of common imprisonment. 
</p>

<p>
The process of Robin's becoming-animal and the recuperation of <i>Nightwood</i>'s sexual and social transgression became the focus of feminist readings of Barnes. These probed <i>Nightwood</i>'s formalist fa&#x000E7;ade, praised by T. S. Eliot for its "great achievement of style," while he warned that "[t]o regard this group of people as a horrid sideshow of freaks is . . . to miss the point" (<i>N</i>, xvi). Feminist readings, reacting against the formalist emphasis on style, saw <i>Nightwood</i> as a novel which, albeit in an indirect way mediated by modernist design, brought to visibility various countercultures, not just the lesbian. They celebrated <i>Nightwood</i>'s carnivalesque articulation of the deviant desires of, to echo Jane Marcus' reading, "the body of the Other&#x02014;the black, the lesbian, transvestite, or Jew."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  However, recent assessments of <i>Nightwood</i> are much more skeptical than optimistic, especially of the claim that the novel is a representation of lesbianism: the novel "frustrates identitarian notions of sexuality," writes Dana Seitler, echoing Dianne Chisholm's statement that Barnes's "narration does not voice the struggle of an emerging subculture . . . Instead of speaking out on lesbianism in cryptic modernism, <i>Nightwood</i> seriously challenges the epistemological and ontological claims of sexual discourse in general and the category of 'inversion' in particular" ("OM," 172). Both Chisholm and Seitler offer new historicist readings of Barnes's recodification of scientific sexological discourses of perversity and degeneration in <i>Nightwood</i>. "<i>Nightwood</i> is set in the Paris of Surrealism," writes Chisholm; "we might see [Barnes] as the artificer of an obscene resistance, laboring in tacit solidarity with her Surrealist contemporaries" ("OM," 188, 195). However, Chisholm is leery of letting too much modernist talk of the autonomy of art creep into her analysis: yes, <i>Nightwood</i> is transgressive, but in a pessimistic way that lacks Surrealism's revolutionary optimism. Less than an identitarian (lesbian) counterdiscourse, <i>Nightwood</i> offers only a negative "queer antidiscourse" constructed out of "a heterogeneous re of abjection" that is deployed against dominant sexological discourse ("OM," 186, 195). Seitler, for her part, charges that Chisholm's discussion of obscenity is still too beholden to the question of style and <i>Nightwood</i>'s "uniquely modernist expression," insisting somberly that "<i>Nightwood</i> relies on, even as it perverts, medical and evolutionary tropes for sexual alterity informed by a conception of the mannish lesbian" ("DAF," 544). Immediately, however, Seitler brings back the notion of stylization as a subversive weapon against the epistemological claims of realist discourse: "While Barnes incorporates sexological discourse into her narrative, she does so with a twist: she ironically and humorously reformulates those conceptions of sexuality into hyperbolic accounts of the self"("DAF," 545). Like hyperbole, irony is eventually brought back as a transgressive tool: "In fact, Barnes takes much pleasure in ironically redeploying early twentieth-century sexual politics, sometimes through a series of hilarious gender inversions" ("DAF," 544). 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
New historicist readings of <i>Nightwood</i>, written in the wake of Foucault's disciplinary construction of identity and discourse, struggle to salvage a measure of the avant-garde and social transgression that earlier feminist readings were more certain of. My point is that they, too, find the traces of resistance in what is variously called "recodification" or "reformulation," which are polite synonyms for aesthetics and stylization&#x02014;in short, they support the notion that literary form can undermine the authority of the functionalist language of sexology and science. This exactly is Sarduy's claim in his theory of the neobaroque as the apotheosis of artifice and anti-realism. Consider the passage of Robin's awakening cited above: the more links there are in the chain of signifiers surrounding Robin, the more unlikely it is that any of these metaphors will be taken literally, referentially, in the authoritative and didactic way that scientific sexological discourse would use them. Thus, both Chisholm and Seitler seem to be arguing, when the Doctor refers to Robin as an "invert" (<i>N</i>, 136), this term loses its powerful authority simply by being inserted into the galaxy of surreal metaphors already orbiting Robin. <i>Nightwood</i>'s dilating baroque discourse uncovers the fallacies of functionalist-scientific discourse by undermining the reader's belief in the power of naming through singular, exclusive analytical concepts.
</p>

<p>
<i>Nightwood</i>'sdynamic, restless discourse, which proliferates indefinitely the process of naming things, is predicated on lack, or the absence of stable meaning. In an essay on William Faulkner, Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes points to the paradox that verbal abundance is causally linked to epistemological uncertainty: "The baroque, language of abundance, is also the language of insufficiency: only those who have nothing include everything. Their horror of the void is not gratuitous; it is due to the certain fact that one finds oneself within the void, that one lacks security. Verbal abundance in . . . <i>Absalom, Absalom!</i> signifies a desperate invocation of a language that fills the absences of reason and faith."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  Fuentes advances this justification in defense of the "language of Faulkner contemptuously called 'Dixie Gongorism' by one North American critic."<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  The horror of the void, which leads to the baroque habit of leaving no empty spaces, similarly motivates Barnes' language. There, too, it testifies to the crisis of Enlightenment rationality and modern scientific knowledge.
</p>

<p>
<i>Nightwood's</i> language of abundance is, paradoxically, a language of insufficiency, lacking a single authoritative truth. Take the medical theories of homosexual "inversion" and the popular myth of the "mannish woman": Barnes subverts their didactic authority by redeploying them (as Dana Seitler argues) as a series of "hilarious gender (and grotesque) inversions" and portraits of the "third sex" ("DAF," 544). These are the "sideshow of freaks" T. S. Eliot worried might distract readers from appreciating <i>Nightwood</i>'s "great achievement of style." Yet Eliot did not realize (neither did many of Barnes's subsequent critics) that the style and patterns he valued were an active force in creating it. Like the characters in <i>Nightwood</i>, form, too, is transgressive, abnormal: the acrobat Frau Mann ("Mrs. Man"), one of the circus characters, emblematizes the third sex; so do Robin Vote ("the girl who should have been a boy"), and the voluble Doctor with the baroque name, Matthew grain-of-salt-Dante O'Connor, who sometimes "feels like a bride," dresses in women's clothes, and claims that he is "the 

<b></b>

woman God forgot." Baroque style, the "apotheosis of artifice" (Sarduy), de-naturalizes the objects and concepts it re-presents; in the description of the body of Frau Mann&#x02014;allegory of the third sex&#x02014;the natural yields to the artificial: "She seemed to have a skin that was the pattern of her costume . . . and the bulge in the groin where she took the bar . . . was as solid, specialized and as polished as oak. The stuff of her tights was no longer a covering, it was herself; the span of the tightly stitched crotch was so much her own flesh that she was as unsexed as a doll" (<i>N</i>, 13).
</p>

<p>
At this point, we should return to Robin, the empty center of <i>Nightwood</i>'s tragic narrative, and silent object of desire and representation, whose dramatic disintegration in the closing scene completes the collapse of social and narrative authority enacted in the novel. As I have argued, the collapse is double, for as Robin's lovers must "bow down" before their failure to love Robin, so they realize that they cannot "speak" Robin. <i>Nightwood</i>'sdeconstruction of discursive authority becomes emblematic in the moment when the Doctor finally ceases to speak, breaking off his prolific monologues; his last words are, "now <i>nothing, but wrath and weeping</i>" (<i>N</i>, 166). In addition to bringing down the social order of romantic and domesticated love (the lover's desire is not reciprocated), Robin also causes the breakdown of the order of representation. As Carolyn Allen and other critics have pointed out, the Doctor embodies language.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  He presides over the story as a commentator, as <i>Nightwood</i>'s central discursive authority and source of knowledge and comfort. The Doctor's early confidence in his knowledge, displayed in his philosophical monologues on "woman" and "the night," full of learned allusions, gives way to bitter resignation as he realizes that language is nothing but a dress and a lie: "You have dressed the unknowable in the garments of the known" (<i>N</i>, 136). Like that of the others, his decline is steep; he moves from the confident "I will tell you how the day and the night are related by their division" (<i>N</i>, 80) to the resigned "To think is to be sick" (<i>N</i>,158).
</p>

<p>
The disintegration of the doctor's epistemological mastery shows baroque <i>desenga&#x000F1;o</i>, disillusionment&#x02014;the revelation that knowledge is but a dream and a fiction. Matthew finally recognizes that his life is absurd and meaningless: "I have not only lived my life for nothing, but I've told it for nothing" (<i>N</i>, 165). Other characters experience a parallel process of "awakening" from their illusions. Thus, Nora says: "I thought I loved her for her sake, and I found it was for my own" (<i>N</i>, 151). In the long conversations and the Doctor's mock-learned monologues of the last four chapters, all beliefs and relationships dissolve through paradox and inversion: truth is falseness, love is fiction, discursive control is an illusion. The Doctor's bitter recognition of having "dressed the unknowable in the garments of the known" reveals the deeper meaning of his final silence: language is but a "dress" and a "lie," that is to say, it is impotent facing the reality it attempts to represent. The verbal spectacle of <i>Nightwood</i>'s extravagant narration only affirms the failure of language and representation: <i>Nightwood</i> inverts the high modernist doctrine of mastery through technique and narrative design.
</p>

<p>
Contrary to Eliot's famous assertion in his essay, "<i>Ulysses</i>, Order and Myth," that modernist technique "is simply a way of controlling, of ordering, or giving a shape and a significance to the immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is contemporary 

<b></b>

history," experimental narration in <i>Nightwood</i> does not restore order through symbolic reference and mythic narration.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  On the contrary, <i>Nightwood</i>'s metaphoric hyperbole, its frenzied proliferation of images exposes itself, as Fuentes suggests and as Sarduy recognizes, as a language of insufficiency. Eliot clearly viewed <i>Nightwood</i>'s "achievement of style" as compensation for its "psychopathic" (<i>N</i>, xv) element, about which he expressed his discomfort. In fact, the opposite is true. <i>Nightwood</i>'s language is powerless to exert symbolic discipline over reality: ceaselessly dwelling on the disturbing reality it attempts to control (Robin's promiscuity and the "night," or the larger trauma Robin represents), it circles a grief that will not cease and a wound that will not close. The Doctor's final silence is superceded by weeping, and Robin's degeneration from human to animal in the last chapter takes place amidst this weeping after the failure of words. 
</p>

<p>
The Doctor's profuse and rambling disquisitions have the quality of a dream, but his is a rational delirium. Here, Jos&#x000E9; Lezama Lima's description of the American baroque as "curiosidad barroca" ("baroque curiosity"), a baroque that was friendly towards, rather than hostile to, the Enlightenment, sheds light on the fusion of the rational and the irrational in the Doctor's discourses.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  The "night," both the setting and the subject of the Doctor's lectures in "Watchman, What of the Night?," is a hallucinatory world. But, unlike the night of surrealism, the medium of escape from rationality, the night of <i>Nightwood</i> is a profoundly intellectual night. The doctor's speculative and analytical mind classifies and systematizes distinct philosophical, geographical, and phenomenological dimensions of the "night": "Well, I, Dr. Matthew-Mighty-grain-of-salt-Dante-O'Connor, will tell you how the day and the night are related by their division. The very constitution of twilight is a fabulous reconstruction of fear, fear bottom-out and wrong side up. Every day is thought upon and calculated, but the night is not premeditated. The Bible lies the one way, but the night-gown the other. The night, 'Beware of that dark door!'" (<i>N</i>, 80). The Doctor offers a detailed (if maddeningly obscure) ontology of the night: "Our bones ache only while the flesh is on them. Stretch it as thin as the temple flesh of an ailing woman and still it serves to ache the bone and to move the bone about; and in like manner the night is a skin pulled over the head of day that the day may be in a torment. We find no comfort until the night melts away; until the fury of the night rots out its fire" (<i>N</i>, 85).
</p>

<p>
The Doctor's errant thought never comes to definite conclusions. Still, even if knowledge fails in the end, the impulse behind both the Doctor's and Barnes's narration is consciousness, the intellectual mind, rather than the unconscious, and its pre-verbal and pre-rational drives. As the Doctor steps into the foreground in <i>Nightwood</i>'s final discursive chapters, his circumlocutions, digressions, and apologies gradually increase to a full-fledged baroque "horror of the void"&#x02014;a horror of the magnitude of pain&#x02014;which, as all parties involved realize, will reign after the inevitable ceasing of words. Here, <i>Nightwood</i>'s obscure language, obsessively circling its objects of representation&#x02014;Robin and "the night," the lost love object, the humiliation, the past, unfulfilled longings, absence itself&#x02014;finally reveals its impotence before reality. But even if his quest remains unfulfilled, the Doctor's discourse seeks knowledge. <i>Nightwood</i> conducts 

<b></b>

its critique of rationality and representation not in the surrealist manner, by abandoning consciousness and intellect, but, rather, by letting them soar to their highest potential, at which point understanding is overwhelmed and recoils in failure. 
</p>

<p>
In a recent article, Victoria L. Smith identified <i>Nightwood</i>'s language as melancholic, linking its indirection, opacity and sustained use of tropes to the Freudian account of melancholia as loss ("SBI"). Comparing melancholia with temporary sadness at the death of a loved one, Freud described melancholia as an interminable grief about a mysterious loss that is partly hidden from consciousness.<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  Smith's argument is convincing regarding Robin's ambiguous role: <i>Nightwood</i> mourns the loss of Robin as the love object that cannot be domesticated; at the same time, grief in <i>Nightwood</i> is larger than what could have been caused by Robin. As Smith notes, "there is perhaps a concatenation of losses, Robin's loss activates, and is contiguous with, larger losses" ("SBI," 202). Smith's notion of a "concatenation of losses" as well as her subsequent comment that "the loss of [ . . . Robin] allows other losses to surface" ("SBI," 203) evoke Sarduy's model, discussed above, of the proliferation of signifiers around an empty center, occupied (but not fully occupied) by Robin. <i>Nightwood</i>'s "rhetorical indirection" calls attention to "something besides its overt narrative," Smith argues, "the novel keens a loss . . . and in doing so calls attention to the style of the lamentation, the one who laments, and the 'dead' or lost object" ("SBI," 194-5).
</p>

<p>
Smith's claims are compatible with the neobaroque dialectic of rhetorical abundance and epistemological insufficiency I have been discussing. I want to extend her argument with respect to the Freudian melancholic ego, which, as Smith points out, is constituted by loss: the melancholic ego is "<i>dependent on loss as a means through which it can represent itself</i>" ("SBI," 203, emphasis in original).<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Like the melancholic obsessive and obscure narrative, the melancholic self stands as a "memorial to loss" ("SBI," 196). According to Smith, Dr. O'Connor epitomizes Freud's melancholic in this re's distinctive self-abasement and self-exposure, its identification with a loss that is no longer confined to a lost object, but which has been transferred onto the self ("SBI," 201). "In mourning," Freud writes, "it is the world which has become poor and empty; in melancholia, it is the ego itself."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In keeping with my focus on Barnes's recuperation of early modern expressive forms and themes, I would like to focus on the long tradition of writing on melancholia preceding Freud, a tradition which Freud himself rewrote through his novel theory of loss. Reviving an Aristotelian doctrine, the Renaissance associated melancholy with learning and genius. The paradigmatic melancholic of early modern iconography, explains Jennifer Radden, was the melancholic scholar, famously depicted by Albrecht D&#x000FC;rer (in his <i>Melencholia I</i>) and by Cesare Ripa.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  This link between melancholy and learning was expanded by cultural intellectuals including Robert Burton, in <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>. While Smith is correct in pointing out the Doctor's affinities with the Freudian re of the self-disparaging melancholic, the Doctor epitomizes even more the early modern re of the melancholic scholar. As Barnes critics agree and as I have discussed above, the most distinctive characteristic of Doctor O'Connor is his learning and his intellect. A "middle-aged 'medical student'" with an interest in 

<b></b>

gynecology (<i>N</i>, 14), the Doctor speculates about Enlightenment philosophy ("We may all be nature's noblemen," <i>N</i>, 15), Biblical legend (Sodom and Gomorrah, <i>N</i>, 86), and many other topics in both high and low culture. Known as a "liar, but a valuable liar" (<i>N</i>, 30), Doctor O'Connor explains the connection between melancholic moods and the intellectual life: "Do you know what has made me the greatest liar this side of the moon, telling my stories to people like you, to take the mortal agony out of their guts . . . " (<i>N</i>, 135). But the link is not just between the suffering of others and the Doctor's torrential mock-learned narrative. The Doctor is a scholar as well as a melancholic: "The scalpel and the Scriptures have taught me that little I did not already know" (<i>N</i>, 153), he claims, yet his brilliance is marred by melancholic gloom. Exclaims the Doctor: "A broken heart have you! I have falling arches, flying dandruff, a floating kidney, shattered nerves <i>and</i> a broken heart! But do I scream that an eagle has me by the balls or has dropped his oyster on my heart? Am I going forward screaming that it hurts, that my mind goes back, or holding my guts as if they were a coil of knives? . . . Isn't everyone in the world peculiarly swung and me the craziest of the lot?" (<i>N</i>, 154). The Doctor's self-diagnosed "floating kidney" evokes and parodies the premodern and early modern humoral theory of melancholia as an imbalance in black bile, causing "smoky vapors to cloud and darken the brain and its functions."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  (As always, Barnes's neobaroque proliferating discourse displaces any such authoritative medical diagnosis by a metonymic chain of other conceits. The "falling arches" and "flying dandruff" are only the beginning of a long series of symptoms of the Doctor's medical condition that, as in the case of Robin's mysterious and primitive nature, keep deferring meaning.)
</p>

<p>
Doctor O'Connor's recognition that "[t]o think is to be sick" (<i>N</i>, 158), furthermore, explicitly names the early modern theory that learned pursuits cause melancholy: in one section of <i>The Anatomy of Melancholy</i>, Burton discusses "Love of Learning, or Overmuch Study With a Digression of the Misery of Schollers, and Why the Muses Are Melancholy." "<i>Many men</i>," Burton elaborates,"<i>come to this malady by continuall study, and night-waking, and of all other men, Schollers are the most subject to it.</i>"<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  Citing various authorities including Marsilio Ficino, "who puts Melancholy among one of those five principall plagues of Students," Burton offers 
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
[t]wo maine reasons . . . why students should be more subject to this malady then [sic] others. The one is, they live a sedentary, solitary life . . . free from bodily exercise, and those ordinary disports which other men use: and many times if discontent and idlenesse concur with it . . . they are precipitated into this gulfe all of a sudden: but the common cause is overmuch study; too much learning . . . hath made thee mad; . . . <i>only scholiers neglect that instrument, their braine and spirits . . . which they daily use, and by which they range all over the world</i>.<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Notice that Barnes echoes, nearly verbatim, Burton's formulation of the intellect by which scholars "range all over the world" in her description of Dr. O'Connor's "interest in gynecology which had driven him half around the world" (<i>N</i>, 14).
</p>

<p>
I want to close this discussion with yet another trace that links <i>Nightwood</i> with the seventeenth-century baroque: in <i>Origin of German Tragic Drama</i>, Walter Benjamin 

<b></b>

discusses the plays of Lutheran Germany as "unclassical tragedies"&#x02014;unclassical because the tragic is expressed in a noisy and demonstrative clamor that is antithetical to the silences of Greek tragedy. "The relationship between mourning and ostentation," Benjamin writes, "is . . . brilliantly displayed in the language of the baroque" (<i>OGTD</i>, 140). Like the lamentations of baroque drama, the lamentation in <i>Nightwood</i> is directed at an audience; it is an extroverted rather than introverted grief, a public display that shifts the emphasis from the tragic suffering itself (objectivism) to its expression and articulation (subjectivism and emotional appeal). In <i>Nightwood</i>, as in the baroque plays analyzed by Benjamin, suffering is a spectacle. The hyperbolic performance of suffering in <i>Nightwood</i>, its noisy and torrential lamentations, is the expression of a language that both affirms its self-confidence and undermines it.

Frank writes: "[M]odern literature . . . is moving in the direction of spatial form; and this tendency receives an original development in Djuna Barnes's remarkable book <i>Nightwood</i>." Modernist writers "ideally intend the reader to apprehend their work spatially, in a moment of time, rather than as a sequence" (<i>The Widening Gyre: Crisis and Mastery in Modern Literature</i> [Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1963], 8-9). A section on <i>Nightwood</i> presents Barnes's novel as the paradigm of the "space-logic" of poetry modernist novelists introduce into the "time-logic" of narrative . <i>Nightwood</i> thus epitomizes a modernism as defined as the experimental formalism championed by the New Critics.

Briefly, there is the widespread notion that England did not have baroque writers like those Continental writers (Spanish poet Don Luis de G&#x000F3;ngora, Silesian poet and playwright Andreas Gryphius), who use the ornate and extravagant stylistic trend usually identified with the baroque. Secondly, as Ren&#x000E9; Wellek has pointed out, English literary history preferred to retain existing terms, such as "metaphysical poetry" or "Jacobean tragedy" to adopting "baroque" from art history as a period term. Yet comparisons of Shakespeare's late plays with, say, Cervantes show that the baroque existed as a definite historical and a trans-European phenomenon. The debate has not been resolved. See Ren&#x000E9; Wellek, "The Concept of the Baroque in Literary Scholarship," in <i>Concepts of Criticism</i> (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1963), 69-127, henceforth abbreviated "CBL."

This is especially true when the discussion is broadened to juxtapositions of the baroque vs. mannerism, and even more comprehensive attempts to translate art historical period terms (Renaissance, Mannerism, Baroque, Rococo) literally into literary criticism, as in Wylie Sypher, <i>Four Stages of Renaissance Style</i>(Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1955). That is why Wellek, in his well-known critical appreciation, admits the baroque only as a heuristic term ("CBL," 113).

Wilfried Barner reviews "the intensive discussion of the baroque of the 1920s" whose enthusiasm, fueled by abstract and ahistorical <i>Geistesgeschichte</i>, gradually gave way to critical and historical readings ("Introduction," in <i>Der literarische Barockbegriff</i> ["The Literary Concept of the Baroque"] ed. Wilfried Barner [Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1975], 1-13, 2). Mid-twentieth century scholarship on the literary baroque ran into another, new problem, that of overly specific terminologization and classification, which distorted the situation in the opposite direction, by drawing sharp boundaries between writers, styles and periods where more heterogeneous differences existed. Also see "CBL" for a critical review of literary scholarship on the baroque. Benjamin takes up the notion of analogies between the baroque and Expressionism to gesture towards the topical interest of his subject, the baroque plays of seventeenth-century Germany.

Barnes had first-hand experience with obscenity laws and trials, through her own novel, <i>Ryder</i>, whose American edition was expurgated against her will.

Susan Lanser and Karla Jay discuss another reason for self-censorship, Barnes's discomfort with being identified as a member of Barney's lesbian circle and her ambivalence about identifying herself as lesbian. While Jay argues that Barnes's reluctance to do the latter is expressed in a "reductionist vision of lesbianism" in <i>Ladies' Almanack</i> ("OAE," 193), Lanser proposes that the rhetorical stance that matters is the book's "inside stance" ("ST," 165), independent of the author's well-publicized disclaimer, "I'm not a lesbian; I just loved Thelma." From the neobaroque perspective adopted here, the realist grounding of the lesbian text in the lesbian life of the author is not the central issue, given, following queer Cuban theorist Sarduy, the baroque focus on artificialization and the "mockery of nature," which includes the naturalization of the text through reference to the author's life.

Although I hesitate to authenticate Sarduy's discourse on the neobaroque as queer by reference to his biography, given the anti-realist premises of his work and this article, readers unfamiliar with his work should know that his being gay had a significant impact on his life and work, the most important of which was his decision, in 1960, to remain in Paris, where he had come on a Cuban scholarship, and not to return home to what had become post-revolutionary Cuba. His Parisian exile, of course, enabled his future intellectual career as a full member of the Tel Quel circle around Roland Barthes, and the development of his post-structuralist orientation. For a study of Sarduy's work, see Roberto Gonz&#x000E1;lez Echevarr&#x000ED;a, <i>La ruta de Severo Sarduy</i> (Hanover, NH: Ediciones del Norte, 1987).

Aside from <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>, Chisholm cites surrealism as the other "ghost" discourse that contributes to <i>Nightwood</i>'s characteristic "darkness." Her insight that Robin Vote is a "Nadja-clone," evoking the protagonist of Andre Breton's narrative, <i>Nadja</i>  is compelling .

Wilson recounts that "a number of modern Marian apparitions&#x02014;La Salette, F&#x000E1;tima, Garabandal&#x02014;have been used to criticize papal policy, while La Salette, in particular, has been the focus of dissident and schismatic groups" (<i>STC</i>, 35).

Barnes biographer Andrew Field notes that <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i> was one of Barnes's "favorite books" (<i>Djuna: The Life and Times of Djuna Barnes</i> [New York: Putnam, 1983]). Herring concurs, citing Barnes's correspondence with Emily Holmes Coleman (<i>DLW ,</i> 219). Leibniz was not just one of Europe's leading rationalists and the co-inventor (with Isaac Newton) of differential calculus; he was also the author of a theodicy, and, infamously, the model for Doctor Pangloss, Voltaire's biting satire of the foolish philosopher, who, despite the evil that he experiences, never abandons his faith "that this is the best of all possible worlds." The literature of the discussion of baroque reason as a hybrid phenomenon&#x02014;seeking a third option beyond the rejection of the Aristotelian-Scholastic tradition for the new mechanical philosophy of the Scientific Revolution&#x02014;includes Deleuze's book on Leibniz, <i>The Fold</i>. For a study of the Mexican scholar Carlos de Sig&#x000FC;enza y G&#x000F3;ngora in the context of the seventeenth-century intellectual background, see Kathleen Ross, <i>The Baroque Narrative of Carlos de Sig&#x000FC;enza y G&#x000F3;ngora: A New World Paradise</i> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993).

Reading for the biographical allegory in <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>, Jay critiques this description of Natalie Barney as "insulting," considering that Barney "considered herself to be completely feminine," not at all a "pseudo-man" ("OAE," 187, 186). In contrast, I am arguing that biographical realism is not the main point of <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>, but that it is, rather, a critique of the rational concept of reality underlying explanations of the "mannish woman" type.

Lanser makes a similar point when she notes that "[m]any of <i>Ladies' Almanack</i>'s terms for the female body&#x02014;furrow, nook, path, keyhole, whorl, crevice, conch shell . . . &#x02014;are clearly designed to counteract emerging Freudian notions of phallic supremacy and clitoral insufficiency" ("ST," 162).

Karla Jay reports that "this deed . . . is a direct reference to Barney's love affair in 1898-1899 with Liane de Pougy, who was the most famous courtesan of her day, and whom Barney did succeed in seducing" ("OAE," 187). Jay goes on to discuss (and express her discomfort with) the obscurity of many of the biographical allegories. "Even Natalie Barney, who provided most of the characters' identities in the margins of her own copy of the <i>Almanack</i>, was unable to name all the res in the book, though they were all supposedly either her lovers or intimate members of her circle" .
