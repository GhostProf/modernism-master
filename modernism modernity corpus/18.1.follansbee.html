<span style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span><p>The fascist dictator, like the Cavalier and the Southern demagogue, supplied William Faulkner with a set of tropes that shaped <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom, Absalom!</span> The parallels between Thomas Sutpen and fascist dictators emerge from and reveal contemporary anxieties about the rise of an American Hitler. Moreover, the novel's structure, by emphasizing the oral transmission of history, dramatizes the constitutive role of storytelling in constructing a national myth and demonstrates the production of fascist subjects. This process depends on Rosa Coldfield, who, by serving as the fascist "mother" to Sutpen's fascist "father," mediates the erotic identification of white Southern men with Sutpen.</p>

<div id="body">
<p>Fascism didn't happen here, but in 1936, when William Faulkner published <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom, Absalom!</span>, Americans didn't know that yet. In retrospect, fascist movements never posed a material threat to the American government. Fascist organizations with direct ties to Italy and Germany, such as the Fascist League of North America or the German-American Bund, and self-proclaimed nativist fascist groups like William Dudley Pelley's Silver Shirts attracted no more than a miniscule following in the United States.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> But in 1934, the American Civil Liberties Union published "Shirts!," a pamphlet surveying a range of paramilitary organizations whose similarities converged, according to the ACLU, in their common hatred for "Communism, democracy and Jews," their appeal to "patriotism," and their desire to "establish dictatorships." "They are disunited, uncertain, with dozens of vague aims, with no one yet to pull their common hatreds together," author Travis Hoke concluded ominously, "but so was Germany split into dozens of wandering parties—before Hitler."<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>While Hoke suggested that the absence of leadership prevented the disparate proto-fascist "shirt" organizations from uniting to gain power, journalist Raymond Gram Swing insisted that potential leaders abounded. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Forerunners of American Fascism</span> , Swing warned that any of a group of proto-fascist demagogues could exploit Americans' "economic dissatisfaction" to rally the impoverished and unemployed with the promise of restored order.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> Manipulating the "psychology" of "fear," Swing claimed, one of these men could defeat "the forces of democratic control" by "resolv[ing]" "social conflicts … through the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> device of dictatorship."<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> Swing profiled a group of likely demagogues—doctor Francis Townsend, Mississippi Governor Theodore Bilbo, radio priest Father Coughlin, and Louisiana Senator Huey Long—not "to personify fascism," he insisted, but to demonstrate the appeal of leaders willing to dispense with "economic democracy and individualism," leaders who, "if invested with autocratic authority," would make the U.S. like Germany or Italy.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The Allied victory in the Second World War insured that fascism didn't happen in the U.S. Postwar commentators attributed the triumph to American democracy, insisting that fascism could only have happened "over there." After Germany's defeat, Depression-era fears of an American-style Hitler seemed quaint, even hysterical, but Cold War constructions of fascism have obscured the fact that for many Americans in the 1930s, the "fingerprints of fascism" were apparent everywhere.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> The cultural productions of the decade—among them films, fiction, and criticism—offer some of the most sophisticated and revealing contemporary assessments of America's vulnerability to nativist fascism. The trope of the American Hitler, the fascist dictator emerging from an American background, red prominently in popular culture in such iterations as Sinclair Lewis's Buzz Windrip  and Orson Welles's Charles Kane , both of whom achieved power by manipulating American economic and democratic institutions.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, Faulkner offered a distinct take on the trope of the American Hitler by demonstrating the interdependence of the fascist leader and his followers. Unlike <span style="font-style:italic;">It Can't Happen Here</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">Citizen Kane</span>, which focus on the fascist leader's rise and the vulnerability of American institutions to his ambitions, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> dramatizes the circular structure of identification by showing how the narrators' desire for Thomas Sutpen simultaneously constructs him as the leader and produces their allegiance to him. <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> bears a complicated relationship to its contemporary moment by combining the Civil War and Reconstruction-era plot of Sutpen's failed dynasty with the "action" of telling Sutpen's story at the apogee of the New South in the fall and winter of 1909–10. The doubled temporal frame within the novel grants telling and listening equal status with the events of Sutpen's life, thus emphasizing the psychological production of white Southern men as citizens of the Southern "nation" at a moment—1936—of regional crisis, and growing national unease about the increasing military power of fascist regimes in Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>If any region in the U.S. seemed ripe to produce a fascist-style "dictator," it was the South, a region shaped by paternalism, a tradition of racial scapegoating, a disposition toward capital rather than labor, a post-Reconstruction history of single-party rule, and home of the "Dixie demagogue."<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> The fascist imaginary—what I call the "fascist fable"—converged with the "Southern family romance" in their shared preoccupation with the cultural politics of nation-building.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> By the mid-1930s, when Faulkner published <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, the narrative of the Southern family romance grounded a political formation, the conception of an alternative Southern "nation," most succinctly articulated in the 1930 Agrarian "manifesto," <span style="font-style:italic;">I'll Take My Stand</span>.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> In its Depression–era iteration, the Oedipal drama of the Southern family mapped the cultural politics of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Southern traditionalism onto a proto-nationalism centered on the white planter-father, who not only represented a past golden age, but also red as the rallying point for a new sectional politics energized in opposition to the emerging power of labor and focused on maintaining white supremacy.</p>
<p>We can see the development of Faulkner's treatment of fascism in the shift from a thematic depiction of fascism in Percy Grimm's "shirt"-style lynching mob in <span style="font-style:italic;">Light in August</span>  to his representation of the construction of fascist subjects in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom, Absalom!</span> In a 1945 letter to Malcolm Cowley, William Faulkner recalled <span style="font-style:italic;">Light in August</span>'s Percy Grimm as "the Fascist Galahad who saved the white race by murdering [Joe] Christmas. I invented him in 1931. I didn't realize until after Hitler got into the newspapers that I had created a Nazi before he did."<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> The racial and gender politics enacted in the climatic murder scene in <span style="font-style:italic;">Light in August</span> have their roots in the Reconstruction, and lynching as a means of enforcing white dominance predates the emergence of European fascism. Yet Faulkner's allusion to his "Fascist Galahad" draws a parallel between the racial politics of the South and of Germany. Hitler's claim to defend the Aryan race against "pollution," especially by "international Jews," finds its analog in Southern racism, Faulkner implies, a connection that was made explicitly by many of Faulkner's contemporaries, including W. E. B. DuBois, W. J. Cash, and Katharine Du Pre Lumpkin.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> By associating Grimm's lynch mob with fascism, Faulkner suggests that the roots of fascism exist already in the sociopolitical upheaval of the Depression-era South and in the dynamics of race and gender on display in Christmas's lynching.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Faulkner's "Fascist Galahad" Percy Grimm anticipates a fuller treatment of the relationship between fascism and the South in the re of Thomas Sutpen, who emerges as a mesmerizing fascist father to generations of white Southerners in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> through the seductive power of voice. Critics have placed Sutpen in a complex matrix of traditions, including the fictionalized Cavaliers of the antebellum South and the "Dixie demagogues" spawned by Reconstruction and the Depression, but Faulkner's comment about the genesis of Percy Grimm invites us to read his fiction in the context of contemporary fascist leaders.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> My point is that the fascist dictator, like the Cavalier and the Southern demagogue, supplied Faulkner with a set of tropes that combined with others and coalesced in the re of Sutpen at a moment when anxieties about "fascism" shaped the discursive context available to Faulkner.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> By exemplifying the appeal and danger of identifying with Sutpen, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> couples a critique of Southern paternalism with a liberal critique of fascism, representing both as products of a broader cultural pathology.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Robert H. Brinkmeyer, Jr. and Ted Atkinson have argued that <span style="font-style:italic;">Light in August</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> demonstrate how Faulkner's critique of economic paternalism and white supremacy converge with his exploration of Southern regionalism and fascist nationalism. However, Brinkmeyer, Jr. and Atkinson largely ignore the formal structure of <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, focusing exclusively on the thematic parallels between Sutpen and fascist dictators. I claim that the structure of <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> reinforces those thematic parallels by shifting the emphasis from Sutpen himself to the narrators' identification with Sutpen.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> By structuring the novel as a series of conversations that reveal Sutpen's enduring appeal as they transmit Sutpen's story to successive generations of white Southerners, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> depicts the constitutive role of storytelling in constructing a national myth and demonstrates the production of fascist subjects. Through the mediating voice of Rosa Coldfield, who becomes the fascist "mother" to Sutpen's fascist father, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> dramatizes the construction of the fascist leader as a product of the desire of his citizensubjects. The dynamics of voice and power dramatized in the characters' speech and embedded in the structure of the book emerge through metaphors of familial—and national—rupture eroticized and aestheticized by the speakers themselves.</p>
<p>By depicting fascism emerging from American culture, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> gives us access to a moment <span style="font-style:italic;">before</span> "democracy" became fascism's "other." In so doing, the novel demonstrates Heesok Chang's claim that fascism becomes "the unnamed precondition of critical speculation itself."<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> suggests that fascism's menace lies in its threat to the ideology of the autonomous subject, which the novel explores through its representation of the narrators' capitulation to Sutpen. By working through the implications of allegiance to the planter-father, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> anatomizes the dangers of fascism, and it represents the role of cultural productions in the creation of fascist subjects. But the novel simultaneously deploys some of the very formations it seeks to resist in a structure that reinforces the monologism of its narrators. In so doing, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> suggests that the formation of a democratic, anti-fascist aesthetic <span style="font-style:italic;">depends</span> on what it seeks to exclude.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">"Decorous Ordering": The Cavalier Myth as Fascist Fable</h1>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s structure foregrounds the activity of witnessing, both literally and ratively. Eyewitnesses observe events and testify to what they have seen; subsequent narrators then bear witness to and repeat the stories of eyewitnesses. The spectacle of Sutpen's exercise of power generates the narrators' testimony to his authority, and, in turn, shapes the scenes of transmission in which witnesses reproduce his domination by insisting on their own authority as speakers. These monological "enunciatory acts," as Stephen Ross dubs them,<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> serve as rituals for confirming Sutpen's authority, an authority that originated in the physical violence he used to build his plantation in Mississippi and that is reproduced in the symbolic violence of his wrestling matches with his slaves. Moreover, they establish Sutpen as a re for identification. The narrators' fantasy of Sutpen's "intact innocence" gives shape to their desire for identity and purity, for what Rosa calls "<span style="font-style:italic;">intricate channels of decorous ordering</span>."<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> Faulkner explores the white South's desire for "<span style="font-style:italic;">decorous ordering</span>" in much of his fiction in the 1930s, but <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> marks a shift in emphasis from representations of physical violence to the symbolic violence embedded in acts of narration. <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s narrators not only recapitulate the acts of violence precipitated by Sutpen's design, they also police the boundaries of the family by insisting on one particular "plot" for Sutpen's story. In so doing, they cast the familial drama of dynastic reproduction as a larger story about the construction of the white Southern "nation." <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>By reconstructing the inception and unfolding of Sutpen's design, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s narrators give dramatic shape to the myth of the Old South, a fantasy of the "intact" white family and, by extension, the white Southern nation. The romantic impulse of <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s narrators finds its complement in the romantic nationalism of Nazism and Italian fascism, which similarly envisions the individual shaped through his association with a collective, mythic past.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> Stark Young provides an explicit bridge between the two formations. In his brief for agrarianism in <span style="font-style:italic;">I'll Take My Stand</span>, Young argues that "a sense of family follows our connection with the land … where [we] have known man's great desire, that generation of himself in the body of life, of which the earth is the eternal and natural symbol."<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> Young's celebration of a "way of life" marked by a "provincialism" "akin to a man's interest in his own center"<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> anticipates his admiration for the mystical agrarianism and Catholicism of the Italian "people" in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New Republic</span> essays of the next year. For Young and for the fascists, a nation—like a family—is a living whole, an organism rooted in a particular soil and shaped by a collective destiny. At the heart of Young's enthusiasm for fascist Italy is the conviction that Italian society shares the Southern traditionalists' organic anti-liberalism. To focus on "identity, purity, regeneration … historical roots, self-emancipation, [and] building the 'new man' and the 'new community'" is not only to subordinate the individual to the collective, but, more importantly, to realize oneself as part of a larger whole.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, the desire for the restoration of Sutpen's dynasty materializes the narrators' vision of themselves as a coherent "people" united, as a nation, by blood rather than rights. Sutpen, as "master to slave, baron to retainer," crystallizes the white South's fantasy of an ordered, hierarchical society even as their stories acknowledge his distinctly humble origins (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 221). If we believe, as Slavoj Žižek argues, that "in the fantasy-scene the desire is not fulfilled … but constituted (given its objects, and so on),"<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> we can see the plot of <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> as an ideological fantasy prompted by the white South's repressed knowledge that the "family" is already ruptured.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> In fact, the novel's structure reflects a consciousness of the narrative of Sutpen's dynasty <span style="font-style:italic;">as</span> an ideological fiction, a point most succinctly revealed in Charles Bon's surviving letter to Judith. Bon's undated letter emphasizes the ideological process of constructing a national <span style="font-style:italic;">mythos</span>. The materials Bon uses for the letter—paper "<span style="font-style:italic;">salvaged</span> … from … <span style="font-style:italic;">a ruined aristocrat</span>" and "ink" made from Northern <span style="font-style:italic;">"stove polish</span>" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 102)—connect the story contained in the letter to its later commodified form as a popular "production" of the New South.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> References to the market value of plantation myths also suggest the ways that such myths could be instrumentalized for political ends. The Agrarians' call for a revitalized regional politics in <span style="font-style:italic;">I'll Take My Stand</span> offers perhaps the most salient example of the mobilization of the Southern <span style="font-style:italic;">mythos</span>, and their critics explicitly connected the Agrarians' program to the politics of fascism, noting the similarities between the Agrarians' traditionalism, Mussolini's commemoration of the Roman past, and Hitler's celebration of the Aryan race.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, Sutpen, as one of the so-called "ruined aristocrats," becomes the emblematic re of the narrators' national <span style="font-style:italic;">mythos</span>, and the transmission of his story becomes the means for cementing subsequent generations to him as the symbolic father.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> By staging Sutpen's history as a series of conversations, Faulkner evokes a certain personal, oral form of Southern history, a kind of familial transmission from one generation to the next that doubles the cultural transmission of the same stories. Imagining time as a series of ripples on successive pools of water, each pool maintaining an "<span style="font-style:italic;">umbilical water-cord</span>" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 210) of connection to the last pool, Quentin presents an image of history that assumes an organic connection between past and present, signified by the "umbilical cord." More specifically, the umbilical cord suggests the transmission of the Sutpen story within the Compson family from grandfather to father to Quentin, and within the Southern "family" from one generation to the next.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> The virtually complete identification of Compson familial consciousness with white Southern cultural consciousness maps the personal transmission of the Sutpen story onto a larger historical landscape. The exchange of stories from one narrator to another doubles the "blood" transmission red through the "umbilical cord," linking Sutpen symbolically to successive generations of Southern men.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> These verbal exchanges reinforce the res of biological transmission connecting the narrators in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> to one another and transforming the listeners into Sutpen's "children." As his father tells Quentin in the opening scene in the novel, Rosa chooses to summon Quentin, someone she barely knows, to listen to her story and help her return to Sutpen's Hundred because "in a sense … [it] will still be in the family" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 8).</p>
<p>The structure of the novel, which centers on debunking the Cavalier myth while dramatizing its continued appeal, points to the tautological structure of totalitarian allegiance. If Sutpen were a "classical Master," to use Žižek's term, his political and social authority would stem from the assumption of his descent from the planter class.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> But the narrators know from the beginning that Sutpen descends from poor whites living on the western Virginia frontier. <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom'</span>s focus on the narrators' identification with Sutpen, despite his personal history, suggests that his authority stems not from his origins, but from the subjects who willingly submit to him. This formulation seems tautological because it is circular: Sutpen's authority originates in the violent imposition of his design, but extending this power beyond his immediate family requires subjects willing to reproduce his design as a representation of their own identity. Sutpen's appeal lies as much in the totalizing experience of identifying with him—becoming his "children," if you will—as in the charismatic power of his personality, a dynamic that repeats the "basic deception" of totalitarianism that Žižek describes. Žižek observes that the totalitarian "Leader's point-of-reference" for "legitimi[zing] his rule (the People, the Class, the Nation) <span style="font-style:italic;">does not exist</span> … except in its fetishistic representative, the Party and its Leader.… [T]he People are the 'real People' only in so far as they are embodied in their representative, the Party and its leader."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> Similarly, the white Southern elite become the "real People" insofar as they are represented by Sutpen. Without Sutpen, they do not exist as a "People." As a result, Sutpen's authority to compel the narrators' allegiance comes through their experience of being represented by him as the father of the "nation." Sutpen himself becomes the "fetishistic representative" of an entity—the Southern nation—that does not exist except through their imagined connection to Sutpen. In fact, bonding with one another <span style="font-style:italic;">because</span> of their shared demystification  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of Sutpen's origins allows the narrators to construct the intact family of their fantasies. Instead of admiring Sutpen because he exemplifies the Cavalier tradition, they understand themselves as kin because identifying with Sutpen as their father (and leader) produces them as citizen-children of a common family and nation.</p>
<p>The narrators' obsessive concentration on Sutpen's dynasty—particularly on its "pollution" by black blood—refracts the economic crisis of the Depression-era South and casts it as a crisis of white <span style="font-style:italic;">cultural</span> power. Sutpen's failure to produce a white male heir becomes emblematic of the South's impotence in the reconstructed nation, and the narrators' pathological attachment to Sutpen becomes evidence of the South's <span style="font-style:italic;">cultural</span> pathology.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> By attributing Rosa's fury, Mr. Compson's decadence, and Quentin's paralysis (and eventual suicide) to their investment in Sutpen's narrative, the novel, in turn, invokes the liberal narrative of fascism as cultural pathology, one of many contemporary explanations offered for the emergence of fascism. If we read <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> in the context of increased labor activism, which white power attributed to the incursions of "foreigners" and "Communists" bent on destroying "traditional values," we need only consider the violent suppression of the 1928 strike of the National Textile Workers Union in Gastonia, North Carolina; the National Miner's Union strikes in 1931 and 1932 in Harlan and Bell Counties, Kentucky; the arrest of Angelo Herndon in 1932 on charges of violating a slave insurrection law; the 1934 General Strike of the Tobacco Workers' International Union in Durham, North Carolina; the persecution of organizers of the all-black Share Croppers' Union and the interracial Southern Tenant Farmers' Union; and the arrest and trial of the Scottsboro Nine to understand the stakes here. <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s white narrators counter the specter of an industrial South controlled by organized labor by displacing their anxiety about the loss of economic and social primacy onto a racialized, fetishized other.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup></p>
<p>Ernst Laclau and Chantal Mouffe's discussion of the emergence of fascist ideology is helpful in making the connection here. They argue that when fascism emerges in Europe it offers monopoly capitalism a strategy for using "mass mobilization against the traditional system of power," while decoupling it from the rhetoric of class struggle. The resulting fascist formation nullifies economic conflict between the classes by mobilizing "popular interpellations"—racism or anti-Semitism—to unite the classes against a common enemy.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> Critics read the South's investment in maintaining white supremacy as a similar attempt to eliminate class struggle in the South by mobilizing racial differences. My claim is that this strategy combines the impulse of German anti-Semitism with the mysticism of Italian organicism. Scapegoating African-Americans through enforced segregation, disenfranchisement, and lynching becomes a means for managing the threat to white elite power, and it puts blacks in the same structural position that Jews occupied in Nazi Germany.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> As a result, the "Southern family romance" and the "fascist fable" share a common response to working class agitation: both formations attempt to neutralize class conflict by unifying whites of all classes against a demonized other—African-Americans or Jews—while retaining and reinscribing the ideological preeminence of the white father.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>From the beginning of <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, the narrators suppress the instrumental role of class conflict in Sutpen's development, transforming his story into a <span style="font-style:italic;">Bildungsroman</span> centered on his appropriation of white paternal authority. Sutpen himself originates this version of events. As Mr. Compson tells Quentin, Sutpen's "code of logic and morality" comes in a burst of light, "a bright glare" from which "the severe shape of his intact innocence ris[es] … like a monument" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 192). As his rifle analogy suggests, Sutpen has already been absorbed into the symbolic order, but his moment of illumination represents the exchange of one strategy for representing patriarchal authority with another.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> In fact, I suggest that Sutpen's symbolic identification with the white planter provides the occasion for him to identify <span style="font-style:italic;">self-consciously</span> with the father as the source of logical coherence and illumination. I draw here on Žižek's distinction between imaginary identification—"identification with the image in which we appear likeable to ourselves"—and symbolic identification—"identification with the very place <span style="font-style:italic;">from where</span> we are being observed, <span style="font-style:italic;">from where</span> we look at ourselves so that we appear to ourselves likeable, worthy of son."<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> In the latter, identification initiates the subject into the logic of the symbolic order by inviting him to identify with the point of view that determines his position in that order. John T. Irwin makes a similar point, arguing that Sutpen "incorporates into himself the patriarchal ideal from which that affront sprang in much the same way that a son comes to terms with the image of the father as a re of mastery and power by impersonating that image as the superego, accepting the justice of the father's mastery even though that mastery has been exercised against the son."<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> However, I would add that symbolic identification with the planter requires Sutpen not simply to identify with the father—we might argue that his rifle demonstrates that he already identifies with the father—but to recognize the distinction between rifles and slaves as modes of representing paternal authority. The metaphors that the narrators use to describe the exchange of one symbolic form for representing the father with another—that is, their substitution of the slave's "balloon face" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 189) for the "rifle analogy"—unwittingly construct the scene as Sutpen's introduction to class differences, which he grasps through the distinction between <span style="font-style:italic;">his</span> father and the planter-father.</p>
<p>The narrators' anxiety about their economic and social position becomes encrypted in their elaborate search for the error in Sutpen's design. Their awareness of the failure of the ideology of the intact family is displaced onto the search for an intact—or whole—story. Their desire for wholeness becomes focused on a painstaking investigation of the "jigsaw puzzle picture integers" that, once in place, will reveal the meaning of Sutpen's—and their own—lives (A, 250). This impulse toward coherence begins with Sutpen himself, who describes his design originating in a moment of illumination that precipitates what Mr. Compson characterizes as "his code of logic and morality, his formula and recipe of fact and deduction" (A, 221). But as John T. Matthews observes, in Sutpen's moment of illumination nothing happens: "Sutpen's innocence remains intact, instructing him, presumably, as it has before."<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> Sutpen's "revelation" offers no insight, yet he and the other narrators persist in reproducing Sutpen's innocence even as they criticize it. Hence, when Mr. Compson observes that even though "you bring  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> them together in the proportions called for" "something is missing," he echoes his father's earlier view that Sutpen believed that "the ingredients of morality were like the ingredients of pie or cake and once you had measured them and balanced them and mixed them and put them into the oven it was all finished and nothing but pie or cake could come out" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 80, 211–12). Similarly, Quentin and Shreve imagine Bon's confusion about his past as a "jumble" of "jigsaw puzzle integers … on the point of falling into a pattern" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 250). They become detectives, searching through the "jumble," just as they imagine Bon does, to find a "pattern" that will reveal—in "a flash of light"—the family of their fantasies (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 250). Sutpen's "recipe," like Compson's "chemical formula" and Quentin's "jigsaw puzzle," relies on a series of equations, formulas, and equivalencies that he hopes will eventually add up. The novel ends with Shreve's concluding equation, an equation that cannot seem to calculate the equivalent of Jim Bond: "So it takes two niggers to get rid of one Sutpen, dont it? … which is all right, it's fine; it clears the whole ledger … except for one thing.… You've got one nigger left. One nigger Sutpen left" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 302).</p>
<p>The persistence of Jim Bond threatens the "intact" white family, but his very name reveals the bond the narrators repress. As this bond suggests, the narrative of the white family depends not only on the erasure of class conflict, but also on the mobilization of what Laclau and Mouffe term "popular interpellations" to cement white Southerners together in opposition to a common enemy. In each iteration of Sutpen's story, the narrators repeatedly offer blackness as the source of corruption in the family and miscegenation as the agent of Sutpen's destruction. If we see Sutpen's history as a synecdochal representation of white Southern history, the fall of his dynasty becomes emblematic of the "fall" of white Southern hegemony, a fall assumed by the narrators to originate in the "pollution" of black blood. Shreve's final equation provides an apocalyptic representation of the results of that pollution. In Shreve's calculation, Sutpen's black descendents cancel out the white until all that remains is the inarticulate Jim Bond, a single black idiot Sutpen, the last remnant of a once-great dynasty.</p>
<p>Given the open secret of miscegenation in the South, the narrators' repeated insistence on the tragic results of racial amalgamation seems out of proportion, particularly since they repeat their accounts of the demise of Sutpen's dynasty in 1909–10. During this period of post-Reconstruction retrenchment in the South, the initial social and political gains enjoyed by freed slaves were erased by institutionalized segregation and disenfranchisement, and reinforced by increased violence against blacks. However, the mobilization of white racism allowed the consolidation of white elite power by channeling white populist anger away from upper-class whites and onto African-Americans, a structure that persisted into the 1930s (and beyond).<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> The persistence of white supremacy invited comparisons to European fascism: Accusations of fascism Southern-style circulated liberally, from W. J. Cash's anatomization of the Klan as "an authentic folk movement" on a par with "the Nazi movement in Germany" to Grace Lumpkin's charge that Allen Tate and the Agrarians promulgated "theories … [that] are quite close to part of Hitler's and Mussolini's programs."<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> As Allan A. Michie and Frank Rhylick argued in <span style="font-style:italic;">Dixie Demagogues</span>, white supremacy was used to "crush the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> infant democracy of Reconstruction," and it was now being used "against the challenge of the New Deal and the labor polities of the CIO": "The Negro has been to the [Southern] Bourbons what the Jews have been to Hitler," they concluded.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">"A Happy Marriage of Speaking and Hearing": Creating Fascist Subjects</h1>
<p>In the post-Reconstruction white Southern imaginary, the white woman consolidated white patriarchal authority by guaranteeing the reproduction of the white family. Protecting white female purity from the imagined threat of miscegenation in the re of the black male rapist displaced class antagonism between elite and poor whites, allowing elite white men to consolidate political power. In addition, it displaced the potential threat posed by a newly-emergent black working class, allowing privileged whites to maintain economic power.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> In both <span style="font-style:italic;">Light in August</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, protecting white women against the "pollution" of black blood cements the white (male) community,<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> but where <span style="font-style:italic;">Light in August</span> represents the ritual sacrifice of the "black" outsider, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> represents the fundamental instability of the community and the ensuing need to reestablish its boundaries through the on-going production of the father and his legitimate white male heirs. In both novels, the structure is circular: the white community requires the expulsion of "pollution," and the expulsion of "pollution" constitutes the community.</p>
<p>Faulkner's representation of the vigilante "platoon" in <span style="font-style:italic;">Light in August</span> dramatizes the symbolic dependence of white male power on the supposed vulnerability of white women to rape by black men.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> It is Joanna Burden's violation more than her murder that inflames the mob, and after Percy Grimm shoots Joe Christmas, he castrates Christmas. "Flinging … the bloody butcher knife" away, he tells Christmas, "'Now you'll let white women alone, even in hell.'"<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> Castrating the black perpetrator ostensibly restores the social order of Jefferson, and the narrator tells us that it leaves Grimm's witnesses with the memory of Christmas's death, not as something "particularly threatful," but as something "triumphant" (<span style="font-style:italic;">LA</span>, 465).</p>
<p>The "triumph" of Percy Grimm adheres as much in his ability to constitute a makeshift militia for "the protection of America and Americans" as it does in avenging Joanna Burden's lost virginity (<span style="font-style:italic;">LA</span>, 454). Faulkner's depiction of Percy Grimm's "shirt"-style lynching mob associates Southern mob violence with both Nazi Storm Troopers and nativist fascist groups.<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> His representation of Grimm and his vigilantes as a quasi-militarist "platoon" distinguishes them from the <span style="font-style:italic;">ad hoc</span> lynching mobs that re in stories such as Faulkner's "Dry September" . What most interests me here is Faulkner's representation of the homosocial bond between Grimm and his followers.<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> Grimm organizes his own "platoon" out of the initially reluctant American Legion members who eventually accept Grimm "with respect and perhaps a little awe and a deal of actual faith and confidence" (<span style="font-style:italic;">LA</span>, 457). Their identification with Grimm transforms them from what the sheriff describes as "fifteen or twenty folks milling around the square with pistols in their pants" (<span style="font-style:italic;">LA</span>, 454) to a cohesive group: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>[T]hey were almost at the pitch where they might die for him, if occasion arose. They now moved in a grave and slightly awe-inspiring reflected light which was almost as palpable as the khaki would have been which Grimm wished them to wear, wished that they wore, as though each time they returned to the orderly room they dressed themselves anew in suave and austerely splendid scraps of his dream.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">LA</span>, 457)</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The narrator's layered use of conditional statements in this passage subordinates the fact that the men are not literally dressed in uniforms in order to emphasize the way that identifying with Grimm produces a "palpable" uniform. Moving in his "aweinspiring … light" materializes Grimm's dreams like "splendid scraps" of the khaki Grimm "wished that they wore." The men's new "faith and confidence" in Grimm also seems to feminize them, converting individual men with phallic pistols in their pants into a unified and passive mass moving in Grimm's "reflected light."</p>
<p>Accepting Grimm as their leader transforms the group's bearing so that on the Monday morning of Christmas's Grand Jury hearing, the narrator remarks that the "intact" platoon "now wore uniforms. It was their faces" (LA, 457). The platoon's changed relationship with Grimm is literally written on their faces, their awe and confidence in Grimm as manifest as a khaki uniform would have been. In privileging the platoon's appearance over its interiority—that is, in describing the shift in allegiance as a visible sign written on their faces, not as a subjective experience—the narrator recapitulates fascism's critique of bourgeois interiority and emphasizes the aesthetic dimension of their political commitment.<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> By using the metaphor of changing clothes, the narrator materializes the newly forged homosocial bond as a rative "change in uniform." In critic Kenneth Burke's account of changes of allegiance, "the vesting and divesting of insignia" and "clothes, uniforms, and their psychological equivalents" are crucial markers of "one's material and mental ways of placing oneself as a person in the groups and movements."<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> The platoon's passive allegiance materializes their transformation from liberal individuals into a fascist mass.</p>
<p>Joanna Burden plays an instrumental role in the larger drama of Grimm's makeshift militia by serving as the impetus for its eventual action against Joe Christmas. But the focus of Grimm's action centers as much on the constitution of his platoon—and himself as its leader—as on its vengeance for Joanna Burden's violation and murder. In Grimm's imagination, defending "America" and avenging Joanna Burden's murder become conflated, and the mob's organization into the "intact" platoon encrypts Christmas's alleged crime into the group's coherence. The intact group of men—moving in the "awe-inspiring reflected light" of Percy Grimm—seeks vengeance for the assumed violation of Burden's intact hymen, a crime that symbolizes the larger violation of the white community and nation. The structural dynamics of homosocial identification in <span style="font-style:italic;">Light in August</span> reinforce the racial hierarchy that Joe Christmas's uncertain racial identity threatens to undermine. While the novel remains equivocal on the question of Christmas's racial heritage, it is the lynching itself that finally confirms Christmas's "blackness" for Grimm and unifies the whites in Jefferson. The bond among members of the community, then, <span style="font-style:italic;">relies on</span> the expulsion of "blackness": as Mason Stokes writes, "[w]hite supremacy … can be usefully understood as a homosocial network  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that commodifies and appropriates the bodies of white women and black men in order to consolidate both whiteness and heterosexuality as governing ideologies … and political structures."<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup></p>
<p>Faulkner's exploration of the homosocial bonds among Sutpen's "sons" in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> explicitly connects the construction of a white community to the drama of familial reproduction. Many critics have explored the mediating role that Judith Sutpen plays in the relationship between her brothers, Henry and Bon, noting, in particular, the Compson men's preoccupation with virginity, incest, and miscegenation as a manifestation of their desire for genealogical and racial purity and as an expression of repressed property relations.<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> What interests me here, however, is the mediating role that Rosa Coldfield's <span style="font-style:italic;">storytelling</span> plays in the production of Quentin and Shreve as Sutpen's "sons." Quentin and Shreve's bonding occurs as the result of Rosa's precipitating act of narration. Rosa reproduces the immediacy of Sutpen's originating voice, and telling Sutpen's story, as Matthews observes, "disseminate[s] the seed, fostering a family of tellings."<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s "family of tellings" operates through the <span style="font-style:italic;">rative</span> construct of marriage as a trope for conceptualizing "conversation" between like-minded individuals.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> By coupling anxiety about actual marriages—consummated or not—with "marriage" as a metaphor describing scenes of verbal transmission, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> explicitly connects biological and narrative reproduction. In turn, the novel's self-reflexive representation of national mythmaking doubles similar exercises in Italy and Germany and demonstrates the relationship between national myths and the production of subjects.</p>
<p>While both <span style="font-style:italic;">Light in August</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> have narrators who give voice to plots that shape the white community, the present "action" of <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> consists entirely of telling stories. If the men in Percy Grimm's lynching mob become a community by acting out their part in the story of "Negro rape," Quentin and Shreve become part of Sutpen's "family" by telling the story of becoming his sons. As they recreate Sutpen's history, they first imagine themselves riding <span style="font-style:italic;">with</span> Sutpen's sons—"not two but four of them riding the two horses through the dark"—and, then, they become <span style="font-style:italic;">merged</span> with them as "Charles-Shreve and Quentin-Henry" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 267). Their work of collaborative storytelling—and of imaginative connection—binds Quentin and Shreve to Sutpen as his "children" and to one another as members of a common family. Atkinson argues that <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s singular focus on Sutpen's containment in the repetition of his story "mediat[es] disruptions in the social order."<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup> True, but reading <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> as an antifascist "allegory" that "complicates and interrogates theories of racial purity and white supremacy" shared by white Southerners and fascists addresses only part of the novel's critique of fascism.<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup> What Atkinson and Brinkmeyer, Jr. both miss is the novel's exploration of the underbelly of Southern racism: the irrational appeal of belonging to something, signified by becoming Sutpen's "sons."</p>
<p>Beginning with Rosa's account of Sutpen's wrestling matches against his slaves, white witnesses are invited to identify with Sutpen as he exercises power.<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> More importantly, they are initiated into a symbolic order in which they experience themselves as simultaneously <span style="font-style:italic;">like</span> Sutpen and <span style="font-style:italic;">subject</span> to him. From this position, the viewer and then those who listen, experience their domination as a source of pleasure, which they  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> associate with belonging to Sutpen's family. The seductiveness of their subjection to Sutpen shapes the narrators who tell his story as well, and understanding their desire for the white father as the symbol of order helps explain their allegiance to Sutpen despite their knowledge of his origins, his ambition, and his cruelty. The novel's focus on <span style="font-style:italic;">voice</span>, then, fuses the "oratorical" performances of the Dixie demagogue with those of the fascist leader as it explores their complex appeal.</p>
<p>Rosa's voice precipitates the storytelling, and she serves as a physical link between Sutpen and his symbolic heirs. However, in contrast to feminist readings of Rosa, I suggest that Rosa's alternative narrative—her disruptive voice, if you will—works to <span style="font-style:italic;">allow</span>, rather than to challenge, the consolidation of masculine authority in the novel by legitimizing the erotic connection between Sutpen and successive generations of Southern men. The feminine in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, rather than <span style="font-style:italic;">opposing</span> patriarchal narrative, travels <span style="font-style:italic;">with</span> patriarchal narrative, as its <span style="font-style:italic;">necessary</span> "other," to bind subjects more fully to that narrative.<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> Feminist critics of <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> have had to grapple with the fact that Rosa, her vitriol against Sutpen notwithstanding, ultimately assents to—and even participates in—his design. Attempting to reconcile Rosa's "disruptive" voice with her apparent capitulation to patriarchy has prompted critics to split Rosa, casting her simultaneously as a character in the novel and as a disembodied "indeterminate narrative voice"; to make her representative of "both woman's disruptive power" and its consequence, "the annihilation of the female subject"; to cast her as unresponsive object rather than living subject.<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup> All of these readings decouple Rosa's subjectivity from her voice in order to account for the apparent disparity between her act of narration and her interpellation into Southern ideology. What connects these readings conceptually, however, is the assumption that the feminine is always disruptive, that it always operates in opposition to and in the interstices of patriarchal narratives.</p>
<p>In contrast, I contend that the novel dramatizes the necessary coupling of the feminine and masculine impulses, depicting their merger as the foundation of the Southern "nation." Rosa's voice—particularly in Chapter Five—invites identification with its own "<span style="font-style:italic;">I</span>," which, by capitulating to Sutpen's design "became all polymath love's androgynous advocate" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 117). Sutpen's insult prevents Rosa from birthing a literal heir, but she nevertheless gives birth to his symbolic sons. While <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s <span style="font-style:italic;">plot</span> turns on Rosa's refusal to gamble on producing an out-of-wedlock white male heir for Sutpen, its <span style="font-style:italic;">structure</span> dramatizes the creation of that next generation of "heirs" in Quentin and Shreve. Both the Northerner and the Southerner, connected as they are by the "umbilical cord" of the Mississippi River (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 208), become Sutpen's sons through the erotic identification with Henry and Bon that Rosa's voice initiates.</p>
<p>My reading of Rosa as the fascist mother to Sutpen's fascist father maps the "fascist fable" onto the Southern family romance through the mediating re of the white woman. If for Southern traditionalists the open secret of the Southern family romance is miscegenation, its central drama revolves around the reproduction of the white family through endogamous marriages producing legitimate white male heirs. Similarly, the fascist nation centers on a patriarch who embodies the nation and establishes the limits of the family. In both iterations, the sociopolitical formation of the family-as-nation  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> emerges through the incessant repetition of the same plot: identification with the father as the psychological bedrock of citizenship and the subsequent purging of "outsiders" from the (national) "family." As Wilhelm Reich wrote of fascism in 1936, "[T]he authoritarian position of the father reflects his political role and discloses the relation of the family to the authoritarian state."<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup> Central to the ideological construction of the nation in both instances is the equation of public belonging—citizenship—with the private experience of belonging to a patriarchal family. Yet as Reich argues, the father's political role in the family (and the state) depends on what critic Alice Yaeger Kaplan calls "mother-bound feelings."<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup> According to Reich, "[i]n their <span style="font-style:italic;">subjective emotional core</span> the notions of <span style="font-style:italic;">homeland and nation are notions of mother and family</span>."<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup> In the complex dynamic between "mother-" and "father-bound feelings," Kaplan argues that:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Hitler, even and especially Hitler, can be mother in a utopian moment, father in an authoritarian one.… [P]eople can identify with a leader-as-father, in that they imagine the leader's power over the state as being their own over their smaller world. But we could just as easily characterize the same moment as one in which a leader-as-mother 'gives birth' to people's feelings of power and euphoria.<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In the fascist state, as in the white Southern family in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, the psychological desire for belonging to the family depends on both the father- and mother-bound aspects of identification with the father, and it simultaneously enables and explains the perpetuation of social and economic privileges accorded its members.</p>
<p>Rosa Coldfield "gives birth" to Quentin and Shreve by giving voice—literally and ratively—to Sutpen's history, keeping him alive long after his death at the hands of Wash Jones. As the novel opens, Rosa's voice conjures Thomas Sutpen, producing for the reluctantly listening Quentin an almost palpable image of the demonic Sutpen and his gaggle of half-wild slaves. Her voice recounts Sutpen's story; more importantly, it actually <span style="font-style:italic;">produces</span> him. He is "resolved," "evoked," "invoked," made into a "picture" by Rosa's very act of telling (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 8, 9). By combining spectacle with voice, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> depicts the narrators' interpellation as both visual <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> oral: In recounting his story, witnesses conjure Sutpen, their voices making him "visible" to the next generation of white Southerners. <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s emphasis on the incantatory power of voice couples the sound of the narrators' voices with the "sonorous defeated names" "echoing" in Quentin's body and with the sound of Sutpen's originating voice (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 7). Rosa describes the foundation of Sutpen's design as a verbal act of creation—"<span style="font-style:italic;">Be Sutpen's Hundred</span> like the oldentime <span style="font-style:italic;">Be light</span>"—her voice reiterating the original speech act (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 4). If spectacle offers one means of enacting the domination of the father, the incantatory repetition of his voice offers another. Listening elicits the immediacy of presence, until Quentin, this time in response to his father's account, "could see it; he [Quentin] might even have been there" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 155). Yet the novel consistently distinguishes between "listening" and "hearing." Quentin, as audience to endless iterations, often refuses to listen as his only escape from the repetitive voices of Rosa and his father. But refusing to listen doesn't block out sound or consign him to silence. Instead, he "hear[s] … without listening," remembering at one point during his exchange with Shreve that  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> "<span style="font-style:italic;">I didn't need to listen then but I had to hear it and now I am having to hear it all over again because he sounds just like Father</span>" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 102, 171). Quentin doesn't need to listen—he grew up listening—but he "<span style="font-style:italic;">ha[s] to hear it again</span>." The very ubiquity of the story in all its repeated manifestations appears to structure the past as well as the present and the future. Quentin's thoughts turn the question, "<span style="font-style:italic;">Am I going to have to hear it again</span>" into the statement, "<span style="font-style:italic;">I am going to have to hear it all over again</span>," not only now ("<span style="font-style:italic;">I am already hearing</span>," "<span style="font-style:italic;">I am listening</span>"), but forever ("<span style="font-style:italic;">I shall have to never hear anything else</span>") (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 222).</p>
<p>Quentin's syntax suggests a <span style="font-style:italic;">desire</span> to hear that is intimately tied to the confluence of Shreve's voice with his father's. Quentin is compelled to hear, then, not just because he can't escape the speakers, but because the sound itself—the "notlanguage" of the deep South—compels his hearing (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 5). Sound conjures Sutpen's presence for Quentin's (and our) "viewing," and its incantatory power satisfies a deep, extra-linguistic desire. Sutpen's story is, of course, the narrators' story too, but that correspondence does not account for the desire driving Quentin "<span style="font-style:italic;">to hear it all over again</span>." Rather, it seems that his immersion in the repeated sound itself satisfies him as much as the story does. I am suggesting that this duality of "listening" and "hearing" offers another means for explaining why the narrators in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, who recognize (and condemn) Sutpen's ruthlessness and overweening ambition, feel nevertheless compelled to repeat his story, the very sounds themselves offering comfort and familiarity.</p>
<p>The distinction in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> between listening and hearing corresponds to a distinction Julia Kristeva makes between the symbolic and semiotic registers of language.<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65">65</a></sup> If the symbolic register, following Lacan, corresponds to the father and to the image, the semiotic corresponds to the maternal and to the vocal. Kristeva associates the semiotic with "the instinctual and maternal," with "rhythmic, intonal repetitions," and "a sonorous distictiveness" that is "no longer either a phoneme or a part of the symbolic system."<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66">66</a></sup> Faulkner's novel not only materializes the reproduction of culture, it also dramatizes the complex ways that language, through meaning and sound, inhabits and shapes consciousness. Quentin describes himself as a receptacle for sound, a veritable ear, "his very body … an empty hall echoing" with the sounds of "stubborn back-looking ghosts," his imagination and sense of himself products of that echo (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 7). In theorizing the interpenetration of semiotic and symbolic functions of language, Kristeva identifies a <span style="font-style:italic;">social</span> function for the semiotic disruption in poetic language, claiming that semiotic disruption works to counteract the repressiveness of modern culture.</p>
<p>Kristeva's theory of the disruption associated with the semiotic assumes that poetic language undermines rather than reinforces patriarchal structures of authority; however, she concedes that semiotic disruption "sometimes falls in with deeds brought about by the same rationality, as is, for example, the instinctual determination of fascism."<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67">67</a></sup> Highlighting the relationship between "modern rationality" and fascism underscores the difficulty in disentangling fascism from bourgeois political and economic formations, a point reiterated by Zeev Sternhell and Laclau and Mouffe, but it also points to the complex dialectic between the symbolic and the semiotic—or the father- and motherbound—in fascism. Fascism's capacity to yoke apparently contradictory impulses opens  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> up the possibility that the maternal might <span style="font-style:italic;">contribute</span> to supporting the authority of the father rather than always undermining it. Kaplan claims that understanding the work of the semiotic—the maternal, "oceanic" structures of language—in the rhythms of fascist rallies and the incantations of voice helps to explain the deep irrational pleasure associated with identification with the fascist father.<sup><a name="f68-text" href="#f68">68</a></sup> Thinking about the incantatory power of sound that shapes the narrative in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> illuminates, in part, Sutpen's enduring fascination for successive generations of Southerners. Sutpen is the product of speakers who, despite claims to the contrary, wish to naturalize his story, for to tell Sutpen's story is to tell their own and to establish, through the telling, the authority of their own voices. The effects of voice are contradictory for Quentin Compson, producing simultaneously the erotic pleasure of intimacy with the father and the paralysis that eventually leads to suicide. Quentin's "reverence for voice," to use Kaplan's formulation, "denote[s] dangerous desires for the acultural, the antiintellectual, the seductive, the <span style="font-style:italic;">fascist</span>," desires that allow him both to recognize and to suppress other voices, a point to which I will return.<sup><a name="f69-text" href="#f69">69</a></sup></p>
<p>The structural relation between the fascist leader and his followers casts the leader as "masculine" to a "feminized" mass, eroticizing the masses' relationship to the leader. We saw a version of this dynamic in the depiction of Percy Grimm's followers in <span style="font-style:italic;">Light in August</span>. However, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, voice becomes the means for producing fascist subjects. In his 1939 review of <span style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf</span>, Burke pointed out that Hitler assumes that the masses are feminine and that they "desire to be led by a dominating male. This male, as orator, woos them."<sup><a name="f70-text" href="#f70">70</a></sup> The "wooing" occurs through the leader's voice, but his voice seduces because it fulfills the masses' desire to be dominated. As many cultural historians have argued, this politicization of the body and of sexuality allowed the fascist leader, as Erin G. Carlson puts it, to substitute "his ecstatic, erotic fusion with the masses" for bourgeois individualism.<sup><a name="f71-text" href="#f71">71</a></sup> In societies that simultaneously privileged virility and persecuted homosexuality, the homosocial bond between the leader and his male followers had to be mediated by the "mother-bound" feelings produced by his voice, feelings which allowed for both their virility and their subjugation.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, storytelling cements the homosocial bonds between Southern men. With the exception of Rosa's conversation with Quentin, all the scenes of transmission are male-to-male, beginning with Sutpen's conversation with Quentin's grandfather, who, in turn, tells the tale to his son, Quentin's father, who then tells it to Quentin. Shreve's conversation with Quentin follows in this pattern, and the fact that Shreve's voice "sounds just like Father's" only reiterates the mapping of narrative and generational transmission that occurs before.<sup><a name="f72-text" href="#f72">72</a></sup> Conversing in the "warm rosy orifice" of their dorm room "above the iron quad (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 176)," the narrator observes that the two:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>stared at one another … There was something curious in the way they looked at one another, curious and quiet and profoundly intent, not at all as two young men might look at each other but almost as a youth and a very young girl might out of virginity itself—a sort of hushed and naked searching.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 240) <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p>Critics have read this scene widely, as evidence of both an actual sexual relationship between Quentin and Shreve and as a metaphoric representation of the erotics of speech.<sup><a name="f73-text" href="#f73">73</a></sup> I am arguing for something in between: the erotic charge between Quentin and Shreve is both real <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> symbolic. That is, an erotic connection occurs as a necessary aspect of their identification with Sutpen, a connection that depends on the seduction of voice.<sup><a name="f74-text" href="#f74">74</a></sup> I accept the claim that asserting normative sexuality becomes a constitutive component of Southern identity through the politicization of sexuality and raced bodies (a structure that mirrors similar structures in fascism). However, reading the homoerotic aspects of Quentin and Shreve's bond simply as a manifestation of repressed homosexuality fails to account for the complex ways that same sex desire is both necessary and anathema to white male identification with the planter–father. That is, the production of white male community and, consequently, white male subjectivity in the South <span style="font-style:italic;">depends</span> on homosocial desire. Quentin and Shreve themselves are vaguely aware of their sexual attraction to Sutpen. The experience of telling Sutpen's story, the narrator tells us, causes Quentin and Shreve to don "that protective coloring of levity behind which the youthful shame of being moved hid itself" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 225). Joking as they tell the story allows them to manage their arousal, which is simultaneously erotic and aesthetic.</p>
<p>Quentin and Shreve's arousal occurs as the result of their collaborative telling, their union producing "people" "out of the rag tag and bob-ends of old tales and talking" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 243). As this passage implies, their erotic speech is generative, suggesting the productive capacity of homosocial desire. The mediation of the imaginary "very young girl" legitimizes their "reproduction." Philip M. Weinstein argues that while <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> "imagines genealogical descent as a fantasy of purely male making," the novel's language encodes "the place of the female," so that "females … reappear … as the space of potential nurture" in, for example, "ripples, pools, feeding, and umbilical cords."<sup><a name="f75-text" href="#f75">75</a></sup> I suggest that the reappearing female red in the "very young girl" is made possible by Rosa's voice, which is itself described in generative terms as "like a stream, a trickle running from patch to patch of dry sand" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 4). Rosa's voice nurtures the "dry sand" of Quentin's imagination, and her invitation to Quentin revives the Sutpen "dynasty" by facilitating the generation of his symbolic heirs.</p>
<p>Sutpen's history unfolds through scenes of telling and listening, but these scenes are less dialogues than they are oratorical performances in which Rosa (and Mr. Compson) almost always insist that Quentin listen to stories he has already heard. Ross claims that the "oratorical" narrative voice in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> "integrates features of a cultural discourse into the fiction."<sup><a name="f76-text" href="#f76">76</a></sup> By evoking the tradition of Southern oratory in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s narrative voice, Ross argues, Faulkner draws attention to aspects of oratory that make oratorical speech a "ritual performed for reconfirmation of shared values."<sup><a name="f77-text" href="#f77">77</a></sup> While the orator "expresses the power of a discourse both orator and audience are caught up in, the orator still … dominates the audience," and this "domination implies violence." In the hands of Southern demagogues, the oratory "manifests a mixture of participation and domination," which is repeated in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>.<sup><a name="f78-text" href="#f78">78</a></sup> The features of Southern oratory that Ross locates in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> could also describe the performative aspects of Hitler's and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Mussolini's oratorical practices, where the fascist father's voice evokes his presence and asserts his authority, a connection made by critics of the "Dixie demagogue." These acts of symbolic violence in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> find a complement in the few scenes of dialogue, which, as Ross argues, "constitute scenes of assault, violence, even murder,"<sup><a name="f79-text" href="#f79">79</a></sup> a point that Warwick Wadlington underscores by suggesting that <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s narrators, by failing to acknowledge others, "produc[e] a desire to subject the other to one's power."<sup><a name="f80-text" href="#f80">80</a></sup> By making these private exchanges coercive and by suggesting that they shape white Southern identity, the novel explores the coupling of force and desire, of power and intimacy.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Democratic Aesthetics: Faulkner's Anti-Fascism</h1>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s focus on the corrosive effects of obsession with Sutpen combines a critique of the aestheticization of politics with a canny manipulation of the very forms that allow the style of politics to be de-coupled from its substance. Faulkner's emphasis on surfaces—on the sensuous effects of language in contrast to his characters' desire for "hidden" meanings—corresponds to fascism's representational strategies. The desire for depth becomes an effect, a means of manipulating reader/listeners, while images conjured through language suggest the operation of fascist spectacle where what a viewer sees is not what "is," but what recapitulates already-held ideas and beliefs.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> also embodies a central contradiction: its narrators reveal Sutpen's violent will-to-power, and the novel demonstrates the reproduction of that will-to-power in the narrators who repeat his story, yet the novel itself repeats a version of the same will-to-power, the same incantatory staging of domination in its own structure. All the narrators in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> tell essentially the same story, yet the allocation of the story to multiple narrators encourages us to see the versions told by Rosa, Mr. Compson, Quentin, and Shreve as distinct and different. Even though each narrator offers an ostensibly distinct point of view, Faulkner uses similar diction and syntax to represent each person's speech. This feature of the novel, which Ross dubs the "oratorical Overvoice," has been noted by many critics and is, in part, the result of Faulkner's practice while writing to move portions of the novel from one narrator to another.<sup><a name="f81-text" href="#f81">81</a></sup> As a result, the voices blend with one another until they sound alike, creating a monological effect in the text that reinforces the dramatized encounters themselves. This interchangeability of voices in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> underscores the novel's insistence on a single story, told from the point of view of the planter class and its descendents, while the totalizing <span style="font-style:italic;">aesthetic</span> perspective works to neutralize the fragmentation of white elite power in the social sphere.<sup><a name="f82-text" href="#f82">82</a></sup></p>
<p>That Faulkner deliberately chose to assign the narrative in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> to these characters—all white, all part of the same social class—is indisputable if we look at an early version of the Sutpen material, the story "Evangeline," which was not published until after Faulkner's death.<sup><a name="f83-text" href="#f83">83</a></sup> "Evangeline," like <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, contains multiple temporal frames: the first-person frame narrator, a newspaper writer who gets a tip about a "ghost" in an old Mississippi house from a local-color painter, goes to the old Sutpen house where he gets the story of the Sutpen children and Charles Bon from an old  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> slave woman who witnessed the Civil War-era events. This eyewitness—whom we learn is Henry and Judith's half-sister—anticipates the character of Clytie in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, but with a crucial difference: whereas "Evangeline" gives us the actual voice of the slave, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> grants Clytie no similar occasion for telling any of the interlocutors what she saw. By limiting <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s narrative point of view, Faulkner emphasizes the <span style="font-style:italic;">repetition</span> of Sutpen's story among its narrators as much as the content.</p>
<p>I suggest that this repetition points to the fact that identification with the father is never complete or final. Perpetually repeating the story simultaneously produces subjects and underscores the fragility of those subjects' identification with Sutpen, which, because it is never total, must constantly be reenacted. If we see the repeated stories as versions of Sutpen's wrestling matches—both are scenes of ritual domination—we might also understand each telling of the story as an opportunity for the narrator to <span style="font-style:italic;">withdraw</span> from identification with Sutpen by telling another story. But these alternative stories never get told. <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> suggests alternative narratives in the stories of Wash and Milly Jones and Sutpen's black children, but the white narrators appropriate these narratives, reframing them as stories about the consequences of being outside the "family."</p>
<p>Wash Jones's story becomes a cautionary tale in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, an occasion for exploring the possibility, as well as the consequences, of challenging Sutpen's authority. Jones's identification with Sutpen crumbles in the instant he realizes that Sutpen has no intention of acknowledging Milly's daughter as his own. Sutpen's failure to "make hit right" with Milly precipitates Jones's revenge, which the novel depicts as a recognition of the difference between "<span style="font-style:italic;">his kind and mine</span>" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 228, 233). Jones understands himself as different in "kind," sees that he is a victim of "men of Sutpen's own kind," who "set the order and the rule of living" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 232). But in Mr. Compson's telling (and Quentin's retelling with Shreve), this moment of difference, this "tech" of the real, becomes subsumed in accounts that deny the specificity of Sutpen's betrayal and Wash's disillusionment. Compson's representation of these events makes Wash's attack a capricious act of personal vengeance, rather than an act of class violence.</p>
<p>Repeating his father's story, Quentin acknowledges Jones's disillusionment, but he, too, neutralizes its challenge to Sutpen's class (and his own) by universalizing the story of flight. To run "from men of Sutpen's own kind" is to exchange "one set of bragging and evil shadows for another, since they (men) were all of a kind throughout all of earth" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 232). Quentin's assertion that all men are the same belies Jones's earlier awareness of a schism between himself and Sutpen, which Quentin, following his father, ignores. Jones's passivity and ultimate death reflect not only an awareness of the impossibility of escaping Sutpen's "kind," but also the fantasy of <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s narrators who thereby contain and neutralize the meaning of Jones's violence as an act of protest. By depicting Wash's self-immolation as a means for him and "<span style="font-style:italic;">all who remain of us</span>" to avoid disillusionment (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 233), Quentin and his father can imagine the wholesale destruction of the white working class as the result of the Jones's personal failure to identify with Sutpen. In short, they can imagine Jones's destruction as the inevitable outcome of challenging Sutpen's preeminence. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The narrators ultimately contain the threat of Wash's protest, but at least his story appears in some form. Unlike "Evangeline," which features the narrative of Sutpen's black daughter, none of <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s black characters offers an account of Sutpen's life. Instead, white narrators present Sutpen's history as the only Southern history, while the experiences of the Sutpen's black descendents emerge only through the mediation of white narrators. Jim Bond, the last "nigger Sutpen," remains a stubborn cipher, a zero who only maintains some presence through his inarticulate howls and groans (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 302). But Jim's name—Bond—exists as a reminder to Quentin of his historical and familial bond with Sutpen's black descendents, and it encrypts an acknowledgement of the continuing bondage of Southern blacks.</p>
<p>The challenges that Wash and Sutpen's black descendents represent to the white narrators' authority reflect the always partial identification of subjects with Sutpen. They also illustrate the power of the dominant narrative to circumscribe other narrators' ability to form counter-narratives. Resistance remains inchoate, a set of signifiers still seeking form, but glimpsed in Wash's scythe, felt in Clytie's touch, and heard in Jim Bond's howl.<sup><a name="f84-text" href="#f84">84</a></sup> Similarly <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, the novel, enacts a critique of fascism, without offering an alternative, anti-fascist narrative. By dramatizing the appeal of totalizing political and aesthetic formations to its narrators, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> provides an account of the power of national myths to shape the subjectivity of its citizen-characters. The novel makes visible the effects of these formations in Quentin's paralysis and suicide and Rosa's fury. However, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> never suggests how subject-citizens might resist Sutpen, who, even after death, remains "somehow a thousand times more potent and alive" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 225).</p>
<p>We can read <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> as an instance of what Burke calls "debunking"—the liberal impulse to criticize without offering alternatives<sup><a name="f85-text" href="#f85">85</a></sup>—but I suggest that we might also see that <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s debunking produces a crucial kind of critique. The novel simultaneously affirms and challenges liberal narratives that pit fascism against democracy as democracy's opposite, or "other." <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> suggests that the danger of "the authoritarian personality" lies in its appropriation of all discourse into the "one voice" of fascism and the consequent distortion of individual subjects and whole cultures<sup><a name="f86-text" href="#f86">86</a></sup>. In its representation of the corrosive effects of monologism in the South—one party rule, white supremacy, arrested cultural development—<span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> affirms liberalism's assertion of fascism's absolute difference. However, the novel's structure, its "infection" by the totalizing impulse it criticizes, complicates the liberal narrative of democratic difference. <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s conversations <span style="font-style:italic;">suggest</span> dialogue while insisting on a single point of view, thus showing the vulnerability of democracy's "Babel of voices" to the power and appeal of "one voice."<sup><a name="f87-text" href="#f87">87</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s critique centers not only on the fascist tendencies of the Dixie demagogue, but, more importantly, on the very real possibility that democracy itself might spawn fascism.</p>

Cash, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Mind of the South</span> (New York: Vintage, 1991 [1941]), 134. However, Southern conservatives were also interested in exploring what a reactionary movement could learn from fascism. See Stark Young, "Notes on Fascism Today" I, II, III, <span style="font-style:italic;">New Republic</span> LXVIII (22 July, 29 July, and 5 August, 1931), 258–260, 281–83, 312–14; and Seward Collins's writings on fascism in the <span style="font-style:italic;">American Review</span> between 1933 and 1936, when Collins also published the work of the Southern Agrarians.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f9" href="#f9-text">9. </a>The phrase "Southern family romance" comes from Richard H. King's <span style="font-style:italic;">A Southern Renaissance: The Cultural Awakening Of The American South, 1930–1955</span> (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1980) and refers to the Oedipal dynamics of the mixed race Southern "family," which revolves around a strong father and both his legitimate and unacknowledged offspring (26–38). For a reading of the Oedipal family in Faulkner's fiction, see John T. Irwin, <span style="font-style:italic;">Doubling and Incest / Repetition and Revenge: A Speculative Reading of Faulkner</span> (Baltimore, MA: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1975). The complex politics of family in the South (and in Faulkner's fiction) find a complement in the cultural politics of German and Italian fascism, which also coalesce around a father who defines familial—and national—belonging in racial terms. The reading of fascism as family pathology emerged first in Wilhelm Reich's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Mass Psychology of Fascism</span> (Vincent Carfagno, trans. [New York: Touchstone, 1970 ], 53), but this work was indebted to Freud's <span style="font-style:italic;">Group Psychology</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Totem and Taboo</span>.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f16" href="#f16-text">16. </a>In the 1930s U.S. understandings of fascism were shaped by the politics of the beholder. Members of the Communist Party of the United States of America (C.P.U.S.A.) followed the Third International, which asserted in 1924 and then again in 1936, that fascism was the instrument of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> capitalism. Left-liberals (including some Marxist intellectuals) tended to see fascism as a product of decaying bourgeois culture, emerging from cultural fragmentation and social conflict, from a decayed middle-class family structure, and/or from the economic and social insecurity of the middle class. See Frank A. Warren, <span style="font-style:italic;">Liberals and Communism: The "Red Decade" Revisited</span> (New York: Columbia University Press, 1993), 89–101; Zeev Sternhell, "Fascist Ideology," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Fascism: A Reader's Guide</span>, ed. E. W. Laqueur (Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA and London: University of California Press, 1976), 315–76; and Payne, <span style="font-style:italic;">A History of Fascism</span>, 451–53. As Payne points out, the cultural pathology thesis appeared in work by Benedetto Croce, Georg Lukács, Wilhelm Reich, Adorno and Horkheimer, Erich Fromm, and American sociologists Harold Lasswell and Talcott Parsons (and it anticipated Hannah Arendt's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Origins of Totalitarianism</span>). Historians and political theorists continue to debate the origins of fascism. For more on the terms of this debate, see Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, <span style="font-style:italic;">Hegemony And Socialist Strategy</span>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (London: Verso, 2001); Walter Laqueur, <span style="font-style:italic;">Fascism: A Reader's Guide</span> (Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA and London: University of California Press, 1976); George L.

The cultural pathology thesis matched up with contemporary views of the South as a place particularly vulnerable to authoritarian tendencies in its efforts to maintain white supremacy and suppress labor activism. For contemporary sources on the South's cultural pathology, see Allan A. Michie and Frank Rhylick, <span style="font-style:italic;">Dixie Demagogues</span> (New York: Vanguard Press, 1939); Lumpkin, <span style="font-style:italic;">The South in Progress</span>; and Cash, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Mind of the South</span>. In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Fourth Ghost</span>, Brinkmeyer, Jr. argues for the South's "irrationality" as exemplary of its "pathology" and connects the region's "irrational" culture to fascism's similar irrationality (7–11).</p></div>

However, according to Žižek, in addressing the "distance between this corporatist vision and the factual society split by antagonist struggles," the society must introduce the fetish—for fascists, the Jew—which "simultaneously denies and embodies the structural impossibility of 'Society'" . According to Žižek, the fantasy of wholeness is always already corrupted; it is "the way the antagonistic fissure is masked.… [<span style="font-style:italic;">F</span>]<span style="font-style:italic;">antasy is a means for an ideology to take its own failure into account in advance</span>" .</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f28" href="#f28-text">28. </a>Many critics have noted the yoking of the Southern historical narrative with the Compson family history.

In <span style="font-style:italic;">Reading Faulkner</span> (Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press, 1989), Wesley Morris (with Barbara Alverson Morris) connects the story of a crisis in cultural and familial transmission with "a crisis of aesthetics" in Faulkner's fiction .</p></div>

At this climactic moment, Rosa imagines herself made Clytie's twin through the agency of Clytie's touch. Clytie's hand connects Rosa to Sutpen like an umbilical cord, collapsing the distance between Rosa and Sutpen and suggesting the exchange of blood between the father and his two "daughters," one actual and one symbolic. The re reappears in Quentin's conversation with Shreve, when the narrator describes the Mississippi River as the "umbilical cord" that links Shreve's Canadian home to Quentin's Southern one .</p></div>

While Faulkner does not refer to the Louis-Schmelling contests in his published correspondence in the 1930s, their first bout occurred in 1936, the year Faulkner published <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, and the press build-up for the match began well before that. Rosa's representation of Sutpen's ritualized ts recalls the structures of the fascist "cult of war and danger" by establishing violence as a regenerative activity and by associating hand-to-hand combat with virility and the representation of national power (Sternhell, "Fascist Ideology," 341).

It is crucial to note that Kaplan distinguishes between "mother-bound feelings" and the actual experience of women under fascism, who were largely disempowered . For an account of fascist theories of gender, see Lucia Re, "Fascist Theories of 'Woman' and the Construction of Gender," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mothers of Invention: Women, Italian Fascism, and Culture</span>, ed. Robin Pickering-Iazzi (Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 1995), 76–99. Notions of "masculinity" and "femininity" structured the discursive spaces in which fascism maintained power; as a result, critics have distinguished between actual subjects and the ideology of gender that shaped fascist representations of the state and family. Because these discursive formations were decoupled from actual subjects, critics have also explored the ways that actual women appropriated gendered discourse within fascist societies both in support of fascist regimes and in protest: see Barbara Spackman, <span style="font-style:italic;">Fascist Virilities: Rhetoric, Ideology, and Social Fantasy in Italy</span> (Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 1996) and Nancy Locke, "Valentine de Saint-Point and the Fascist Construction of Woman," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Fascist Visions: Art And Ideology In France and Italy</span>, Matthew Affron and Mark Antliff, eds. (Princeton, NJ and Oxford: Princeton University Press, 1997), 73–100. For an account of how the fascist vision of an aestheticized totality enlists both men and women and draws on bourgeois gender relations for its structures, see Klaus Theweleit, <span style="font-style:italic;">Male Fantasies</span>, 2 vols., Stephen Conway, trans., with Erica Carter and Chris Turner (Cambridge: Polity Press, 1987, 1989).</p></div>

Carlson, <span style="font-style:italic;">Thinking Fascism: Sapphic Modernism And Fascist Modernity</span> (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1998), 38. On fascism's anti-liberalism, see Sternhell, "Fascist Ideology," 325–37. On fascism and the individual, see the same source, 344–349. Spackman argues that "the [fascist] cult of youth, of duty, of sacrifice and heroic virtues, of strength and stamina, of obedience and authority, and of physical strength and sexual potency … are all inflections of that master term, virility" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Fascist Virilities</span>, xii). For more on the "Rhetoric of Virility," see Chapter 1. On fascist masculinity, see George L. Mosse, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Image of Man: The Creation of Modern Masculinity</span> (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1996).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f72" href="#f72-text">72. </a>In using the word "conversation" to describe the scenes of telling and listening, I deliberately invoke the several meanings of the term, suggesting that these verbal exchanges occur because the characters (including Shreve) share values. In the case of the Compson men and Rosa Coldfield, they also share a heritage; that is, they reproduce the culture in which they have been born. In claiming that Shreve shares the interests of the Compsons, Sutpen, and Rosa Coldfield, I build on Matthews's claim that Shreve projects onto his account of Bon's desire for a father his own desire "since he too seeks patriation in an adopted new land" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Play</span>, 144). We can see Shreve's desire for a father—and a "fatherland"—as akin to the other characters' desire for Sutpen as the fascist-father. As Matthews points out, Shreve's "references to 'Aunt' Rosa Coldfield betray his senses of the South as a vast family and of his own need for adoption" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Play</span> 145). I suggest, therefore, that we can see Quentin and Shreve's "happy marriage of speaking and hearing" at the end of the novel not as a departure from the earlier conversations, but as a similar reproduction of established lines of power through the rative allusion to marriage (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 253).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f73" href="#f73-text">73. </a>For example, both Betina Entzminger—"Passing as Miscegenation: Whiteness and Homoeroticism in Faulkner's <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom, Absalom!</span>," <span style="font-style:italic;">The Faulkner Journal</span> 22:1–2 (Fall 2006/Spring 2007), 90–105—and Norman W. Jones—"Coming Out Through History's Hidden Love Letters in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom, Absalom!</span>," <span style="font-style:italic;">American Literature</span> 76:2 (June 2004), 339–66—read this conversation as a partially obscured scene of actual sexual climax, arguing that telling Sutpen's story is a form of sexual expression for Quentin and Shreve and that the novel's representation of suppressed "deviant" sexuality recapitulates the expressed threat of miscegenation (Entzminger, 90, 98–100; Jones, 339, 344–347). Matthews reads the scene metaphorically, arguing that the narrator's desire for an absent other is "analogous to the desire of the storyteller for his subject's representation" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Play</span>, 130).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f74" href="#f74-text">74. </a>Entzminger emphasizes the "seductive power of speech," drawing on Shoshana Felman to argue—in Felman's terms—for the "'pleasure-taking performance of the very production of speech'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Passing as Miscegenation</span>, 99). I suggest that the erotic pleasure of speech must be connected to the "originating" power of the paternal voice in order to understand fully how the fascist father "seduces" rather than simply subjugates through his voice.</p></div>

On the similarity of voices in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, Ross claims that <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s "oratorical voice" is "monological in form and content, for it articulates certainty." He observes that "[m]any commentators on the novel have emphasized differences among the narrators, finding each discourse to be motivated by the psychic needs of the storyteller. The distinctions in tone, style, or type of metaphor, however, seem in the final analysis incidental compared to the overwhelming consistency of an oratorical Overvoice pervading the entire text … All the narrators more or less 'sound like father'—and 'father' names a principle of authority greater, of course, than Mr. Compson" ((<span style="font-style:italic;">Inexhaustible Voice</span>, 213 and 220–21).

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f84" href="#f84-text">84. </a>Slavoj Žižek, drawing on Laclau and Mouffe, argues that "'[i]deological space' is made of non-bound, non-tied elements, 'floating signifiers,' whose very identity is 'open,' overdetermined by their articulation in a chain of other elements." These signifiers are "structured into a unified field through the intervention of a certain 'nodal point' … which 'quilts' them, stops their sliding and fixes their meaning" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Sublime Object</span>, 87). The "nodal point" that fixes signifiers into one "quilt" as opposed to another is always situated; it consolidates and focalizes a point of view, a position within the ideological field that is one of many (unequally) possible points-of-view. Žižek's description of an "ideological quilt" helps explain how <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> might construct non-identical narratives—the "Southern family romance" and the "fascist fable"—from the same pool of "floating signifiers." I point out the lability of the ideological space in order to support my claim for the co-existence of the "Southern family romance" and the "fascist fable," but also to suggest that the "Southern family romance" ultimately succeeds in fixing meaning more effectively than the "fascist fable," as the scholarly literature reveals. I am not arguing that the "fascist fable" is "truer" or more representative of "what really happened," but, rather, that the legibility of one narrative over the other <span style="font-style:italic;">itself</span> illuminates the operation of the ideological field, a point I cannot develop at length here.</p></div>
