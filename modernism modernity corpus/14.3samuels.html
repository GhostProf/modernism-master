<p id="lead">In a letter that Bishop's biographer, Brett C. Millier, considers "may have been the most important single piece of criticism Elizabeth ever received," Marianne Moore posed the aesthetic problem of "depth" to her young protégé, Elizabeth Bishop.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  Moore wrote: "I can't help wishing you would sometime in some way, risk some unprotected profundity of experience." <sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Responding to the 1930s pressure for artists to engage with the political left, Moore urged Bishop to turn, as the older poet herself had, to the "deeper" moral and metaphysical Christian critique of culture provided by the cultural critic and theologian Reinhold Niebuhr. Although Bishop admired Niebuhr and read some of his books, she could not rely on Christian metaphysics to provide a ground for her work. Bishop's second volume of poems, <i>A Cold Spring,</i> published in 1955 but written almost entirely during the 1940s, constitutes Bishop's solution to the problem of depth. Paul Klee's experiments with the construction of deep space provided Bishop with a means of imagining a poetics of aesthetic and ontological depth. In drawing on the work of modernist painters in order to solve a literary problem, Bishop participates in what Charles Altieri has called the "dialectic between painterly achievements, writerly appropriations, and painterly responses" that was integral to the story of modernism.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  As Altieri has shown, poets often used the work of modernist painters to invent models of subjectivity, positions for the "I" in relation to landscape or world.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Drawing on Klee's innovative use of a fluid deep space, Bishop located the eye/"I" deeply, extensively and expressively within the complex relations of a mobile environment of other motifs, bodies, and textures that carried multisensory and emotional experiences. 

<b></b>

 The eye/"I" almost without skin becomes witness to and host of the "events" of the environment in which it hangs.  </p>

<p>Bishop's lifelong engagement with the visual arts is well documented, although it has been examined only partially.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  A brief listing of the range of her interests would include her early attraction to Van Gogh, before Van Gogh's work was widely known in the U.S.; her report in a 1939 letter that she "almost lived" at MoMA;<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>  her frequent comparison in letters and notebooks of people, animals, and places to particular paintings or painters; her long friendships and extensive correspondence with Margaret Miller, research associate and then associate curator at MoMA, the American painter Loren MacIver, and the English painter Kit Barker; her own amateur work in watercolors and her construction of two Joseph Cornell-like boxes; her frequent visits, sustained over a lifetime, to exhibitions and museums; her frequent purchase of art books and art; and her reading of art criticism in the small American and British magazines as well her extensive reading of major art historians: Irwin Panofsky, Alfred H. Barr, Ernst Gombrich, Meyer Schapiro, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, Eugene Fromentin, and Arnold Hauser. Occasionally, we can even glimpse the intensity of Bishop's encounter with particular paintings. In 1949, at a moment of personal despair, Bishop begs MacIver to finish "that little picture with the lights" so that it can accompany the poet as life raft or talisman for her upcoming dreaded year in Washington D.C. where Bishop was to serve as Consultant in Poetry at the Library of Congress.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  During that year in Washington, Bishop felt a special attraction to the Phillips Collection, and years later, returning to the museum, two Daumiers so overwhelm her that she reports feeling her "entire life has been wasted."<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  In 1959, she claims that she can remember almost every Calder that she had seen in an exhibition of 1932.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>   </p>

<p>The wide range of paintings and sculptures with which Bishop was familiar and to which she responded passionately in her correspondence and notebooks may overwhelm any scholar wishing to discover how she drew on visual art in creating her own aesthetic. Yet deeper affinities for particular works and artists emerge in the course of her career. Bishop most consistently names three painters as fundamental for her: Edouard Vuillard, Paul Klee, and Kurt Schwitters.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Bishop's debt to Klee is most demonstrable, and this essay focuses on her use of some elements of Klee's aesthetic, particularly in the 1940s drafts and in the poems included in her second book, <i>A Cold Spring.</i>  </p>

<p>Some of Klee's paintings moved her because of their ability to express the dismemberment caused by the invasion of a force from outside that enters the self and severs its integrity. In these paintings, subjectivity became catastrophically open to the surround that violently encroached across the membrane of skin or consciousness. But, Bishop also used Klee's experiments with deep space to protest that invasion and to redress it. Drawing on the aesthetics of Klee—as made available to an American audience through the 1945 MoMA publication edited by her friend, Margaret Miller—Bishop created poetic structures that allowed for relation to external forces to be held at a distance, where differences in scale and speed do not threaten the self but are ranged around it in a variety of shapes or orbits. Contemporary criticism on Klee described an alternative structure for engagement with forces outside the self, stressing the suspension of the 

<b></b>

 subject in relation to floating motifs and the variety of colors and textures that cross into but do not threaten the self. In this mode, openness allows for a genial capaciousness, gentle emotional warmth, and response to the surprise of encountering motifs and textures that emerge in the environment. Such poems as "Faustina, or Rock Roses," to be examined later, combine the two responses to Klee's work, holding subjectivity suspended among and viscerally open to textures and motifs in an environment that also carries a potential sense of threat.  </p>

I. Klee in Bishop's Correspondence
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Three moments in Bishop's letters suggest that Klee was of particular importance to Bishop and begin to characterize the nature of her interest in his work. In the famous October 17, 1940 letter in which Bishop managed to hold her own against Marianne Moore's suggested revisions to "Roosters," Bishop refers to the feeling that arose in her when she viewed Klee's painting, "The Man of Confusion," arguing that her own antiwar poem sought to recreate a similar feeling. In response to Moore's critique of the crudeness of triple rhymes, Bishop tells Moore: "I can't bring myself to sacrifice what (I think) is a very important 'violence' of tone—which I feel to be helped by what <i>you</i> must feel to be just a bad case of the <i>Threes.</i> It makes me feel like a wonderful Klee picture I saw at his show the other day, 'The Man of Confusion.'"(<i>OA,</i> 96). "The Man of Confusion" displays the severed sections of a disintegrated human body, literally fallen apart and scattered over the surface of the canvas (<a href="#1"> 1</a>). The "man" is ambiguously also a woman bearing the separated pearls of a necklace, without string, arrayed under the detached head. The features of the woman's face have also begun to "fall out" of the face: the mouth has migrated over towards the edge of the face and one of the eyes has begun to widen and become detached, yet the other eye maintains its normal position, giving the uncanny effect of a person trying to hold on to normalcy and ignore the loss of her own body. The normal eye creates a consciousness inside the picture that watches as a distanced observer while its own body is subjected to violence. Bishop's invocation of Klee's painting to explain her use of triplets reveals her intention to replicate this "severing" through the triple rhymes that harshly break up the sentences and return with crude overinsistence to the same sound, drawing undue attention to and therefore detaching each item so that it stands isolated at the end of the line. Each end rhyme is spit out (the cock's cry "grates like a wet match / from the broccoli patch, / flares and all over town begins to catch").<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  The brevity of Bishop's remark makes it difficult to know whether she was referring not only to the rhymes but also to the content of the poem, which contains two startling dismemberments. However, the remark does suggest that Bishop thought of the "severed" nature of the rhymes and their crude violence as expressive of the position of the speaker who is torn apart by the rooster's calls. The roosters who "planned to command and terrorize the rest" enforce "deep from raw throats / a senseless order" by "active / displacement in perspective; each screaming; / 'This is where I live!'" and thus tearing apart the just-wakened sleeper by pulling her attention harshly and forcefully in many different 

<b></b>

 directions (<i>CP,</i> 36). This violence to the "I" becomes the psychological equivalent to the second dismemberment, which occurs in the "falling apart" of the roosters/soldiers' bodies as, in their dying fall, feathers and then eyes "detach" from the bodies. Holding on to this "tone of 'violence'," produced by rhymes, diction, and subject matter, and legitimized by the Klee painting that so moved her, Bishop refuses to alter the poem in accord with Moore's suggested revisions. Within the next month Bishop twice invites Moore to see the Klee exhibit (at the Buchholz Gallery October 9–November 2, 1940), suggesting not only that she wishes to make amends for her rebellion but also that it would be of particular importance for the younger poet to see Klee's paintings with her mentor at her side. </p>

<p>The second significant reference to Klee in Bishop's letters occurs when Robert Lowell sent Bishop the poems that would eventually become part of <i>Life Studies</i>. Bishop 

<b></b>

 responded enthusiastically to Lowell's new style. In her reply of January 29, 1958, she evokes Klee to get across the aesthetic that she is praising in Lowell's work:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I bought that Webern you had before I left and I'm listening to parts every day. I think I'm so smart, because when you played me one piece I immediately thought it seemed like the musical equivalent of Klee—now, according to the notes, Webern was actually a member of the Blue Rider group . . . I still can't take very much of the songs—for one thing, those voices aren't too good, even if accurate—but I am crazy about some of the short instrumental pieces—they seem exactly like what I'd always wanted, vaguely, to hear and never had, and really "contemporary." That strange kind of modesty that I think one feels in almost everything contemporary one really likes—Kafka, say, or Marianne, or even Eliot, and Klee and Kokoschka and Schwitters . . . Modesty, care, <i>space,</i> a sort of helplessness but determination at the same time. Well, maybe I'm hearing too much.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Again, Klee's name appears at a moment when Bishop struggles to get at a description of her aesthetic. If Lowell's new poems and the Webern instrumental pieces allow her to replace an inchoate vision ("what I'd always wanted, vaguely, to hear . . .") with the thing itself, Klee's name still hovers, close to the unnamable, indescribable ideal.  </p>

<p>Writing to Lowell three years later, Bishop again struggles to articulate a possible way forward for poetry. Looking for an alternative to the Beats, she can only vaguely point Lowell (and herself) to a not-yet-discovered mode of writing, one that she senses is possible because she has seen it in Klee:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>What you say about Marianne is fine: 'terrible, private, and strange revolutionary poetry. There isn't the motive to do that now.' But I wonder—isn't there? Isn't there even more—only it's terribly hard to find the exact and right and surprising enough, or un-surprising enough, point at which to revolt now? The beats have just fallen back on an old corpse-strewn or monument-strewn battle-field—the real protest I suspect is something quite different—.</p>

(If only I could find it. Klee's picture called FEAR seems close to it, I think)<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">As in the letter to Moore and the previously quoted letter to Lowell, Klee represents for Bishop an achieved mode, an aesthetic model, even though a poetic corollary remains difficult to invent. Bishop invokes Klee to explain, clarify and more fully imagine the mode of writing that she herself finds desirable but not yet attainable. Bishop had seen this painting more than ten years before writing the letter, in another Klee exhibit at the Buchholz gallery (May 2–27, 1950) [<a href="#2"> 2</a>]. The painting was also reproduced in the eulogy that Andre Masson had written for Klee.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  Composed by using oil on burlap, "Fear" shows a "person" completely submerged in the fabric of the irregularly spherical shape of its own "body." Only the eye is visible, and even the eye is composed of the same burlap texture as the body in which the eye is embedded. The body itself is barely distinguishable from the surrounding environment, also composed of burlap in ochre and blue tinted browns. The effect is an even more extreme version of Klee's earlier "Arab Song" in which the subject clandestinely peers out from its "cover" to see what is "out there" at the same time that the "out there" has already infiltrated inside 

<b></b>

 the subject. In both "Fear" and "Arab Song," it is impossible to determine precisely where the body ends and the surroundings begin. In "Fear," the "hiding" eye also bears a red slash mark, generating the sense that the eye has seen violence and is itself wounded. The painting produces the feeling of a person as composed only of an eye; the substance of the person is barely demarcated from its surroundings which are in fact also the "inside" of the person.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  The eye is intensely diminished in power (it has no real body capable of action) and intensely private; but, in spite of its position of hiding or helplessness, the subject remains in revolt against an environment that contains a violence so powerful that it has entered the space of the self. </p>

<p>From the letters emerges, then, a more definite set of qualities that Bishop associated with Klee: 1) an ability to invent an unconventional form to express visceral emotion that arose from the invasion of the self (the "'violence' of tone" in "The Man of Confusion" which in "Roosters" appeared as crudely "severed" rhymes that produced the sensation of a subjectivity dissevered by its environment); 2) qualities that she valued such as "modesty, care," "determination" in the face of an acknowledgment of "helplessness"; 3) a protest or private revolt that would go beyond the protest of the Beats, 

<b></b>

 and 4) "<i>space</i>," a category emphasized by Bishop's use of an underscore but remaining undefined by her in the letter. In both paintings that Bishop mentions by name as particularly affecting her, all four categories are apparent. Both Klee's "The Man of Confusion" and "Fear" convey visceral emotion produced by a catastrophically open or severed subjectivity that is helpless, modest, but "still there," determined although in "hiding" and therefore in a position of private protest or revolt. Both paintings invent subjectivity beyond the usual idea of "person," refusing to represent the body as an integral unit or as bounded by skin. Both produce a protest by representing the situation of the eye/"I" (how the eye/"I" came to this state, its relation to its environment). Yet, it is unlikely that these paintings can serve as complete models for Bishop's interest in Klee's invention of "<i>space</i>." For some means of defining that term, we need to turn to the contemporary intellectual context for the reception of Klee in America in the late 1930s and 40s. </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
II. Reception of Klee
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>The closest intellectual context for Bishop can be found in her former college roommate and close friend Margaret Miller, a Research Associate and Associate Curator at MoMA. Miller made particular selections from Klee's writings for the MoMA publication on Klee that she edited in 1945. In addition, her correspondence with Christian Zervos, the editor of <i>Cahiers d'Art,</i> shows her enthusiasm for the special issue on Klee published by Zervos, which had several articles that rather lyrically rendered Klee's use of deep space. The discourse surrounding the reception of Klee, with particular attention to Miller, both reveals the general assessment of Klee as an artist working on an intimate scale, and explores his further uses of "space" beyond the uncanny and frightening relation of the eye to its own body and environment discussed above. Criticism on his paintings by John Thwaites, David Sylvester, and authors writing in <i>Cahiers d'Art</i> described the invention of a deep space that <i>undoes</i> the violence of a subjectivity open to the environment. Such critics emphasized Klee's situating of the viewer as an eye or ear wandering among a landscape of floating colors, textures, and shape motifs. As in the paintings described above, the "psycho-physical" forces in the environment served to infiltrate the viewer, removing a sense of the boundaries or membrane of the body but the fluidity occurred not only as a mode of anxiety or violence but also as pleasure and surprise. Colors and textures became mobile, "flamed and shook," infiltrated the somatic and emotional experience of a mobile self that floated, sometimes as only an eye, with its body composed of the surround. In a more structured vision of the subject's relation to its environment, the excerpts from Klee's writing chosen by Miller positioned a re in relation to objects with disparate trajectories, sizes, and speeds. Unlike "Fear" and "The Man of Confusion," the body in these paintings was not viewed solely as subjected to unseen forces but was set in a more structured and distant, controlled, relation to those forces.<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Among divergent critics, one point of agreement seems to have been a stress on Klee's intimacy. "In an age that blasted privacy Paul Klee built a small but exquisite 

<b></b>

 shrine to intimacy" writes James Johnson Sweeney in the 1940 Buchholz catalogue. And Herbert Read opens his remarks in the same catalogue by declaring "Art has to choose between being monumental and intimate. A destructive age can only erect valid monuments to destruction (Picasso's <i>Guernica</i>)."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  According to Alfred H. Barr, in the publication edited by Miller, "Picasso's pictures often roar or stamp or pound; Klee's whisper a soliloquy—lyric, intimate, incalculably sensitive."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  In the early and mid-1940s, critics distinguished Klee's work from the monumental egoism of Picasso. Later in the 1940s, although the abstract expressionists developed ideas that they found in Klee, he was to be distinguished from their large-scale myth-making.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Because small-scale art, modesty, and determination in the face of an acknowledged helplessness are all qualities commonly associated with Bishop's own values and poetry, we can readily see the connection between these 1940s descriptions of Klee and Bishop's interest in his work.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  Bishop's report of a dream to Lloyd Frankenberg in juxtaposition to a comment in a postcard to Loren MacIver suggests that Bishop too poised Klee against the "big picture" artists:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Last night I dreamed one of the living rooms was filled with huge abstract paintings, in sections set up like screens—absolutely terrifying, for some reason. We all had to paint them; they were "compulsory" and I was reassuring some stranger that he too could do it. "All you have to remember," I said "is to paint wither [sic] a dyptich, a tryptich, or a styptich."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Whereas, two days earlier, Bishop had written to Loren MacIver, "I love the Klee book—just the thing."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  We might tentatively conclude that reading through the Klee book had given rise to the dream, the Klee paintings allowing her to acknowledge her resistance to the prevailing rules for creating "big" art. And, Bishop's interview with Ashley Brown registers just this placement of Klee, intimately scaled against the "mythic" abstract expressionists. When Brown inquires whether Bishop thinks "it is necessary for a poet to have a 'myth'—Christian or otherwise—to sustain his work," Bishop replies: "Look at Paul Klee . . . . he didn't have a formulated myth to look to, apparently, and his accomplishment was very considerable. . . I'm not interested in big-scale work as such. Something needn't be large to be good."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  The response reveals Bishop's association of Klee with an alternative aesthetic to that of Christian myth as well as abstract expressionism, with its attraction to primitive myth and huge-scale paintings. Given that the abstract expressionists were understood to be painting in response to the terrors of war and to the tragic knowledge of human capacity for violence, we can see why Bishop associated Klee with another kind of protest. Likewise, Barr's and Read's contrasting of Klee with Picasso, particularly in his monumental protest against war, sheds some light on the way that art on an intimate scale set itself in protest to a world of violence but in a quiet, private voice rather than monumental gestures. </p>

<p>The nature of this protest entailed Klee's movement away from depicting the self's awareness of bodily severance or invasion by extreme violence. Critics discussed many paintings by Klee that provided, rather, a structure for openness to the environment. 

<b></b>

 In these paintings, the subject matter of the painting seemed to be the viewer himself who becomes relocated <i>in</i> the canvas, sometimes as a floating eye in the landscape (<a href="#3"> 3</a>). The eye, a consciousness open to multisensory experience, wanders in a landscape. The eye is bodiless but nevertheless touched and moved by floating motifs (stick-like trees) where sheets of red and orange drift across the membrane of the (now missing) body. Klee's critics stressed especially his innovative construction of this new feel for space. John Thwaites, who wrote at the time that Bishop first became interested in Klee in 1937, taught his readers to experience Klee's innovative deep space by feeling their way inside it. The "eye" of the viewer wanders inside the space of the painting as if floating through a landscape where the parts of that landscape have the tactile feel of textures and atmospheres available to a body in motion. Thwaites emphasized Klee's interest in conveying the object not as the stilled cubist object, frozen in time, but the object as it existed in multiple sensory dimensions. While Braque, according to Thwaites, can only deliver a "strong way of seeing," Klee captures nonvisual perception in addition to the visual: "Klee is interested in movement because he is interested in the object in all its ways of being. The object in space or in time, in sight or in sound, in temperature or in touch, interest him equally."<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Hence, Thwaites emphasized Klee's use of texture to build in a more visceral, somatic element beyond the optical: "he learned to use texture, not as the cubists did for a plastic feeling of the object, but to give a psycho-physical reaction." Such a view clarified the link between Klee's use of color ("the color is laid on in undefined areas like stains") and his production of a sense of movement: "the red-brown surfaces vary in intensity, letting your eye through to different depths as the Chinese sepia does. Then a fistful of blue breaks through the sky and is echoed in a blue border like Seurat's. That color relation makes the little landscape flame and shake." Thwaites emphasizes the way that Klee unfolds the colors and textures of objects into movements: "He brings a Greco-Roman fold out of an arabesque, but you feel it fall and settle."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  While the mood, here, has softened and has nothing to do with the vulnerability of the re in "Fear," colors and textures "touch" the body and the mind of the viewer, who has gone over the frame of the painting to float among colors and textures inside the landscape.  </p>

<p>In the first issue of <i>The Tiger's Eye</i> (which Bishop alluded to in a letter to Lowell), David Sylvester similarly described Klee's invention of a new space filled with movement in contrast to cubist space which held the object frozen: "the movement of the motifs themselves defines the fluid space they inhabit."<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  The viewer must "feel into" the painting, Sylvester elaborated, in order "to explore those perspectives already visible from outside. A late Klee is the face of a cliff. To 'feel into' it is to clamber over it" (<i>AMA </i>37). Sylvester is even clearer in a 1951 essay about the late Klee:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>While the spectator <i>may</i> project himself into any picture, he <i>must </i>project himself into a late Klee. . . . As the spectator moves between the signs of the Berne pictures, he feels, not that he is traveling on a surface, but that he is suspended in space and that the structure of the picture is three-dimensional. This is in spite of the fact that it contains none of the devices—linear or serial perspective, plastic colour, overlapping of forms—normally used to give an illusion of depth and space. And, indeed, no space is signified so long as the 

<b></b>

 spectator confronts the picture. Yet when he projects himself into it and moves about in it, the signs situate themselves at different depths, thereby implying space. </p>

<p class="continued">In Klee's space, the subject of the painting and the viewer himself are suspended or "swimming" (Sylvester) in a landscape of different textures, atmospheres, and motifs, many of which carry what Thwaites referred to as a "psycho-physical" effect.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  In some paintings, the eye in the landscape flips the viewer so that she is not merely traveling through the landscape but actually is the eye of the landscape's body (see <a href="#3"> 3</a>).<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  As the later scholar, Carolyn Lanchner, summarizes it: "The space . . . is organic weightless, and indeterminate . . . deeper [than Cubist space]. It has become metaphysical, iconic with the painter's and the viewer's interior space, both sensuous and ideographic."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Several of the essays on Klee in the 1945/46 issue of <i>Cahiers d'Art</i> (which Margaret Miller admired and would have shared with Bishop) emphasize that Klee's mode of seeing involved a visceral and somatic openness in a fluid space of floating motifs.<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Roger Vitrac began his essay "Le regard de Paul Klee," by emphasizing the receptiveness and clarity of Klee's vision ("<i>au fond de l'oeil le plus limpide</i>").<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  The eye, in its receptiveness, felt open and waiting, like an ear open at night. The body itself seemed open, operating with an extensive network of heightened sensory awareness based in the organic or botanical level of the body ("<i>des sens et des passions les nervures grandissantes de la connaissance</i>"). Vitrac described a viewer encountering depths of anxiety, a vertiginous falling ("<i>les vertiges</i>") into realms usually forbidden to our view, dreams of despair, shame, and silence (<i>CA,</i> 53, 54). For Georges Duthuit, the viewer moved in the space of a Klee painting as if walking backward blindfolded at night, feeling traps underfoot and encountering small flashes of living things, eyes of trout, flowers glowing like nightlights at the bottom of a pond ("<i>les yeux bandés, marcher á reculons: trop de pièges sous nos pas . . . La scène s'éclaire des petits yeux de la truite et des fleurs en veilleuse, au fond de l'étang</i>"<i>)</i> (<i>CA</i> 20)<i>.</i> Christian Zervos wrote that Klee "inserts us into the mystery of a world of shifting, fluctuating boundaries" ("<i>a nous insinuer le mystère de ce monde aux frontièrs flotantes</i>") (<i>CA,</i> 16). Several of the <i>Cahiers d'Art</i> critics emphasized the paintings' immense silence, imagining both painter and viewer hanging in space, stretching out via the ear toward the world, consciousness open and stretching beyond the boundary of the body so that colors, textures, and motifs seem to cross into the interior space of the self (Bousquet, <i>CA, </i>50–1; Grohman, <i>CA,</i> 63–5).  </p>

<p>One other mode of the organization of "space" emerges from Klee's own writings that Miller excerpted in a 1945 MoMA publication. Miller mentioned the booklet twice in letters to Bishop, and Bishop's interest in Klee and friendship with Miller makes it highly likely that the poet read these particular excerpts.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  In his remarks "On Creation," Klee revealed his interest in setting up relationships between various kinds of movements, shapes, lines, and times (opposing "forces") in the space of one painting. The subject, even while moving, is suspended amongst this array of other shapes and movements:

<p class="continued">In both passages, Klee jogs loose painting's adherence to the planar and resituates it so that both the subject of the painting and the viewer are oriented inside a wider world, filled with trajectories of different shapes, densities and directions, moving at variant paces and durations. These shape-motifs do not diffuse across the space of the self, the way that sheets of color cross into the eye in "Glance of a Landscape" or burlap texture crosses into the body in "Fear." The res in these paintings are not imagined as open to the environment across a missing boundary or membrane; nevertheless they retain an orientation toward motifs in the landscape which somehow "bound" or circle them. In the man on the steamer, the re is not so much subjected to those outside trajectories and forces as held in relation to them. He moves in relation to their movements. Pacing on the deck, he has a certain degree of independence from the forces ranged around him, but he is nevertheless "held" within the relation of their disparate shapes and movements. In the passage about the sleeping person, the sleeping 

<b></b>

 consciousness is held at a distance from but in relation to the movements of his own body (the circulation of the blood, the movement of the lungs) and then, at an even greater distance, the movements of his more amorphously shaped dreams and then his "fate." In both Klee excerpts, the re is opened to and held by an environment located outside the direct control of the subject. </p>



<h1 class="sec-headA">
III. Bishop's use of Klee's Aesthetic
</h1>	<!--CLOSE sec-headA-->




<p>Both unpublished and published poetry of Bishop from the mid-1940s demonstrates a widespread affinity between Bishop's developing aesthetic in this period and Klee's work. The positioning of the speaker in these lyrics experiences an openness to the environment, not always in the mode of bodily severance or invasion but in a milder aspect whereby fields of color and texture cross the boundary of a form, the speaker is placed within a "complex of movements," or suspended within different kinds of lines and shapes. At times, Bishop renders the crossing of those boundaries by submerging the body or subject in its environment or surround, effacing the subject, and leaving only an "eye" which is itself variously saturated by an environment that is also, somehow, the eye's own body—resembling Klee's use of an "eye" floating bodiless in space, where the landscape becomes the "eye's" body.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Bishop's unpublished and perhaps not fully achieved poem, "On the 'Prince of Fundy'" (1946 or 1947), allows us to watch the poet experiment with Klee's aesthetic. The poem creates a "complex of movement." Like the man on the steamer in Miller's excerpt of Klee's writing, which placed a man walking forward on a steamer's deck in relation to the different pace and direction of the movement of the ship, the revolution of the earth, and the orbiting moon and stars, Bishop's poem similarly suspends the speaker in relation to disparate speeds, directions, and circulating shapes in a "complex of movements": </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the "Prince of Fundy"<br />
We must weigh tons and tons and tons<br />

We gently gently rock this way and that.<br />

And why does she sing so high?<br />

There's nothing real to judge by.<br />
(I love you more today than I did yesterday.<br />

Approximately two hours and twenty-five minutes.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-poetry-->




<p class="continued">Recalling Klee's positioning of the man on the steamer among a range of differently timed movements and shapes, "On the 'Prince of Fundy'" suspends the speaker on a ferry amidst opposing weights, movements, shapes, and lines. It opens with the sense of weight pulled downward (the "weight of tons and tons and tons " of "cars &amp; cars &amp; trucks / stowed below") and sets that weight in tension with the light airy high voice of a woman singing ("And why does she sing so high?"). Suspended between these poles, the cabin is a dark hole which introduces another form of movement ("we gently rock") into the existing field, a movement where situational instability is increased by the epistemological inability to "judge" against any firm stable horizon or marker ("WE <i>think</i> we rock because / there's nothing real to judge by"). Instability becomes the site where another kind of possibility opens. Inside that space of gentle rocking, suspended somewhere between weighty immobile depth and airy wavering height, emotion has altered, shifted into a more joyous affirmation ("I love you more today than I did yesterday. / Isn't that nice?"). The affirmation is without cause or motive, a "free" and gentle event that "floats up" inside of a matrix of other movements and events, a shift that could just as easily have been other. The shift comes without preparation, appearing inside a field of other objects, movements, and events—some of long duration and others intermittent. Its own continuity cannot be known (will it be a long period of shared loved or a brief sensation soon to dissipate?). After the emotional shift, the "field" continues, surrounding the event. A shape/movement of circling ("why are they walking around like that") of fairly extensive duration ("at all hours of the night") holds inside and slightly below itself the cabin, still dark and gently swaying, "up, down and sometimes sidewise, too." Another "line" is introduced at the close, one in which the ship has a directness, moving unidirectionally, straight towards a named and stable destination in a named duration ("two hours and twenty-five minutes") with a minuscule uncertainty ("approximately" as spoken in the official voice of announcer of timetables and schedules). We can recognize the kind of "arrow" shape frequently used by Klee in the unidirectional movement of steamer toward port. </p>

<p>"On the 'Prince of Fundy'" can function as a particularly clear example of Bishop's situating a "complex of movements" in relation to one another and to an observer, comparable to the man on a steamer or the man in repose in the excerpts from Klee's writings on modern art. Keeping in mind "On the 'Prince of Fundy,''" and Klee's writings, we can more fully comprehend the final poem in <i>A Cold Spring,</i> Bishop's tribute to her love for Lota de Macedo Soares in "The Shampoo," composed in 1951. Bishop herself was surprised when the <i>New Yorker</i> first rejected the poem and when readers did not seem to understand it, while she considered it to be without difficulty. The poem becomes more accessible when set in the context of the excerpt about the man 

<b></b>

 walking forward on the steamer. "The Shampoo" gently suspends the human res in relation to the speed, scale, and shape of heavenly orbits and earthly objects. The poem is short enough to be quoted in full: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The still explosions on the rocks,<br />
The lichens, grow<br />
By spreading, gray, concentric shocks.<br />
They have arranged<br />
To meet the rings around the moon, although<br />

<p>
And since the heavens will attend<br />

Precipitate and pragmatical;<br />
And look what happens. For Time is<br />

<p>

<p class="continued">The speaker of "The Shampoo" and her lover are suspended among shapes and lines that also contain movements of varying speeds. Lichens, as circles, will take much longer than our memories can hold to grow far enough "to meet the rings around the moon." These circles, slow, capacious, are poised against other shapes and speeds, such as Lota's white hairs, like comets, that shoot more precipitously towards the moon. The precipitous, precocious movement of shooting lines is contained by another shape, the circle of the tin basin where Lota's hair will be washed. In the middle stanza, poised or "hung" between these two kinds of time (imagined as shapes with variant speeds), there is the trajectory of the meeting of the lovers themselves. They too could have waited much longer to meet or to enter into a loving relationship (as "the heavens will attend / as long on us") but Lota has been "precipitate and pragmatical" not only by growing gray hair but also by inviting Elizabeth to live with her sooner rather than later. "Time" is "amenable" to this arrangement; the warmth of that word "amenable" with its shades of amiable and accommodating, and its softness against the harsher member of the rhymed pair, "pragmatical," creates a soft atmosphere, implying that the Time (and the stanza) in which the lovers reside is suspended amiably, unhurriedly amidst the harsher "shocks" "rocks" "shooting stars" and "tin." The fact that the time of that second stanza is like the time of the first allows the interval in which they are suspended to be elongated beyond even human memory and makes the felt experience of their love more expansive than the little action of the shampoo. Their love then can hang inside of that expanded space, while also acknowledging its eventual limit (closed 

<b></b>

 by the aging and death that are signaled by the white hairs that move too quickly and the aging "battered" basin). The lovers are suspended amidst motifs of circles and lines that vary in speeds and carry "psycho-physical" forces. The proliferative "spray" is played against more controlled "intact" forms: "still explosions on the rocks" are also rings ("concentric shocks"). The straight, exploding lines of Lota's hair are contained, in the final stanza, by the circular shape of the "big tin basin." The proliferative lives of these two women, that could have gone anywhere, and dispersed, are now inside a container of sorts, since their growth has "arranged" to "meet the rings around the moon" and they meet inside the circle of the basin, the loving action of the shampoo, and their own room or space of living together. The subjectivity of both speaker and lover has become dispersed or distributed in and among shapes other than themselves, shapes which are provided by the natural and human environments and which also provide containers for subjectivity. </p>

<p>For an equally clear demonstration of an abovementioned technique of Klee's work, noted by both American and European critics—that of allowing fields of color and texture to cross the boundary of a form and the suspension of the "I" in a field of floating motifs—we can first turn to Bishop's own notebook observations that constitute her raw material for many poems. Bishop repeatedly shows an interest and takes pleasure in the dispersal of drops through a three-dimensional field, suspended in emulsion then dissolving. Often she describes different textures or atmospheres of different densities touching or passing through each other. To select one of numerous examples, here is a note taken while staying in North Carolina:  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>October. The nights of the full moon this month were beautiful. The mountains looked bluish, snowy, &amp; wasted. Gay sparks from the little river floated through the black oak trees. Then a thin, high, silvery fog came through all the valleys, from different directions—watched it coming closer &amp; closer until it came through the oak trees, hid them &amp; then through the screens into the room which suddenly got very cold. </p>

<p>We can see this interest in sparseness, diffusion, varying atmospheres and textures crossing one another in a short poem, probably from Key West, "Mimosas in Bloom" (perhaps to be associated with her painting "Graveyard with Fenced Graves").<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  The poem shows Bishop's delight in textures meeting one another, their mode of touching or passing through: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">

<p class="continued">

 Fineness, softness, gentleness occur in different registers: the less dense, "barely there" of the "air-light litter" in the petals or pollen from the trees next to/against the comparatively denser, more solid but still light in weight substance of the "gray-green leaves / . . . like kittens' ears." In another register, the diffused golden pollen crosses into the even more diffused realm of air as, by a tiny adjustment of weight and color, the pollen that filters over the hills becomes diffused like golden light. A notebook entry renders the same subject and thematizes it: "the ground that would dry their [the mourners] tears like / Blotting paper—in the cemetery— / And let it through, scarcely detaining / it, to join the sea below" (SCV, 75.3, 14). Here tears gently dissolve into the earth of the graveyard, and their gentleness in this dissolution is associated with an acceptance of death. These notebook passages prepare us for textures and colors diffusing across the boundaries of other forms or across the membrane of the self in a mode other than fear and violence. </p>

<p>In another unpublished fragment from this period, "The night intact," lovers are set as a barely distinguishable object (only the mouths visible) in a field of other objects, movements, atmospheres, and textures: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-poetry">

<p class="continued">This unfinished draft gathers power from its reversal of the aubade tradition, which only managed to wish the night prolonged, the sun delayed. Here, the speaker and her lover bring back "the night intact" when they kiss. Inside the "(brilliant) white room" they bring into being and also receive an enabling darkness as a "gift" descending from above. The darkness, imagined as a "fountain" or spray rising and spreading or raining down also appears concentrated, not diffused, at the place where the two mouths meet. The steady climbing movement of a gradual darkening ("it grew dark / &amp; darker as we went upstairs") stands slightly ajar from the two poles of darkness imagined as "intact" 

<b></b>

 and "fountain." Somewhere between the different densities of darkness imagined as a concentrated whole ("intact") and imagined as a diffusion or spray ("fountain"), the room itself "holds" the darkness in a less dense, airy way. The "space" of the brilliant white room surrounding the lovers holds the darkness inside of its airy openness, suspended in it, like an emulsion. The feeling of suspension derives from the lovers' movement upward rather than downward and from the way that the upstairs room is an enclosure open to the outdoors. Outside of that space, but also inside because present in the speaker's awareness, there is a different kind of diffusion of color or movement, "palm trees swaying &amp; / clashing like (taffeta) bright tin blue flowers" (not the movement of the gradual climbing upstairs nor the stopped movement of the intactness of two mouths meeting). The taffeta and the palm fronds both yield up an image of a diffused, netlike or ragged texture, becoming even more ragged when described as dotted with a multitude of "tin blue flowers." Textures "touch" one another or infiltrate. Ragged fronds swaying and crashing, the stiff harsh brushing of taffeta, tin blue flowers are all agitated surfaces that stand apart from (but also serve to characterize the other mood of) the more sedate shifting of planes in the thematics of a "misplaced" night. In this case, one set of images of excitement or agitation hovers like a penumbra around the borders of the room and, because the poem is about two lovers' passionate return to each other in the day, the movement at the edges is implicitly also occurring in the unshown, dark center where the two mouths meet.  </p>

<p>"Night intact" suspends the speaker in a field of shape motifs that, in Thwaites's terminology, have clearly become "psycho-physical" fields of force. In these drafts, and in "The Shampoo," as in Klee's paintings, movements, lines, speeds, shapes ("motifs") in complex relation to one another become the setting in which a subject is suspended but also, simultaneously, expressive of that subject. As in Klee's laying of transparent washes of color across each other or across the boundaries of a form in "Glance of a Landscape," we see the crossing or infiltration of the subject by atmospheres or textures from the environment. The boundary line around the subject becomes indistinct so that the subject, while still holding the objects of the environment at a distance, experiences them somatically as simultaneously inside, part of the interior feeling of the self. While the paintings "Fear" and "The Man of Confusion" showed the invasion of the violence of the environment across the boundary of skin, "Night Intact" and "Shampoo" situate the speaker in an openness to the shapes, movements, colors, and textures of a milder environment. The speaker and her lover are suspended among these shapes and textures, and the psycho-physical forces arranged around the speaker become the range of her interior experience. </p>

<p>A later draft, entitled "Gypsophilia," set in Samambia after Bishop moved to Brazil in 1951 (too long and occurring in too many versions to quote in full), again suspends the speaker (as "we") in a deep fluid space amidst a field of shape motifs of varying speeds and directionalities.<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Standing high on a mountain, in a diffuse terrain where the "air is thinner" and the "blue / deteriorates," the speaker is crossed by the "hard and thin" sounds of a voice yelling "<i>Din-ner</i>!" and the metallic clang of someone beating an iron bar in the orchid nursery below. The presumably sedentary speaker herself 

<b></b>

 seems to be floating off ("The last clangs are / the last words of a bell-bouy out at sea," [<i>SCV,</i> 66.5]). Standing high on the mountain in her "cold sub-stratum of dew," she is also floating beneath a circling spray of white stars and so appears to be at the bottom of a deep space. When Manuelzinho's family appears on the road below, carrying burdens, the speaker is suspended among a different set of shape-motifs, resembling "the spiky things Klee loves, sprays of grass or reeds, fronds or fir twigs or the backbones of fishes."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  The family, carrying "a load of dead branches," and an "enormous sheaf" of "'Gypophilia [sic],' 'baby's breath'," with Manuelzhino's wife possessing "hair hang[ing] down under . . . an old felt hat," is rendered as a series of short straight lines, not quite aligned, first lying sideways (the branches as they are carried), then pointing downward (the hair), and then pointing upward in a tiny set of explosions (the "baby's breath"). Later, the speaker imagines herself as a small, dark, condensed black seed carried or "borne" in the "minutely, whitely, blossoming sprays" of white stars above ("a dead black seed / caught somewhere / caught, somehow, and carried, carried / in those glimmering sprays about us," [<i>SCV,</i> 66.5]). She terms the spray a "fascicle," the exfoliated, bursting shape of a flower's stamens. Invisible at the center of a circle of a white spray of stars, the lyric speaker is suspended, borne along, "carried." As in "Night Intact," the speaker of "Gypsophilia" hangs among floating motifs that are arrayed about the speaker and cross into the interior, felt as "psycho-physical" forces. </p>

<p>Again and again Bishop shows us surfaces that modulate in texture or tactility, that open and become airy or diffuse and allow infiltration by other colors, atmospheres, or textures. Resembling the painting "Fear," this fascination with infiltration is not merely the aesthetics of placing color against color, shade against shade, texture against texture, but involves a particular kind of ontology that sees subjects as partially open, airy, crossed by the textures and movements of the environment and modulated by the intricate density of that environment. While in "Fear," the crossing into the boundary of the subject occurs in the mood of a deep anxiety about infiltration, other moods—as we have seen in "Night Intact" and "Gypsophilia"—are possible. The boundary of the body can be dangerously open, when unable to prevent frightening forces from crossing into it (the arrows at the right-hand edge of "Fear" emphasize this effect) or more pleasurably open, when other kinds of "psycho-physical" fields cross its membrane. Like the bodiless eye floating among drifting reddish-orange diaphanous sheets of color in "Glance of the Landscape," Bishop's speaker in "Gypsophilia" stands in an atmosphere where "blue deteriorates" or the sound of metal drifts away, like "the last word of a bell-buoy." The speaker hangs as eye or ear in that deep space, among objects that float toward or away. The release of the line from bounding the re in Klee's work is closely related to the subject's perception that the surface of the body is incompletely and incoherently sensed from inside, and cannot properly "bound" the ego. Ultimately, Bishop's noting of an "I' comes closest to the mobility of Klee's staging of an "event" in which an object "appears" in a field that did not before contain it but that immediately rearranges itself, opens, to hold it. The self is not the center of that occurrence. The "I" is itself a kind of field, and its elements, variously remote or close, both inside and outside the skin, resituate the speaker as the environment changes. These lines, shapes, 

<b></b>

 motifs, and orbits cause the registering of sensation in the perceiver, rearranging and creating anew the proprioceptive subject. As Henri Wallon defines it, 'proprioceptivity' is the result of the "gathering together and unification of otherwise disparate and scattered sensations provided by the various sense organs, in all their different spaces and registers."<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  The experience of sensation causes an identification-at-a-distance, as Kaja Silverman terms it, and diffuses the sense of the "I" so that it is "stretched" among the atmospheres, textures, and objects of the "surround."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Bishop's own favorite of the poems in <i>A Cold Spring,</i> "Faustina, or Rock Roses," demonstrates most clearly the way that different textures and shapes infiltrating one another includes not merely a visual aesthetic but an ontology of the subject. In this poem, as in "Fear" and "Glance of a Landscape," we become intensely conscious of eyes in bodies that are open to the atmosphere. Suspending the speaker in a deep fluid space of floating shapes and materials that open into or drift across that speaker, Bishop creates a dynamic sense of subjectivity intensely vulnerable to an environment that can diffuse across its boundaries and yet also be held in suspension among its objects. The poem, about Bishop's visit to an invalid under the care of a Key West black woman, Faustina, appears as a collage of variously textured whites.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Inside the invalid's room, the various surfaces are layered across or next to one another: the white on white of the fine lines of hair on the white pillow, nightgown against undershirt, the papery "pallid palm-leaf fan" that the papery pallid invalid is too weak to wield (<i>CP,</i> 72). Textures vary from smooth to encrusted to opening: the white enamel of the bed frame with its surface crazed; the loosely dotted powder of talcum; the rough, more solidly meshed "pasteboard boxes" and the condensed but ornamented spheres of pills with their encrusted surface "half-crystallized"—these are textures that open toward each other, varying in the diffuseness or "openness" of their surfaces. They will dissolve away, like the flags with their patterns and images "bleached" away (<i>CP,</i> 73). The field of whites occasionally moves through various kinds of luminosity and occasionally rises to a color, and Bishop orchestrates their emergence in the mode that Klee's critics described, as flashes encountered, floating up into view: dew that "glint[s]" on the mesh of the screen door, two glow-worms beyond the screen with their subdued light not quite emergent from a dark field ("burning a drowned green"), the harsh lighting from a bare bulb that suddenly makes tack heads glint, the "wall-pocket, / violet-embossed, glistening / with mica flakes." The surfaces sometimes move or open or wilt: the bedposts that unfurl into "four vaguely roselike / flower-formations," the undulating lines of the sagging floorboards, the white sheets, with their undulating lines and dissolving enervated folds "like wilted roses." We should see these motifs in relation to Klee's insistence on the textures of objects that erupt into movement and which the viewer feels as "psycho-physical" effects. </p>

<p>The res in the poem are suspended within this field of textures, and the human res' interiors can open out extensively or toward various depths like the other materials in the room. Beyond, at the edges of the various whites, lurk several darks. A night deep and dark enough to semi-drown the glow-worms' two green lights hangs beyond the room.

 in. Inside the white space, other "holes" appear. In the white room that constantly fluctuates between two and three dimensions, the visitor herself and the interaction between the visitor and the invalid woman remain shadowed, almost invisible, silent, effaced, like holes that are deeper than the rest of the space. The question of whether the women will "open out" to one another is central. No words are spoken between visitor and invalid. The visitor is only known as a re that deviates from that white-on-white environment:  </p>

<p class="continued">Full of a gentle "embarrassed" pathos, Bishop captures the shame of the still-living in the presence of the dying. The almost-effaced assertion, in that gentle "perhaps," marks the visitor as caught in the embarrassing situation of being embarrassed by living instead of dying. She is too ashamed to "show" in the picture. Her invisibility becomes a kind of hiding, a not-wanting to be so embarrassingly bright or alive. Because the next line is "by and by the whisper / says" we know that the speaker has been sitting in silence for some time, suspended inside the space of the collage of whites and hearing only the inaudible whispered words of the invalid. We do not see the invalid's face, which occurs only as the blank from which the whisper issues. We see/feel the visitor only as "perhaps the reverse" of "pain," "age," and "nakedness." Neither the face of the visitor, nor the face of the invalid, comes into focus (the invalid's surround has been shown but not her face). Both the invalid's face and the speaker's even less visible face sink (almost) into the environment so that only the eyes are visible—like the eye in "Fear" that hides in its body composed of the textured burlap of the environment.  </p>

<p>As in "Glance of a Landscape," which suspended the "eye" in a landscape of drifting sheets of color and spiky stick shapes, this poem suspends the speaker in a complex of shapes, lines, and textures of different densities moving across or through one another, opening into one another, closing to one another. Distinct from the white on white environment and these deeper "holes" in that environment, the black face of the caretaker, Faustina, looms with an engulfing suddenness as the focal point and is viewed, in a strange and "sickening" reversal, as if the visitor were in the sick bed looking up. </p>

<p class="continued">

The face is condensed in the two words "sinister kind" ("her sinister kind face / presents a cruel black / coincident conundrum") so that opposed meanings and contrasting sounds cohere in a tight space juxtaposed to one another. The binary falls or collapses into itself in the phrase "coincident conundrum" where the similarities of consonants and vowels, their "nearness" to each other, make the binaries cohere even more closely in a denser relationship, as if a pattern of contrasts can become tighter and finally the contrasts can squeeze into the same space as one other. Then contrast or pattern opens out, briefly, for a second, with the light, airy, long-drawn, upward inflection of "Oh, is it / freedom at last, a lifelong / dream of time and silence, / dream of protection and rest?" The two blank spaces between stanzas—after "oh, is it" and "rest?"—provide intervals that are suspended, uplifted in hope. Just afterwards, the line comes down sharply, "Or is it the very worst?" The horror is intensified by "rest" in slant rhyme with "worst," again pressing contrasts together in an uncomfortable embrace. Then, "shape" leaps out of the scene, which until now has been largely texture against texture of only slightly opening or unfolding whites (varied by the small glints and glows and the "holes" of the invisible faces and the dark night). As if leaping out of the deep space of Faustina's black face, "The acuteness of the question / forks instantly and starts / a snake-tongue flickering; / blurs further, blunts, softens, / separates, falls, our problems / becoming helplessly / proliferative." The sudden explosion of squiggly lines, uncontained, is unlike anything that has been seen in the poem thus far (meshes, textures, of white on white, or little squares—the wall pocket—or rounded forms that open out only as far as something like a rose). This little chaos of sharp sticklike propulsive lines (the question felt as a shape, "acuteness" experienced as shape), is then condensed into the two eyes. The proliferative questions are held inside two darkened unreadable circles ("the eyes say only either"). At the close of the poem, the "proliferative" is carried over into the bunch of roses that the visitor hands the invalid, roses that have a "blurred" or infiltrated section of rust and which begin to disperse in a spray of petals. The interiors of the speaker, the invalid, and even Faustina open out, become opaque or unreadable, turn propulsive, cross over into one another, reclose. Subjectivity, suspended in its fluid space of floating textures and motifs, can be infiltrated or invaded in a mood of geniality or fear.  

<b></b>

  </p>

<p>Even more striking, Bishop seems to produce in this poem the kind of reversal of viewer/object that Klee produced through placing a floating eye in a landscape or an eye inside a body submerged in the surround. The viewer of Klee's "Glance of a Landscape," when entering the painting in the way that Thwaites and Sylvester suggest, clambering over into it, finds himself suddenly inside the painting and now located in the eye, looking out, with the painted landscape serving as the viewer's body. So, too, the speaker of "Faustina, or Rock Roses" flips from watching the invalid at the bedside to inhabiting the invalid's body, which is partly composed of the "body" of the room of whites surrounded by an unknown night. Both sets of eyes (the invalid's and the speaker's) then stare up into the downward-leaning eyes of Faustina, as, in fact, the reader of the poem is likewise forced to do.  </p>

<p>As a viewer of Klee's paintings in the late 1930s and 1940s, Bishop would have been taught by critics such as John Thwaites, David Sylvester, and the critics in <i>Cahiers d'Art</i> to move past the two-dimensional surface of Klee's paintings and cross over into the deep space where the eye wanders among moving motifs and engages in intimate and quasi-physical encounters with a sequence of variously dense or diffuse materials that infiltrate the "body" of the subject. Positioned inside the picture, the viewer, like the speaker in these Bishop poems, drifts in a weightless deep space in relation to a complex of shapes and lines moving at various speeds, crossed by textures and atmospheres of variant densities, the empathic subject of a bedazzling variety of "psycho-physical" objects and environments. Textures or atmospheres lying against, infiltrating, passing through, falling into, glancing off, undulating and dissolving planes, spiky, circling, explosive lines: these sites for surfaces to sink into or reach out into depth become the subject of much of <i>A Cold Spring</i> (as well as the subject of "The Moose," which Bishop began in this period). The diffused and the dispersed, the open and the closed, the proliferative and the contained become a political subject (in "A View of the Capitol from the Library of Congress") or a deeply human one (in Faustina or "The Shampoo"). </p>

<p>Finally, "The Shampoo," "On the 'Prince of Fundy,'" "Night intact like that," "Gypsophilia," and "Faustina" allow us to see the existential or ontological import of Bishop's interest in depicting a range of textures, kinds of concentration and diffusion, colors, and luminosities simultaneously "touching", crossing, and sometimes sharing one another's "spaces" or reflecting off, and obstructing one another. "Faustina," especially, reveals the way that human relationships and human questions are felt as the opening and closing, appearance and disappearance of shapes or lines that project out or are introjected across the various "materials" of the environment and the self. Skin, as drawn boundary around the subject, diminishes into near-invisibility as the space of the self becomes crossed by or suspended among other objects and textures. The paintings singled out by Bishop in her correspondence about Klee picture massive disintegration or near effacement of the body, leaving an eye (or eyes) submerged in a "field." Therefore Bishop's frequent use of a nearly effaced or submerged speaker, only arising gradually and gently to speak the "I" from within a multitude of acts of perception and relations with a landscape, becomes most visible to us when understood as the poetic corollary to Paul Klee's floating eyes submerged in landscape or surroundings, crossed 

<b></b>

 by atmospheres and textures and suspended within a "complex of movements." For Bishop, depth took on a visceral and somatic aspect that replaced Moore's Christian metaphysics. Bishop located the eye/"I" deeply, extensively, and expressively within the complex relations of a mobile environment of other motifs, bodies, and textures folding into and across one another's surfaces. The speaker in Bishop's poems is like Klee's staging of an "event" in which an object "appears" in a field that did not before contain it but that immediately rearranges itself and opens to hold it. The self is not the center of that occurrence. The "I" is itself a kind of field. As in the paintings "Fear," "The Man of Confusion," and "Glance of a Landscape," the eye/"I" almost without skin becomes witness to and host of the "events" of the environment in which it hangs.  </p>

<p><a name="FOOT5" href="#REF5">5</a>. Richard Mullen ("Elizabeth Bishop's Surrealist Inheritance," <i>American Literature</i> 54 [March 1982]: 63–80) has shown that Bishop both drew on and distinguished herself from the surrealists. Lorrie Goldensohn has compared Bishop's own watercolors to her poems ("Elizabeth Bishop's Written Pictures, Painted Poems," <i>"In Worcester, Massachusetts" Essays on Elizabeth Bishop From the 1997 Elizabeth Bishop Conference at WPI </i>ed. Laura Jen Menides and Angela G. Dorenkamp [New York :Peter Lang], 167–76) and has written about perspective and perception in Bishop's poetry, as well as extended Mullen's work (<i>Elizabeth Bishop, The Biography of a Poetry</i> [New York: Columbia University Press, 1992], 118–134. Bonnie Costello (<i>Elizabeth Bishop, Questions of Mastery</i> [Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1991]) has written extensively on Bishop's use of perspective. Her argument is broader than can be summarized here but includes an emphasis on Bishop's "points of view that discovered or acknowledged their inadequacy, that expressed uncertainty or need and could not account for everything before them" . Costello argues that Bishop's "experiments with odd and multiple perspectives, with radical shifts of frame and scale, with temporal conditions of observations, provide her with the visual language for representing a fluent, temporal subjectivity" . Costello has also drawn out the aesthetics implied in Bishop's poems about paintings (214–33). Ernesto Suarez-Toste ("'Telling It Slant': The 'Healthier' Surrealism of Elizabeth Bishop and Joseph Cornell," <i>Revista Canaria de Estudios Ingleses</i> 42 [2001]: 279–88 has explored the affinity between Bishop and Joseph Cornell. </p>

<p><a name="FOOT10" href="#REF10">10</a>. In spite of periodically telling Anne Stevenson that the biographer's work must be her own and that Bishop wishes to avoid directing the line of argument for the biography, Bishop tries to prevent Stevenson from associating the poetry too closely with the surrealists and Max Ernst. Bishop throws out an alternative track for Stevenson to follow, naming Klee and Schwitters: "You mention Ernst 

<b></b>

 again. Oh dear–I wish I'd never mentioned him at all, because I think he's usually a dreadful painter. I liked that <i>Histoire Naturelle</i> I mentioned, and his photo-collages still seem brilliant. Klee I like, of course, and Schwitters—but then I like so much painting" (Letter to Anne Stevenson, January 8 , 1964, Washington University Libraries, Department of Special Collections, Manuscript Division, St Louis, MI.) Even though Bishop backs off her choice to single out Klee and Schwitters by adding the phrase "but then I like so much painting," we should hear it as significant that she chose Klee and Schwitters to be the two names brought forward to counter the mistaken association with Ernst. </p>

<p>Art historians have linked Schwitters to Klee in some respects.

Tradition and Innovation</i> [Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 1993], 64) argue that the Blue Rider group provided an early and important influence for Schwitters. According to Dietrich, Schwitters "maintained his ties to Expressionism even after his adoption of a medium—collage—that is usually thought of as having been conceived in opposition to it" . She also argues for a direct link to Klee (100–02).  </p>

<p><a name="FOOT16" href="#REF16">16</a>. The characteristics of "modesty," "care," "determination in the face of an acknowledgement of helplessness" likely derive from Klee's use of a "wandering line," an important subject for Bishop but not one that I can cover in this essay. The later critic Andrew Kagan ("Paul Klee's Influence on American Painting: New York School," <i>Arts Magazine</i> June [1975]), interpreting Klee's influence on 1940s visual art, can help us to connect this use of space with the issue of modesty: "Klee's line functions as an independent and autonomous pictorial element, never bound to the description of volume, and often free from the task of bounding forms . . . Klee's improvisatory drawing does not grip space rigidly and declare it by force. It rather displaces and inflects a highly fluid pictorial depth . . . " . Klee allows fields of color and texture to cross the boundary of a form, largely because line does not define volume or bound a form. This feeling of space loosely held corresponds to the sense of modesty in Klee that Bishop so admired. It is probably related to her commonly acknowledged epistemology of uncertain movement toward knowledge, and, a handwritten phrase in the letter to Lowell, added as afterthought to the list of "modesty, care, <i>space,</i> determination in the face of helplessness" suggests this epistemology: the note adds to the list of qualities another item: "and admission of final ignorance" (January 29, 1958, Robert Lowell Papers, BMSAm1905, Houghton Library, Harvard University). </p>
