<p>
What difference does it make to the way we read <i>Ulysses</i> that Leopold Bloom is a Jew, or rather, that he is thought by most of Dublin to be a Jew? In the past decade, research into the question of <i>Ulysses</i> and Jewishness has been largely dominated by two main approaches, one concerned with content, and the other with form. Content-oriented critics such as Neil Davison focus on the <i>representation</i> of Bloom as a "Jew," and tend to ignore the formal and stylistic innovations of <i>Ulysses,</i> treating them as distractions in an essentially "realist" novel.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
 The form-oriented critics examine Joycean textuality itself for signs of Jewishness&#8212;say, through analogies to the Talmud (Ira Nadel), or to Levinas's philosophy (Steven Connor)&#8212;in a way that tends to bracket the question of the specific function and representation of Bloom, as well as to promote a disturbingly fetishized notion of Jewishness.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 What I want to propose here is a way to synthesize the premise that thinking about Jewishness in <i>Ulysses</i> means thinking about Bloom, with the insight that this thinking needs at the same time to account for the peculiar formal innovations that give <i>Ulysses</i> its place in literary history. I should also point out that other critics, most notably Bryan Cheyette and Marilyn Reizbaum, have acknowledged and addressed the self-consciousness with which Joyce invokes the notion of "Jewishness," however their accounts lack a consideration of the <i>particular</i> literary techniques and styles that distinguish <i>Ulysses</i>: this essay attempts to remedy this omission in critical discussions of Joyce.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>




<b></b>

<p>
In what follows I propose that the way to achieve this synthesis is by thinking less about the <i>identity</i> of either Bloom or the text and more about structural similarities in the way both Bloom and the work <i>Ulysses</i> are perceived by others. In particular, I want to draw attention to a certain conceptual homology between the anti-Semitic notion of "the Jew" and aspects of <i>Ulysses</i>' form, insofar as both might be seen to represent the abstract realm of social relations under industrial capitalism.

<p>
The account of modern anti-Semitism that I find most productive in this context is that put forward by the social theorist Moishe Postone. In "Anti-Semitism and National Socialism," Postone focuses on romantic anticapitalism's confusion of the appearance of capitalist relations for their "essence." Capitalist social relations <i>appear</i>

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
antinomically, as the opposition of the abstract and concrete. Because . . . both sides of the antinomy are objectified, each appears to be quasi-natural. The abstract dimension appears in the form of abstract, universal, "objective," natural laws; the concrete dimension appears as pure "thingly" nature.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
Romantic anticapitalism, however, hypostatizes the concrete, rooted, and organic, and identifies capitalism solely with the abstract dimension of the antinomy. As Postone asserts, romantic anticapitalism does not understand "That concrete labor itself incorporates and is materially formed by capitalist social relations [the abstract dimension]" ("ANS," 309).

<p>
According to Postone, modern anti-Semitism takes this romantic anticapitalist model a step further and sees the abstract dimension of capitalist social relations (for the romantic anticapitalist, capitalism as such) personified in the Jews. Central to the story Postone tells is the observation that

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
the specific characteristics of the power attributed to the Jews by modern anti-Semitism&#8212;abstractness, intangibility, universality, mobility . . . are all characteristics of the [abstract] value dimension of the social forms analyzed by Marx. Moreover, this dimension, like the supposed power of the Jews, does not appear as such, but always in the form of a material carrier, the commodity. ["ANS," 308]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
In other words, "the Jew" as imagined by modern anti-Semitism solves the problem of finding a concrete embodiment, or, more precisely, a <i>personification,</i> for powerful social and economic forces that otherwise lack a material manifestation. The Jew serves to personify processes within finance capital that have no concrete manifestation, that are quite literally <i>unrepresentable.</i> Thus we might infer that the problem that anti-Semitism solves is a problem of representation, and that anti-Semitism must therefore possess an intrinsically aesthetic dimension. An aesthetic dimension, and a specific kind of aesthetic at that: the Jew gives a <i>human</i> shape to the abstract circuits and cycles of finance capital. Yet precisely because of this contradictory representational and representative burden&#8212;concretizing the abstract, giving a "thingly," "organic" form to that which has none&#8212;"the Jew" is also always on the verge of being dehumanized.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>


<p>
Postone's account of the modern anti-Semitic image of "the Jew" resonates strikingly with contemporary Marxist accounts of <i>Ulysses</i>' form in which the text's proliferation
<b></b>
of styles is also explained in terms of the abstraction of modern life. Think of the links Fredric Jameson draws between the internal differentiation of <i>Ulysses</i>&#8212;the "autonomization" of "individual chapters and sub-episodes"&#8212;and the Taylorization of the labor process, or of Terry Eagleton's claim that in <i>Ulysses,</i> "[W]hat is turned disruptively against bourgeois <i>culture</i> is in a sense bourgeois <i>economy</i>: the leveling, equalizing, indifferent operations of the commodity form itself, which respects no unique identity, transgresses all frontiers, melts solidity into air, and profanes the holy."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
 Both Jameson and Eagleton read <i>Ulysses</i> in terms of quasi-Benjaminian <i>correspondences,</i> an inevitable step in trying to explain how the text&#8212;like "the Jew" for the anti-Semite&#8212;might embody otherwise unrepresentable social processes.

<p>
Eagleton goes even further, emphasizing the interdependence of modernism's exilic "estrangement . . . [from] clapped-out national lineages" with "an expression of the rootless conditions of an international monopoly capitalism, whose abstractly universalist forms are mimed by modernism's own progressively abstract techniques."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 Estranged from national lineages, rootless, and abstractly universalist? How many writers have described "the Jew" in just this language? Of course, Eagleton is talking about modernism and <i>capitalism</i>. Yet the rhetorical and conceptual convergence between Eagleton's description of "international monopoly capitalism" and modern anti-Semitic discourse remains striking, and not a little disturbing: although "capitalism" is arguably (part of) the correct name for that which is misrecognized by the anti-Semitic fantasy of "the Jew," one also wonders whether the uncanny substitutability of the one term for the other in those lines betrays precisely the scapegoating, binary structure of thought that is inextricable from much of the violence that so distinguished the twentieth century and seems set to persist in our own. My point here, however, is not to disqualify the Marxist accounts of <i>Ulysses</i> and modernism, but to underline the importance of refusing the temptation to <i>anthropomorphize</i> capitalism: it is precisely because Eagleton succumbs to this temptation&#8212;international, monopoly capitalism as an exilic and rootless nomad&#8212;that his rhetoric begins to assume its uncanny likeness to just the discourse to which it can otherwise serve as antidote.

<p>
Eagleton's missteps aside, his and Jameson's accounts suggest that the form of <i>Ulysses</i> emerges from, reflects, and reproduces within literature the same economic processes to which Postone traces the anxieties and projections of the anti-Semite. But whereas <i>Ulysses</i>' response to an increasingly abstract world is to mime and imitate it, and thereby to strip literature of its anthropocentric "illusions," the anti-Semite's response is to reassert the claims of anthropocentric representation, to insist on an answer to the question "<i>Who</i> is doing this?" and to find the Jew behind the curtain, pulling the strings.

<p>
What I've sketched out allows us to think of <i>Ulysses</i> and modern anti-Semitism as sharing more than an historical determinant, namely, an historically specific representational "problematic": how to represent or explain the apparently unrepresentable, increasingly abstract processes of the modern, and modernizing world? This shared problematic&#8212;one to which Joyce and the anti-Semite of course find very different solutions&#8212;in turn raises the possibility that the various notions of "the Jew" that circulate in <i>Ulysses</i> could be read as having a significant relationship to the form of the text. 
<b></b>
To explore this possibility we need, however, to turn our attention toward the issue of how and why Bloom is constructed as a "Jew," and to put ourselves on the lookout for signs of a self-conscious connection within the text itself between the anti-Semitic notion of the Jew as personified abstraction and the way the text itself exploits linguistic abstractions.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>


<p>
It seems to me that these elements converge in "Cyclops," a chapter of <i>Ulysses</i> in which, as we know, Bloom is violently confronted, and makes a stand&#8212;albeit one he later renounces&#8212;<i>as</i> a Jew, but also a chapter in which we see a peculiar reflection on the shape of <i>Ulysses.</i> "Cyclops" also has a special status in the compositional history of the text; for if, until shortly after the end of World War I, Joyce had been writing <i>Ulysses</i> in what he called the novel's "initial style," a style marked by stream of consciousness, dialogue, and intermittent third-person narration, it was with the writing of "Cyclops" in mid-June of 1919 that he abandoned this style and, as Michael Groden tells us, began to write a "second" <i>Ulysses,</i> one "in which a succession of parody styles . . . began to take over."
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 "Cyclops" therefore represents Joyce's "first total break" with his initial style (<i>UP,</i> 125). I shall return to the implications of this break at the end of this essay; for now, let me focus on one of the central narratological features of this chapter: the anomalous narrative voice known to critics as "the Nameless One" that runs through the chapter.

<p>
I am not alone in seeing the Nameless One as something of an anomaly within <i>Ulysses.</i> For years Joyce scholars have rightly tried to give an account of the relationship between the Nameless One's singular voice and his patently dubious political and social views. The standard explanation is, of course, that his one voice, his monologue, reflects his one-eyed, cyclopean view, which, unlike the polyphonic novel in which he appears, intolerantly excludes other perspectives and voices. There are a number of problems with this account of "Cyclops." Suffice it to say here that what distinguishes the Nameless One <i>cannot</i> be that he is monologic&#8212;a "one-eyed" single voice as opposed to the polyphony of <i>Ulysses</i>&#8212;if only because Bloom, Molly, and Stephen are all, in their own ways, also monological.

<p>
Yet the Nameless One's voice can indeed be read as a narrative anomaly within <i>Ulysses</i>; in fact, I want to suggest that this voice be read as an embodiment and representation of everything that the rest of the novel&#8212;in formal terms&#8212;is not. Elsewhere I have argued that the central distinguishing feature of this voice within the novel is its use of <i>direct address</i>; I consequently propose that this voice be read in conjunction with Louis Althusser's theory of ideological interpellation, in which, as is well known, a certain kind of direct address is also crucial.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
 In Althusser's theory, however, the addressee is interpellated through a call to recognize him or herself as prima facie guilty, while the addressee of the Nameless One's narration is <i>reassured</i> to the extent that he recognizes himself in the narrator's voice and prejudices. Addressed as guilty in the Nameless One's discourse is not the implied addressee, but a putatively trangressive other&#8212;Leopold Bloom. Most pertinent to what follows, I argue that the Nameless One's attacks on Bloom (which occupy much of his narration) presuppose a literary and linguistic normativity that the narrator himself exemplifies and calls upon the addressee to identify with, a normativity from which Bloom is seen to deviate. <b></b>

<p>
The notion of a "narrative anomaly" is, however, just the first piece of the puzzle. In what follows I explore why Joyce presents that normativizing other as <i>anti-Semitic.</i> Why should the target of the Nameless One's hostile self-differentiation be a Jew rather than, say, a colonizing Englishman? And, of course, the Nameless One is not the only one performing an act of self-differentiation in "Cyclops": if the Nameless One represents the <i>narrative</i> "other" of <i>Ulysses,</i> and the Nameless One's "other" is Jewish, what does that tell us about the relationship between the anti-Semitic Nameless One's perception of Bloom as a Jew and the form of <i>Ulysses</i> itself? These questions are best approached by a closer examination of what the Nameless One has to say about how Jews&#8212;especially Bloom&#8212;speak.

<p>
From the outset of the novel, <i>Ulysses</i> acknowledges just the kind of anti-Semitic personification that Postone diagnoses. In "Telemachus," Haines, Mulligan's visiting chum from Oxford, tries to reach out to Stephen in the language of shared nationalism and anti-Semitism: "Of course I'm a Britisher, Haines' voice said, and I feel as one. I don't want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either. That's our national problem, I'm afraid, just now."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 Garret Deasy, headmaster of Clongowes school and advocate of zero-sum economics (he warns Stephen against the perils of going into debt), offers a still more striking illustration of how anxieties about the nation-state and economics are intertwined in anti-Semitism:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
England is in the hands of the jews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are the signs of a nation's decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the nation's vital strength . . . As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction. [<i>U,</i> 33]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
In such passages the Jew clearly serves to tie together (or, as Slavoj Zizek puts it, to "quilt") the anxieties about economic and territorial integrity that finance capital arouses; Deasy's diatribe shows especially clearly the slide from economic to organic-biological thinking that is representative of anti-Semitic personification.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>


<p>
The Nameless One and his companions in Barney Kiernan's have a lot to say and repeat about Bloom, most of it familiar to anyone acquainted with both traditional and modern anti-Semitic notions about the body and behavior of "the Jew." Bloom is rumored to be a menstruating "mixed middling," a notion that combines medieval notions about the bodies of male Jews with the theory of the femininity of the Jewish male proposed by Otto Weininger in his 1903 <i>Sex and Character</i>, a book that was all the rage in fin-de-si&egrave;cle Europe, and whose influence on Joyce is still being explored.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 Bloom's refusal to drink or treat others to drinks despite the fact that he is rumored to be carrying vast winnings from his bet on "Throwaway" resonates with stereotypical anti-Semitic notions of Jewish stinginess, secretiveness, and diffidence toward local forms of community. It is worth noting here that in earlier drafts of "Cyclops," the rumor was that Bloom had won big in the Hungarian lottery (<i>UP,</i> 132). What remains consistent throughout the different versions of "Cyclops" is the fantasy of Bloom's hidden, hoarded money. Even the rumor&#8212;"John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the idea for Sinn Fein to Griffith"&#8212;is congruent with notions of "the Jew" as a hidden, 
<b></b>
conspiratorial political power: that Bloom would be seen as both a capitalist-type money bags and an anti-imperialist revolutionary conforms all too well to the fantasy world of modern European anti-Semitism described by Postone, which imagines "the Jew" as the "hidden force" behind such "apparent" opposites as capitalism and socialism (<i>U,</i> 335).

<p>
In these respects Bloom is perceived, or <i>mis</i>perceived, to personify the Jew in a manner congruent with modern European anti-Semitism. But it is Bloom's language, the way he talks and what he talks about, that the Nameless One most obsessively and antagonistically dwells upon. I have indicated that the Nameless One marks his own speech as normal and proper and Bloom's (among others) as deviant and improper. Admittedly, there is something counterintuitive about the claim that the Nameless One, whose monologue is, after all, a morass of malapropisms, should be concerned about "proper speech." In the "Cyclops" chapter, however, Joyce's irony frequently works through an implicit tu quoque; the Nameless One's claims about others often reflect equally upon himself. Furthermore, it is not even clear that the Nameless One's malapropisms provide such implicit criticism. His linguistic missteps seem deliberate and willful rather than, as Emer Nolan suggests, signs of a faulty education.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 Complaining of Bloom, the Nameless One says,

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: <i>Look at, Bloom. Do you see that straw? That's a straw.</i> Declare to my aunt he'd talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady. [<i>U,</i> 316]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
You can't declare the truth of something to your "aunt" and to your "antimacassar" in the same breath without showing that you know perfectly well which one, in standard English, is your relative and which one protects your furniture.

<p>
The Nameless One's language bears, rather, a family resemblance to cockney rhyming slang: a product of working- and lower-middle-class culture, playfully resistant to the standardization of national languages that Benedict Anderson has shown was crucial to the formation of nation-states.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
 Yet it is still a language with its own codes and conventions, mastery of which means identity and inclusion, incompetence in which means exclusion&#8212;exclusion, most significantly, for the stranger, immigrant, or outsider. This very alliance between shared identity and idiomatic speech might lead us to imagine&#8212;following a Zizek-inspired logic&#8212;that what gets abjected from the social body is too <i>strict</i> a conformity to the official laws and standards of the language, that precisely too strict an adherence to the law is felt as a transgression of the boundaries of what we might call "properly improper" or incorrect behavior and taste.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 Especially for those nations that stake their singularity on defiance of (English) rigidity&#8212;alongside Ireland and Scotland, the United States and Australia come immediately to mind&#8212;a good part of national identity might reside in the skilled and proper rupture of English linguistic and other proprieties. Something of this "improper propriety" seems to make itself felt in the Nameless One's objections to Bloom's pedantic and playless diction.



<b></b>
<p>

To see what is at stake in the Nameless One's attacks on Bloom's speech, it might help to see what is not. Most of the deviations from "proper speech" that the Nameless One draws attention to are Bloom's, but the first is attributed to the creditor whose debt the Nameless One is supposed to collect, Moses Herzog:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Jesus I had to laugh at the little jewy getting his shirt out. <i>He drink me my teas. He eat me my sugars. Because he no pay me my moneys</i>? [<i>U,</i> 292]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
This rendering of Herzog's speech amounts to an English-language version of what was in the German-speaking world called <i>mauscheln,</i> a derogatory term used to characterize the Jew's manner of speaking German.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 It was thought that because of their prior linguistic "contamination" by Hebrew and Yiddish, Jews were constitutionally incapable of speaking German properly, and mastering either grammar or pronunciation. Similarly, the Nameless One's imitation of Moses Herzog's language directly translates Yiddish into English through the imitation of reflexive verbs ("he eat me my") and the use of plurals where standard (and even nonstandard) English permits only the singular: the "teas," "sugars," and "moneys."

<p>
In her recent account of <i>Ulysses</i>' "poetics of Jewishness," Marilyn Reizbaum asserts the centrality of the concept of <i>mauscheln</i> to the representation of Bloom as a self-hating Jew.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
 But as Bloom's memories and "Circe's" burlesque demonstrate, Herzog's <i>mauscheln</i> is the language of <i>Rudolph</i> Virag/Bloom, Leopold's father: the immigrant, unassimilated and unmodern, even anachronistic, for whom English remains a foreign language. <i>Mauscheln</i> is not the language of Leopold Bloom, who patiently explains to his wife the meaning of "metempsychosis" and is amused by the stylistic awkwardness of his secret penpal, Martha. The language of <i>Ulysses</i> may be hybrid and may seem like a kind of translated English, but nothing is added to our understanding of <i>Ulysses</i> by describing it as akin to a language that plays such a marginal role in the text itself and from which Bloom is so clearly distinguished.

<p>
Yet the Nameless One clearly locates something "foreign" in Bloom's language; nothing about Bloom disturbs him more. Some representative examples:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon. [<i>U,</i> 304; in response to Bloom's scientific explanation for why hanged men have erections] 

<p>
Mister Knowitall. Teach your grandmother how to milk ducks. [<i>U,</i> 315; in response to his opinions about foot and mouth disease]

<p>
&#8212;But, says Bloom, isn't discipline the same everywhere? I mean wouldn't it be the same here if you put force against force?

<br />
&#8212;Didn't I tell you? As true as I'm drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living. [<i>U,</i> 329]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
And there is, of course, that moment in the midst of the Nameless One's account of a discussion of "Irish sports" that inspired my title: 



<b></b>

<p>


<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of the lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil and building up a nation once again and all of that. And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower's heart violent exercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: <i>Look at, Bloom. Do you see that straw? That's a straw.</i> Declare to my aunt he'd talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady. [<i>U,</i> 316]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
Leopold Bloom doesn't talk like Moses Herzog; he doesn't <i>mauscheln.</i> Nor does the Nameless One think otherwise; the Nameless One's irritation with how Bloom talks is not a question of Bloom's lack of assimilation or a ghetto-like archaism. Yet the Nameless One's incessant harping about how Bloom speaks and what he says still, I want to argue, has to be seen as of a piece with his anti-Semitism.

<p>
The first thing to note here is that the features ordinarily ascribed by modern European anti-Semitism to the <i>person</i> of "the Jew" are recapitulated here in the qualities of the <i>language</i> ascribed to Bloom: abstract, dilatory, detached from concrete particulars. The tension Postone describes between the visible, concrete, "thingly" appearance of the commodity and that which seems in excess of and parasitic upon it reappears in the Nameless One's remarks about Bloom's verbal and verbose defiance of common sense: Bloom can't let a straw be just a straw, a thing in itself about which there is nothing to say&#8212;there has to be something behind it. Second, when we recall that the Nameless One himself appears to embody a kind of antitype of Joycean narrative protocols, we might well suspect that when Joyce makes discursive style central to the Nameless One's criticism of Bloom, Joyce thereby also introduces a certain self-consciousness about <i>literary</i> language to the tension between the Nameless One and Bloom. Let me elaborate on these claims in turn.

<p>
Certain characteristics of Bloom's speech mark him as a stranger, and it is clear that he either doesn't understand (as Fritz Senn argues) or doesn't want to play by (as Wolfgang Hidesheimer suggests) the rules of the language game that regulate discourse in Barney Kiernan's pub.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 Bloom seems to function as a harbinger of modernity, for what he introduces to the conversation is what modernity also brings: the sense of the conventionality and <i>contingency</i> of traditional ties that were once seen to be natural. The Princeton astrophysicist J. Richard Gott III has parsed the Copernican revolution (and thereby, arguably, modernity itself) with the phrase "your location is not special"
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 and when Bloom asks about corporal punishment, "Wouldn't it be the same here. . . . ?" it seems less important to worry about what this says about his political credentials than to recognize that what irritates the others about Bloom's question is that it does not take the uniqueness of the Irish situation as a given, as something that, like a straw picked up from the floor, <i>goes without saying.</i> If we follow Georg Simmel's reflections in his essay "The Stranger" on the effects of Jewish immigration and assimilation in Western Europe, the same unsettling destabilization of location that Gott describes as an effect of the Copernican revolution, what we might call a "modernity effect," is also brought about in the life of organic communities by the appearance of the stranger.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 In sharing his scientific preoccupations in Kiernan's pub, Bloom's discourse therefore yokes together the modernity effects of science and the stranger.



<b></b>

<p>
There is, however, also a kind of distortive violence in the Nameless One's representation of Bloom's speech. Bloom may challenge received wisdom&#8212;as he does, say, on the virtues of strenuous exercise or the British use of corporal punishment&#8212;but contrary to the Nameless One's account, he does not contravene natural laws&#8212;telling you that living is dying or that ducks can be milked&#8212;and there is little evidence throughout most of <i>Ulysses</i> that Bloom is anything like as verbose as the Nameless One makes him out to be. In fact, in the rest of <i>Ulysses</i> Bloom is often rather reticent and awkward, especially in comparison to garrulous types like Simon Dedalus (whose imitation of Larry O'Rourke provides a stark contrast to Bloom's own exchange of banalities with him), eloquent storytellers like Martin Cunningham (who rescues Bloom's bumbled attempt to tell his "awfully good" story about Reuben J. Dodd), and confident, if clich&eacute;d, speechifiers like the Citizen. "Cyclops" represents a rare moment where Bloom aggressively asserts himself verbally: no wonder he boasts about it afterwards.

<p>
In his suggestive essay "Bloom Among the Orators," Fritz Senn claims that the Nameless One objects to Bloom's unadorned accounts of things, "Where everybody is expected to wield tropes divertingly, for the fun of it, Bloom remains, even in his most rhetorical moments, factual (whether he gets the facts right or not), sincere and truthful, devoid of Odyssean trickery."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 According to Senn, Bloom is not interested in imaginative embellishment for the sake of entertainment, which is why the Nameless One interrupts him with his own versions. But this is exactly the opposite of what the Nameless One says he objects to in Bloom: not an obsession with the facts, but an obsession with explanations that undermine one's sense of what the facts are; not sincerity, but manipulation:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
&#8212;But, says Bloom, isn't discipline the same everywhere? I mean wouldn't it be the same here if you put force against force?
<br />
&#8212;Didn't I tell you? As true as I'm drinking this porter if he was at his last gasp he'd try to downface you that dying was living. [<i>U,</i> 139]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
The gap between what Bloom says and what the Nameless One re-presents him as saying is symptomatic of the distortions of anti-Semitism, of what we might call the difference between Jewish people and the re of "the Jew." Both the gap itself and the fact that the Nameless One continually cuts Bloom off (in this respect the above example is atypical) point also to the way that anti-Semitism in <i>Ulysses</i>&#8212;and in general&#8212;is deeply bound up with problems of representation.

<p>
These distortions strike me as significant, as indicating the step beyond a mere conflict of discourses toward rendering the difference of others as "abnormal," "unnatural," and, at its all too real limit, "unhuman." Such distortions are, of course, of a piece with the distorting worldview of anti-Semitism, which turns a Jewish person into "the Jew." The Nameless One's most extreme claims about Bloom are false in the most insidious ways, and yet still possess a kind of intuitive plausibility. If we haven't seen Bloom lecture for hours on "phenomena," we have seen that he is preoccupied with popular scientific knowledge, and it is true that certain concepts and objects can trigger from him a stream of unfiltered information related to the concept or object in 
<b></b>
question.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 What the Nameless One describes himself as objecting to conforms not to how Bloom really talks but to how we have seen him <i>think</i>&#8212;how we have seen Joyce write him&#8212;in what Joyce called the "initial style" of the previous chapters. Andr&eacute; Topia's description of "Bloomian discourse" captures the essential features of this style:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The clear designation of the theme . . . plays [in "Lotus Eaters"] the role of a kind of title, a chapter-head which automatically summons, elicits, and reels off the whole series of generic expressions which fit it and belong to its "compartment." Rather than a space of reverie we are dealing with a linguistic, a rhetorical, an encyclopedic space. Rather than playing out the unbroken continuum of a description, the text scatters indices each of which corresponds to a subclass, a subgroup of a dictionary grouping, a vast repertory of clich&eacute;s on the "Far East."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<p>
The third-person, past tense, narrative voice that designates the theme is known conventionally as the "narrative norm."
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 The Nameless One's "Look at, Bloom, do you see that straw, that's a straw!" parallels the narrative norm's description of the phenomena that catch Bloom's attention, and to which he responds not with a steady hour's dilation on each, but always with enough associated thoughts for Joyce to fill a paragraph until the next stimulus appears.

<p>
What's at stake here is the specific kind of narration that <i>Ulysses</i> presents; the text itself implicitly asks us to read the Nameless One's critique of Bloom in terms of its own procedures. In other words, the Nameless One appears not just as a narrative anomaly, but as a narrative other, a narrating consciousness that is not only hostile toward how Bloom speaks, but that, by extension, also appears to be staging a hostile account of the first half of <i>Ulysses.</i>

<p>
Here, in other words, we begin to see how the tension between the Nameless One and Bloom is also marked by a certain self-consciousness about antagonisms concerning <i>literary</i> language. This tension only becomes more pronounced as the chapter continues. What replaces the initial style and keeps interrupting the Nameless One's own narration is an even more extreme form of what the Nameless One says he cannot tolerate: the numerous parodic interpolations, in which discourse proliferates in a manner that confounds conventional literary narrative and linguistic common sense alike. As soon as the Nameless One has declared to his antimacassar that Bloom could talk about a straw for an hour his own narration is interrupted by an interpolation:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of <i>Brian O'Ciarnain's</i> in <i>Sraid na Bretaine Bheag,</i> under the auspices of <i>Sluagh na h-Eireann,</i> on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. [<i>U,</i> 316-7]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>


<p>
No sooner is Bloom accused of excessive dilation than the text immediately proceeds through this "interpolation" itself to expand upon the discussion that the Nameless One has just skimmed over. The various interpolated discourses in "Cyclops" do precisely what the narrator sees Bloom as doing: producing endless (or at any rate excessive) 
<b></b>
streams of discourse upon meaningless bits and pieces plucked, like the straw, apparently at random from the environs and events of Barney Kiernan's pub. The interpolation makes the analogy unmistakable. The text aligns the Nameless One's claims about Bloom's abstract loquacity with the proliferation of pastiches that dominate <i>Ulysses</i>' second half.

<p>
Clearly, the interpolation undermines the opposition that operates within the Nameless One's own discourse, not to mention those that he recounts, and suggests that the romanticized myth of origins is not that different from, and is even a by-product of, the increasingly abstract and standardized modernity from which the nationalist wishes to distinguish himself and his country. The discourse of nationalism and "Gaelic sports" is implicated in the world and logic that the Nameless One identifies with Bloom; thus the very language of the concrete, local, organic, and heroic is shown to be abstract, mobile, and subjectless.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>


<p>
It also seems to me that Joyce is suggesting a connection between the sources and kinds of hostility Bloom encounters and the sources and kinds of hostility his own work initially encountered. The Nameless One's reactions to Bloom can also be read as Joyce's representation of how his own work might appear <i>through the eyes</i> of a re whose narrative voice embodies everything that his own work is not. The structural connections between the Nameless One's account of Bloom's language and the actual structure of <i>Ulysses</i>' language suggest that ostracism of a stranger perceived as a Jew and resistance to modernist innovations in literary presentation emerge from the same anxieties about representation and abstraction, and likely also from the same desire, diagnosed by Postone, to see in appearances a reflection of real relations.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>


<p>
If the Nameless One's criticisms work to identify Bloom's language with the abstract discourse of modernity, the interpolated texts deconstruct this very identification. They do so, firstly, by showing that the Nameless One's own discourse, and that of his drinking buddies, is equally implicated in the abstractions of modernity, although these res themselves fail to recognize it. Secondly, the distortions to which the Nameless One subjects Bloom's language point to how much he <i>displaces</i> onto Bloom: what the Nameless One attributes to Bloom&#8212;like what the anti-Semite attributes to "the Jew"&#8212;are actually the features of what Postone calls the "abstract value dimension of social forms." In the Nameless One's case these features also strikingly resemble a number of the techniques of <i>Ulysses</i> itself. The interpolated text on "ancient Gaelic sports" is representative of the moment in which Joyce himself abandons personification.

<p>
Franco Moretti's account of the difference between the initial and the later style in <i>Ulysses</i> is helpful in this context:

<p>

<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Bloom reactivates discourses formed around him . . . and then [in the second half of the book] Joyce reactivates those reactivated discourses, without any longer passing through Bloom's mind. He reactivates them, in other words, without motivating them any longer. Like Pound with <i>The Waste Land</i> [Moretti refers here to Pound's rigorous editing of Eliot's first draft], <i>Joyce eliminates the bodies and keeps the voices</i>: he erases the original motivation, and allows the new technique to take off freely. [emphasis added]
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>



<p>
This moment of transition is entwined with the question of anti-Semitism. In "Cyclops" Joyce simultaneously abandons the use of Bloom's body to focalize the discourses and phenomena of modern life, connecting the way that the Nameless One constructs Bloom as linguistically "Jewish" with his novel's own distinctive features, particularly its abstraction, its context-ignoring rationality, and its "improper" verbal excesses; these <i>disembodied</i> discourses deliberately mimic the rhetorical features that the Nameless One attributes to Bloom. <i>Ulysses</i> is not, <i>pace</i> critics like Ira Nadel, a "Jewish" text, but it does draw attention to itself as a text that manifests and exploits the properties that the anti-Semite sees personified in "the Jew."

<p>
None of this is to deny that Bloom does, at least in the early chapters written in the "initial style," seem to embody certain key experiences of modernity in forms conventionally linked for various reasons&#8212;some value-neutral, some insidious&#8212;to the experience of modern European Jewry: his mobility, his rationality, his alienation, his preoccupation with commerce and consumption. But in "Cyclops" this kind of embodiment is called into question. Joyce's critique of anti-Semitic fantasies about "the Jew" can be seen as vital to the way we understand <i>Ulysses</i>' break with the language of the individual, with voice, and with anthropocentric representation. "Cyclops," the site of this break, marks the point at which Joyce emphatically abandons the <i>personification</i> of modern life in favor of an artistic exploration of modernity that <i>imitates</i> its abstraction, intangibility, and excess; modernity is represented linguistically and analogically, rather than through a particular kind of person. In the "Cyclops" chapter&#8212;and beyond it&#8212;Joyce displays the creative potential to be found in undoing anti-Semitic fantasies rather than, as so many of his contemporaries did, indulging such fantasies as a means to poetic inspiration. Joyce's recognition of the impossibility of representing all that is abstract, intangible, and excessive in the modern world becomes the point of departure for radical artistic innovations that challenge the constructions of "the Jew" prevailing both in the works of other modernists and in the period's broader discourses of nation and race. <i>Ulysses</i>' most singular formal features can, therefore, be read as a form of critical and complex reflection on early-twentieth-century European anti-Semitism, and thus as an index of the degree of the novel's engagement with one of the definitive elements of the historical period Eric Hobsbawm has called "the Age of Catastrophe."

The particular parody that I have focused on is full of similar reflexive ironies. The Gaelic <i>Sraid na Bretaine Bheag</i> translates into "Little Britain Street." The critic W. J. McCormack has suggested that the Citizen's speeches rely on English clich&eacute;s, while Bloom's account of the postmortem erection, "It's only a natural phenomenon, don't you see, because on account of the . . . " exploits a feature of Gaelic known as <i>na cura cainte</i> (runs [or throws] of speech) which are "lengthy phrases which have an established and recognized existence <i>as units</i>" and which are integral to the fluent speaking of Irish. See W. J. McCormack, "James Joyce, Clich&eacute;, and the Irish language," in <i>James Joyce:</i> T<i>he Augmented Ninth,</i> ed. Bernard Benstock (Syracuse, N.Y.: Syracuse University Press, 1988), 330, 327. On the other hand, Emer Nolan insists that the interpolations, in their very verbal excess, are actually better renderings of Gaelic style than the translations upon which they are based. Yet even Nolan identifies the interpolations as manifestations of "the endlessly levelling discourse of the modern," and fails to show convincingly that the interpolations undermine Gaelic myth any less than they "subvert the language of the modern from the inside." See <i>James Joyce and Nationalism,</i> 107. Bloom too is on occasion the object of these interpolated parodies. Yet what matters is not how Bloom actually talks and whether the parodies are like that too, but that the parodies are like the kind of language that the Nameless One projects onto him. Even when the interpolations parody Bloom's traits, the text is still doing what the Nameless One says that Bloom does.

Was this an anticipatory representation of possible criticism? Although <i>Ulysses</i> as a finished text appeared on Joyce's birthday in 1922, chapters in progress had appeared in the <i>Little Review</i> as early as June 1918. David Trotter sees this date, which marks the publication of the first version of "Calypso" and thus also the point at which it became clear that <i>Ulysses</i> would be radically different from <i>Dubliners</i> and <i>Portrait,</i> as the birthdate of literary modernism. "The Modernist Novel," in <i>The Cambridge Companion to Modernism</i>, ed. Michael Levenson (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 83. Serial publication also gave Joyce four years to hear what people made of the initial style and, in his responding to them, to initiate a second break from literary convention without leaving time for people to get used to the first one. His role in subsequent interpretive endeavors, most notably Stuart Gilbert's book, is well-known. Similarly, while <i>Finnegans Wake</i> was still <i>Work in Progress,</i> Joyce saw fit to "commission" his followers to publish <i>Our Exagmination Round his Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress,</i> which includes "A Litter" to "Germ's Choice" signed by "Vladimir Dixon," but thought to be by Joyce himself. As these examples demonstrate, Joyce was no stranger to the principle of the post-publication, preemptive strike. Freedman's exploration of the ambivalent identification of Anglo-American writers (including Henry James and T. S. Eliot) with the Jew as "an odd double for the artist or the intellectual" has a certain similarity to my argument, but again Freedman's emphasis is on the social status of the writer, rather than on the formal properties of the text. Freedman, <i>The Temple of Culture,</i> 11.
