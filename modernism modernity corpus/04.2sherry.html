In the first paragraph of "The Meaning of the Wild Body" , Wyndham
Lewis sets out the major premise for his mature theory of comedy. This
entails an axiomatic, apparently inarguable separation between the
object of comedy and its laughing observer, between the Wild Body and
its percipient:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
First, to assume the dichotomy of mind and body is necessary here,
without arguing it; for it is upon that essential separation that the
theory of laughter here proposed is based. The essential us, that is,
the laugher, is as distinct from the Wild Body as in the Upanisadic
[<I>sic</I>] account of the souls returned from the paradise of the Moon,
which, entering into plants, are yet distinct from them. Or to take the
symbolic vedic re of the two birds, the one watching and passive,
the other enjoying its activity, we similarly have to posit <I>two</I>
creatures, one that never enters into life, but that travels about in a
vessel to whose destiny it is momentarily attached. That is, of course,
the laughing observer, and the other is the Wild Body.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This uncompromising dichotomy appears at odds, however, with Lewis's
attitudes in a contemporary treatise, "Inferior Religions."
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 Here the "Wild Body" is "regarded as a brain" and

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
laughter [as] the brain-body's snort of exultation. It expresses its
wild sensation of power and speed; it is all that remains physical in
the flash of thought, its friction; or it may be a defiance flung at
the hurrying fates.

<P>

The Wild Body is this supreme survival that is us, the stark apparatus
with its set of mysterious spasms: the most profound of which is
laughter. [<I>WB,</I> 152]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
No superior or derisive sneer, laughter here wells up from the very
source and matrix of the laughable. Although Lewis seems equally to root
his laughter in the Wild Body and laugh his
way

<B></B>

 out of that vibrating corpus, he stands as no credible witness at a comic
 marriage of brain and blood. For he scores his doubts too deeply into
 these essays--into their conceptual fabric, into the very rhetorical
 textures of these passages: the re of the souls returning to the
 plants in the Upanishadic account, for example, is poised with suspicious
 ambivalence between entry and abeyance.

<P>
The contrary positions Lewis assumes in these essays may reflect
a generic or typical division in modern ideas of the comic, which
have focused variously on the internal or psychological dimensions of
laughter and its external, mechanical occasions. His preoccupation with
the nature and character of the laugher resonates with Sigmund Freud's
interest, in <I>Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious,</I> in the
laugh as an unleashing of forbidden energies. And his fixation on the
comic object of the Wild Body matches Henri Bergson's focus, in <I>Le
Rire</I> (Laughter), on the risible automaton, the primary scene of
comedy. These several interests may testify to the comprehensive scope
of Lewis's engagement with the comic, but their differing interests do
not explain away the inconsistency here: the uneasy shift in positional
relation between the target of humor and the laugher's vantage. There is
an uncertainty about the proper comic response that we may understand
as a vacillation between an experience of the <I>ludicrous</I> and
a sense of the <I>ridiculous:</I> between a spirit of play, in which
<I>homo ludens</I> happily joins with the wild body of the laughable,
and a spirit of ridicule, where the observer distances and chastises
the mechanical object of laughter but does not redeem or reclaim it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>

<P>
This double measure of ludic participation and satirical rebuke has only
been obscured by the re of the Enemy, the professional antagonist,
which Lewis projected so strenuously as his public persona in his
middle years and put forward as his literary identity in <I>Satire
and Fiction</I> . There is indeed a richness of texture in his
comic texts that is informed by a self-division that the Enemy could not
admit. Now, these rival attitudes might be assimilated to some standard
critical counter like "generative tension" or "creative opposition," but
they are understood better, more usefully and substantively, as a residue
of contrary stages in his development. His movement from reciprocity
with the comic object to judgment of it turns on a moment of political
recognition that gives the difference between early and later Lewis its
fullness of intellectual implication. This moment stands as a watershed
in his literary-intellectual career, and I wish to define and recover
its importance here. I center it in the second of the three sections
that follow, where I show the profound reorientation it represents by
searching more deeply into the samples and model of early comedy that I
set out in the first section. The difference this political perception
makes will then be seen, in the third section, in the revision the older
Lewis makes of his earlier work.

<P>

<H3><!--_a-head-->
<B>I</B>
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
The variable in Lewis's comic theory and practice lies in the positional
character of the laugher, not in the nature and behavior of the comic
object, and so it seems

<B></B>

 best to begin with that constant: to redraw Lewis's image of the Wild
 Body and note its comic properties and precedents. The most influential
 model is surely Bergson's. After all, Lewis attended the lectures
 Bergson offered at the Coll&egrave;ge de France in 1903,
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 and the recent publication of <I>Le Rire</I>  had established
 its idea of the comic as a prevailing convention. It was this idea
 that Lewis carried with him through Brittany and Spain--in travels that
 would provide material for his first attempts at literary fiction, the
 stories he drafted and published in England in 1909 and 1910.

<P>
Bergson sees the classic incidence of comedy as involving a collision
between the mechanical and the organic, the habitual and the
variable. Thus the absent-minded man, who has reduced his walking to
involuntary routine, slips risibly on the unseen banana peel. The changing
demands of life reveal a habitual pattern for what it is, and the mirth
is earned at its expense. The laughter entails more than perverse delight
in such contretemps, however; it exercises a high Aristotelian function,
Bergson suggests, for it identifies the fool, rebukes the automaton,
and purges the nonperson, the thing, from proper society.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 Yes, humans may revert to the lower level of mechanical life, but
 Bergson's comic philosophy clearly regards such descents as mere dramatic
 opportunities, as incidents to trigger and set in motion a whole economy
 of redemptive laughter, which returns the audience to the true norm of
 the flexible, thinking response. That is a profoundly humanist norm,
 after all, for it measures and celebrates a human superiority to the
 lower, animal-mechanical character.

<P>
It is remarkable that the tradition of critical inquiry into Lewis's
appropriation of Bergson has failed uniformly to note this defining
difference--all the more remarkable in view of the fact that Lewis sets
the anti-Bergsonian temper of his early stories in the clear theoretical
frame of his later treatises, which he published with the revised version
of those stories in 1927.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 Here Lewis reverses the value and strategy of the Bergsonian formula:
 "The root of the Comic is to be sought in the sensations resulting from
 the observations of a <I>thing</I> behaving like a person" (<I>WB,</I>
 158); the mechanical thing defines the <I>essence</I> of Lewis's
 character, not simply a provisional, farcical identity. This comedy
 laughs at the pretence to humanity, the imitation of personhood by its
 inveterate inferiors; the very humanist vantage assumed by Bergson
 is here the butt of laughter. Lewis's comic characters are not some
 subnormal exception; they comprise a usual humankind, whose strenuous
 but vacuous attempt to supersede their animal-mechanical nature affords
 the constant opportunity for comedy. Lewis expresses the antihumanist
 philosophy that generates this perception as the passage about "the
 root of the comic" continues, elaborating its basic premise in typical
 mise-en-sc&egrave;nes:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
But from that point of view all men are necessarily comic: for they are
all <I>things,</I> or physical bodies, behaving as <I>persons.</I> . . .

If you saw (to give another example of intelligence or movement in the
"dead") a sack of potatoes suddenly get up and trundle off down the street
(unless you were so sceptical to think that it was some one who had got
inside the sack), you would laugh. . . .

<B></B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The other day in the underground, as the train was moving out of
the station, I and those around me saw a fat but active man run
along. . . . [H]is running, neat, deliberate, but clumsy embarkation,
<I>combined with the coolness of his eye,</I> had a ludicrous effect, to
which several of us responded. His <I>eye</I> I decided was the key to
the absurdity of the effect. It was its detachment that was responsible
for this. It seemed to say, as he propelled his sack of potatoes--that
is himself--along the platform, and as he successfully landed the sack
in the carriage: ". . . When you run a sack of potatoes like ME, you
get the knack of them: but they take a bit of moving."
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
It was the detachment, in any case, that gave the episode a comic
quality, that his otherwise very usual appearance would not have
possessed. [<I>WB,</I> 158-60]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
To say, as Geoffrey Wagner does, that Lewis's "comic type is the human
being lacking in awareness, guilty of Bergsonian 'distraction,' and
approximating to the animal machine,"
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 is to miss the whole point of this radical rewriting. For Bergson's comic
 percipient takes an Aristotelian high ground, noting the anomaly of the
 mechanical person and restoring the proper human value by laughing at
 the mistake; the pretence of such human superiority becomes the target
 of Lewis's comic disdain--the animal's humorous impersonation of free
 and thinking humanity.

<P>
There is an anatomy of folly in Lewis's oeuvre, a tendency to see certain
sensory aspects of the human creature as particularly susceptible to the
mechanisms of comedy. His inclination points to backgrounds in French
intellectual history that may be usefully rehearsed here. This is the
post-Revolutionary tradition of <I>id&eacute;ologiecritique.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 This quasi- or semiscientific method takes the body as primary locus
 for adducing truths about the human creature and uses these axioms as
 bases for the formulation of political principle. This discourse was
 being carried on at Lewis's own moment in France by Remy de Gourmont,
 whose analyses, compounded shortly afterward by Julien Benda, routinely
 identified the senses of sound (speech as well as hearing) and sight
 as demonstrations of opposite human possibilities and political
 values. In this description the eye relies on distance and separation
 from the object in view, while the ensuing clarity of focus induces
 a mental condition favoring clear conceptual definition and detached
 understanding; instrument and emblem of intellectual superiority, the
 eye validates the whole notion of social hierarchy. Hearing, by contrast,
 requires contact between the auditor and the physical stimulus; incapable
 of detached intellectual activity, the ear processes the content it
 has received merely by repeating it, verbatim, through the mouth: the
 auditory type becomes one with the sound. The fusion or empathy enabled
 by this process defines its political valence: the less discriminating
 members of the body politic are open to this lower channel of sensory
 communication--an audience bound first to sound and then to each other
 in a spurious but formidable unity, a demotic solidarity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 The political import of this construction may await our consideration in
 the second section, but it is already easy to see how this understanding
 of sound may cast the primary character of comedy. The re of an
 acoustic fool, blithely and mechanically repeating the sounds dubbed
 into him, is the automaton set up for a comic fall.

<B></B>

<P>
The fall shows its peculiarly Lewisian spin right from the start, in
his first published story, "The 'Pole'" . Here the tale-teller
Isobletsky has listened to himself recite his account and is now locked
into the several speaking mannerisms to which he has reduced it; his
own character in the adventure has become an aural impression to be
duplicated. A tissue of impersonations, an overlay of echoes, he depicts
the <I>habit</I>ual, rote repetition to which aural reception inclines. By
the time the narrator meets him, he shows

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
the strangest <I>habit</I> of imitating his own imitations. In telling
a story in which he red (his stories were all designed to prove his
independence) he had a conventional type of imitation for the voice
and manner of his interlocutor, and a gruff, half-blustering tone to
imitate his own voice in these dramatic moments. And gradually these
two tones, mixed into each other, had become his ordinary tone in
conversation. [<I>WB,</I> 213; emphasis added]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Isobletsky's claim to "independence" as a protagonist in these tales
comes into sharp and revealing contrast with the mechanical character of
his utterance: the irony here tracks Lewis's own classic comic incident,
where the target of laughter lies in the assumption of human superiority
over such automatic life. Thus Lewis mounts his challenge to the humanist
philosophy of Bergson from a distinctively Gourmontian ground; the heavy
mechanisms of aural habit exert a force like gravity here, acting as
counterweight to the auditor's unsuccessful but laughably strenuous
efforts at transcendence.

<P>
The comic agon in "A Breton Innkeeper"  develops similarly. Roland,
the concierge-dictator, inveighs thus against the boy-auditor, his
assistant:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
He rages often, cries <I>nom de Dieu,</I> stamps and fumes when the
aforementioned youth does something that displeases him. And doubtless
there is some <I>nuance</I> in this that touches the brass-buttoned
boy--doubtless there is in that youth's exquisite instinct for Roland many
a shade in the rough voice imperceptible to a stranger--some inflection
that makes him scamper more hastily about his business. But outwardly
it is the same heavy and desperate geniality. [<I>WB,</I> 269]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The youth is driven by aural signals as compelling but uncomprehended as
a dog-whistle; such reflex response and mechanical behavior enact the
truth of de Gourmont's own aper&ccedil;u: the ear is unfree, incapable
of detachment from its own network of rote, determinate response. Nor
is the speaker Roland a straight man to this comic mechanism: his
character-in-voice is no less manic and inalterable than the boy's,
for Lewis prefaces the account of his speaking style with this generic
identification: "I have never seen him forsake his farcical manner
with anyone" (<I>WB,</I> 269). There may be some pronominal confusion
between the speaker and auditor in the last sentence here--whose
"heavy and desperate geniality" is it?--but this uncertainty resolves
itself into a single debility, into the one comic opportunity of ear
and mouth. Whether it is the boy or Roland, the automaton pretends an
independence more risible

<B></B>

than his ostensible slavery. He reaches toward a higher level of human
polity and social decorum, but lurchingly, comically, as the phrasing
suggests: his "heavy and <I>desperate</I> geniality" speeds up the very
mill of driven behavior he is seeking to outrun.

This paradox of mechanical vitality shows its somber
gusto in the visual language of the 1912 <I>Courtship</I> (<A
HREF="4.2sherry_1.html"> 1</A>). Here the male and female res
are curvilinear, lithe, thus idealizing the elementary energy of their own
instinctive ritual; true to the ironic pattern, their thighs and upper
torsoes bulge to a muscle-bound puppetry, and so depict their owners as
chthonic automatons, dancing in grim compliance with the determinate laws
of life. Bergson's <I>&eacute;lan vital</I> runs down into self-mocking
robotics, and Lewis adds his comic touch in allowing one of these res
to pretend some superiority over her mechanical condition: the head angled
demurely to the side affects a human shyness, a self-consciousness out
of keeping with the machine, with behavior compelled by instinct. But
not entirely so. Such courtship is a ritual, after all, and the head
display is really no free play at all, for it is working in a fashion
as grim and driven as the rest of her bodily bulk. The image of superior
freedom it affects is really the focus and butt of humor here.

<B></B>

<P>
But it is the circuit of aural-oral compulsion that provides Lewis's
main comic occasion. Thus the narrator-<I>far&ccedil;eur</I> of "Le
P&egrave;re Fran&ccedil;ois"  fiddles with his victim's throat:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
After having been shown his throat, and having vainly attempted to seize
between my thumb and forefinger an imaginary vessel that he insisted,
with considerable violence, that I should find, our relations nearly
came to an abrupt termination on my failing, and having, indeed, pursued
song athwart his anatomy to its darkest and most lugubrious sources, I
said irrelevantly that his hair was very long. He slowed down abruptly
in his speech, but some sentences still followed. Then, after a silence,
taking suddenly the most profoundly serious expression, he said, with a
conviction of tone that admitted of no argument and paralysed all doubt,
"I will tell you! It's too long! My hair is too long!" [<I>WB,</I> 278]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The mystery organ in the depths of this "florid aperture" of the
mouth is the source and center of acoustic vitalism, an energy running
according to those laws of <I>&eacute;lan m&eacute;canique</I> so richly
evidenced in the other early stories. Having had the vitalist innards
of his throat tickled and stimulated, Francis duly produces the sort
of rote, determinate reaction that vocal energy typically runs to:
the Franciscan merely repeats the phrases imprinted into him by the
narrator-protagonist. When he claims these words as his own--"<I>I</I>
will tell <I>you</I>"--he is of course reversing the real current
of influence; thus he takes the wheel of farce one turn further, and
completes the scene with Lewis's own distinctive flourish: the ultimate
moment of comedy is a character's attempt to pretend superiority over
his own determinate nature--the paces of aural habit through which this
vibrant songbird has just been put.

<P>

<H3><!--_a-head-->

</H3>

<P>
"The higher the slavery, the more exquisite the buffoonery":
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 the truth of Shaftesbury's elegant conceit is borne out by the deftness
 of Lewis's lampoons, for this <I>far&ccedil;eur</I> also reveals an
 intoxication with the object of laughter. At moments in his early work,
 one finds the signs of an infatuation with the musical and vocal culture
 of the same Breton speakers he otherwise burlesques. Such attraction
 instances a prime type of acoustic empathy. To its considerable appeals
 Lewis produces a mixed response, modifying his enchantment with an
 emergent recognition--and resistance. He is coming to regard this musical
 sympathy as an experience replete with the psychological and political
 meanings so richly detailed in the contemporary European analysis of
 the subject. (There is simply no evidence that Lewis knew de Gourmont's
 work before beginning to write the stories; the very progressive and
 dialectical character of the recognition I am about to outline, indeed,
 suggests persuasively that he had no prior knowledge. The work of the
 contemporary <I>id&eacute;ologues</I> comprises an awareness into which
 he moves, at least initially, on his own.)
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 While Lewis's struggle clarifies the terms of that continental discourse,
 and claims its relevance to his

<B></B>

own nascent model of comedy, his divided attitudes will be most
interesting when they end, as an ambivalence overcome. Once he recognizes
the social manifestations of aural empathy, that is, the idea of musical
fellow-feeling generates a distaste that annuls all ambiguity. His angle
of relation to his comic object shifts, accordingly, from a more playful
and reciprocating one, grounded in a strong sense of the ludicrous, to an
attitude of detached ridicule and a concomitant vision of the ridiculous.

<P>
A travel diary fragment written at Quimperl&eacute; in 1908 (preserved
at the Cornell archive) records Lewis's elementary fascination
with the Breton tongue. His sympathy is as articulate as it is
discriminating. Sifting through an interlingual hubbub on the quays, he
concentrates on the local dialect, which sounds out its own version of
the Burkean sublime. It creates a beauty as severe as fear--a mingled
and compelling chime:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Several groups of Sweedish [<I>sic</I>] sailors from the boats and
breton dock hands were working on the quay, and the harsh celtic
tongue, passionate and abrupt, was mixed with the wearisome drawl of the
scandinavians. Certain languages,--Russian, swedish, breton,--apart from
the distinct sound of them, are spoken with a distinct tone of voice.
<BR>
. . . Breton is a solemn, rude, patriarchal, monotonous tongue, with long
 and sudden bursts of wild, impetuous speech, with sentences coming to a
 dead halt, which is not a breaking off as it seems, but the excited pitch
 of the voice is kept up till the last syllable and so there is no drop of
 the voice at the end of the phrase; there seems to be a ring of joy--not
 benevolent,--and recklessness, hysterical, timbre drawn out, and then
 sudden harsh and trenchant tones, and grating emphasis. [<I>WB,</I> 197]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Acoustic sensation at this pitch of intensity is felt along the pulse of
a fundamental life-force, various European commentators were suggesting,
and thus joins its auditor in empathy with an <I>&eacute;lan vital.</I>
The same vitalist currents drew Lewis into the thrall of Bretonic aural
culture, he would reveal four decades later, when its vibrancy seems
inseparable from the stupefaction it induced in him:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
The Atlantic air, the raw rich visual food of the barbaric environment,
the squealing of the pipes, the crashing of the ocean, induced a creative
torpor. Mine was now a drowsy sun-baked ferment, watching with delight
the great comic energies which erupted beneath my rather saturnine but
astonished gaze: Brotcotnaz, Bestre, and the rest.

. . . The characters I chose to celebrate--Bestre, the Cornac and his

sun-drunk insects.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The passage offers its mixed attitudes like the palimpsest of a forty-year
career, yet it also provides a remarkably accurate replica of an original
complexity. Its peculiar combination of attraction and censure, both
glorifying and objecting to the vitalism with which Lewis had moved in
elementary sympathy, describes a counterrhythm

<B></B>

already strong in the early fiction, where it emerges less discursively,
more dramatically, as the function of an open-ended, dialectical inquiry.

<P>
This counterrhythm of resistance and reciprocity with Bretonic vocal
culture moves at first as a function of Lewis's response to its sublime
aspect. Its severe economy of beauty and terror discovers a <I>locus
classicus</I> in "The Death of the Ankou" (probably the first of Lewis's
attempts to fictionalize his experience in Brittany), where the English
narrator recounts and responds to a primitive death fetish. Whereas
Lewis would later attribute this story to sources of vitalist energy in
Brittany, to the "sun, a Breton rather than a British" sun,
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 the death fetish emerges narratively and dramatically out of the vitalist
 <I>sounds</I> of the place--a vocal hubbub drenched in the sharp
 life-blood of the locale, an acoustic milieu as stark and compelling
 as the object it generates:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Whenever I grew attentive to my surroundings, the passionate movement of
whirling and striking arms was visible at the tables where the play was
in progress, or a furious black body would dash itself from one chair
to another. The "celtic screech" meantime growing harsher and harsher,
sharpening itself on caustic snarling words, would soar to a paroxysm of
energy. "Garce"! [Bitch!] was the most frequent sound. All the voices
would clamour for a moment together. It was a shattering noise in this
dusky tunnel.--I had stopped reading, as I have said, and I lifted my
eyes. It was then that I saw the Ankou.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
With revulsed and misty eyes almost in front of me, an imperious re,

<P>
The Ankou embodies not only the vocal culture of the place but the
double measure of its acoustic sublime, moving not by eyesight but an
"eloquently moving mouth" and in that sound combining the lure of acoustic
beauty with its own lore of terror, its death-mission and aim.

<P>
Behind this curtain of terrible splendor, rather like the Wizard of
Oz's, stands a pair of all too human feet, a local beggar's, and the
little joke of this reversal goes to the larger sense of comedy that
Lewis inscribes in the tramp's name: Ludo. The sense of play in this
environment--"the <I>play</I> was in progress," after all, when the Ankou
appeared--captures an ethical value within its theatrical meaning. In this
primitive culture, the drama of death (and life) is a game, a sport no
less severe than boisterous but at all points a collective engagement,
a playing <I>tout ensemble:</I> Ludo emerges from voices in "clamour
. . . <I>together.</I>" And Lewis signs this re of play into a type
and model of comedy as he assigns Ludo an exact double and counterpart
in the <I>far&ccedil;eur,</I> through this fisherman's anecdote:

<P>

The English <I>far&ccedil;eur</I>'s blindness may be taken to typify
Lewis's openness to the sounds of the warm vitalist <I>cultus</I> of his
own experience, in Brittany. In such reciprocity, moreover, we find the
unexpected values and emphases in his earliest model of comedy: a playful
synergy with the very characters of acoustic vitalism that provide his
farcical types.

<P>
Such reciprocity is the theme in Lewis's recreation of the comic economy
in "Les Saltimbanques" . Here the performing troupe provides a
paradigm of the comic occasion and a definition of the author's relation
to his comic object (and audience), the wild body of the public:

They looked upon the public as a vast beast, with a very simple but
perverse character, differing from any separate man's, the important trait
of which was an insatiable longing for their performances. . . . Whenever
they met one of these monsters ["the many-headed beast"]--which was on an
average twice a day--their only means of escape was by charming it with
their pipes, which never failed to render it harmless and satisfied. They
then would hurry on, until they met another, when they would again play
to it and flee away.

The reflection that all these people parted with their sous for so
little would be the only bright spot in the gloomy Adrien Brower of
their minds. They felt that they were getting the better of them in some
way. That the public was paying for an idea, for something that it gave
itself, did not occur to them, but that it was paying for the performance
as seen and appreciated by them, the performers. For it is most difficult
to realise the charm of something we possess. [<I>WB,</I> 237-38]

<P>
Once again a pronominal confusion--here in the last several
sentences--serves Lewis's theme perfectly: an exchange of roles, in
which the audience plays music to the performers. Sounding the audience's
response back to itself, Lewis's performers seal the network of acoustic
empathy that binds all together. The author's own incipient resistance
to such exchanges leads him to give the upper hand here to his players,
who can pretend that, even while they are being paid for performing,
they are the ones enjoying the show.

<P>
Yet the performers' complicity with the crowd reflects the inexorable laws
of physical attraction and bonding between sound and listener and, as
expressed, signals Lewis's own fascinated discovery of these rules. For
his narrative modulates into semidiscursive rhythms, inscribing sympathy
through sound--speech no less than music--as the constant, necessary
principle of such performances:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
it is the public . . . towards whom the discomfited "swell" in evening
dress turns as towards his peers, for sympathy and understanding, when
"scored off" anew, in, as the simile would affirm, this low-bred and

that was being represented in the dialogue, and constantly discomfited,
and he were merely their mouthpiece.

To hear these exchanges between performer and audience as a protopolitical
event is to exercise a Bendian hermeneutic that Lewis's language and
imagery here amply invite. Thus Demos, a "low-bred" creature, is reached
at the lowest sensory level through sound; musical empathy underlies
and directs the very collective behavior that constitutes "the Crowd,"
"the public." While these scenes hint consistently at such a political
insight, however, their social content is most interesting in remaining
implicit, unformulated. It is as though the narrative consciousness,
struck by the perplexity of its own fascinated revulsion at the music
of local speech, is evolving this social analysis to sort out that
paradox. For this political reading, which occurs to Lewis only as a
suggestion, emerges obliquely, tentatively, as a function of his own
divided response to the Bretonic vocalese. While the insight lingers on
one side of the narrative consciousness, he does not look at it directly.

<P>
Lewis sees it steady and whole a year later, in the last of his
continental stories, "Le P&egrave;re Fran&ccedil;ois":

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Music was his theme. In making use of certain expressions in the course of
his rambling declamation, such as <I>andante</I> and <I>contralto,</I> he
would add with sudden politeness "that is a term in music." . . . To look
at him one would have said that the only emotion he had ever experienced
was that provoked by the topical and sentimental songs of his country. He
had become a very disreputable embodiment of them. His was the face of
a man who had wedded, and been mastered by, the vague and neurasthenic
heroine of the popular lyrical fancy; from constant intercourse with this
shade he had grown as nearly as he could make himself her ideal. With
his hat stuck over his eyes, his lips in a drunken and insolent pout,
his nose red, and an ironical scowl on his countenance, . . . he turned
in my direction, stretching out the hand with the umbrellas, and began
singing a patriotic song in lusty voice. . . . [H]is discourse [was]
full of what I supposed to be musicians' slang, confounded with thieves'
slang and Breton slang; the hiccups that engulfed so many of his phrases
and often ruined a whole train of thought . . . were only a few of the
disappointments to be met . . . [<I>WB,</I> 277].
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Here the empathy proper to the musical response reveals the same psychic
and social mechanism that Benda would describe nearly a decade later. Thus
Francis's fanciful marriage with the heroine of the song, following his
"constant intercourse with this shade," consummates the laws of physical
sympathy fundamental to acoustic experience. Presenting that response as
the femme fatale's "popular draw," moreover, Lewis draws a specifically
political situation. Such empathy through sound is the populist way of
feeling; it also binds the membership of Demos into an acoustic amalgam
and, like the national hymns heard by Benda, generates collective feeling
as a function of its own musical effect. Thus the singer Francis, exuding
the same "lusty" mood that compels his imaginative marriage with the
ballad bride, rides his "patriotic song" into radical union with his
conationals--and it is a lower order of nation, after all, that includes
"thieves' slang" in its national speech.

<P>
Reversing this current of empathic projection but preserving its social
meaning, Francis invites the same populist aggregate to abide within
him: he has "become a giant. . . . [N]ow that he is isolated everything
has come to inhabit him, and he feels

<B></B>

constantly in his spirit the throbbing of multitudes" (<I>WB,</I>
279-80). Thus the modern political phenomenon of demotic gigantism
whirls around an empty center; this vacant intraindividual space craves
such bogus relationships and expansions as musical empathy makes all
too easy and available.

<P>
Remarkable for the new virulence of its depiction of the aural, "Le
P&egrave;re Fran&ccedil;ois" moderates its invective only to serve the
needs of exposition, which links this musical character to the methods
and emblems of demotic solidarity. Once Lewis has recognized the social
meanings of aural empathy, moreover, he exhibits a categorical antipathy
to it. Thus lyrical fellow-feeling provokes a distaste that annuls all of
Lewis's earlier ambiguities about the acoustic experience. Indeed, the
political content of this aesthetic event decisively turns the course
of his development, for "Fran&ccedil;ois" anticipates the substance of
the author's mature social critique.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>

<P>
The difference this political perception makes in the typical
mise-en-sc&egrave;ne of Lewisian comedy may be found in a particular
passage in "Fran&ccedil;ois," one that recasts the incident of an
earlier story in view of the political import newly found in the comic
action. (The unitary character of these stories was reinforced by their
appearance in but two magazines: the first three [1909] in Ford Madox
Hueffer's <I>The English Review;</I> the next three [1910] in <I>The
Tramp.</I>) Thus "Fran&ccedil;ois" includes a pointed reference to "A
Breton Innkeeper," the piece published immediately before it. Here Lewis
compares the musical antics of the Franciscan, cryptically but knowingly,
with those of the concierge. Invoking Roland as Francis's "like," the
author gestures at a particular scene in which the innkeeper, seen in
the company of street boys--like Francis in the matching passage--matches
the "ceaseless dramatic effervescence" (<I>WB,</I> 279) of the priest. A
juxtaposition of the two texts shows Lewis angling his later reference
to point up the specifically political nature of Roland's musical antics:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
Roland is like one of those "eccentric musicians," as they are called,
that tear about in front of a row of different sized bottles, playing
"Rule Britannia" with inconceivable agility. His perpetual verbosity and
ubiquity are appalling. Rather than relapse into anything approaching
calm, he will talk to his own wife, or to a little ragged boy that has
stopped in the street to stare at the boy in buttons. He is capable of
banging on the back of a saucepan or rattling the dishes to "keep things
going." [<I>WB,</I> 271]

The P&egrave;re Fran&ccedil;ois and his like spend their lives in a
ceaseless dramatic effervescence. Their furious gestures, their dark
sayings and invectives, are as harmless as the vacant menace of lonely
and excited little boys, who occasionally take some notice of one in the
streets. The only difference is that the children are conventional and
romantic, whereas his impersonations are often of the most blood-curdling
realism. You will find a beggar ranting in some Paris street, and with
fiery exclamations he will be exciting an imaginary and sanguinary mob
to revolution; or he will lash the watching people with his scorn like
some misunderstood and outraged leader, and, rushing off, will constantly
turn and shout his threats and reproaches at them from afar, as though
he were leaving some doomed city. At the next street corner a fresh
crowd will gather at his eccentric mutterings. [<I>WB,</I> 279]

In a nationalist lyric like "Rule Britannia," the collectivizing effects
of music are channeled to their predictable political ends, but this
theme holds no conceptual focus for Lewis yet. An unclaimed inference,
it is passed over, lost to the very headlong fancy of the simile that
generates it. Two months later, this gay charade has darkened into an
augury of the political truths Lewis has lately and grimly grasped. He
exploits it accordingly. As Francis's "like," then, the formerly
innocuous bottle-player moves as one with this ignorant but sinister
mountebank, and into the arena of real political theater, where the
demagogue's vocal music consolidates the crowd and magnetizes its members
to himself. And that is no laughing--or ludic--matter. The earlier sense
of the ludicrous--a boisterous laughing with the wild body of comedy, a
participatory fun with the comic automaton playing his harmless bottle
music--dissolves into a repugnance at the dangerous political prepotence
of such performance and sympathetic participation: Francis prompts only
disdain; ridicule is the sign and mode of our response.

<P>
The treatises on comedy that Lewis composed later in his career, then,
show the palimpsest-like character of his developed thinking on the
subject: a layering of varied--and conflicting--emphases on vitalist
empathy and satirical distance. It is thus especially interesting to
recover a first tract, a piece written just slightly ahead of the moment
of political perception that would complicate the primary model. This is
an essay published in the <I>New Age</I> in May 1910: "<I>Our</I> Wild
Body." My emphasis here points to its signal difference from "<I>The</I>
Wild Body," where the definite article carries that later strain toward
objectivity and distanced regard. For in May 1910 Lewis still views the
Wild Body as a collective possession and the experience of comedy that it
centers and generates as a game played in common, a sport of the social
<I>corpus.</I> Indeed, this 1910 essay is so borne along by the spirit
of corporate fun that it scarcely steps aside to characterize as humor
the experience it valorizes, but the nature and behavior of the energy
he extols here clearly belong to the genre of comedy.

<P>
The essay seeks to recover and legitimate a sense of bodily vitality by
contrasting the healthy attitudes of Continentals, mainly the French,
to the defensive inhibitions of the English. The bodily behavior of
the French is not idealized beyond the bounds of the comic--their energy
resembles Roland's, a type of the laughable automaton--but the playfulness
and easy communion Lewis finds between the actors here announces the
ludic, empathic character of the fun. The genteel buffoonery of these
French bodies is mellowed, moreover, through its fellowship with the
French mind, which ingratiates them to each other and to us:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
[The French bourgeois] will . . . establish a playful and more
intimate relation between your respective persons--to glory in
their warmth and fitness, to slap you on the shoulders, to take your
arm in his hand. . . . This will not in the least detract from the
severe and dignified attitude of your two minds, and their sentimental
intercourses. The Frenchman regards our bodies as children, and when the
minds, like the two fathers, have become friendly, it seems natural to
him that the bodies also should become better acquainted and have their
little sport. [<I>WB,</I> 251-52]

The comic marriage of blood and brain that Lewis intimates here
is consummated in the summary praise of the French as one of "those
vivacious and thoughtful races, for whom life is <I>game</I>" (emphasis
added), and for whom

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
such a monstrous growth as this universal life of sport [the English
mind's denial of <I>corpus ludens</I> in the discipline of body-building]
. . . would be impossible and above all unnecessary. This division weakens
both life and play. But it is in our case meant as a blow at life, to
divide life's forces. Art is only worth anything when the artist is as
vulnerable in it as in his body. [<I>WB,</I> 254]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Annulling the opposition he will later drive between the laughing observer
and the laughable object, Lewis declares an essential reciprocity between
himself as author of comedy and its wild body, presumably his own--a
synergy once again empowered through the (French) sense of play. And
with the same value in mind he rewrites the typical scene of Bergsonian
comedy here, deploying the orange peel for the comic automaton to slip
on but falling together with the victim: "Often walking beside some man,
nervous and exasperated, and silently imputing to him the whole gamut of
stupidity and meanness, have you not felt that . . . should you slip by
chance on a piece of orange peel, catch at him instinctively, drag him
down with you on the ground, and roll about a bit with him, all would
be well?" (<I>WB,</I> 252) Ludicrousness, in the full sense of that
word, shapes Lewis's early understanding of comedy, and the admission
of openness and vulnerability that attend it stand in sharp contrast to
the ridicule later professed, through the persona of the Enemy, in his
brandishing of the satirist's armored hide.

The revisions Lewis performed on the stories he republished in 1927
are informed centrally and crucially by the political lesson first
adduced in "Le P&egrave;re Fran&ccedil;ois," in 1910. Even at that
early date, this lesson provided him the vantage, as we have seen, for
significant revision of previous stories, by enabling him to read the
political character of the demagogic Franciscan back into the apparently
innocuous capers of Roland. His later adjustments essentially repeat that
procedure. He extends the recognition first limned in "Fran&ccedil;ois,"
applies it retroactively, and continues to shift the essential tenor
of comedy from the ludicrous to the ridiculous. To place his later work
on a developmental continuum with the earlier, moreover, is to subjoin
its apparent mastery to those difficult beginnings. The ambiguities
revolving around musical and vitalist empathy with the Wild Body beget
fresh complexities, but he moves these toward resolution in the harsh
solvent of the political convictions first expressed in "Fran&ccedil;ois."

<P>
Rewriting "Le P&egrave;re Fran&ccedil;ois" as "Franciscan Adventures,"
Lewis simply takes the earlier political intuitions up a discursive
level, fixing generic tags on the populist musician, whose experience
now typifies the values of post-Revolutionary, populist,

<B></B>

"Republican France" (<I>WB,</I> 121): he is a "sickly re of early
republican romance" (<I>WB,</I> 129). The pre-"Fran&ccedil;ois" stories
must undergo more extensive revision, however, because these sustain
ambiguities about acoustic empathy that are simply intolerable now. Thus
Lewis seeks to write equivocation out of these stories, to this purpose
showing a striking singlemindedness. His target in "Les Saltimbanques"
is the players' musical complicity with their audience. These exchanges,
contested but necessary in 1909, showed Lewis conceding his own part in
the verbal and acoustic milieu; his later revision, however, takes back
that concession. Thus the musical soothing of the public beast no longer
provides the show in the retitled piece, "The Cornac and His Wife," where
the action seems to revert to the acrobatics suggested by the original
heading, "Les Saltimbanques":

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

Whenever one of these monsters was met with, which on an average was twice
a day, the only means of escape for the unfortunate family was to charm
it. Conduct involving that never failed to render the monster harmless
and satisfied. Then they would hurry on, until they met another. Then
they would repeat just the same thing over again, and once more hasten
away, boiling with resentment. [<I>WB,</I> 92]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This silencing of a formerly musical relationship coincides with a newly
virulent antipathy to the public, asserted by the author through his
players. The urgent need to distance themselves from the audience signals
a repressed but unforgotten connection, a linkage primarily acoustic;
it is most forcibly recalled when most strenuously repressed: "Had you
suggested to the Showman that the Public paid for an idea, <I>something
it drew out of itself,</I> that would have been a particularly repugnant
thought." (<I>WB,</I> 93; emphasis added) "Particularly repugnant" to
the Showman (the author's provisional double) in 1927 is a thought
Lewis presented with eloquence and imaginative penetration in 1909,
when he heard the rhythms and movements of the public's own inner
vitalism--something it drew out of itself--echoing back through the
sounds made by the players: a perfect paradigm of acoustic empathy. Now
infected with political meanings, this formerly musical union survives
only as an uneasy memory, a residual irritant--a sore point for the
author no less than his Showman.

<P>
Behind the circuit of acoustic connection that Lewis esteemed earlier
lay the residual pull of the harsh music of Breton speech, and so it
seems appropriate, in conclusion, to revisit that scene of primary
edification and chart the evolution of attitudes toward its appeals. In
the early account of Bretonic speech in "Les Saltimbanques" ,
Lewis's narrator echoes the bracing appreciation made in the 1908
diary fragment, repeating its conceit. This vocal music appears to be
alternately excited and imperturbable; it displays the odd but exciting
combination of spontaneous vitalism and controlled mechanism. He expands
that paradox, too, as he hears the speakers grasping vibrant life at its
most intense--that is, at its most predetermined, automatic, fatalistic:

<P>
In the 1927 revision, however, Lewis's Showman stands "before a
congregation of Hodges, who could not even express themselves in
the metropolitan tongue, but gibbered in breton, day in, day out"
(<I>WB,</I> 92).

<P>
In "Franciscan Adventures," similarly, the author revokes his
early fascination with a passion more exacting than his earlier
appreciation. Here he alters his former excitements both in letter
and spirit, casting the very terms of his first infatuation (emphasized
here)--the paradoxical but pleasing medley of vitalism and mechanism--into
labels of evident "scorn" for the Breton priest: "I examined this old
song-bird with scorn. <I>Monotonous passion,</I> stereotyped into a
<I>frenzied machine,</I> he irritated me like an aimlessly howling
wind. . . . What emotions had this <I>automaton</I> experienced before
he accepted outcast life?" (<I>WB,</I> 121; emphases added) Accordingly,
Francis acts out a clarifying parody of his own provincial speech, both
defining and mocking the halt-and-rush rhythms that, at least in the
mouths of other speakers, have held Lewis in their thrall: "He would
stop, and with an indrawn wheeze or a quick gasp, fetch it back as it was
escaping. Then he would burst out violently again into a heaving flux of
song" (<I>WB,</I> 120). This dramatic invective goes back to 1910 and the
decisive moment of "Le P&egrave;re Fran&ccedil;ois," where Lewis first
recognized the political meanings of acoustic empathy. It is there that
the sweet severity of Bretonic speech first goes sour. In "Franciscan
Adventures" the enlivening abruptions of the Breton dialect produce a sad
caricature in Francis, who turns its angular frisson into this blithering
staccato, staggering through his own comic prosody of discontinuity:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

quote them <I>&agrave; propos</I> of something with which they had no

or enthusiastic man would do, he boldly uttered it, taking it as a text
for a new discourse, until another one turned up to bring what was often
its most astounding career to an abrupt end. [<I>WB,</I> 282]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
From the start the harsh music of that coastal dialect provided Lewis
a type and model of vitalist laughter; its severe percussiveness was
at one with the stabbing gestures of its mirth. Thus the narrator in
"Les Saltimbanques" actually roots the patterns of local speech in the
raucous laughter of the place:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
One sees in the Breton peasant a constant tendency to sarcasm. Their
hysterical and monotonous voices are always pitched in a strain of fierce
raillery and abuse. But this does not infect their mirth. Their laughter
is forced and meant to be wounding, and with their grins and quips they
are like armed men who never meet without clashing their swords together.

In 1927, however, that savage panoply of armored mirth is stained with
a diminutive regard; its terrible beauty is changed, utterly, in the
final assessment Lewis adds to the revised version:

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
You see in the peasant of Brittany and other primitive districts of
France a constant tendency to sarcasm. Their hysterical and monotonous
voices--a variety of the "celtic" screech--are always with the Bretons
pitched in a strain of fierce raillery and abuse. But this does not affect
their mirth. Their laughter is sharp and mirthless and designed usually
to wound. With their grins and quips they are like armed men who never
meet without clashing their weapons together. Were my circus-proprietor
and his kind not so tough, this continual howl or disquieting explosion
of what is scarcely mirth would shatter them. [<I>WB,</I> 101]
<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Removing his Showman-counterpart (his own "kind") from vital contact with
the audience, and withdrawing his earlier benediction on the "primitive
wisdom" of their vocal culture, Lewis measures the difference of his
later estrangement most dramatically in his refusal to admit that such
laughter is mirth at all.

<P>
Has a theory of humor been confused or clarified in this process of
change? Lewis mounted his challenge to the Bergsonian model of comedy
from a Gourmontian platform, but he built it on the shifting sands of
that littoral dialect. Yes, he reduced those coastal speakers to creatures
of oral (and aural) habit; these mechanisms, apparently irreversible and
insurmountable, defied the humanist hope in Bergson's vision of redemptive
laughter. Yet the residual thrall of the vocal music of Brittany led
Lewis to thrill at the very mechanical vitality he would abuse. The
political perception of 1910 at least fuses his comic philosophy to its
object of rebuke, the oral automaton, who receives no quarter now. Human
music, an instrument of empathy and the detested social collectivism,
offers the <I>far&ccedil;eur</I> a target unmisted by fancy--the Celtic
twilight of Lewis's own youthful muse. From a history as contrary as
his, however, no literary theory stands free and clear. When he sets
out the mature conception of humor in the essays collected in <I>The
Wild Body,</I> then, he retains the twists and inconsistencies of this
development and, in this way, confirms the lasting importance of its
opening moment: the abiding role of the vocal culture of Brittany and his
obsessive engagement with--and against--the empathic response it prompts.

Absurd," <I>Enemy News</I> 15 (winter 1982): 23-25. The critical
literature on modernist comedy is far from extensive. A fairly standard
assumption is that modernism and comedy, at least in the traditional
sense, are antithetical. This view is put forward by Laura Mooneyham,
"Comedy Among the Modernists: P. G. Wodehouse and the Anachronism of Comic
Form," <I>Twentieth Century Literature</I> 40 (spring 1994): 114-38,
where the conventional comic rhythm of problem and reprieve is seen
to belong to a vision of life no longer tenable. The main problem with
this view is of course the undeclared assumption that there is a single
sensibility in modernism; it seems more helpful to think of individual
variations of certain basic premises about comedy.

Wagner, <I>Wyndham Lewis,</I> 230. That Lewis represents no significant
reorientation of Bergson's comic philosophy is the argument repeated
frequently by Wagner, 215-30.

The modern intellectual culture of <I>id&eacute;ologie</I> is set out in
the introductory chapter of my <I>Ezra Pound, Wyndham Lewis, and Radical
Modernism</I> (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 9-42. In
the present essay I develop this background toward an idea of the comic
not advanced in that study, where the chapter on Lewis focuses nearly
exclusively on his political and fictional writing in the years between
the two world wars.

That Lewis knew the work of de Gourmont and Benda (and Georges Sorel)
during his Paris years is an assertion made without proof by Jeffrey
Meyers, <I>The Enemy: A Biography of Wyndham Lewis</I> (London: Routledge
and Kegan Paul, 1980), 15-16; on this question it is important to
note that Frederick Tarr, the Englishman and double of Lewis in Paris in
<I>Tarr,</I> moves almost exclusively through a community of expatriates
and makes virtually no contact with local French intellectual culture,
let alone the signal res named by Meyers.

Lewis discusses this work in 1935 in "Beginnings" (<I>WB,</I>
373-74), where he claims it as his first piece of fictional writing;
it was left unpublished in 1909, possibly because it had not reached
completion, and it appeared only in 1927. I believe the story to have
been unrevisable at that later date. It had to appear as initially
conceived, in line with the intensities and enthusiasms of that early
moment: the absolute centrality not only of the death fetish but of the
acoustic sublime in that re made this piece unamenable to the sort
of revision Lewis carried out on other early stories.
