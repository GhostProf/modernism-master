<p id="lead">

From the time of his appointment at the Salpêtrière Women's Hospice, Paris, in 1862 through to his death in 1893, Dr. Jean-Martin Charcot lectured in neurological diseases, pathological anatomy, geriatrics and other topics. Charcot's famous lessons on hysterioepileptic seizure and hypnotic automatism drew the most public attention. His presentations as a whole though focused on less dramatic conditions such as complications of gait and locomotor coordination (ataxia, sclerosis in plaques, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Charcot's work has elicited considerable attention from feminists and historians of hysteria and gender, medical historians, literary critics, photographic historians and others.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  While commentators typically acknowledge the theatrical quality of Charcot's presentations, there has been no sustained analysis of what this constituted, the significance of this theatricalism, or its precise nature. The accounts which appeared in the contemporary lay and medical press however demonstrate that Charcot was almost as well known for the aesthetic style of his presentations as he was for their specific content. An examination 

<b></b>

 of what this style was, how it functioned, as well as its strengths and weaknesses, is therefore overdue. While the transgressive nature of hysterical symptomatology has since become a truism of the historiography, the discursive transgressions embodied within Charcot's own <i>demonstrative technique</i>—a technique which he applied to all of the diseases he described, from goitre through to epilepsy—has not been acknowledged. It is this topic addressed below. </p>

<p>Charcot's chosen field of neurology was a new branch of medicine. His focus on the dynamic function of the body in time and space forced Charcot to find new ways to represent these essentially <i>performative</i> disorders.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  The need for a novel form of medical representation and analysis brought the work of Charcot and his associates dangerously close to theatrical and para-theatrical aesthetics via the creation of a new multi-media style whose dynamically embodied, live form echoed that of the living, neurological body which was its subject. Charcot was an accomplished dramaturge whose refusal to employ elaborate rhetorical flourishes within his personal presentation constituted in itself a highly mannered performance of rationalist, scientific authority. A close study of the discourse which surrounds Charcot's work reveals that this project contained within it the possibility for inversion, with Charcot's "science" being read as a form of implicitly fictional "theatre," more closely allied to such sensationalistic precedents as Étienne-Gapsard Robertson's phantasmagoria of the 1780s, than to the secure, Positivist propriety which French medicine otherwise sought to project.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  Spectators such as Platel perceived this formal contradiction, likening the neuropathologist's presentations to the arational, melodramatic aesthetics advocated by various dramaturges like Richard Wagner and others. </p>

<p>Charcot presented two distinct lecture series. There was the fully-prepared, afternoon, <i>vendredi</i> (Friday) lessons, offered as part of the Faculty of Medicine courses. The second was the morning, <i>mardi</i> (Tuesday) lessons—in addition to other less formalised presentations [<a href="#1">re 1</a>].<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  Each lasted for approximately two hours: slightly longer than a short play.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Charcot and others emphasised the improvised nature of the <i>mardi</i> stream, in which he interviewed subjects who had ostensibly been chosen that morning from the clinical admissions of the hospice (<i>la policlinique</i>).<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  A comparison of the published lectures from both streams, the patients who appeared, and Charcot's detailed notes however shows that the "improvised" quality of the <i>mardi</i> presentations was considerably exaggerated. 

<b></b>

 In both cases, Charcot's speech closely corresponded with his notes, which he recited from memory, and both covered similar topics and used much the same theatrical machinery (slides, casts and so on).<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  The distinction between the two streams was therefore primarily a matter of their rhetorical framing. In both situations, Charcot consciously strove to manipulate the dramaturgy to best serve his aims. Charcot may not have actually plunged "right in" and proceeded "just as I do in my own practice" before the eyes of the audience at his <i>mardi</i> lectures. He nevertheless successfully maintained the <i>illusion</i> that this was what he did.</p>

<p>Sigmund Freud (who studied at the Salpêtrière 1885–1886) was particularly impressed by this aspect of the neuropathologist's pedagogy.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Freud observed that Charcot portrayed the true difficulties of clinical practice in the latter's more informal lessons. This was not the "Dogmatic" Charcot of the <i>vendredi</i> lessons, but rather a highly skilled yet humble physician, visible in all his fallibility. If the Friday lectures represented the summit of medical scenography, then the Tuesday demonstrations offered a glimpse into the more problematic, haphazard backstage world of actual diagnostic practice. The <i>mardi</i> presentations functioned through a process of deliberately crafted demystification, akin to Bertolt Brecht's later articulation of <i>gestic</i> theatre or the defamiliarisation of the theatrical process as aid to the conscious, rationalist understanding of causes 

<b></b>

 (<i>gestus</i>).<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Just as the patients' diseases were only fully manifest in real time, open to the exigencies of the moment yet nevertheless following a predictable pattern known to the physician, the same was true of Charcot's own discourse. </p>

<p>The use of curial terms such as "Dogmatic" and <i>"ex cathedra"</i> by Charcot and Freud gave the lectures an aura akin to a respectful community of shared worship—in this case to the god of rationalist science. As Freud put it, Charcot: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>would put aside his authority on occasion and admit—in one case that he could arrive at no diagnosis and in another that he had been deceived by appearances; and he never appeared greater to his audience than when, by giving the most detailed account of his processes of thought and by showing the greatest frankness about his doubts and hesitations, he had thus sought to narrow the gulf between teacher and pupil.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->





<p class="continued">By showing "his doubts and hesitations," the professor transformed both himself and science itself into res comparable to the heroes of classical tragic theatre: protagonists aware of their own limited, human powers, and hence heroic. Charcot crafted himself as an immensely sympathetic character, narrowing "the gulf between teacher and pupil"; between the papal chair (<i>cathedra</i>) and the seated congregation in "his audience." </p>

<p>Charcot's performance style therefore effected a double movement: it demonstrated the awesome powers of modern science at mastering the mysteries of the nervous tissues while simultaneously rendering visible the fraught, provisional nature of scientific truth and medical diagnosis. Charcot's theatre was at once seductive in its impressive theatrical display of scientific praxis, while simultaneously reminding the spectators that the fundamental principles upon which neurological dramaturgy was based were accessible to all with proper training. </p>

<p>The lecture theatre provided the ideal site for the dissemination of knowledge about the living, moving body. Public presentations alone were nevertheless not sufficient to establish an academic career. One of the problems facing Charcot and his fellow neurologists was how to transfer their work into <i>textual</i> form. </p>

<p>Salpêtrière <i>chef de clinique</i> Joseph François Felix Babinski provided the most detailed discussion of the difficulties involved in putting Charcot's lectures onto the page. In his "Preface" to Charcot's published Tuesday lessons, Babinski related that a 

<b></b>

 Viennese student was disappointed by a visit he made to the clinic of a famous German physician. The German did not appear to have "a single original" unpublished "idea" and that "reading his books" was "enough to know him." The German was most likely Ernest Kraepelin, while the Viennese student may have been Freud. The Viennese narrator implied that the medical techniques which Charcot dramatised within the Tuesday lessons defied written documentation. To fully "know" Charcot and his method one had to personally attend the lectures. Babinski continued that: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>It is for these … reasons that MM. Blin, Charcot <i>fils,</i> and [Henri] Colin . . . have thought . . . that publishing these Tuesday lessons would be a significant service . . . It will be greeted with the greatest satisfaction by those who have attended the classes and happily can relive them.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->





<p class="continued">Babinski nevertheless remained reluctant to concede that a close transcription of Charcot's <i>mardi</i> lessons could displace the authorial presence and medical knowledge which Charcot developed through theatrical presence. Babinski concluded that: "Without replacing the speech of the professor, the reading of these new lessons permits everyone . . . to better know the ideas of <i>le maître</i> and to broaden their own [understanding of them], as the Viennese doctor thought."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  The text did not therefore replace the professor's voice; rather it <i>supplemented</i> it, expanding (<i>"d'élargir"</i>) both his ideas and the circle of his acolytes. Lecture-scripts remained an imperfect record of pedagogic performance, just as the textual description of the cadaver was an imperfect record of dynamic, living neurophysiology. </p>

<p>The disappointment of the Viennese doctor echoes Jacques Derrida's model of phonological discourse.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  So long as authority was closely tied to the thoughts and opinions of a single, phenomenologically real author—as was the case during the nineteenth century—the written text served primarily to register traces of an <i>absent</i> authority and an absent body. Only the author could (literally) breathe life into the text by speaking its words. This was particularly true of Charcot's discourse, where the subject of his speech was embodied neurological behaviour. Not only was Charcot's own authority made physically manifest by his presence as a speaker, but so also was the subject of his discourse enacted and performed by patients through movement. There was therefore a close parallel between how one gained access to the topic of Charcot's discourse itself (watching the patient perform), and how one gained access to Charcot's own discourse (listening to the author speak). </p>

<p>As Charcot himself explained, his purpose in delivering his lectures was: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>to place before your eyes anatomical specimens with which you are able to study the imperfections revealed by the naked eye. In their absence, I will present you with plates . . . No doubt a good plate, no matter how faithful it is, can never completely replace the direct contemplation of the diseased organ; but . . . since one is able to hold [the plate] always before one's eyes, it offers the advantage of quickly and efficaciously fixing one's memories which fade quickly if one does not have the opportunity of frequently reviving them.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup> 

<b></b></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">

 Charcot's discourse put into relief the very tensions which he sought to overcome. Photography and illustration were characterised as both superior <i>and</i> inferior to the theatrical viewing of the living body. The neuropathologist extolled photography for enabling one to see that which was difficult to revive, while simultaneously conceding that images could only stand in for the body. Photographs acted merely as mnemonic aids. The photograph was able to remain "always before our eyes"—yet ideally so too would the body itself. Photography took over only "when one does not have the opportunity" to stage pathologies before one's eyes. The amphitheatre therefore served as the privileged but nevertheless ambiguous site for the genesis, authorship and dissemination of Charcot's discourse. Charcot's methodology remained inescapably theatrical, even in its <i>textual</i> representation. </p>

<p>In the words of Charcot's immediate successor to the chair of neurology, Fulgence Raymond, Charcot first carried out his own "mnemonic exercise" in learning the complete text of what he was to say. Following this: "That which was engraved in his mind, he set himself the task of penetrating into the minds of his listeners and engraving it there also."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>  Ultimately it was not the illustrated pages of Charcot's published texts that served as the primary site for the re-transcription of Charcot's lectures. Rather the minds of those present in the amphitheatre acted as the primary slate or <i>site of audience</i> for Charcot's medical pedagogy. As Charcot's former student Moses Allen Starr observed: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>It has been said that the whole clinic was arranged for theatrical effect. I believe that was the only manner in which it was possible to demonstrate in a clear light . . . all of the features, clinical and pathological, of the subject. But grant that it was theatrical; it left on the mind of the students a series of mental pictures of patients and of lessons which no amount of private study could possibly produce. It taught men so that they could not fail to remember.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">The arrangement of images and forms in space constituted a spectacular, mnemonic system similar to the theatre of memory advocated by Cicero and other classical rhetoricians.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  One recalled concepts through the logical placement of visual keys located within specific spaces found within a virtual, mental theatre. Starr and others felt that Charcot transposed the manifest dramaturgy of the physical demonstrations onto the immaterial architecture of the audience's psyche—"it left on the mind of the students a series of mental pictures" such that "they could not fail to remember." </p>

<p>The venue within which lectures of both streams were eventually held was designed to meet Charcot's needs.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>  A theatre was built at the Salpêtrière for Charcot's lectures and it was in use by 1880.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>  Audience members entered at the rear and descended from the back row, filling the seating from the front. Grand, lavishly decorated structures in the style of Renaissance dissection theatres were still employed at institutions such as the Paris Medical Faculty building.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Charcot's venue though was not in fact a true amphitheatre, nor did it feature any superfluous adornments. It was rather a long rectangular hall, more akin to a spartan performing arts building than a conventional anatomy theatre [<a href="#2">res 2</a>—4]. If one removed the proscenium arch found at sites such as the modest <i>Théâtre Libre</i> (founded by modernist dramaturg André Antoine and supported by Charcot's former student Léon Daudet) one would have had a comparable space.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  X from <i>Les annales politiques et littéraires</i> somewhat melodramatically described the auditorium as follows:<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>The amphitheatre is a long room, of which perhaps one half is occupied by tiers. All of the windows are hermetically sealed and locked. Not a ray of daylight comes in to pierce . . . the dark light of the gas lamps with their frosted globes. The high walls painted in red give this light a special quality . . . in the other part of the room [on the stage itself], several rows of chairs face in upon themselves [i.e. in a semi-circle], surrounding a modest space, reserved for the professor, his subjects and his aides; two little tables with a few instruments for electricisation, demonstration illustrations, a large blackboard, this is the entire <i>mise en scène.</i><sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->





<p class="continued">Although the space had a claustrophobic air, it was not entirely "sealed," as X put it. Heavy coverings were fitted to the windows. Starr noted that it was only "After the audience had gathered" that the "dark shutters were closed at the windows, the footlights were turned up, and the clinic began." He added that "sometimes, when a particular feature had to be demonstrated, a calcium light"—or limelight—"was turned on the patient, whose re" became "the chief point of light in the darkness" and consequently "could always be perfectly seen by all."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Many commentators echoed Starr in extolling the modernity of the amphitheatre's stage machinery. The venue was fitted with various equipment not uncommon at theatre venues and magic lantern displays since the 1850s. Charcot's main innovation was the introduction of these mechanisms within the specific context of <i>medical</i> display. The lighting for example was controlled by a central dimmer which enabled Charcot to darken the foyer, a convention which Antoine later pioneered at the <i>Théâtre de l'Odéon.</i><sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Electrical slide projections and limelight spots could then be deployed to full effect. As Starr explained, this rendered the demonstration subject "the chief point of light in the darkness."<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  Charcot seems to have used Léon Laurent's relatively novel design for an electrically-powered "megascope" or slide projector (and not a limelight- or gas-powered magic lantern; <a href="#5">re 5</a>), thus adding a more explicit level of modernity to his otherwise piecemeal use of theatrical tools and new technologies.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The descriptions of journalists such as Pont-Calé from <i>Les hommes d'aujourd'hui</i> and of X, as well as that of Starr, indicated that the lighting of the space overall had

a dismal, high-relief, almost Gothic tone. Even when natural light was allowed into the room, the dark colour of the walls tended to absorb it, rather than diffusing it throughout the venue. Pont-Calé opined that: "The high walls painted in red lend their own gloomy note to that obscurity."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  When the directional lighting of the floor lamps and spots was deployed, however, the objects captured by the glare took on a harsh, bleached aspect, leaping forward within the viewer's depth of field. Platel similarly found the lighting extremely bright and consistent with the anatomical style of the lecture presentations themselves: "The smallest details of the scene are beaten into tiny fragments [<i>découpés à l'emporte-pièces</i>], under the bluish steam and rawness of the gas."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Charcot's stage machinery tended therefore to cast the body into a stark, high-contrast relief, vividly demarcating the shadows from illuminated clarity. Light took on a poetic function, rendering illness visibly comprehensible and banishing darkness to the margins of the space.</p>

<p>One notable concession to decoration within this harsh, gloomy ambience ("the only adornment in the room," as one author put it) was located on the wall behind the stage.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  This was Robert Fleury's salon painting <i>Pinel déliverant les aliénées de la Salpêtrière de leur chaînes</i> (1876; <a href="#6">re 6</a>)—an iconographic model which André Brouillet paraphrased in his own, later salon painting of Charcot: <i>Une leçon clinique à la Salpêtrière</i> (1887; <a href="#1">re 1</a>). The presence of Fleury's painting in the amphitheatre helped to establish a metaphoric link between the pioneering work carried out at the Salpêtrière after the Revolution by the alienist Phillippe Pinel, with Charcot's later, more anatomically-based discourse.<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>  Excepting this iconographic set-piece, the unadorned

<p class="continued">

aesthetic of Charcot's theatre was consistent with the project of rationalism itself, being stripped back of superfluous details so as to reveal fundamental truths caught in the bright light of science. This was moreover notably different from the ambience created by the neo-classical ornamentation at the Faculty of Medicine amphitheatre. </p>

<p>As noted above, long wooden benches rested on tiered seating banks extending from the rear wall of the Salpêtrière amphitheatre, which tapered off at the front with an extended apron one step above the floor itself, before which sat the stage. The seating at the front consisted of nine or more rows of approximately ten to twelve unfixed chairs, which could be added to, subtracted from or moved as circumstances dictated [<a href="#2">res 2</a>—4]. The seats furthest forward were often used by the <i>chefs de clinique.</i> On some occasions: "On the slightly raised stage with the <i>chef de clinique</i> appeared some favoured spectators, placed near the actors as in the past were the <i>grands seigneurs</i> at the theatre."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  Charcot often delivered his text from a seated position—literally <i>"ex cathedra"</i>—or stood side-on, his much commented upon likeness to Napoleon clearly visible in profile. The patients sat slightly behind him on the stage, illuminated by foot lights or adjustable spots.<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>   </p>

<p>Charcot's audience was typically mixed, with students and physicians joined by foreign guests, res from the <i>École des beaux-arts,</i> artists, actors, authors, socialites, journalists and politicians.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Notable spectators included Freud, Jules Clarétie (a friend of Charcot, former medical student and administrator of the <i>Comédie Française</i>), the professor of artistic anatomy at the <i>École,</i> Mathias Duval, senior Republican politician Léon Gambetta and his protégé René Waldeck-Rosseau, writers and dramaturges such as Léon and Alphonse Daudet, Émile Zola, Paul Arène, Guy de Maupassant, Edmond de Goncourt, and other intellectuals such as Hippolyte Taine, Emile Durkheim and Henri Bergson. The lectures were not completely open to the public. Most observers obtained an introduction of some kind, though visiting Glasgow physician Jane Henderson simply walked in off the street after asking for directions.<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>  The audience was nevertheless drawn predominantly from the same well-to-do society within which the Salpêtrière physicians themselves circulated.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  Female medical students, <i>mondaines</i> and actresses such as Sarah Bernhardt (who toured the wards of the Salpêtrière) also constituted a highly visible minority, with several commentators disparagingly drawing attention to their presence—notably Charcot's disgruntled former student Axel Munthe.<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>  For Munthe and others, the very audience at Charcot's lectures caused the neurologist's work to too closely approximate a theatrical performance. </p>

<p>Charcot was a creature of habit in both his personal and professional life. The lessons began punctually and conserved a high degree of standardisation in general format. Anticipating a prompt commencement—as well as competition for seating—spectators often arrived over thirty minutes early.<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>  Charcot's famed indifference to elaborate expressions of politeness and his cultivated "mask" of objectivity gave the proceedings a powerfully ritualised character—akin to a religious or Masonic ceremony—which reporters commented upon.<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>  X for example noted that expectant audience members would talk amongst themselves, when "a door is brusquely opened, the murmur ceases, all eyes turn towards the master."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>  <i>Les hommes d'aujourd'hui</i> recorded that after 

<b></b>

 this: "The master moves forward with a slightly heavy step, followed by a cortege of students, the legendary aprons"—part of the physicians' uniform—"tied about their waists."<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  Senior medics like Charcot or the head of the Salpêtrière electrotherapy unit, Romain Vigouroux, often further reinforced their institutional standing through their costume with the addition of their academic caps. This opening procession was arrayed according to medical seniority. First came Charcot, then the heads of the specialist departments at the Salpêtrière (ophthalmology, photography, histology, hydrotherapy, electrotherapy), any special guests, the general <i>chefs de clinique,</i> interns and then the undergraduate externs and those who tended to the patients on a day-to-day basis.<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>  This opening display of medical hierarchy constituted a mutually supportive, physical reiteration of authority. The credentials visible in the entrance helped authorise the lecture series, which in turn bolstered the power and hierarchy of the medics themselves. The procession rendered in moving flesh the status of the Salpêtrière as a "neuro-pathological Institute," made up of various specialist facilities.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>  </p>

<p>The diseased subjects were the last to enter. Henderson observed that the "patients who are to form the text of the clinical lecture" waited in an anteroom off-stage, or "behind screens till the time comes for them to come forward," at which point they shuffled out or were "carried and deposited on chairs."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Illustrations show that decorated Chinese screens such as were common in fashionable Parisian homes were used for this purpose, with these stage elements doubtless brought in from one of the doctors' offices near the amphitheatre (most likely Charcot's; <a href="#7">re 7</a>).<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>  Like the screens behind which they were sequestered, the patients remained essentially inactive sculptural elements within Charcot's dramaturgy, worked upon rather than constituting active participants. As historian Christopher Goetz observes: <i>"Charcot treated the patient like an inert object in the laboratory,"</i> frequently speaking "in front of the patients as though he was speaking in front of cadavers."<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>  Charcot's presentations were therefore theatrically closer to monologues, such as was the typical form of address for contemporary magic lantern demonstrations, than they were to the dialogic form of most theatre. </p>

<p>Through such methods, the performing body was ordered and contained, its theatrical possibilities rendered according to Charcot's model of rationalist <i>gestus.</i> The content and form of Charcot's lectures resembled in this sense what Tom Gunning and André Gaudreault have described in the case of the first showings of the Lumière brothers' filmic <i>actualités</i> as a "spectacle of attractions."<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>  At the Salpêtrière, the role of the lecturer-demonstrator—or <i>monstrator</i> in Gaudreault's terms—was to de-sensationalise, rationalise and discursively master the often shocking physical deformations and diseases which Charcot placed upon display.<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Daudet however made it clear with his monstrously carnal medical satire of <i>Les Morticoles</i>  that he did not accept Charcot's de-sensationalising model. Rather, he argued that lectures such as those of the Salpêtrière provided a licence for depraved, pseudo-medical theatricality. Within the novel, he related how a patient fell "to the ground screaming" before commencing the "disorderly gymnastics" which Charcot claimed constituted the chief diagnostic sign of hysteria. This performance caused 

<b></b>

 several audience members to "get up to see better. Others cry <i>Sit down!</i> and <i>Hat!</i> at a sign from his boss," Charcot's fictional assistant "stems the attack," after which the "thaumaturge continues," while some of the junior students in the lecture hall attempted to "choke back their laughter."<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>  Charcot and his peers were deemed by Daudet and his sympathisers to be unable to fully defuse the performativity inherent in such neuropsychological illnesses, particularly those most complicated, performative syndromes which fell under Charcot's care—namely hysterioepilepsy, Tourette's syndrome and chorea. For Daudet, Platel and others, Charcot was subsumed within the frame of his presentations, becoming a harsh, Wagnerian thaumaturge who instigated an absurd, chaotic, para-medical melodrama.</p>

<blockquote class="disp-quote-epigraph">
<p>Neither the rounded tones, nor the sonority, nor the beautiful cadences, all of the attractive qualities which Lasègue and Trousseau possessed to such a high degree. But how many of them had his colour and above all such clarity!</p>

	</div>	<!--CLOSE attrib-->

<p>Charcot's speech was not without its flourishes. His German peer Ernst von Leyden, for example, commended the neuropathologist's use of "such sharp, striking, living expressions, for example: <i>accentuated speech</i> [<i>parole scandée</i>], <i>stepping walk</i> [<i>marche steppante</i>]."<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>  Even more notable was what medical biographer A. Lubimoff called "the singular aptitude of M. Charcot" at "reproducing" illnesses through "gestures 

<b></b>

 and general appearance [<i>allure</i>]. In the pathetic moments, his voice had a timbre as attractive as a baritone making grave intonations."<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>  Other commentators went so far as to describe the neuropathologist as a "skilled scientific actor" on the basis of his ability "to show the gait characteristic of various nervous disorders, or describe with his hands different forms of choreiform movements."<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Although Charcot leavened his presentation with moments of accomplished physical and vocal mimesis, these periods of high drama constituted dynamic interjections within an overall sedate aesthetic in which such dramatic materials as hysterioepilepsy and gross deformity were calmly monstrated to the audience—diseases were simply shown and then verbally emplotted within Charcot's scientific discourse. To achieve this effect, Charcot generally eschewed dramatic or oratorical demonstrations of authority in his own deportment and speech. Charcot's leading student Georges Gilles de la Tourette, for example, reflected that as an undergraduate Charcot had initially performed poorly in oral examinations: "Nothing was less suited to Charcot's temperament than such oratorical jousting where high-sounding words replace arguments of a scientific order."<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>  The assessment of Charcot's performative temperament provided by later Salpêtrière neurologist Georges Guillain was also consistent with that of Tourette.<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>  Guillain noted that Charcot had a "horror of" exaggerated "emphasis," just as he despised: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>commonplaces. His language was slow, his diction impeccable; he did not use gestures and sat as much as he stood. His exposé was always remarkably clear.<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->





<p>Contemporary journalists also found Charcot's oratory modest. X reported of Charcot for example that: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>His voice is somewhat dull [<i>sourde</i>]; the speech is clear, precise, not meticulously arranged, sometimes slightly hesitant. But the master delays little in choosing words, he speaks simply, the elevation always comes from the subject.</p>
<p>With a few very short phrases, he poses the problem to be resolved, the question to be studied, and immediately introduced the living examples . . . one listens only to his voice, monotonous like that of a puppeteer of wax res<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">—these waxes being the closely-directed patients whom Charcot described. X felt that "the professor is self-effacing," tending to subside into the background and let the subject matter speak for itself: "he contents himself with being a great demonstrator."<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>  This meant that spectators rarely kept their eyes upon the neuropathologist, or even necessarily upon such attractions as his patients, but instead "one listens only to his voice," gazing about distractedly as one attended to this plain, disembodied monologue suffusing the space. </p>

<p>The importance of Charcot's <i>speech</i> over his physical <i>performance</i> or even his use of <i>images</i> was particularly emphasised in Henderson's account: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Charcot's voice was not at all strong, so that the raised seats were too far away [for it] to be appreciated, and the majority of the students came as near as possible to the front, 

<b></b>

 even although [sic] the view of the platform was apt to be obscured by the heads of those before them.<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">For these audience members, Charcot's slides, sketches and specimens were far less significant than his vocal text. Accounts such as these show that, despite Charcot's famous innovations in spectacular presentation (see below), his monstration was often judged to be primarily <i>aural</i> and <i>conceptual,</i> strongly in keeping with his uncompromisingly rationalist, Positivist stance, and in opposition to the more extravagant aesthetics of both the popular and the <i>beaux arts</i> entertainments of the period. </p>

<p>Charcot's authority was not attributable to the "attractive" qualities of either his vocal or linguistic expression itself. As Charcot's former student Paul-Aimé-Desiré Peugniez observed, Charcot lacked the oratorical skills for which Hôtel Dieu lecturer Armand Trousseau or Hospital Necker demonstrator Charles Lasègue were renowned. Charcot was in fact a slightly boring and banal presenter—his style echoing the unremitting, unalloyed truth he revealed. As Raymond noted, Charcot: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>appealed primarily by means of a language stripped of all useless research, but with a clarity of expression, in harmony with the clarity of the thinking . . . a language seductive in its simplicity, and where each word had its proper value.<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->





<p class="continued">Echoing both Raymond and Tourette, Platel ungenerously (but accurately) observed that: "He goes over his descriptions [<i>épithètes</i>] with his dull voice and drives the argument into the brain of his listeners, heavily and dully,—as one drives in a nail with a large block of wood."<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>  As X observed, the "elevation" came "from the subject," and not from Charcot's <i>performance.</i> </p>

<p>For these and other commentators, Charcot's presentation style was deemed superior to those of Lasègue and Trousseau because of its <i>lack</i> of rhetorical enhancements. Charcot's personal presentation constituted a form of deliberate <i>non-performance</i>—in the words of historian Georges Didi-Huberman, "a spectacle without <i>mise en scène"</i>—a performative technique which (ironically) established the very mastery which Charcot refused to overtly display.<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>  This created a clear dramaturgical distinction between Charcot and his more extroverted, mumbling, staggering or fitting patients. Charcot's theatrical framing was simultaneously spectacular yet banal, effecting a contradictory balance between artifice and science. </p>

<p>Charcot's most famous theatrical demonstration involved the differential identification of illnesses exhibiting symptomatic trembling. Charcot brought on stage patients suffering from paralysis agitans (Parkinson's disease), locomotor ataxia (tabes) and chorea. Raymond observed that: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>By various ingenious artifices, he sometimes amplified a symptom to produce specific characteristics . . . [including a] bizarre but instructive collection of trembling patients, provided with head gear terminating in long rods, and which Charcot presented . . . to demonstrate the oscillatory characteristics of the diverse varieties of tremors.<sup><a name="REF69" href="#FOOT69">69</a></sup></p>
</blockquote> <!--CLOSE disp-quote-epigraph-->





<p class="continued">Feathers at the tip of each rod wavered distinctively according to the illness in question. Charcot demonstrated the "specific character" of Parkinson's by having assistants hold the subjects about the trunk. When the upper body of a Parkinson's sufferer was stabilised, the feather remained still—which was not true of the patients afflicted with other illnesses. The apparent head tremor of Parkinson's was therefore a secondary consequence of vibrations which originated in the trunk, showing Parkinson's to be a distinct disease entity associated with a loss of neuromuscular control centred in the torso. </p>

<p>These feather-topped hats constituted merely the most flamboyant device Charcot employed in these contexts. Another commonly rehearsed identifying mark involved the separation of intention tremor (loss of precise control over transitory voluntary actions) from persistent, involuntary tremor. The standard test was to have the patient attempt to drink a glass of water. Otherwise coordinated subjects often exhibited a marked tremor during such an action. The intention tremor of those afflicted with sclerosis in plaques (multiple sclerosis) helped distinguish them from sufferers of paralysis agitans, who exhibited a tremor while at rest.<sup><a name="REF70" href="#FOOT70">70</a></sup>  Other physical examinations performed in the amphitheatre included walking, writing, holding one's arms horizontally, or attempting to balance with the eyes closed (Romberg's sign). Charcot's presentations conformed in this sense to a tautological pattern of orally telling, then visually showing through the directed actions of the patient, and then further explication in words. </p>

<p>These diagnostic tests constituted, in Raymond's words above, a form of performative <i>amplification.</i> As in a sketched caricature (a form of illustration at which Charcot excelled),<sup><a name="REF71" href="#FOOT71">71</a></sup>  the neuropathologist exaggerated the apparent scale of, or relative focus upon, various physical signs in order to make them more visible to the viewer. To manipulate the audience's attention, the physician utilised hand drawn illustrations, theatrical lighting, commentary and the direction of on stage action to dramaturgically <i>change the apparent proportions of the body</i> in such a way as to enhance his pedagogic demonstration and diagnosis. </p>

<p>Charcot's most influential contribution to medical display was his enthusiastic use of projections. Commentators were quick to proclaim his skilful manipulation of slides as a particularly impressive innovation in scientific pedagogy. It is unclear whether Charcot was the first to use photographic slides in an anatomical context. Slides were nevertheless relatively uncommon formal pedagogical tools at this time.<sup><a name="REF72" href="#FOOT72">72</a></sup>  The sheer quantity of photographic materials associated with the Salpêtrière during 

<b></b>

 Charcot's tenure was without precedent. The photographic laboratory at the hospice produced a vast quantity of images, which were widely disseminated throughout the publications of the Salpêtrière school.<sup><a name="REF73" href="#FOOT73">73</a></sup>  Contemporary commentators made frequent mention of the impressive slide presentations which Charcot gave and this practice continued at the Salpêtrière under Charcot's former student Pierre Marie (professor of neurology 1917–1925), whose talent for audiovisual display was said to surpass even Charcot's.<sup><a name="REF74" href="#FOOT74">74</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Slides from the Salpêtrière photography clinic made up the most overtly modern, rational element within Charcot's iconography. There does not appear to have been a set location from which the slides were cast. Fully-enclosed modern, projection-booths were not common until into the twentieth century, following conventions first established in the cinema, phantasmagoria (moving magic lantern shows) and other forms like Charles-Émile Reynaud's idiosyncratic <i>Théâtre Optique.</i><sup><a name="REF75" href="#FOOT75">75</a></sup>  The Faculty of Medicine amphitheatre had a bio-box added after Charcot's death, for example. The projector at the Salpêtrière however was visibly present to the audience, being typically directed onto movable stands resting on the stage, to one side of Charcot and the subjects [<a href="#3">res 3</a>, 5 &amp; 7].<sup><a name="REF76" href="#FOOT76">76</a></sup>  The distance of throw was short and so images would have been bright and sharp, but relatively small. The theatre could also be fitted with a translucent cyclorama for more impressive displays, but there is no indication that Charcot took advantage of this possibility. Charcot's presentations were therefore notable not so much for the integrated scale of their effects, as for the number of slides, their flow and what Guillain described as the "luminous clarity" which they permitted. </p>

<p>Even more than the literal body which had been "beaten into tiny fragments" by the limelight, the projected photographic image enabled a transmutation—a <i>transration</i>—of the body into its immaterial, nosological characteristics. These elements constituted a veritable inverse panopticon, beaming out images with which Charcot enabled his audience to see through the eyes of observers past and present, arraying historic works of art depicting deformities and fits alongside his own representations of modern patients.<sup><a name="REF77" href="#FOOT77">77</a></sup>  Images lifted from the retina of this unblinking, all-seeing composite eye were distributed throughout the space of the amphitheatre. </p>

<p>The body-made-fleshless through projection—a body of pure light—was arrayed beside these numerous other iconographic representations, reifying the body even as Charcot established his mastery of it. As Starr's account at the top of this section suggested, slides not only enabled one to compare different physical fragments, but also to metaphorically look <i>within</i> the body of the patient in question, revealing the causes of these dynamic diseases of movement in tissue damage and other anatomical phenomena. The subject was dismissed from the theatre and the interiority of the pathological body displayed. No sooner was the body of the living patient presented on stage than it was replaced by its iconographic representation in the form of photographs, postmortem preparations, verbal explications and other materials [<a href="#5">res 5</a>, 7 &amp; 8].<sup><a name="REF78" href="#FOOT78">78</a></sup>  Charcot's methodology thereby minimised—but did not altogether disallow—the possibility that the live performance of the subject could destabilise his <i>gestic</i> presentation of this material.

<p class="continued">Charcot emerged from these accounts as a highly adept multi-media dramaturge and monstrator who nevertheless, either by choice or from necessity, presented himself in a modest, theatrically uninteresting light—even during his <i>ex cathedral</i> lessons. Charcot attempted to forge a reconciliation between theatrical aesthetics and the new science of neurology. The rhetorical devices which Charcot brought together were not however always compatible, highlighting conflicts which existed between different discursive forms and genres. Charcot's demonstrations constituted an evolved theatrical form which was nonetheless characterised by absences and contradictions. His dramaturgical methodology remained an incomplete one. Neither the lectures themselves nor the published clinical <i>Leçons</i> could fulfil their function alone without the other. The two

 discursive forms existed as part of a performative dialectic, each sustaining (whilst also partly undermining) Charcot's neurological discourse.

The anatomy theatre at the Paris School of <i>beaux-arts</i> was intermediate in character, with seven rows of semi-circular, raked benches and no decorative elements within the building's fabric. Various paintings and casts which could be varied at the whim of the demonstrator made up the main adornments. Unlike the amphitheatre at the Salpêtrière, that of the <i>École</i> was lit by natural light to facilitate painting. Charcot's medical peer and supporter Mathias Duval lectured here, 1873–1903, and was succeeded by Charcot's former students and collaborators Paul Richer, 1903–1922, and Henry Meige, 1922–1940. I am currently researching Richer's practice and presentation methodology.
