<p>
<i>The life of images has taken a decisive turn in our time: the
oldest myth about the creation of living images, the fabrication
of an intelligent organism by artificial, technical means, has
now become a theoretical and practical possibility thanks to new
constellations of media at many different levels. The convergence of
genetic and computational technologies with new forms of speculative
capital has turned cyberspace and biospace, the inner structure of
organisms, into frontiers for technical innovation, appropriation,
and exploitation&#8212;new forms of objecthood and territoriality for
a new form of empire. In AI, Stephen Spielberg registers this change by
telling a story about the invention of an image that is, quite literally,
a "desiring machine." David, the contemporary answer to Pinocchio,
is a robot boy with dreams and desires, and with an apparently fully
elaborated human subjectivity. He is programmed to love and to demand
love, a demand that becomes so obsessive (he is in competition with his
real human "brother" for the love of his mother) that he is rejected and
becomes an orphan. To the question, "What do pictures want?" the answer
in this instance is clear: they want to be loved, and to be "real."</i>
<p>
<i>The genius of AI is not in its narrative, which is full of clunky,
implausible moments, but in its vision of a new world and its</i>

<b></b>

<i>new objects. David is a perfectly photogenic, adorable simulacrum of
a boy who is loveable and endearing in every way. The filmic point of
view encourages us to identify with him throughout, and to despise his
mother for rejecting him. Yet underlying the sickeningly sweet fantasy
of mother-son bliss (a utopian resolution of the Oedipus complex?) is the
horror of the double, the encounter with one's own mirror image rendered
autonomous, a horror that even the robot boy is capable of feeling when
he sees scores of his own duplicates on the assembly line, ready to be
packaged for the Christmas shopping season. The fantasy of AI, then, is
a kind of extreme exaggeration of the uncanny, when the old, familiar
phobia or superstition is realized in an unexpected way. This fantasy
was, of course, always already predicted from the moment of the creation
of Adam from the red clay of the ground, the creation of the first
drawing with the red earth of vermilion, the casting of the Golden Calf
from Egyptian gold. In our time, the materials are organic substances,
proteins, cells, DNA molecules, and the shaping, casting procedures are
computational. This is the age of biocybernetic reproduction, when (as
we suppose) images really do come alive and want things. What follows
is an attempt to sketch out a thick description of this moment, and to
assess some of the artistic practices that have accompanied it.</i>
<p>
The current revolutions in biology and computers signified here by the
images of the double helix and the Turing Machine (. <a name="1"
HREF="10.3mitchell_res.html#1">1</a> and <a name="2"
HREF="10.3mitchell_res.html#2">2</a>) and their implications
for ethics and politics raise a host of new questions for which the
arts, traditional humanistic disciplines, and Enlightenment modes of
rationality may seem ill-prepared. What good is it even to talk about
the human if a humanist like Katherine Hayles is right in arguing that
we live in a post-human age?
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
What is the point of asking the great philosophical questions about
the meaning of life, when we seem to be on the verge of reducing this
most ancient question of metaphysics to what Giorgio Agamben has called
"bare life," a matter of technical means, a calculable chemical process?
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
And what about the ancient mystery of death in a time of neomorts,
indefinitely extended comas, and organ transplants? Is death now
merely a problem to be solved by engineering and adjudicated by
lawyers? What is the structure of scientific and technical knowledge
itself? Is it a set of logically validated statements and propositions,
a self-correcting discursive system? Or is it riddled with images,
metaphors, and fantasies that take on a life of their own, and turn the
dream of absolute rational mastery into a nightmare of confusion and
uncontrollable side effects? To what extent are the widely heralded
technical innovations in biology and computation themselves mythic
projections or symptoms, rather than determining causes? Above all,
who is in a position to reflect on these questions, or rather, what
disciplines have the tools to sort out these issues? Do we call on the
artists or the philosophers, the anthropologists or the art historians,
or do we turn to the proponents of hybrid formations like "cultural
studies?" Do we rely on the genetic engineers and computer hackers to
reflect on the ethical and political meaning of their work? Or do we
turn to the new field called "bioethics," a profession that requires
fewer credentials than we expect from a hairdresser, and which is in
danger of becoming part of the publicity apparatus of the

<b></b>

corporations whose behavior they are supposed to monitor&#8212;or as
in the case of George W. Bush's Presidential Council on Bioethics,
a front for the reassertion of the most traditional Christian pieties
and phobias about the reproductive process?
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>

<p>
I can not promise clear and unequivocal answers to these questions,
a set of dialectical theses on the order of Walter Benjamin's 1935
manifesto, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction." I
can offer, however, a target for inquiry, the concept of "biocybernetic
reproduction." The questions, then, are as follows: what is biocybernetic
reproduction? What is being done with it by way of critical and artistic
practice, and what could be done?


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Biocybernetics
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Biocybernetic reproduction is, in its narrowest sense, the combination of
computer technology and biological science that makes cloning and genetic
engineering possible. In a more extended sense, it refers to the new
technical media and structures of political economy that are transforming
the conditions of all living organisms on this planet. Biocybernetics
ranges from the most grandiose plans to engineer a brave new world of
perfect cyborgs to the familiar scene of the American health club, where
obese, middle aged consumers are sweating and straining while wired up
to any number of digital monitors that keep track of their vital signs
and even more vital statistics&#8212;especially the number of calories
consumed. It is not limited to the pristine lab

<b></b>

populated with white-coated technicians and electronically controlled
media, but encompasses the world of the messy, chaotic computer station,
destructive viruses, and carpal tunnel syndrome.
<p>
I adopt the polysyllabic tongue-twisting term "biocybernetics" rather
than the more compact "cybernetics" in order to foreground a fundamental
dialectical tension in this concept. The word "cybernetics" comes
from the Greek word for the "steersman" of a boat, and thus suggests a
discipline of control and governance. Norbert Wiener called cybernetics
"the entire field of control and communication theory, whether in the
machine or animal." "Bios," on the other hand, refers to the sphere
of living organisms which are to be subjected to control, but which
may in one way or another resist that control, insisting on "a life
of their own." "Biocybernetics," then, refers not only to the field
of control and communication, but to that which eludes control and
refuses to communicate. In other words, I am questioning the notion
that our time is adequately described as the "age of information," the
"digital age," or the age of the computer, and suggesting a more complex
and conflicted model, envisioning all these models of calculation and
control as interlocked in a struggle with new forms of incalculability
and uncontrollability, from computer viruses to terrorism.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
The age of information might better be called the age of mis- or
dis-information, and the era of cybernetic control is&#8212;if my
daily newspapers are telling me the truth&#8212;more like an epoch of
loss of control. In short, far from being technically determined in
any straightforward way by computers and the internet, the digital age
spawns new forms of fleshly, analogue, non-digital experience, and the
age of cybernetics engenders new breeds of biomorphic entities, among
which we must number intelligent machines such as "smart bombs," and
those even more intelligent machines known as "suicide bombers." The
final result of the smart bomb and the suicide bomber is the same,
namely, the creation of a biocybernetic life form, the reduction of a
living being to a tool or machine, and the elevation of a mere tool or
machine to an intelligent, adaptable creature.
<p>
In invoking the concept of the "bios" as a zone of resistance and
incalculability, I do not posit some reservoir of "vital forces" that
stand against the mechanical and rational operations of cybernetics. My
aim, rather, is to observe that within the very heart of the cybernetic
the bios rears its head in very concrete forms&#8212;most conspicuously
in the computational virus&#8212;but also in subtler forms such as the
decay of information found in the phenomenon of "Lossy compression."
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
I also stress the two-way operation of the disintegration of oppositions
between the mechanical and the organic. It's not simply that living
things become like machines, but that machines more than ever behave now
like living things, and that the line between hardware and software
is increasingly entangled with a third zone that might be called
"wetware." At the more global level of macroorganisms, it is impossible
to ignore the emergence of a biocybernetic paradigm in the work of
computer researchers such as Alberto Laszlo-Barabasi, who remarks that
"internet researchers are like doctors trying to re out what their
patient looks like." "Redundancy in the network" has reached a complexity
"that resembles what biologists have found in living organisms," while
(on the other side) "some biologists hope that such studies [of the
internet] may help them find

<b></b>

clues to the deeper mysteries of nature."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
Internet artists such as Lisa Jevbratt take quite seriously the metaphor
of the Internet as a living organism. Jevbratt, in fact, believes that
it is a <i>dying</i> organism, and her work is devoted to making visible
its vital processes and pathological tendencies.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>

<p>
It might be useful here to put biocybernetics in the larger theoretical
and historical framework of semiotics and iconology (the study of signs
and images). From this broader perspective, the relation of the "bios"
and the "cyber" is a re-writing of the traditional dialectics between
nature and culture, human beings and tools, artifacts, machines, and
media&#8212;what we used to call the whole "man-made world." It also
reenacts the ancient struggle between the image and the word, the idol and
the law. The cyber-steersman is the digital code, the alphanumeric system
of calculation and iterability that makes language and mathematics the
controlling instruments of human rationality, from cunning calculation
to wise estimation. As Northrop Frye once noted, the real gift to man
on Mt. Sinai was not the moral law, which was already known in oral
tradition, but the semiotic law, which replaced pictographic writing
systems with a phonetic alphabet, analog writing with the digital.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
The Cyber is the judge and differentiator, the one who rules by writing
the code. Bios, on the other hand, tends toward the analogical register,
or the "message without a code" as Roland Barthes described it in the
context of photography.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
It is the domain of perception, sensation, fantasy, memory, similitude,
pictures&#8212;in short, what Lacan calls the Imaginary. Traditionally
these categories stood in stable hierarchies: reason, the logos. The
Symbolic was supposed to rule, and the image was relegated to the
sphere of emotions, passions, and appetites. That is why admonitions
against idolatry and fetishism are so often associated with accusations
of materialism and sensuality. But here is the curious twist in our
time. The digital is declared to be triumphant at the very same moment
that a kind of frenzy of the image and spectacle is announced. Which
is it? The word or the image? Raymond Bellour notes that "all French
reflection for half a century has been drawn between the pincers of
the word and the image," a pattern that he traces in Lacan, Deleuze,
Barthes, and Foucault. Bellour compares this weaving of word and image,
discourse and re, fantasy and the law to a "double helix" of signs
and sensations that constitutes the evolution of new media and new
"image species" in our time.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
As Bellour's metaphor of the helix suggests, the word-image
dialectic seems to be reappearing at the level of life
processes themselves. An image of this appearance is provided
in a film still from <i>Jurassic Park</i> (<a name="3"
href="10.3mitchell_res.html#3"> 3</a>), in which a
velociraptor is caught in the projector beam of the park's orientation
film, its skin serving as a screen for the display of the DNA codes
that were used in cloning the creature from fossil traces of living
tissue. This image provides a metapicture of the relation of digital
and analogical codes, the script of DNA and the visible organism that
it produces.
<p>
I will spare you a detailed argument that something like biocybernetic
reproduction is indeed the technical and scientific dominant of our age,
that biology has replaced physics at the frontiers of science, and that
digital information has replaced the physical quanta of mass and energy
as dominant forms of imagined materiality. Anyone who has read Donna
Haraway on cyborgs, or watched science fiction movies over

<b></b>

the last twenty years cannot fail to be struck by the pervasiveness of
this theme.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
Films such as <i>Blade Runner,Alien,The Matrix,Videodrome,The Fly,The
Sixth Day,AI,</i> and <i>Jurassic Park</i> have made clear the host of
fantasies and phobias clustering around biocybernetics: the spectre
of the "living machine," the re-animation of dead matter and extinct
organisms, the destabilizing of species identity and difference,
the proliferation of prosthetic organs and perceptual apparatuses,
and the infinite malleability of the human mind and body have become
commonplaces of popular culture.
<p>
The contrast between the mechanical and biocybernetic model is vividly
illustrated by the "new model" cyborg of Arnold Schwarzenegger's
<i>Terminator 2</i>. Schwarzenegger plays the role of a traditional
robot, a mechanical assembly of gears, pulleys, and pistons driven by a
computer brain and the most advanced servo-motors. He is faced, however,
with a new model terminator composed of "living metal," a shape-shifting
chimera that is a universal mimic, capable of taking on any identity. By
the end of this film, we are prepared to be nostalgic for the good old
days of mechanical men who could express regret for their inability to
cry, and to feel horror at the new re of infinite mutability and
mutation, remorselessly pursuing the extinction of the human species.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>

<p>
I will state it as a bald proposition, then, that biocybernetic
reproduction has replaced Walter Benjamin's mechanical reproduction as
the fundamental technical determinant of our age.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
If mechanical reproducibility (photography, cinema, and associated
industrial processes like the assembly line) dominated the era of
modernism, biocybernetic reproduction (high-speed computing, video,
digital imaging, virtual reality, the internet, and the industrialization
of genetic engineering) dominates the age that we have called
"postmodern." This term, which played its role as a place-holder in

<b></b>

the 1970s and 80s, now seems to have outlived its usefulness, and is
ready to be replaced by more descriptive notions such as biocybernetics
(although even as we move toward this more positive description, it will
be important not to forget the project of postmodernism to go beyond
narrow notions of technical determination toward reconstructing the
entire cultural framework of an era).
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
Benjamin and Biocybernetics
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
If we pursue the question of biocybernetics in the spirit of Walter
Benjamin's "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,"
then every term needs to be re-examined. "Art" or "Kunst," as Benjamin
already saw, does not merely signify the traditional arts of painting,
sculpture, and architecture, but the entire range of new technical media
(photography, cinema, radio, television) emerging in his time. The "work"
itself is highly ambiguous as to the art object (the "Kunstwerk"), the
medium of art, or the very task (the work as "Kunstarbeit") to which
the arts ought to be committed. "Reproduction" and "reproducibility"
mean something quite different now when the central issues of technology
are no longer "mass production" of commodities or "mass reproduction"
of identical images, but the reproductive processes of the biological
sciences and the production of infinitely malleable, digitally animated
images. What does it mean when the paradigmatic object on the assembly
line is no longer a mechanism but an engineered organism? And how is the
life of this organism altered when the medium in which it thrives is
a fusion of digital and analogical codes, the "eyewash," as Friedrich
Kittler puts it, of the apparent sensuous output, and the stream of
alphanumeric ciphers that lies beneath it?
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>
I focus here on three consequences of the new mode of biocybernetic
reproduction, each of which has its counterpart in Benjamin's analysis
of mechanical reproduction, which I will posit as three categorical
claims: first, the copy is no longer an inferior or decayed relic of the
original, but is in principle an improvement on the original; second,
the relation between the artist and work, the work and its model, is both
more distant and more intimate than anything possible in the realm of
mechanical reproduction; and third, a new temporality, characterized by
an erosion of the event, and a vertiginous deepening of the relevant past,
produces a peculiar sense of "accelerated stasis" in our sense of history.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>

<p>
First, the issue of original and copy entailed in
"reproducibility." Benjamin famously argued that the advent of
photographic copies was producing a "decay of the aura"&#8212;a
loss of the unique presence, authority, and mystique of the original
object. Biocybernetic reproduction carries this displacement of the
original one further step, and in doing so, reverses the relation of
the copy to the original. Now we have to say that the copy has, if
anything, even <i>more</i> aura than the original. More precisely, in a
world where the very idea of the unique original seems a merely nominal
or legal fiction, the copy has every chance of being an improvement or
enhancement of whatever counts as the original. The digital reproduction
of sounds and visual images, for instance, need not involve any erosion
of vividness or lifelikeness, but can actually

<b></b>

improve on its original material. Photographs of artworks can be
"scrubbed" to remove flaws and dust; in principle, the effects of aging
in an oil painting could be digitally erased, and the work restored
to its pristine originality in a reproduction. Of course this would
still constitute a loss of the aura that Benjamin associated with the
accretion of history and tradition around an object, but if aura means
recovering the original vitality, literally, the "breath" of life of the
original, then the digital copy can come closer to looking and sounding
like the original than the original itself. Indeed the miraculous
programming framework of Adobe Photoshop even preserves the "history"
of transformations between original and copy so that any transformations
can be reversed.
<p>
This point becomes even more evident when we think about the manipulation
of <i>genetic</i> copies and originals. Cloning is a process which,
in principle, is meant not only to produce an identical twin of the
original organic tissue or organism, but to produce an improved and
enhanced copy. Our children or our cloned descendants will give the
phrase "she is the image of her mother," a new meaning, with the implied
promise that the child's genetic makeup will have been "scrubbed" of
the flaws that made the parent a less than perfect specimen. The film
<i>Gattacca,</i> whose title is composed of the four letters of the DNA
molecular code, provides a vivid imagining of the brave new world promised
by this process of an ever-improved copying of life-forms. Eduardo Kac's
experiments with transgenic artworks promise to produce surprising
new organisms by creating a web site which responds interactively to
"hits" from visitors by producing mutations in micro-organisms. Kac's
experiments in splicing rabbit DNA with jellyfish protein are designed
to produce a rabbit that glows in the dark, a copy that has more aureole,
if not aura, than its original.
<p>
The second consequence of biocybernetics concerns the transformed
relation between artist and work, work and model effected by new tools
and apparatuses. In a striking analogy, Benjamin contrasts the era of
manual and mechanical reproduction with the res of the magician and
the surgeon, the painter and the cameraman: "The surgeon," says Benjamin,
"represents the polar opposite of the magician. The magician heals a sick
person by the laying on of hands; the surgeon cuts into the patient's
body. . . . Magician and surgeon compare to painter and cameraman. The
painter maintains in his work a natural distance from reality, the
cameraman penetrates deeply into its web."
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
In the age of biocybernetic reproduction, two new res have appeared
on the scene. The cameraman is replaced by the designer of virtual
spaces and electronic architectures, and the surgeon adopts the new
techniques of remote, virtual surgery. The surgeon operates at an
unnatural distance from the patient's body, performing his gestures in
a remote location, such as another room, or perhaps even from another
country. He moves his hands inside of data gloves like a shaman making
passes over a virtual body, removing a virtual tumor with sleight of
hand. He is able to rehearse his movements on a virtual body many times
before the actual operation takes place. The digital miniaturization
of his movements allows him to cut deeper and finer than any operation
conceivable in traditional manual surgery. Similarly, the cyber artist
operates simultaneously within a closer and more distant relationship
to the real. In

<b></b>

the case of a performance artist like Stelarc, the materiality of the work
is the artist's own body, subjected to prosthetic surgeries that graft
on additional limbs, while the actualities of performance may involve
wiring the artist's body up to remote locations in other countries,
so that an interactive performance may be conducted in which spectators
control the movements of the artist's body.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
The relationship of artist-to-work-to-corporeal reality is thus made
more intimate than ever, at the same time the artist's subjectivity
is simultaneously dispersed and fragmented across the circuitry of
prosthetic limbs and remote control spectatorship (<a name="4"
href="10.3mitchell_res.html#4"> 4</a>).
<p>
But it is above all the sense of temporality that is transformed in the
age of biocybernetics. The very notion of an "age" defined by technical
determination has a different feel at the threshold of the twenty first
century. Benjamin wrote in the uneasy interim between two world wars
that had raised the technologies of mass death and extermination of
civilian populations to unprecedented heights, a time of crisis and
immediate danger punctuated by irreversible catastrophes and dramatic
technical innovations. We live in a time that is best described as a
limbo of continually deferred expectations and anxieties. Everything is
about to happen, or perhaps has already happened without our noticing
it. The ecological catastrophe of Don DeLillo's <i>White Noise,</i>
is a non-event. The Gulf War, according to Jean Baudrillard, did not
take place (although he has conceded that September 11<sup>th</sup>
very likely was an event of some sort, but

<b></b>

exactly what sort is still to be worked out). The human genome&#8212;the
very "secret of life" itself&#8212;is decoded, and yet everything
remains the same. The heralded new computer you bought last week will be
obsolete before you learn to use it properly. The simplest conceivable
mechanism for rationalizing political life with a decisive, calculable
event (namely, a "free election") turns out to be not so simple, and
the leadership of the world's most powerful nation is determined by a
debate about whether human hands or machines should be trusted to count
the vote. Needless to say, the human hands lost.
<p>
Even war, the most dramatic and defining historical event human beings can
experience, turns out in our time to take on a radically indeterminate
and nebulous shape. As I write, the United States is in a state of
war, but a new kind of ambiguous, undeclared war in which the enemy
is nowhere and everywhere, without a definite territory or identity,
located in faraway places like Afghanistan or Iraq, but living among us
in Florida, hiding in caves and secret bases, or dwelling in the open,
driving their mini-vans to the mall, like "sleeper cells" that can awaken
without warning to unleash plagues and destruction. The onset of this war
was experienced as a wrenching, visceral catastrophe of mass death and
destruction, and as a media event suffused by unreality and disbelief. The
conduct of the war will range from espionage, to diplomacy, and commando
raids to full-scale preemptive wars. It will be a war without a front,
a back, or a middle, a war of indefinite and probably unattainable
objectives. It already has established a permanent state of emergency
designed to consolidate the power of a single political party, and indeed,
of a small faction within that party. To call this a new form of fascism
is not to engage in name-calling, but to call a situation by its true name
<p>
Meanwhile, at the same moment that terrorism is being defined as the
greatest evil of our age, the most popular movie of our time is a
film called <i>Matrix,</i> which glorifies a small band of hacker
terrorists determined to bring down the entire world economic and
political system because they resent the fact that computers are
controlling human life. We live in a very peculiar time, in which more
media circulate more information to more people than ever before, and yet
when the phenomenon of "disconnection" has never been more dramatically
evident. Polls of the American electorate show widespread discontent
with practically every major policy position of the ruling party, at the
same time that its leader continues to enjoy unprecedented popularity,
and his party rolls to one victory after another. Every pundit expresses
wonder at the "disconnect" that plagues American public consciousness
(if such a phrase still has any meaning), and every analysis of this
"consciousness" suggests that it has become so irreconciliably divided
that Americans appear to be living on two different planets.
<p>
Walter Benjamin's prediction that the human race might be capable of
viewing "its own destruction as an aesthetic experience of the first
order" has come true in a long-running series of apocalyptic disaster
films.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
The scenes broadcast from New York on September 11, 2001, had, as
many observers noted, been anticipated numerous times by Hollywood,
and it was even suggested that the terrorists timed the second plane's
collision with the south tower of the World Trade Center in the full
expectation that hundreds of video cameras would capture the event live,
and broadcast it over and over again around the world.

<b></b>


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
A Paleontology of the Present
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Every present moment has to define itself against some notion of the past,
and ours is no exception. Benjamin noted that modernity and mechanical
reproduction seemed to bring along with them a revival of primitive and
archaic formations: that modernist painting, for instance, was riddled
with traces of fetishism, and that modern cinema was fulfilling the
ancient dream of a universal hieroglyphic language that would repair the
damage done at the Tower of Babel. Our time has its share of fascination
with primitive pasts, and the new literalizing of the living, desiring
image is, as I've tried to show, the occasion for numerous revivals of
archaic and pre-modern fantasies about the creation of life. But now
our sense of the revived past is even deeper than the time-frames of
archaeology and anthropology. Now paleontology, the study of ancient
extinct life-forms (most notably the dinosaur), looms as the temporal
framework for the some of the most innovative achievements in art,
media, and technology. The still image of the raptor from <i>Jurassic
Park</i> (<a href="10.3mitchell_res.html#3"> 3</a>), like
a petrified fossil extracted from the stream of living time, captures
the paradox of biocybernetics perfectly. With its skin lit up with the
DNA codes that brought it to life, it is a dialectical image of the
most up-to-date and the most ancient forms of life&#8212;a technically
engineered organism <i>and</i> a world dominant creature that predates
the advent of mammals. Fused here in a single gestalt are the inseparable
but contrary twins of biotechnology, constant innovation and constant
obsolescence, the creation and extinction of life, reproductive cloning
and the annihilation of a species.
<p>
Art historian T. J. Clark has recently written about the modern era,
the time of Benjamin and Picasso and Lenin, as an era so remote from
our present as to require an "archaeology" to understand it.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
My own view is that the present is, in a very real sense, even more
remote from our understanding, and that we need a "paleontology of the
present," a rethinking of our condition from the perspective of deep
time, in order to produce a synthesis of the arts and sciences adequate
to the challenges we face. Artists such as Robert Smithson, Allan
McCollum, and Mark Dion, who have pioneered the introduction of natural
history themes into their art practices, have given us some guidance in
thinking about the task of art in relation to issues of deep ecology and
the spectre of extinction. Smithson saw his <i>Spiral Jetty</i> both as
a cosmic hieroglyphic, a product of modern earth-moving technologies,
and a geological trace, like the footprints of the dinosaurs,
spiraling into a "deep time" which makes our own historical and even
archaeological time-sense seem brief and shallow by comparison. Allan
McCollum brought painted concrete castings of dinosaur thigh bones into
the classical atrium of the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh to evoke the
way in which America's sense of the past has&#8212;at least since Thomas
Jefferson&#8212;simultaneously evoked the classical past of Greece and
the Roman Empire, and the even deeper past of a natural history that
links our nation's past to the fate of the giant erect reptiles that
once ruled the world (as America does now). Mark Dion'sinstallation
<i>Dinos R U.S. : When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth,</i> inquires into
the obsession of typical American first-graders with extinct creatures
that dominated the world 70 million years ago. Why is it that the most
familiar, most highly publicized animal group on the planet

<b></b>

earth at this time is a group of creatures that have never been seen
outside of museums and movies?
<p>
The first conclusion of such a paleontology of the present might be
summed up by Fredric Jameson's remark that "it is now easier to imagine
the death of the human species than the end of capitalism." In Walter
Benjamin's time, the greatest accumulations of power were located in
the nation-state, the collective life-forms symbolized by Hobbes's
Leviathan. Adorno called the dinosaur a monument to the monstrous total
state, but in our time, it has become a re for a new monster, the
multinational corporation, locked in a Darwinian struggle of survival of
the fittest, in which new strategies of downsizing, flexibility, and rapid
adaptation (the virtues of the Velociraptor) have replaced the emphasis
on giantism of the old corporate giants (the power of the T. Rex).
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
Any critique of this mode of production, then, that does not address the
corporation as life-form and Kunstwerk, and multinational capitalism
as its habitat, will miss the outer frame of this subject. Capitalism
is now the only game in town, a second nature that operates by and
appeals for legitimation to the impersonal, Darwinist logic of a first
nature that is red in tooth and claw. It is not merely that biotech
corporations are rapidly appropriating the copyrights to genetic codes
of newly engineered species of plants, animals, and foodstuffs, or that
they will soon be copyrighting human genes and farming human embryos,
but the deeper fact that these corporations are themselves biocybernetic
"forms of life," collective organisms that must destroy or devour their
rivals in order to survive. If cybernetics is the science of number
and computation, it is perhaps the perfect modus operandi for the
new-model corporation based in speculative finance capital (as distinct
from innovative, entrepreneurial capital), exemplified by the dot-com
bubble and the fabulous accounting procedures that made Enron appear
to be so profitable. (The Enron "partnerships" that were designed to
gobble up debt and improve the parent company's balance sheet were,
significantly, called "Raptors"). Standing over against these legitimate
or "normal" corporate entities, of course, are their dark counterparts,
the cartels of terrorism and international crime organizations, complete
with private armies and legitimate "front" operations. As Hyman Roth
said so prophetically to Michael Corleone in <i>Godfather II:</i>
"Michael, we're bigger than General Motors."

The "Work" of Art
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
What, then, is the "work" of art in this era? What is its task in the
face of biocybernetics, and the new corporate and physical bodies it is
spawning? The sheer volume and variety of new artistic production that
deals with the themes and issues of biocybernetics makes any summary
very difficult indeed. When I wrote the first draft of this essay in
the fall of 2000, a single show at Exit Art Gallery in New York was
able to assemble twenty artists who had something to say or show on this
topic. Since that time, scores of exhibitions and shows explicitly on this
theme have been organized. There is little agreement on what exactly the
"theme" in question is. For some artists, such as Janet Zweig, it appears
to be an eternally recurring issue, one that is continuous

<b></b>

with the first artistic imitations of life, the legendary cave
paintings of Lascaux. Zweig transfers hand-painted copies of these
cave paintings onto the side of a spool of computer tape imprinted
with the genetic codes of similar animals, as if to say that the
relation of the bios and cyber has always been with us (<a name="5"
HREF="10.3mitchell_res.html#5"> 5</a>). Others treat genetic
technologies as the content of traditional media like painting and
sculpture. Alexis Rockman's <i>The Farm, 2000</i>depicts a soybean field
that, according to the artist's instructions, "is to be read from left to
right. The image begins with the ancestral versions of internationally
familiar animals, and moves across to informed speculation about how
they might look in the future."
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
Laura Stein's <i>Smile Tomato</i>carries the notion of genetically
altered fruits and vegetables to its logical extreme. If we can engineer
produce to maintain its fresh appearance (if not its taste) indefinitely,
why not design fruits and vegetables with smiley faces?
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
Ron Jones's human-sized rendering of the genetic structure of cancer (<A
NAME="6" href="10.3mitchell_res.html#6"> 6</a>) in the
mode of Jean Arp's abstract sculptures reminds us of the very specific
role that sculptural modeling has played in genetic research<b>.</b>
The double helix structure of DNA has been compared to a Constructivist
monument, and biologist Robert Pollack (one of the pioneers of DNA

<b></b>

research) describes "the leap from DNA to protein" as a "transit from
line to shape, from signifier to signified . . . as if each sentence in an
encyclopedia were folded into a unique origami sculpture that carried its
meaning in its shape. . . . Bent, knotted, and folded, a cell's protein
sculptures look like the animals in Alexander Calder's wire circus."
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
Sculptural magnification is also at issue in Bryan Crockett's
<i>OncoMouse,</i> "the first patented transgenic lab mouse," which gives
the engineering of designer laboratory animals a grotesquely monumental
treatment. Crockett justifies the human scale of his 6 foot tall mouse
by linking it to the Christ re, calling it <i>Ecce Hommo Rattus,</i>
the principal sacrificial animal in the rituals of cancer research.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>

<p>
Perhaps the most disturbing and provocative sort of biocybernetic
art, however, is work that does not attempt to represent the genetic
revolution, but to participate in it. Eduardo Kac's installation,
<i>Genesis 1999,</i> is a "transgenic artwork linked to the internet,"
an interactive work that translates visits or "hits" on the installation's
website into instructions for random genetic mutations of microorganisms.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
Transgenic art is, in Kac's words, "a new art form based on the use
of genetic engineering techniques to transfer synthetic genes to an
organism or to transfer natural genetic material from one species into
another in order to create unique living beings." Kac's most notorious
work is a rabbit named "Alba," produced by splicing jellyfish protein
with rabbit DNA. Alba is thus engineered to be a fluorescent rabbit,
though reportedly her "aureole" is only visible if one parts the fur
and examines the skin under a special light. There is, in addition,
a problem with actually exhibiting Alba, since the French government
lab that engineered the rabbit has declined to release it to the artist.

<b></b>

<p>
Kac's work dramatizes the difficulty biocybernetic art has in making its
object or model visible. In looking at the <i>Genesis</i> installation,
or hearing about the synthetic rabbit, one takes it on faith that the
work exists and is doing what it is reported to be doing. There is, in
a very real sense, nothing to see in the work, only documents, gadgets,
black boxes, and rumors of mutations and monsters. Perhaps this is the
point, and Kac's work is best viewed in the context of conceptual art,
which often renounces visual payoff. The object of mimesis here is
really the invisibility of the genetic revolution, its inaccessibility
to representation. The real subject matter, then, becomes the idea
of the work and the critical debate that surrounds it as much as its
material realization. In response to the predictable objection that the
work is a kind of irresponsible "playing" with genetic technologies,
Kac's equally predictable response is that purposeless play is at the
heart of the aesthetic gesture as such
<p>
A more pointed, simple, and direct use of conceptual art strategies
is offered by Larry Miller's <i>Genomic License</i> project, which
plays upon the patenting of animal and plant breeds by extending the
notion of commodification and property rights to the personal genes of
human beings. Miller copyrighted his own DNA in 1989, and has continued
the project since then of distributing genetic copyright forms as, in
his words, "a contribution to "Genesthetics," or art works that link
art, science, theology, and capitalism. A related project is <i>The
Creative Gene Harvest Archive,</i> part of an ongoing work by artists
Karl S. Mihail and Tran T. Kim-Trang entitled <i>Gene Genies Worldwide
Corporation.</i> This project, advertising itself as the "the cutting
edge of art and genetic engineering," aims to compile an archive of the
genes of "creative geniuses" in an attempt to improve the human species.
<p>
The blank irony and deadpan humor of these projects seems to leave any
critical perspective to the spectator. One art project that stands out for
its explicitly critical approach to biocybernetics is an internet-based
artists' collective known as Rtmark. One of the most notable productions
of this collective is <i>Biotaylorism 2000,</i> a half-hour automated
PowerPoint presentation designed by Natalie Bookchin of Cal Arts. As a
web-based entity, Rtmark presents itself as a new mutual fund designed
to highlight the risks and opportunities of biotechnology corporate
partnerships which are "scavenging the Third World and the interiors
of bodies for valuable genes." Rtmark links the contemporary race to
commodify the human genome with earlier state-sponsored programs in
racial eugenics and the rationalization of industrial processes known as
Taylorism, the subjection of every biological process to calculation and
control. Bobbing and weaving between deadpan humor, feigned enthusiasm
for the glorious profits to be made in biotech futures, and mordant
historical reminders of the questionable past of biocybernetics, Rtmark
has managed to insert itself into the corporate culture of biotechnology
as a kind of resident virus. The collective has, on occasion, even been
mistaken for a legitimate mutual fund, and has received invitations
to trade shows and to private consulting sessions with biotechnology
startups hungry for venture capital. Their proposals to make dazzling
profits on world hunger and designer babies sound very attractive in a
conversation riddled with optimistic projections about feeding the poor
and improving the lives of everyone. Rtmark has also developed a

<b></b>

new software application entitled <i>Reamweaver</i> (the name is a
spin-off on <i>Dreamweaver,</i> one of the leading hypertext programs for
the creation of websites). <i>Reamweaver</i> targets existing websites
such as the Celera Corporation or Monsanto, analyzes their content,
and automatically weaves a parodic, counter-web site in which the images
of corporate hype are systematically undermined. And it does all this,
Rtmark promises, while you sleep!
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
Clearly there is no consensus on artistic strategies in
biocybernetics. And there is a real question about how well this art
can find a place in the traditional spaces of the gallery or museum,
given its invisible, often technical content; this question is coupled
with considerable uncertainty about what sort of medium or form it ought
to employ. Biocybernetics has probably found its best medium in the
cinema, where horror and science fiction provide spectacular images and
narratives of bio-dystopias (like the worlds depicted in <i>The Matrix</i>
or <i>Gattacca</i>).
<p>
However, some artists have found ways, in my view, to compete with
the effects of cinema within a more or less traditional gallery
space. Consider the work of Damien Hirst, whose experiments with "vitrine
art," the art of the glass box that preserves the biological specimen,
from the pickled shark to embryo to the bisected cow, have drawn so much
attention. In a recent work entitled <i>Love Lost</i> (<a name="7"
HREF="10.3mitchell_res.html#7"> 7</a>), Hirst presents us
with a massive, ten foot high vitrine filled with water and live fish
swimming around a gynecological examination room. The room contains,
in addition to the examination table with its stirrups, a computer
station. The whole scene is rendered as if all the objects have been
underwater for a considerable period of time, as if we were looking at a
scene from a sunken city, a lost civilization like Atlantis. Hirst stages
one of the critical scenes of contemporary biocybernetics, the control
of women's bodies and reproductive processes as an archaic "lost world"
whose meaning is to be interpreted by the forensic imagination of the
spectator. Indeed, when I first saw this work at the Gagosian Gallery in
New York, spectators were swirling around it obsessively, like the fish
inside the tank, inspecting and interpreting every detail, as if they were
detectives or archaeologists inspecting the scene of a crime or disaster.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>

<p>
Antony Gormley's <i>Sovereign State</i> (<a name="8"
HREF="10.3mitchell_res.html#8"> 8</a>) is the most
concentrated sculptural rendering I have seen of the dystopia of
biocybernetics. A mathematically expanded concrete casting of the artist's
own body lying on its side in a fetal position with large rubber hoses
attached to the body's orifices, the sculpture suggests that draining
and drinking, output and input are all tangled together in an image
of waste products recycled as food. This is a re of the neomort,
neonatal, or comatose human body, as if in suspended animation, like a
cryogenic incubator keeping someone alive until the next millennium; or
(if wired to a virtual reality network) one could imagine it as the exact
counterpart of the human inhabitants of <i>The Matrix.</i> As the title of
the piece suggests, Gormley's sculpture portrays absolute sovereignty, the
subject at one with itself, in harmonious, self-enclosed equilibrium. It
further enacts the reduction of bios to zoe, the living form to bare life.
<p>
I conclude by returning to the image of the digital raptor from
Spielberg's <i>Jurassic Park.</i> Like Gormley's <i>Sovereign State,</i>
Spielberg's image captures the dream of

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 498]</b>

biocybernetics, but carries it to the final illusion. This dream is not
just the indefinite maintenance of a life-form in perfect self-regulating
equilibrium, but the resurrection of extinct life with cybernetic
codes. The dream of control over life, its reduction to calculable
processes, is here projected as the ultimate fantasy: not just the
conquest of death (as in the biocybernetic myth of <i>Frankenstein</i>),
but the conquest of <i>species</i> death by cloning the DNA of extinct
creatures. This fantasy of cybernetic control is, of course, exactly what
the film's narrative puts into question. At the moment of this film still,
the raptor has just broken into the control room of the dinosaur park, and
is looking to devour the controllers. The DNA codes which express mastery
over the reproductive processes of extinct animals have unleashed flesh
and blood creatures who have taken over their own means of reproduction.
<p>
The digital dinosaur is a biocybernetic updating of the oldest myth about
the creation of life, that life begins with the word of god, and the word
is made flesh, a corporeal image of the creator&#8212;an image that, as
we know, inevitably rebels against its creator. Biocybernetics is about
the attempt to control bodies with codes and images with language. The
analogy between biogenetic engineering of organisms and digital animation
of graphic images is perfected in this re, as if someone had hit the
"reveal codes" button to expose the digital basis of both the creature
itself, and its cinematic representation. Perhaps this, then, is one
task of art in the age of biocybernetic reproduction, to reveal the
codes and expose the illusion of the ultimate mastery of life. Another
task would be the elaboration of what I have called a "paleontology
of the present," a discipline that would begin by acknowledging that
contemporaneity is perhaps even more mysterious to us than the recent or
distant past, and that would proceed by insisting on the connectedness
of all forms of life, a project that might put cybernetics to work for
human values. Still another task is the re-articulation of what we mean
by the human, by humanism, and the humanities, an inquiry in which all
the things we have learned about "identity" and identity politics in the
postmodern era would be applied to the ultimate question of <i>species</i>
identity. Finally, there would be the question of the image, and the
Imaginary, itself. If we are indeed living in a time of the plague of
fantasies, perhaps the best cure that artists can offer is to unleash
the images, in order to see where they lead us, how they go before us. A
certain tactical irresponsibility with images might be just the right
sort of homeopathic medicine for what plagues us.
<p>
<p>
Walter Benjamin concluded his meditation on mechanical reproduction
with the spectre of mass destruction. The dangerous aesthetic pleasure
of our time is not mass destruction but the mass creation of new, ever
more vital and virulent images and life-forms. The epithet for our times,
then, is not the modernist saying "things fall apart," but the even more
ominous slogan "things come alive." Artists, technicians, and scientists
have always been united in the imitation of life, the production
of images and mechanisms that have, as we say, "lives (and desires)
of their own." Perhaps this moment of accelerated stasis in history,
when we feel caught between the utopian fantasies of biocybernetics
and the dystopian realities of biopolitics, between the rhetoric of the
post-human and the real urgency of universal human rights, is a moment
given to us for rethinking just what our lives, and our arts, are for.

what passes for reasoning in human cloning:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Repugnance is often an emotional bearer of deep wisdom, beyond reason's
power fully to articulate it. Can anyone really give an argument fully
adequate to the horror which is father-daughter incest (even with consent)
or having sex with animals or eating human flesh, or even just raping
or murdering another human being? Would anyone's failure to give full
rational justification for his revulsion at these practices make that
revulsion ethically suspect? Not at all. In my view, our repugnance at
human cloning belongs in this category.

The notion of digitization as a universal solvent has been a commonplace
in media studies, from Marshall McLuhan's vision of an electrified
global village, to Friedrich Kittler's claim that "any medium can be
translated into any other" in the age of computers. See <i>Gramaphone
Film Typewriter</i> (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999),
2. This sort of statement underestimates the effects and difficulties of
translation. The age of cybernetic "communication" and "translatability"
would be better described as an electronic Babel in which every device
requires an intermediate device to speak to every other device. I'm happy
to see, in this regard, that new media theorists like Lev Manovich are
now rejecting the digital as a master term, but I'm not reassured by
Manovich's substitution of the "programmable," since that only raises
the dialectical problem of the unprogrammable. See <i>The Language of
New Media</i> (Cambridge, Mass. : MIT Press, 2001).

The robot boy, David, of Spielberg's <i>AI</i> is thus much more
disturbing than the new model terminator, whose skills never enlist
audience sympathy, even in his moment of spectacular "melt-down,"
when he morphs rapidly through all the personas he has adopted during
the film. Perhaps the most terrifying moment in the film is when the
Terminator impersonates the voice of the son, and then the body of his
mother, playing both sides of the Oedipal drama that structures <i>AI.</i>

One could debate whether Benjamin intended "mechanical" reproduction
in its strictest sense; the key word in the title of his essay could
also be translated&#8212;or even transliterated&#8212;as "technical,"
not mechanical. This translation has now achieved a kind of independent
authority, however, and in any case the claim that we are dealing with new
forms of "technical reproduction" (biocybernetic rather than mechanical)
would still obtain.

It seems clear that postmodernism has now become a historicist, period
term for the era beginning with the 1960s and ending somewhere around
the fall of the Berlin wall, roughly 1968-1990. My sense is that it
had its greatest leverage on historical thinking in the 1980s, when it
served as the rallying point for numerous projects in the critique of
politics and culture.

Evonne Levy raises an interesting question about Laura Stein's tomato
in relation to the artistic tradition of idealization. The notion of
an idealizing function for the artist, as a perfecter and improver of
images (and perhaps of life-forms) seems to be displaced by work of
this sort by an idealization of the biological scientist, who works
to improve species through genetic engineering. Does this mean that
the artist now is mainly consigned to counter-images of idealization,
in which the "improvements" promised by genetics are critiqued, mocked,
and satirized by the artist? Or is there still room for a positive role
for the artist in the age of biocybernetics?

Recall here Walter Benjamin's claim that Atget photographed the empty
Paris streets "like scenes of a crime" . Hirst does something
similar, I suspect, with enigmatic installations that elicit a forensic
response from the beholder. What Hirst's "pictures" want, then, is
precisely a decoding, a tabulating of clues, traces, and indices that
lead the spectator to the construction of a scenario or narrative.
