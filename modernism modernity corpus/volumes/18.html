With this in mind, this special issue assays the value of the archive: it ponders the merits of archival remains, including offcuts, first drafts, notes, proofs, correspondence, and assesses the worth of the research that this material allows. Beckett reliably deprecates the value of his writing. The letters to Thomas McGreevy play ceaselessly on the execrable and excremental worth of his literary efforts, and a letter of August 1931 to Charles Prentice implies that a well-crafted work would be nothing more than a well-turned turd, “twice round the pan &amp; pointed at both ends.”</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"><Sup>3 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Similarly, the later lament that “every word is like an unnecessary stain on silence and nothingness,” suggests something spilt or leaked, as if writing were an effluent.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"><Sup>4 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">But the ferocious negation that resounds in Beckett’s oeuvre so troubles the basis of value that the valueless becomes valuable, failure becomes success, and each might, at any moment and recursively, turn into its antithesis. Failing may be bettered or worsened—if they were ever different options—and there may be no more economical way to spend words than by wasting them. The same ambiguity that sees failure as a form of success characterizes the value of the archive itself. For the archive is prefigured in one of Beckett’s most iconic—and thus valued—props: an ashcan. An archive is a dumping ground, where unpublished documents and unwanted scraps reside while final drafts and unabandoned works fill bookshelves, newspapers, examinations, and readers. The archive’s content is that which the author casts off as inessential, whether sold on or donated. But the process of archiving—of taking these resources in—is primarily one of a reversal very much like those found in Beckett’s work. The archive sees by-products and exuviae as its special treasure. Responding to Beckett’s statement to Jacoba van Velde that “There are two moments worthwhile in writing; the one where you start and the other where you throw it in the waste-paper basket” the archivist must add a third: when it is fished back out.</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:5.8pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"><Sup>5 </Sup></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">For the archive has the eye of all those disdained and now defunct trades: the night soil man, the rag-and-bone man, or even the soap maker, who would collect ash for lye. What is no longer of use to the maker is of particular use to them. If archival resources are increasingly the fertilizer—more waste made good—with which modernist scholarship is grown, as is clearly the case in Beckett studies, they are frequently boosted by authorial intervention. Cast-offs are often re-authorized by having been donated, and the archive’s own authority bestowed by the author who directs his or her false starts to a good home. For the archive is a space of such in</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">vestment that nothing there can be valueless. To be there is to be made special. This transforming function belongs both to the author and the archive, the manufacturer and purchaser, as Beckett knew and played with. If we consider some of the more unusual manuscripts held by archives of his work, it seems he quite understood what it means to collect artifacts and manuscripts. Scribbles on whiskey labels and disposable tablecloths are particularly special: archival showpieces where Benjamin’s aura can still get a good foothold.

The doodles, annotations, emendations, letters, diaries, and notes are enlivening not only Beckett’s texts, but Beckett himself. Together with biographies and memoirs, these documents mean that Beckett is more alive now than he has been since he was </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">actually </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">alive. This impression is further cultivated by the drip-feed of unpublished texts into the public domain, which has seen him become newly prolific. While scholars have known about these texts for a long time, the moment of academic discovery in a reading room is now being restaged on a much larger scale. To the casual observer Beckett is writing again, and he does his work in the archive. </SPAN></P><P style="text-align:left; margin-bottom:0px; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">Of course such claims are all rhetorical flourish in the sense that the recent publi</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">cations contain old works whose preparation and authorization—by the estate rather than the author—has finally come to fruition.

Beckett’s early essay “Dante . . . Bruno.Vico..Joyce” sees him hesitate before the conceptual cocktail to be made of Joyce’s “Work in Progress.” He asks “Must we wring the neck of a certain system in order to stuff it into a pigeon-hole, or modify the dimensions of that pigeon-hole for the satisfaction of the analogy-mongers?

Theory’s decline is itself presaged in Beckett’s skepticism towards contemporary philosophy’s power as literary criticism. Dismissing the relevance of existentialism to his work, he made clear that his writing is intrinsically, rather than incidentally, literary: “I wouldn’t have had any reason to write my novels if I could have expressed their subject in philosophic terms.” Beckett not only refuses Sartre or Camus, but philosophy’s explanatory function, as “There’s no key or problem” (</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">BCH, </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">217) to be found or solved in his writing. But this same doubt resists the grip of any single methodological successor. Indeed, despite the rapid expansion of “genetic criticism” in the preparation and study of Beckett’s unpublished writings, the majority of new work combines detailed manuscript study with philosophical, psychological, contextual, biographical, historical, and performance-based approaches. The variety of critical forms mirrors the newly apparent diversity of Beckett’s writing. In the face of diaries, letters, notebooks, and drafts, the insufficiency of a single interpretative stance is more obvious than ever. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-bottom:20px; margin-right:34px; text-indent:16px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">The act of critical recovery—making something of the cast-off—is actively encour</SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F"></SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">aged by Beckett, and is shared by his strongest readers.

The appropriate character for the Beckettian scenario is one who is prepared to rifle through the bins to find the right item, but also ready to throw back the grubby manuscript when the job is done. This both resembles and surpasses the task of the archivist. For if, as suggested above, Beckett’s textual waste finds a good home in the archive, such a home is one that </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">won’t </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">treat waste with the respect it deserves, but with a whole lot more. </SPAN></P><P style="margin-bottom:10px; margin-left:31px"><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; font-size:8pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">MODERNISM / </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:11pt; font-style:italic; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">modernity </SPAN></P><P style="margin-bottom:34px; margin-left:31px; text-indent:-30px; line-height:18px"><SPAN style="font-family:'sans-serif', 'GillSans'; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">678 </SPAN><SPAN style="font-family:'serif', 'New Caledonia', serif; font-size:10pt; font-weight:normal; color:#221E1F">In storing the old, the archive deepens and renews the familiar works of the modern canon.

<div class="abstract">
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span><p>If the direct and massive influence of Asia on Western literature of the last century were adequately acknowledged and researched, it would be possible to see Anglo-American Modernist poetry as part of a global, rather than a merely provincial, cultural development. This article demonstrates that imagist poetry, traditionally regarded as the first authentically Modernist literary initiative to appear in English, was in fact a response to a dramatic resurgence in pan-Asian cultural awareness that had begun in Tokyo during the closing years of the nineteenth century, and which spread across Eastern Asia and the Indian Subcontinent to reach Europe a few years before the onset of the First World War. A large quantity of previously unpublished documentary evidence is presented to show that the imagist experiments of Ezra Pound, Richard Aldington, Amy Lowell, and John Gould Fletcher were indebted to an engagement with Japanese visual culture that was far deeper than has ever previously been suggested. The venues for these seminal meetings between East and West were the museums of Britain and the United States.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="body">
<p>In the early years of the twentieth century, traditional Japanese culture underwent a resurgence that not only extended its influence beyond the nation's borders, but fundamentally affected the character of global Modernism as it was beginning to emerge in the art and literature of cities as distant as Calcutta, Boston, and especially London. For more than three decades, Japan had enjoyed under the regime of the Meiji Emperor an openness to international influences that had been systematically denied by the <span style="font-style:italic;">sakoku</span>, or "closed country," policy of the Tokugawa Shogunate that preceded it. Novelty had induced fascination, and European conventions of architecture, painting, and writing became increasingly fashionable amid the urban landscape of the new Imperial capital at Tokyo—with a population of nearly two million by 1905, one of the six largest cities in the world.</p>
<p>However infectious this fashion was, however, its products should not be seen as imitations of European styles, but rather as hybrid adaptations that anticipate the Western experiments with Japanese aesthetics that would follow them. Shimizu Kisuke II's design for the headquarters of Mitsui bank, constructed in 1872, is a good example. "The style of construction was diverse, with the lower floors consisting in a Western veranda featuring railings along with supporting columns of bronze," the important urban theorist Maeda Ai wrote of this building in the 1970s, "but above it all was placed a three-story tower styled like that of a Japanese castle complete with projecting gables."<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> Such deliberate and selective incorporation of Western styles and motifs is also visible in the literature of the period. The author Tsubouchi Shōyō,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> an erstwhile scholar of Russian culture, famously advocated the adoption of Western realist aesthetics in his 1885 critical work <span style="font-style:italic;">Shōsetsu Shinzui</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Essence of the Novel</span>), but retained the labyrinthine plotting conventions of Tokugawa literature in his own fiction, and translated the works of Shakespeare into the idiom of Kabuki theatre.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> In painting, Takahashi Yuichi and Harada Naojiro studied European techniques such as volumetric shading and vanishing-point perspective, but applied these to local motifs such as the <span style="font-style:italic;">oiran</span>, or female entertainer; and to devotional images of <span style="font-style:italic;">Kannon</span>, an aspect of the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara familiar throughout the history of East Asian art.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>By the turn of the century, the use of aesthetics and methods overtly derived from Europe had begun to seem distinctly passé to many members of the Tokyo avant-garde. "We love the poetry of our predecessors, both of the East and of the West," wrote the poet Yosano Tekkan; "but we cannot stoop to spade fields that they have already cultivated." Rather than engage in further adaptation of Western poetic genres, his magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Myōjō</span>, or "Morning Star," encouraged a reconceptualization of indigenous Japanese verse forms, particularly the thirty-one syllable <span style="font-style:italic;">tanka</span> format from which the more internationally famous seventeen-syllable <span style="font-style:italic;">haiku</span> is ultimately derived.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> Thinking along similar lines, the great art historian Okakura Kakuzō in 1898 founded the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nihon Bijutsuin</span>, or "Japan Fine Arts School," the country's first institution to offer formal academic training in traditional Japanese approaches to painting, sculpture, and design (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>). "Accustomed to accept the new without sacrificing the old, our adoption of Western methods has not so greatly affected the national life as is generally supposed," he wrote a few years later.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> "We were obliged to assimilate much that the Occident offered for our advancement and at the same time to resuscitate the classic ideals of the East."<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>It was Okakura who began the work of turning the tide of intercultural flow so that Asian concepts began to influence the West more strongly than vice versa. His first port of call was the rapidly industrialising city of Calcutta, where he was welcomed in 1902 by Abanindranath Tagore, nephew of the great Bengali poet Rabindranath and soon to be recognized as the city's most influential early Modernist painter. As a result of his stay there, he began to see all the cultures of India and China as forming a continuity that had been disrupted by historical events such as the devastating Islamic invasions of the former and the extension of Mongol hegemony over the latter. Japan, he thought, represented a repository of those two fundamental civilizations—a "museum of Asiatic civilisation" that could now be drawn upon to revitalize the contemporary culture of the continent.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> "The history of Japanese art," he wrote in his seminal volume <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ideals of the East</span>, "becomes thus the history of Asiatic ideals—the beach where each successive wave of Eastern thought has left its sand-ripple as it beat against the national consciousness."<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> In order to assist this revitalization, he brought two Japanese artists, Hishida Shunsō and Yokoyama Taikan, to Calcutta to exchange ideas with Abanindranath Tagore and his colleagues; from Taikan, Abanindranath learned the "wash technique" that would become his trademark, and began to experiment with motifs derived from Chinese classicism.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Though written in Calcutta and imbued with the spirit of pan-Asianism, Okakura's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ideals of the East</span> was composed in English and published in London and New York,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> suggesting that its target was a Western, rather than an Eastern, readership. One of its biggest fans was the poet and British Museum curator Laurence Binyon, regarded in the years leading up to the First World War as London's premier authority on Asian art. Binyon's first publication on the subject was a review of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ideals of the East</span> in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times Literary Supplement</span>, and references to this and to other writings by Okakura, whether overt or covert, permeated his subsequent output of lectures, articles, and books.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> Even as late as 1933, when he was invited to Harvard to give a series of lectures on the visual cultures of Japan, China, and India, Binyon was still able to begin one of his talks by quoting the opening phrase of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ideals of the East</span>—"Asia is one."<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup></p>

</div>
<p>In the audience at Binyon's earliest known lectures on the same topic—presented twenty seven years previously at the Royal Albert Hall in London's Kensington—there was a listener whose attendance would have profound implications for the development of Modernist poetry in the West: Ezra Pound. Pound had been introduced to Binyon  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> about a month and a half beforehand by their mutual publisher Elkin Mathews, and had doubtless been invited to the event by the speaker himself.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Pound's subsequent remark on the lectures in a letter to his mother—that he had found them "intensely interesting"—demonstrates the strength of their impact upon him.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>The nature of the introduction to East Asian culture received by Pound at the Albert Hall in 1909 has been a matter for intensive and varied speculation by poetry critics. Noel Stock began the guesswork in his biography of Pound in 1965, and only a few years ago Zhaoming Qian—the most prolific contemporary authority on Asian art and Modernist poetry—was able still to note that "the precise contents of the lecture[s] Pound heard in 1909 remain unknown."<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> In 2002, however, a seventy-five volume archive of Binyon's personal papers suddenly became available via the British Library that reveals not only what Binyon said during his talks, but also which lantern slides he projected onto the screen at the front of the hall. The process of dating these documents has not been made easy by Binyon's idiosyncratic practices as a lecturer. Because the fundamental structure of the lecture series changed little over the years, dog-eared pencil drafts are often found interleaved with newer pages written in ink or typed; the page-numbers of the older sheets having been amended to reflect their new position. These older pages are heavily annotated, with anachronisms crossed out or even excised with scissors. Those that have not been incorporated into later talks are strewn randomly throughout the archive, but continue to be datable via internal evidence to 1909 or thereabouts.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> The most compelling reason for thinking that these handwritten texts represent the Albert Hall lectures, however, is that their contents fit exactly with the handbill Binyon issued to advertise the series (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>). This document was discovered by John Hatcher among Binyon's papers at the Houghton Library at Harvard, and is reproduced in his 1991 biography <span style="font-style:italic;">Laurence Binyon: Poet, Scholar of East and West</span>.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> Most importantly, both the oldest manuscripts and the handbill are divided into just four lectures, whereas Binyon expanded the series to six after the First World War, and to seven by the time of the Harvard lectures.</p>
<p>Two aspects of Binyon's 1909 lectures stand out as significant for the future development of Modernist poetry in the West. The first is their tendency to juxtapose particularly productive epochs in civilizations remote from one another in time and space in an attempt to uncover correspondences. Lecture Two, for example, investigates the societal conditions that appear to bring on a cultural renaissance—a subject soon to become a key concern of London's Modernists. The discussion begins with the dramatic literary and artistic developments sponsored by Japan's Ashikaga Shoguns—again with most of its observations lifted from <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ideals of the East</span>—but goes on to create direct analogies between these and the Italian Renaissance in fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Florence.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> Pound must have found Binyon's narrative strategy equally as compelling as the information on East Asian art itself, for he would later use a comparable system of "subject rhymes" to give structure to the eclectic historical sweep of his <span style="font-style:italic;">Cantos</span> project.</p>

<p class="continued">to concentrate is of the strongest interest. Considering the wide scope of the Albert Hall lectures, there is a disproportionate concentration on the <span style="font-style:italic;">ukiyo-e</span>, or "floating world," school whose intricate woodblock prints were popular in Japan from the late eighteenth through the nineteenth centuries. The same bias also determined Binyon's choice of illustrations for <span style="font-style:italic;">Epochs of Chinese and Japanese Art</span>, a posthumous 1912 publication by that most famous of all Western scholars of East Asian culture, Ernest Fenollosa.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> Binyon included no less than fifty <span style="font-style:italic;">ukiyo-e</span> prints as illustrations in the volume, when—ironically—Fenollosa's text runs down the movement, contrasting its popularity in pointedly negative terms with the elitist academic traditions of Japanese painting that had preceded it.</p>
<p>The fact is that Binyon was rather obsessive about <span style="font-style:italic;">ukiyo-e</span> prints; his concern with collecting them for the British Museum operating, in the words of his biographer, "at a deeper level than was necessary for his curatorial duties."<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> At the time Pound met him, Binyon was concluding an unprecedented series of exactly such acquisitions, having purchased several thousand prints—the bulk of the museum's renowned present-day collection—between 1906 and 1909. Binyon's lecture manuscripts show that he often encouraged his audience to follow up their viewing of his lantern slides by visiting the Prints and Drawings Students Room at the British Museum—affectionately known as "The Print Room"—to see the originals.</p>
<p>New evidence from the British Museum archives shows that Pound had already visited the Print Room twice between his first meeting with Binyon and his attendance at the Albert Hall lectures; and that he would do so on three further occasions before the end of 1909. There are two reasons for thinking that these visits were made in the company of Binyon. The first is that entry to the Print Room required completion of a lengthy membership application that required references and a waiting period of at least one month. There was not enough time between Pound's first meeting with Binyon and his first two visits to the facility on the ninth and the twelfth of February for these formalities to have been completed.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> The second is that Binyon—who often signed visitors who were not members into the Print Room attendance register personally—entered Pound's name in his own distinctive copperplate handwriting on two of the young poet's 1909 visits.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> The Print Room was where Binyon engaged in sorting the enormous horde of new acquisitions and taking notes on it for the comprehensive catalog that would take him until 1916 to prepare.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> It is inconceivable under these circumstances that he did not show choice specimens to Pound and discuss them with him, but nothing about the Print Room, or indeed specifically about East Asian art, appears in Pound's published or unpublished writings until three years later. It would take time for Pound to realize the potential value of Japanese visual art to his poetic development, but when he did, the Print Room would be his first port of call.</p>
<p>The received wisdom about East Asian influences on imagist poetry is that these came via published translations of traditional Japanese verse forms owned by F. S. Flint and imitated by him and T. E. Hulme. New evidence, however, points to a much more significant and direct role in the story for <span style="font-style:italic;">ukiyo-e</span> prints. Flint's and Hulme's poetry group met throughout 1909 with the objective of creating similar contemporary  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> adaptations of traditional <span style="font-style:italic;">tanka</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">haiku</span> forms to the ones attempted by <span style="font-style:italic;">fin de siècle</span> Japanese poets such as Yosano Tekkan. At this point in time, though, Pound was equally prepared to dismiss these innovations as he had been to ignore the possibilities held out by Japanese visual art in the British Museum. Flint himself noted that the younger poet had attended the 1909 meetings, but had "added nothing to the discussion," insisting instead on talking about his translations from the troubadours of medieval Europe.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> When Pound later published these last as <span style="font-style:italic;">Canzoni</span> in 1911, however, his sometime literary mentor Ford Madox Ford ridiculed them as a "jejune provincial effort," and advised him to update his poetic idiom to something more fashionable as a matter of great urgency.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Pound's decision to publish some of Hulme's experiments as an appendix to his own <span style="font-style:italic;">Ripostes</span> volume the following fall shows that he had begun to come around to the idea of looking beyond the borders of Europe for such inspiration. These were exactly the poems of Hulme's that Flint referred to as "little Japanese pictures," emphasizing the intimate connections between that culture's visual art and its poetry. <span style="font-style:italic;">Ukiyo-e</span> prints were often produced to illustrate well-known stanzas that were then inscribed at the top of the print itself; while historical poets such as Yosa Buson, one of whose short poems Flint used as an example in a seminal essay on Japanese verse, typically painted or drew mental images as <span style="font-style:italic;">haiga</span>—visual poems—before translating these into words.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Interestingly, the idea that Japanese visual aesthetics could be just as important to avant-garde poetry in the West as Japanese verse conventions seems to have occurred first not to Pound but to another of London's early Modernists—Richard Aldington.</p>
<p>Aldington derived the imagery of "The River," one of the showcase pieces in Pound's <span style="font-style:italic;">Des Imagistes</span> anthology, directly from "a couple of Japanese colour prints" in "the B.M. Print Room."<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> Though these verses did not become public until they appeared without a title in the January 1914 edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Poetry</span> magazine, the paper trail he left behind tells us that Aldington wrote the poem during the fall of 1912—around the time that Pound officially announced the existence of the imagist movement in the same <span style="font-style:italic;">Ripostes</span> volume that incorporated Hulme's "little Japanese Pictures." Aldington first stepped into the Print Room on the twenty-eighth of August, making no fewer than five visits there before the end of the following month.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> Because he did not go back again until 1915, "The River" must have been composed during this period, probably during the three consecutive days he spent there from the twenty-fourth to the twenty-sixth of September. The text of the poem was printed in <span style="font-style:italic;">Poetry</span> as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>I have drifted along this river<br>Until I moored my boat<br>By these crossed trunks.</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>Here the mist moves<br>Over fragile leaves and rushes,<br>Colourless waters and brown, fading hills. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>You have come from beneath the trees<br>And move within the mist,<br>A floating leaf.</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>O blue flower of the evening,<br>You have touched my face<br>With your leaves of silver.</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>Love me, for I must depart.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup></p></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">"The landscape was certainly Hokusai's," he told the poetry critic Earl Miner later; "the second one I don't remember, obviously a girl, perhaps an Outamaro [Utamaro], perhaps a Toyokuni."<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup></p>
<p>It is a simple matter to locate the first print, not least because Aldington's ekphrasis of it is comprehensive enough to allude to its physical condition as well as describing its motif. Katsushika Hokusai's <span style="font-style:italic;">Suwa in Shinano Province</span> forms part of the artist's early nineteenth-century series <span style="font-style:italic;">Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji</span>, the British Museum's collection of which had been completed by Binyon in 1908 (<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>). It shows a pair of crossed trees on a headland, with a boat to one side on what are—in the version Aldington saw—quite literally colorless waters. Woodblock prints are prone to blanching when they are exposed to moisture or light, and the blue shading in the Print Room's particular impression has almost completely faded away.</p>
<p>The content of the latter part of Aldington's poem suggests that he may also have been examining some of the museum's racier holdings. Among Kitagawa Utamaro's most noteworthy products are his books of <span style="font-style:italic;">shunga</span>, or "spring pictures," a euphemism in Japanese art for erotic images of courtesans and their clients in the Yoshiwara pleasure district of old Tokyo. The British Museum owned a copy of the most highly regarded of these, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Utamakura</span>, or "Pillow Poem," but Binyon kept it out of his official 1916 catalog for fear of disturbing Edwardian notions of propriety. The most famous of these images shows a man having sex with a woman wearing a midnight blue kimono adorned with stylized silver and bronze fall leaves, while her small hands touch the face of her lover (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>). The sexual urgency of Aldington's final appeal, to "love me, for I must depart," may also be felt in the suggestive poem that Utamaro has inscribed on the lover's outspread fan: "Its beak caught firmly / In the clam shell, / The snipe cannot / Fly away / Of an autumn evening."<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup></p>
<p>One reason for the sudden perceived relevance of Japanese culture to avant-garde undertakings in general was the rapidly changing view of the country in Europe during the years leading up to the First World War. The idea of Japan as a forward-looking civic society and industrial powerhouse rather than a picturesque and exotic backwater had been acknowledged by the West only since the crushing defeat of Russia by the Japanese armed forces in Manchuria in 1905. "The average Westerner was wont to regard Japan as barbarous while she indulged in the gentle arts of peace," Okakura Kakuzō remarked caustically the following year, "he calls her civilized since she began to commit wholesale slaughter on Manchurian battlefields."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> The new status of Japan as <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">a global power was reinforced in the summer of 1910, when the Japanese government put on a large-scale exposition of architecture, visual art, and landscape gardening in London. This attracted more than eight million visitors, making it the best attended such event held in Britain up to that date. Ford Madox Ford liked it so much that he went along twice, later publishing the following impression:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>[I] came out in a great square of white buildings all outlined in white light. There were crowds and crowds of people—or no, there was spread out beneath the lights, an infinitely moving mass of black, with white faces lifted up to the light, moving slowly, quickly, not moving at all, being obscured, reappearing …<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>This curious description brings us to the most famous imagist piece of all: Pound's "In a Station of the Metro." It cannot possibly be a coincidence that on the day following Richard Aldington's string of three consecutive visits to the British Museum Print Room, Pound's signature appears in the register there for the first time in three years; nor that the following "<span style="font-style:italic;">hokku</span>-like"<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> poem was sent off to <span style="font-style:italic;">Poetry</span> magazine a very short time later:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>The apparition of these faces in a crowd,<br>Petals on a wet, black bough.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Japanese art and literature has always maintained an obsessive fascination with the ephemeral beauty of <span style="font-style:italic;">sakura</span>—the cherry blossoms of spring—and scenes featuring them appear with great regularity as <span style="font-style:italic;">ukiyo-e</span> motifs. In Hokusai's <span style="font-style:italic;">Poem by Ono no Komachi</span>, for example, a print acquired by Binyon just before Pound's first ever visit to the Print Room, an old woman is shown sweeping up the pale petals, which litter the ground and then cling to the rain-wet cherry wood of the tree's branches (<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>). Binyon liked this artwork so much that he had the poem on it translated, and included the English version in his 1916 catalog:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>While I have been sauntering through<br>    the world, looking upon its vanities, lo!<br>    My flower has faded and the time of the long rains come.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p>The print is part of a series of Hokusai's illustrating the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hyakunin isshu</span>—"One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets"—probably the best-known verse anthology in Japanese literature. Ono no Komachi was a great beauty of the ninth-century Fujiwara court, whom Pound had already heard described in Binyon's Albert Hall lectures as "the most famous of all the poetesses of Japan."<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> Her numerous early works take romantic love as their subject, while later verses such as the example above reflect upon the brevity of life and beauty and the exigencies of old age. There are several Japanese plays about Komachi, and it is interesting that Pound and W. B. Yeats chose to begin their <span style="font-style:italic;">Noh</span> theatre adaptations the following fall with two of these—the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sotoba Komachi</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Kayoi Komachi</span>—both of which express the same feelings of ephemerality and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> loss as the poem inscribed on Hokusai's print. "Have spent the day in searches," Pound wrote to his fiancée Dorothy Shakespear during the first week of 1913; "I contemplated mediaeval Japanese prints at the B.M. and feel ages older and wiser."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup></p>

<p>If anything, the vogue for basing imagist poetry on <span style="font-style:italic;">ukiyo-e</span> prints intensified as the American poets John Gould Fletcher and Amy Lowell became associated with the movement. Fletcher, a resident of London, derived the imagery of his 1914 <span style="font-style:italic;">Symphony in White</span> from "contemplation of some snow scene prints by Hiroshige."<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> He could not have looked at these at the British Museum, for, as Pound had complained to Shakespear late in 1914, "the Print Room B.M. is closed forever."<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> Due to Binyon's mania for acquisition, the department's holdings had become too large for their original premises, and were being shifted to more spacious accommodation in the institution's newly-constructed northern wing. The British Museum was not the only place in London with an <span style="font-style:italic;">ukiyo-e</span> collection, however, and Pound was quick to ask Dorothy, "is there anything at the S. Kensington?"<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup></p>
<p>By coincidence, London's Victoria and Albert Museum—sometimes named after its location in South Kensington—was about to open "an important loan exhibition of Japanese Colour-Prints" featuring seven of the snow prints by Hiroshige that would so attract John Gould Fletcher's attention for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Symphony in White</span>.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> These included an edition of one of the printmaker's acknowledged masterworks, the rare triptych <span style="font-style:italic;">Mountain Streams of the Kiso Road</span> (<a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>)—a striking image of meltwater snaking between glacial masses, which may well have inspired Fletcher's lines "Through thin blue crevasses, / Trickles an icy stream." Another print on display was Hiroshige's <span style="font-style:italic;">Kambara</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">under Snow</span> (<a name="7-text" href="#7"> 7</a>)—an elegant depiction of a snowbound village which seems to have given Fletcher "Under their heaped snow eaves, / Leaden houses shiver." Most interesting of all, however, is the fact that Fletcher, like Aldington, makes a reference in his poem to the physical characteristics of the museum exhibits that inspired it. "O that the white scroll of heaven might be rolled up," he writes at the end of the piece, perhaps to remind the reader that <span style="font-style:italic;">ukiyo-e</span> prints were modeled on hanging scrolls and were traditionally rolled for storage. Fletcher's tendency to produce what were often little more than direct descriptions of such works intensified over the year that followed, even as Pound was shifting his own interest in East Asian culture away from Japanese art and towards Chinese poetry. Back in the United States in 1915, he spent a week in February at the Chicago Art Institute writing a series of short, <span style="font-style:italic;">tanka</span>-like poems based on his impressions of particular prints on display there. When he published these a year later with the assistance of Amy Lowell, he even named the volume <span style="font-style:italic;">Japanese Prints</span>.</p>

<p>The form and content of Lowell's own imagist work closely follows that of Fletcher's in its development. After returning to the United States from London in 1916, she wrote a poem about the urban center of Boston that features a fairly subtle incorporation of the straight-ruled black lines used by Hiroshige to represent rain falling on the streets of Tokyo:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Cross hatchings of rain against gray walls<br>Slant lines of black rain<br>In front of the up and down, wet stone sides of buildings.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">At Boston's Museum of Fine Art, the person in charge of Asian visual culture between 1904 and 1913 had been none other than Okakura Kakuzō. He had strongly encouraged the institution's acquisition of <span style="font-style:italic;">ukiyo-e</span> prints in addition to ensuring that they were kept on permanent display in the exhibition galleries. Hiroshige's <span style="font-style:italic;">Night Rain at Karasaki</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Driving Rain at Shono</span> were acquired shortly after Okakura's death in 1913, and probably suggested both the aesthetics and the title of Lowell's poem, which is named "Afternoon Rain in State Street."</p>

<p>After helping Fletcher to publish his <span style="font-style:italic;">Japanese Prints</span> later in 1916, Lowell's poetic adaptation of Japanese imagery became noticeably more overt and conspicuous. Early the following year, she submitted a collection named <span style="font-style:italic;">Lacquer Prints</span> to <span style="font-style:italic;">Poetry</span> magazine which, much in the manner of Fletcher's volume, comprised what are basically ekphrastic descriptions of individual <span style="font-style:italic;">ukiyo-e</span> works.<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> One of these short pieces, titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Road to the Yoshiwara</span>, provides an excellent example:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Coming to you along the Nihon Embankment<br>Suddenly the road was darkened<br>By a flock of wild geese<br>Crossing the moon.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Critic David Ewick has said that the visual ingredients of this poem "are perfectly selected to remind of <span style="font-style:italic;">hokku</span>," but they are actually all drawn directly from <span style="font-style:italic;">Nihon Embankment, Yoshiwara</span>—the final print in Hiroshige's celebrated <span style="font-style:italic;">One Hundred Views of Edo</span> series (<a name="8-text" href="#8"> 8</a>).<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> Hiroshige's title provides the initial clue to this relationship, and the image itself may be seen to feature every one of the visual elements described by Lowell.</p>
<p>The fact that the first recognisably Modernist school of Anglo-American poetry depended so heavily on interpretation of visual art from a culture on the other side of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the planet serves to illustrate an important point with regard to the evolution of the movement in a wider context. Far from representing an essentially Western initiative with its roots in Europe, Modernism should be seen as a product of the complex cultural interplay between metropolitan centers across the globe, with aesthetic and technical concepts flowing at least as vigorously from East to West as vice versa. While the late nineteenth century was characterized by an uptake of European conventions of literature and visual art in cities such as Calcutta and Tokyo, the early twentieth century saw an equal and opposite reaction, with sculptors, painters, poets, and architects in London, Paris, Boston, and Chicago adapting Asian forms in order to revitalize what by that time had come to be regarded as a moribund Western tradition. The earliest manifestations of Modernism, then, were transcultural to a far greater extent than has previously been acknowledged, and should be seen as the beginnings of a human, rather than a merely regional, cultural milieu.</p>

<div class="abstract">
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span><p>The scrapbook was an important vehicle for the chronicling of personal history and the negotiation of identity in a culture of mass print, frequently modeling other modern cultural and literary forms. This essay argues that Marianne Moore's early scrapbooks informed both the subject matter and the form of her developing collage poetry in their material display of juxtaposition, assemblage, pasting-over, anchoring, and enjambment. In doing so, it challenges the common critical notion that the collage poem was an exclusive extension of the visual avantgarde, pointing to a popular scrapbooking tradition as basis for poetic collage.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="body">
<p>In "A Crystal for the Metaphysical," her review of Marianne Moore's 1966 poetry collection <span style="font-style:italic;">Tell Me, Tell Me: Granite, Steel and Other Topics</span>, Muriel Rukeyser meditates on the strategies of what has generally been called poetic collage:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The poet who believes in the materials of the world—written material—in such a way that his desire to include drives him to use them selectively, but in their own voice, is at once faced with questions. How to claim, to make the material one's own, and still leave it to walk among its origins? The traditional assertion that all materials belong to the artist is true in a sense. This is actually an assertion that the artist does not want to own the world but to use the world. It includes the entire range of life in horror and love.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">While Rukeyser's description is most immediately occasioned by Moore's new collection and prompted at least in part by Moore's own depiction of her "hybrid poetics,"<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> the passage strains to explain the importance of quotation in the modern poem more generally and the modern poets (herself included) who wrote them. Rukeyser's definition is a capacious one. As she writes in an unpublished draft to the review, "[T]he question of the bringing to poetry primary materials contains several elements. It is partly the question with which we are trained in school to harvest, to acknowledge, to make one's own—the question of research, learning, and footnotes. It is partly the question of the film editor who is incorporating a stock shot, of how to make  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the sequence so that the film has unity; even the technical question of how to make a smooth splice."<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The critical history of the modern collage poem, however, has not been so far-ranging. It has typically assumed that the modern collage poem grew exclusively out of the visual avant-garde. As Marjorie Perloff has asserted, "collage, perhaps the central artistic invention of the <span style="font-style:italic;">avant guerre</span>, incorporates directly into the work an actual fragment of the referent, thus forcing the reader or viewer to consider the interplay between preexisting message or material and the new artistic composition that results from the graft."<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> The connection helps to explain, among other things, the rise of poetic quotation, which is distinguished from the long tradition of poetic allusion—Shelley to Dante, Dante to Virgil, Virgil to Homer—in that it not only incorporates previous ideas, but the precise wording of those ideas (in their original languages) as well, giving the poem what Leonard Diepeveen calls its "texture."<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> The collage techniques of the visual avant-garde would seem, then, to be the shining example for the verbal artist looking to subvert tradition and authority, bringing the "real world" into the realm of the poem, just as the visual artist frames it and hangs it on the wall.</p>
<p>Perloff runs into trouble, however, when she specifically addresses poetic collage. She argues that collage is "by definition, a visual or spatial concept, but it was soon absorbed into the verbal … But perhaps because verbal, as opposed to visual, collage must be understood metaphorically (words and phrases are not literally pasted and glued together)."<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> To say that poetic collage must be understood metaphorically, however, concedes too much ground. In denying the spatial dimension of language and severing poetry from its particular material history—the fact that it frequently <span style="font-style:italic;">was</span> literally pasted and glued together—Perloff makes the poetic a shadow of the visual, a disenfranchised second-hand invention. Nevertheless, this has remained the dominant interpretation of poetic collage, espoused in such studies as Bonnie Costello's <span style="font-style:italic;">Planets on Tables</span>, and clung to even when other, perhaps more fitting, models are readily available.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> It has been an especially corrupting influence on studies of Marianne Moore. Elisabeth Joyce, for example, commenting on articles that Moore clipped from the New York Armory Show and pasted into one of her early scrapbooks, draws on Perloff's understanding of collage to argue that:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>These articles compose a semicollage of the response to the show by presenting quotations from various critics with little or no introduction. Moore expresses her affinity to collage not only by this simple collection of articles about the cubist artists but also by her reshaping of these articles, her cutting out, rearranging, and altering them. There was no work of collage in the Armory Show because Picasso was just making his first one, <span style="font-style:italic;">Still Life with Chair Caning</span>, in 1912, when the show's curators were formulating the exhibition, but the impetus to develop collage techniques was apparent already in the cubist formulation. Moore reveals the influence of the visual arts not only through her scrapbook but through her use of collage in her poetry, especially in "Marriage" and "An Octopus."<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Moore certainly learned from the visual avant-garde (though this was by no means a one-way street), and in an effort to get a grip on her disciplinary digressions, her manipulation of paratextual elements, and her strategies of juxtaposition and quotation,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Moore's poems have often been compared to avant-garde visual artists such as Braque, Picasso and Joseph Cornell.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> But the influence seems almost <span style="font-style:italic;">too</span> pervasive: we are asked to believe that not only did Moore adapt her poetic technique from visual collage, but that she had anticipated a <span style="font-style:italic;">later</span> collage style by extrapolating from the rather different aims and evidence of cubism. Yet, Moore's poetry is still said to be <span style="font-style:italic;">indebted</span> to this (as of yet non-existent) style of collage! To her credit, Joyce is one of the few critics to have even considered Moore's scrapbooks in relation to her poetic production. In upholding a received history of collage, however, she fails to recognize fully that while the scrapbooks bear some functional relation to the art of the Armory Show, they are themselves potent sites of popular collage independent of the visual avant-garde.</p>
<p>I argue, however, that the scrapbook generally, and Moore's scrapbooks in particular, offers an alternative history of collage that calls into question the major assumptions of the historical avant-garde, while foregrounding the material dimension of language that Perloff is quick to dismiss. As I will show, this has important implications for our understandings of Marianne Moore's collage poetry and for our understandings of modern poetry more generally.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Scrapping Modernism</h1>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>A good book is fruitful of other books; it perpetuates its fame from age to age, and makes eras in the lives of its readers.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>The <span style="font-style:italic;">Oxford English Dictionary</span> defines the scrap-book as "a blank book in which pictures, newspaper cuttings, and the like are pasted for preservation," citing its earliest instance in a book of anecdotes, "The Scrap Book" from 1825. (Similarly, cutting appears in "press cutting," dated to 1857, and "clippings," as in the preservation of popular writers, dates to 1884.)<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> Popular books on scrapbooking, however, tend to locate the origins of the phenomenon with the publication of John Poole's popular 1832 <span style="font-style:italic;">Manuscript Gleanings and Literary Scrap Book, Original and Select</span>, designed "to supply the World of Literature and Fashion, and more especially the Fair portion of it, with an elegant and suitable Depository for those Selections which the reading of even the passing hour offers to its votaries."<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> In contrast to the earlier album or commonplace book, into which passages from reading were copied by hand, Poole's manufactured blank book took its cue from the cheap, plentiful, mechanical reproduction of texts and was specifically intended for the physical insertion of clippings. Other scrapbooks followed, some of which were quite large and ornate with gilded covers and bindings (though it was not unusual that scrapbookers would paste onto the pages of a book already in possession or seek out hefty volumes such as ledgers and government reports). Scrapbooks became popular enough to be advertised as a specialty item by the 1850s.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> Scrapbooking was also institutionalized in a number of ways: clipping services sprang up, allowing authors to track their reviews and the places where their work had been published; public institutions, such as libraries, began keeping scrapbooks composed of clippings from local newspapers as well.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>As part of an effort to reconsider the social and cultural impact of print-culture ephemera, a number of literary critics and historians have recently given close attention to the scrapbook's long and often marginalized history.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> Much of this scholarship highlights the scrapbook as an important vehicle for negotiating modern mass print culture through scrap juxtapositions and assemblages that resemble artistic collage. Jessica Helfand, for example, argues in <span style="font-style:italic;">Scrapbooks: An American History</span> that for the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century scrapbook (as opposed to the early nineteenth-century scrapbook, which tended to be more rigidly linear in its construction), the "language of collage offered the ideal imaginative outlet: it was at once playful and self-protective."<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> This material transformation was in line with a social one as "scrapbooks would migrate away from the realm of the domestic, toward a new, often socially alienated and arguably more internalized sense of self," producing "a fascinating study in pictorial assemblage in which less is <span style="font-style:italic;">never</span> more."<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> Similarly, the editors of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Scrapbook in American Life</span> explain that there is a historical coincidence between scrapbooking and collage, where "collage and its variant, montage, reached prominence during the time that scrapbooks first enjoyed great popularity."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> As they go on to claim:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>By the early twentieth century, the informal and highly personal scrapbook had infiltrated the public domain in the form of collage, described by art historians as among the first truly modern art forms … Scrapbook makers and artists grasped the idea of a fragmented world and expressed it through a scrap aesthetic. The arrangement of items in both collage art and scrapbooks functioned in much the same manner … Both creative forms reflected the modernist characteristics of rupture and multifaceted interpretation. Scrapbooks relied on the assemblage of images borrowed from diverse origins, often discovered by chance and reconstituted to create an entirely new context and meaning.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SAL</span>, 16)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The editors also make a point of explaining that while many men did in fact scrapbook, "in general, scrapbook and album making was considered a female activity, linked to traditional female concerns of holding families together and preserving nostalgic items" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SAL</span>, 10).</p>
<p>If the editors have not made the case strongly enough, allow me to connect the dots: the long historical trajectory of scrap-collage and the perception that it is a feminized practice strike a great blow to the long-held assumption that visual (and poetic) collage is the product of a masculinized avant-garde that burst onto the scene in the first decades of the twentieth century. Andreas Huyssen has famously explained, "it is indeed striking to observe how the political, psychological, and aesthetic discourse around the turn of the century consistently and obsessively genders mass culture and the masses as feminine, while high culture, whether traditional or modern, clearly remains the privileged realm of male activities."<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> These spheres are not only separate, however, but unequal. Huyssen goes on to claim that the problem with the distinction "is not the desire to differentiate between forms of high art and depraved forms of mass culture and its co-options. The problem is rather the persistent gendering as feminine of that which it devalues."<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup></p>
<p>Critics have often challenged Huyssen's feminizing of mass culture—as well as the separation of modernism and the historical avant-garde he borrows from Peter  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Bürger—as over-dichotomous distinctions, pointing to many examples that just don't fit the bill.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> Huyssen's point, however, is not that the practice itself is feminized; rather it is the surrounding discourse that feminizes the practice (scrapbooking being a prime example). I agree with this, but challenge Huyssen's claim from another angle, arguing that the problem is not that devalued cultural forms are gendered female, but that feminized forms are devalued. In the realm of modern poetry, this is the logic, perpetuated at least from Pound onward, that has either demonized the feminine or argued for Moore, along with H. D. and Mina Loy, as "masculine" poets, redeeming them for the historical avant-garde.</p>
<p>The editors of <span style="font-style:italic;">Scrapbook</span> go on to claim that "high-art collage contrasted with the scrapbook's low-art collage, which contained the private side of identity, the non-political and nonideological" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SAL</span>, 17). I am skeptical of this claim, which seems to echo much of the scholarship that sees scrapbooking as an anthologizing practice or the material residue of reader-response and cultural negotiation, but has fallen short of seeing it as a model for articulating further literary and cultural production. In contrast, I wish to suggest that scrapbooking is an important <span style="font-style:italic;">productive</span> practice in addition to being a receptive one. The scrapbooker is not simply a passive conduit for information, but an active participant in reshaping and re-presenting content. She highlights and exploits thematic or formal connections and differences, becoming a salient example of what Roland Barthes has pointed to as the death of the author and the rise of the scriptor. She provides a key heteroglossic site where different scraps are brought together, retaining their individual distinctions, but adopting new meaning through juxtaposition and recontextualization.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>This productive potential was often evident in the turn-of-the-century discourse surrounding scrapbooking. As one contributor to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Writer</span> suggested, we might argue that "all literature consists of snippets. Every book is but the record of a selection from the world of fact and thought, and why should any one insist that the author's own selection is peculiarly entitled to respect?"<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> Snipping was not always seen in a positive light, however, as when another article (somewhat ironically pasted into a scrapbook) claimed that:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>This is an imitative and not a creative age; why? Partially because we debauch ourselves with flippant, flitting dips into the multitude of articles that appear in the newspapers, periodicals, and books of the day. Concentration comes before creation; reading daily upon a multiplicity of topics does not inspire thought, it merely dissipates the understanding.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Attentive to both the potential and the pitfalls of finding individual voice in a culture of mass print, I argue that the scrapbook's productive possibilities would find one of its greatest expressions in the modern collage poem and especially in the collage poems of Marianne Moore. Before turning to the scrapbooks themselves, and to their importance for Moore's mature poems, however, I will examine the early, often overlooked, poetry in order to highlight the extent to which Moore was thinking deeply about cutting and pasting. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Pack-Rats and Poem-Scraps</h1>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>An over-fondness for quotations may betray a superficial rather than a thorough reader,—as if one had been, so to speak, at a literary banquet and brought away only the scraps.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>While a number of modern poets, including e. e. cummings, Hart Crane, W. C. Williams, Amy Lowell, and H. D., kept early scrapbooks foregrounding subjects and ideas they would later tackle in their poetry, Moore was particularly conscious of the influence scrapbooking had on her developing poetic sensibilities. When writing to her brother John Warner Moore of her poetic composition, for instance, she off-handedly reveals the importance of her source material: "between sorties I work on my poems. If some of them don't materialize this time in breakfast food, I'll kick my scrapbasket to California."<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> Of the early poems that did "materialize," a great many are about the act of scrapbooking itself (extending a long, undiscussed tradition of "scrapbooking poems" that were popular from the mid-nineteenth century onward). As Moore writes in "Holes Bored in a Workbag by the Scissors":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>A NEAT, round hole in the bank of the creek<br>            Means a rat;<br>                      That is to say craft, industry, resourcefulness:<br>                            While<br>These indicate the unfortunate, meek<br>          Habitat<br>                   Of surgery thrust home to fabricate useless<br>                          Voids<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">"Rat," the nickname Moore would claim for herself after reading <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wind in the Willows</span> (and carrying the connotation of "pack-rat"), doubles with the scissors as a means of opening a gash (in the body, the bank, the bag). The scissors, like claws in burrowing and the scalpel in surgery, become an instrument of (re)making (<span style="font-style:italic;">BMM</span>, 103). They craftily fabricate ("fabric" being here a key root word suggesting textile and text), but what they fabricate are habitats, spaces apart from the useful, places that can only be lived in through the force of habit. Similarly, the poet carves a place for poetry out of and apart from everyday language and materials. Moore's early free verse manipulates the white space on the page, using voids to point out the importance of the formal employment of spaces as well.</p>
<p>"Apropos of Mice," the poem originally published beneath "Holes Bored in a Workbag by the Scissors," implores:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>                                Come in, Rat, and eat with me;<br>                                One must occasionally—<br>                        If one would rate the rat at his true worth—Practice catholicity.</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>Cheesepairings and a porkrind<br>Stock my house—good of their kind <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <br>                                But were they not, you would oblige me?<br>                                Is Plenty, multiplicity?<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">BMM</span>, 103)</div></p></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Inviting Rat into her own neat space, the speaker encourages him to develop more catholic tastes, to find nourishment in different sources, just as different sources nourish the poem and Moore's overall aesthetic. Snooty cheese-pairings and pedestrian bags of pork rinds—markers of high and low culinary culture—become discarded scraps for the rat. The invitation to partake in these scraps is a constant one: eating cannot be done once and for all time, one needs to do so "occasionally," frequently making an occasion of it, making it ephemeral. Plenty is not multiplicity; it is sufficient to satisfy a need or get a point across, but it doesn't allow for variation, contradiction, proliferation. Reading this poem in conjunction with "Holes Bored in a Workbag by the Scissors" suggests how to draw upon sources and the catholicity with which sources must be drawn upon, so that, as Moore writes in another early poem, "Diligence Is to Magic as Progress Is to Flight," "aesthetic procedure … dubs them poetic necessities—not curios" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BMM</span>, 64).</p>
<p>Composition is itself a material act of pasting, as Moore suggests in an early poem, "Leaves of a Magazine":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>They open of their own will to the place<br>Where Captain Kidd stands with averted face<br>And folded arms, as solid as an oak,<br>His loosely knotted sash and scarlet cloak<br>Encircling him, and flapping in the breeze<br>That lines the withered, undulating seas.<br>Upon the page across from him, a frame<br>Of knives lie point to point about the name<br>Of a dim verse fantastically made<br>In praise of him,—a ragged block of shade;<br>A block of shade, with blurs and puckers where<br>Admiring hands have often brought to bear<br>Their pressure on the picture and the rhyme<br>Of buccaneering in the olden time.</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">BMM</span>, 347)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The poem conflates the historical captain Kidd with this particular representation of Kidd, collapsing the two into a single referent that is juxtaposed against the verses in praise of him—a kind of second-order representation that confirms the conflation as it points to both the historical re and the "ragged block of shade." To further complicate things, Moore's lyric encompasses this dialogic interaction in its own representation of the assemblage as a whole—an early attempt to bring mass cultural heteroglossia into her work—so that the poem itself becomes a made thing, confirmed by the (supposedly) actual magazine leaves to which it refers. The poem can be read as a commentary on the collage already evident by then in such magazines as <span style="font-style:italic;">Tit-Bits</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">Life</span> ,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Punch</span>  that Moore was reading at the time. But the "admiring hands" that have brought their pressure to bear on the relationship between picture and rhyme suggest an active physical process such as scrapbooking that literally presses these leaves together in their pasting and metaphorically stresses their connection. While these generally overlooked poems do not for the most part demonstrate the collage techniques of the mature poetry that, as I am arguing, was still being worked out in the scrapbooks, they do grow out of Moore's deliberate engagement with a culture of mass print and help to inform Moore's scrapping practices. With those practices and that print context in mind, I will now turn to the scrapbooks themselves.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Making Marianne</h1>
<p>Marianne Moore produced two major scrapbooks between the formative years 1909–1914, corresponding to and illuminating what Patricia Willis has called a "rather hidden life for Marianne, the years between college and her first appearance in a little magazine."<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> The scrapbooks, now housed at the Rosenbach Museum and Library in Philadelphia, not only helped chronicle the major moments of her life, but as this was the time when Moore was developing her literary sensibilities and finding her characteristic poetic voice, they are invaluable as a <span style="font-style:italic;">Künstlerroman</span> as well, exposing subjects, themes, source materials and stylistic innovations that would inform much of Moore's later poetry.</p>
<p>In many ways, however, these scrapbooks are quite typical. Moore used modest, commercially produced matte-black books, labeled "Scrap Album" front and center. The construction-paper pages are crumbling and have become detached from their binding. Clippings from the scrapbooks have become loose, and some are now preserved in cellophane sleeves. Like many scrapbookers, Moore preserved materials of sentimental value. Her scrapbooks contain various personal items: letters of invitation to Bryn Mawr social events; photos of Lake Placid where Moore worked a stint for Melvil Dewey; a Library of Congress reading card requesting Willard Fiske's <span style="font-style:italic;">Dante</span>; correspondences from William Alexander of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ladies' Home Journal</span>; the letter from the United States Civil Service Commission, Washington DC explaining that her "request providing for an examination for business teacher (male)" for the Carlisle Indian School could not be accepted. And, tucked into a home-made envelope with a watercolor painting of a sparrow and a tree in spring, a copy of a short biography and follow-up letter sent to Harriet Monroe of <span style="font-style:italic;">Poetry</span> regarding her first accepted verses.</p>
<p>Moore also kept little mementos in these pages, like sketches of skunks and wolves, construction-paper cutouts of butterflies and birds, and a "Valentine's-day Owl." The vast majority of the pages, however, are made up of clippings from a handful of newspapers and magazines, as well as a few pamphlets and other printed ephemera.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> As such, the scrapbook exemplifies what Willis points to as Moore's "life-long habits: a choice of subject matter close at hand and conservation of poetic material for later use."<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> It is certainly tempting to read these clippings against specific poetic lines. Did Moore think back to the article "Hobs vs. Creepers for Ice Work" when she conjured  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> up "An Octopus / of ice"? How much did she return to those newspaper pictures of Abbeys and Cathedrals as she reconstructed her "England?"<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> These are questions certainly worth investigation, some of which I will do here. But beyond speculating on a bibliographic genealogy of any particular poem, I will point to the ways in which the scrapbooks stage a general process of accumulation and reinforce our notions of a poet thinking deeply about her poems, where she may meditate on a subject or image for years before it emerges in verse.</p>
<p>The scrapbooks reveal the myriad subjects that Moore would return to throughout her life, limning the major contours of a developing artist who worked, as Elizabeth Bishop would put it, like a bird obsessed. Moore pasted in a menagerie of animals, from elephants and tigers to camels and frogs. She included an article on baseball in Japan. She referenced biology, psychology, and religion. She made anthologies of flower poems. She clipped pictures of Brooklyn Bridge, Gibraltar, and Trafalgar Square.</p>
<p>The scrapbooks reveal Moore's early artistic and literary allegiances as well. She kept reviews of plays and ballets as well as news items on Sarah Bernhardt and Marcel Duchamp. The scrapbooks show that from very early on Moore was conversant with the various –<span style="font-style:italic;">isms</span> of the day, including post-impressionism, cubism, Futurism, imagism, and vorticism—movements she would speak about with such authority in her many articles and reviews. The scrapbooks also suggest early literary influences, with clippings of poems and reviews of the title res in her poem "To a Cantankerous Poet Ignoring His Compeers—Thomas Hardy, Bernard Shaw, Joseph Conrad, Henry James" that were key res in an emerging literary modernism (<span style="font-style:italic;">BMM</span>, 47). The scrapbook also contains what is presumably an early example of Moore's critical prose: a typewritten manuscript on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Black Riders</span> of Stephen Crane. At the same time, the scrapbooks demonstrate engagements with the social and political world that Moore's critics have often ignored. The scrapbooks illustrate Moore's commitments to women's suffrage in their inclusion of articles, fliers, and pamphlets for the "National American Woman Suffrage Association." They present portraits of presidents Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, as well as pictures of zeppelins that portend a looming world war.</p>
<p>Many of these clippings come in the form of political cartoons, a discursive form often containing some of the most trenchant critiques of the status quo, but which can all too easily be dismissed as "popular" and superficial rather than serious social criticism. Moore's collection of cartoons, jokes, and caricatures reveals not only her interest in the political (and how the popular is a key adjudicator of the political) but also the playful sense of humor that has often been overlooked in discussions of her work. The scrapbooks are riddled with jokes, some taking prominence in the middle of the page, some wedged into corners, turned on their sides, placed wherever there is a little free space.</p>
<p>As jokes like "Examples" suggest, humor, like poetry, is for Moore an exploration of the possibilities of language. In addition to pointing out what Moore can expect in her chosen profession, the joke relishes in redundancy: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>"Little Willie—Pa, what's a redundancy of expression?<br>"Pa—Using more words than are necessary to express one's meaning, such as 'wealthy plumber,' 'poor poet,' 'idle rich,' etc."<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Another poem, "The Slang of the Day," draws its power from puns:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>"A—Awful Hot, ain't it?" "Yes, awful!" (<span style="font-style:italic;">pause</span>.)<br>"A—Awful Jolly Floor, ain't it?" "Yes, awful!" (<span style="font-style:italic;">pause</span>.)<br>"A—A—Awful Jolly Sad about the poor Duchess, ain't it?" "Yes—Quite too awful—"</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">And so forth</span>.)<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">But her interest in redundancy and precision went beyond humor. Moore clips an article from <span style="font-style:italic;">Life</span>, "He Cabled Every Word (except the <span style="font-style:italic;">the's</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">and's</span>)," writing in pencil "Everybody's Way," implying either that this is how everybody does it, or this is how everybody should do it, but in any case recognizing the benefits of such a pared-down language.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> At another point, Moore also clips an article about a children's dictionary that confuses the star-fish and—the subject of one of her early poems—the jelly-fish, betraying her obsession with taxonomy and classification in addition to demonstrating that she is mindful of the need to be precise in description as well as language (<span style="font-style:italic;">PMM</span>, 14).<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>The scrapbooks provide a rich, underutilized resource for studying Moore's personal development at this crucial point in her life, as well as the mass cultural expressions, social concerns, and historical events that helped to shape her development. Scholars would do well to further investigate the scrapbooks as archival sources illuminating many of her lifelong interests and commitments. But the scrapbooks also provide valuable clues as to <span style="font-style:italic;">how</span> Moore was developing her characteristic forms of poetic expression. This is readily evident in her material manipulation of printed scraps, to which I now will turn.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">A Scrappy Poetics</h1>
<p>Just as the scrapbooks preserve and present the images, themes and sources that informed the subject matter of Moore's poems, they also illustrate her processes of poetic composition. The scrapbooks as a whole are roughly chronological from front to back: clippings published at the same time or in the same source are frequently grouped together. Obviously this is an aid to the scholar concerned with Moore's poetic development. But while many pages follow this chronology, others appear to be more deliberately assembled over a longer period of time. There are several examples of unfinished pages and pages where the dates of clippings are separated by weeks or months, suggesting that Moore often thought of the page as a site for long-term selection and juxtaposition, and was willing to wait a while to elaborate a subject or complicate a theme. These clippings generally come from several different sources and genres (photos, cartoons, articles, poems), often resembling the pages of magazines  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> from which they were culled. Sometimes the connections are obvious; at other times they require a leap of logical association, much as the poems do.</p>
<p>Moore's scrapbook pages need to be examined with the same close attention we would give to her poems. This close bibliographic reading shows that the scrapbooks reveal not only Moore's principles of selection, displaying the scraps she chose to rescue from the flood of mass print culture, but also the processes of bibliographic manipulation (manifest in the presentation of these scraps) that would be translated into the formal manipulation of her poems. This is most evident in the incorporation and juxtaposition of clippings, often in full-page assemblages, as well as in processes of pasting-over, anchoring and enjambment.</p>
<p>These processes are dependent on the dual status of the individual clipping. Clippings are taken out of their prior contexts (these clippings themselves often reproduced from still earlier contexts) and placed into the new context of the scrapbook, exhibiting markers of date, place and name of publication (which Moore meticulously recorded) in an effort to maintain some connection to the previous contexts from which they were taken. In this way, the scrap indexes both a former public mass-cultural context and a new private aesthetic one (that may in turn be articulated to the public). Individual clippings adopt new meaning as they are incorporated into this context, and through juxtaposition the page as a whole takes on a new significance at the intersection of these clippings.</p>
<p>To take an example of this process of juxtaposition, page 96 of the First Scrapbook (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>) sets an article on biologically modified tadpoles, "Pigmies and Giants by Feeding," alongside a poem, "At the Aquarium" by Max Eastman, that compares the wanderings of fishes to that of people, who may be in for a "pale and cold surprise." The two clippings are connected through a water metaphor (artificially constructed—be it aquarium or laboratory) and through taxonomy: both fishes and tadpoles are classified as water creatures. But just as Eastman's poem draws a connection between the wandering people and the wandering fishes, the pigmy- and giant-tadpoles take on human connotations so that the distinction between the social and the natural is, like the fishes themselves, slippery.</p>
<p>Beneath Eastman's poem is an editorial cartoon, "A Consultation," that caricatures the Balkan Wars. The relationship between the cartoon and the poem is difficult to establish at first, but once we think about Eastman's own socialist commitments and the radical stance of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Masses</span>, where the poem was originally published, the poem becomes deeply connected to the cartoon. War is the ultimate outcome of a people caught off guard; revolution is the potential in the wandering masses. Whereas the connection between the tadpoles and the fishes is a formal one, this connection is more complex—it requires knowledge of history and biography to understand the formal juxtaposition. The meaning is not merely present on the page; the individual clippings must be traced back to their (historical, ideological, biographical, bibliographical) sources to make sense in this immediate coming together. This meaning beyond the page, manifested in a radical labor politics, is also necessary to understand the point of the juxtaposing joke: "'How many people work in your office?' / 'Oh, I should say about a third of them.'" <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

</div>
<p>Beneath the cartoon of the Balkan states is an article on "Whitman's Siege of Europe." The reference to Europe and the term "siege" suggests aesthetic revolution as a corollary to the Ottoman revolution that was a key contributing factor to the Balkan Wars. The juxtaposition of the article with that on tadpoles also makes Whitman a giant among poet-pigmies. And he too had a commitment to the masses. Beyond a simple binary juxtaposition, we start to see a triangulation of multiple sources as they pertain to Whitman (and to the other clippings on the page as well). In an open-ended additive process, as opposed to a closing-off intersection of meaning, Whitman becomes  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> a re of cultural influence: a giant, a conqueror, a laborer, anything but a wanderer. The clippings on the page—representing a variety of discursive forms, including the joke, the poem, the illustration, the photograph and journalistic prose—contribute to the complex meaning of the assemblage as a whole. Without being reduced to a single concept, the page foregrounds issues of influence (be it artistic or political), the line between the social and the natural, and the relationship between the great individual and the will of the masses.</p>
<p>In another assemblage, on page 63 of the Second Scrapbook, Moore constructs a page as material embodiment and criticism of a divided Ireland (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>). The "Irish Question" of independence and unification that faced the country in the first decades of the twentieth century is a subject that Moore takes up at other points in the scrapbooks. It is a topic particularly suited to being presented in a scrapbook, where form mimics conflicted content and the juxtaposition of different clippings contribute to a complex pastiche on the page that cannot be reduced to a single idea or resolved into unity—much like Ireland itself. As in the previous assemblage, the uneasy juxtaposition of clippings encourages a reconsideration of conflict in the social context that the clipping metonymically represents.</p>
<p>Moore places two copies of sketches by John Butler Yeats side-by-side, helping to literally divide the page down the middle. The first is a "Scene at the Irish Fair" glorifying the traditional Irish peasantry who remember their brothers fallen in battle. The second is a self-portrait, "The Goya of Ireland," that praises the artist who has the abilities and the sensibilities to produce a work like "Scene at an Irish Fair." Beneath the self-portrait, above the caption, Moore has penciled in "Padraic Colum," the name of the Irish poet and playwright who—like John Yeats and his son, W. B. Yeats—was a key re in the Celtic Revival, writing in Gaelic and collecting folklore. Importantly, though, while the early Yeats's work gave forceful voice to the movement for independence, he was Protestant and increasingly identified with the Anglo-Irish aristocracy. Colum, on the other hand, was Catholic and shared the religious and class sensibilities of the majority of the Irish people. For these reasons, Moore may see him as a more fitting descendent of Goya's populist aims. At the very least, Moore challenges the notion of a single inheritor of the Goya tradition, and that it is necessarily a tradition perpetuated through a particular art form, implicitly making the case for her own aesthetic inheritance as a poet as well. The lateral juxtaposition of the two images also suggests the tension between the artist's need to represent the people and the external world more generally, and the need to represent one's self.</p>
<p>Beneath these sketches, Moore quotes lines from Shakespeare's <span style="font-style:italic;">Measure for Measure</span> in response to the notion that Ulster was an inevitable spoil of war:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>But man, proud man,<br>Drest in a little brief authority,<br>Most ignorant of what he's most assured,<br>His glassy essence, like an angry ape,<br>Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven<br>As make the angels weep.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div></blockquote>

</div>
<p class="continued">The quotation points to the theatricality of the war and the importance of a poet to chronicle historical events, but it is also a potent example of how Moore would often read clippings in opposition to their intended meaning. Even as the excerpt reinforces the recourse to poets like Colum and Yeats, it underscores the cultural imperialism of honoring an English Shakespeare in an Irish land (an issue that would vex, among others, Joyce's cerebral hero, Stephen). While the quotation is supposed to be read against the British conquering of Ulster, its source renders its meaning ambiguous.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Beside this quotation is a passage on Wu Ting-Fang and Tang Shou-Yi, two revolutionaries who were educated in British-controlled Hong Kong and who were instrumental in establishing the Republic of China. The clipping suggests one political response to imperialism, though without explicit endorsement. Looming above these clippings, covering the full top third of the page, is a photograph of a man wrestling a shark. The literal meaning of the picture is disconnected from the issues of Irish tradition and political division presented elsewhere on the page, but its placement in this political climate charges it with metaphorical significance. The image connects the otherwise divided page, but does so through violent struggle, just as violent struggle connected an otherwise divided Ireland. While the shark may be personified to some degree, as the tadpoles and fishes are in the previous example, it still retains its status as a creature of brute force with the clear advantage. It is hard not to identify the shark with Britain. To once again invoke Shakespeare, the image res for Ireland the "sea of troubles" that foreshadows the sea image in Moore's most politically charged poem on the question of Ireland, "Sojourn in the Whale" (<span style="font-style:italic;">PMM</span>, 119).</p>
<p>These two examples of Moore's full-page assemblages suggest the myriad ways in which the incorporated text can take on new meaning through its association with other texts, while at the same time encouraging a connection to earlier social and bibliographical contexts. This accumulation of clippings, adopting many forms and coming from many sources, can add up to complex, often politicized, statements greater than the sum of its parts. Such possibilities, and the dangers of discouraging them, are central to Moore's poem "Novices," where a mature poet reflects on fledgling attempts to "anatomize their work" ("their" referring to both the poet presenting the work of others and the ones whose work is being combined) in a manner mimicking the anatomized page that would discourage intertextuality. Set against a background of marine metaphors that is integral to both examples, the poem makes explicit the connection between the natural and the cultural—perhaps looking back to the first assemblage—as it points to authors as "the masters of all languages, the supertadpoles of expression" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BMM</span>, 113).</p>
<p>More generally, incorporation, juxtaposition, and assemblage provide a bibliographic basis for what has often been recognized as the dominant formal strategies in Moore's poems. These processes help to explain her complex associations of tropes and images and, most obviously, her use of quotations. With Moore's scrapbooks in mind, we can see her quotations as not only linguistic negotiations of identity, voice and context, but also as material manipulations, where diacritical marks impose real bibliographical barriers that may or may not be transgressed.</p>
<p>In some poems, a quotation is simply imported from another source and placed in the poem, like a pasted scrap. The surrounding text may then help to illuminate the quotation's meaning, as Moore's marginalia often does in the scrapbooks. "In This Age Of Hard Trying, Nonchalance Is Good And," for example, begins with the phrase "'really, it is not the / business of the gods to make clay pots'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">PMM</span>, 108). The phrase is read not only through the preceding title-phrase, which makes both the ancient gods and clay pots contemporary, of "This Age," but also through the next sentence, "They did  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> not / do it in this instance," that undercuts the possibility that the gods would change their minds through reinforcing that this instance is not unlike any other. Of course, critics have long pointed out that Moore's reading of quotations are not merely explications, but are often powerful <span style="font-style:italic;">mis</span>readings, where quotations are taken radically out of context in order to challenge the integrity of that context or the possible meanings of the text itself—but, then, this is true as well in the scrapbooks.</p>
<p>Although several of her poems incorporate a single quotation, Moore would also frequently juxtapose quotations. In such cases, meaning derives not only from the original text surrounding the quotations, but from the interplay of different quoted texts and, by extension, their sources. Often, these quotations are mediated by original phrases, as in the conclusion of "Sea Unicorns and Land Unicorns," where "the unicorn 'with pavon high,' approaches eagerly; / until engrossed by what appears of this strange enemy, / upon the map, 'upon her lap,' / its 'mild wild head doth lie'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">PMM</span>, 164–168). At other times, these quotations are directly juxtaposed without mediation, as in "To a Snail," where there the phrases "'a method of conclusions'; / 'a knowledge of principles'" are placed, with the help of a semicolon, in metonymic series (<span style="font-style:italic;">PMM</span>, 174).</p>
<p>This logic of poetic juxtaposition undergirds Moore's most rhetorically complex poems, "Marriage" and "An Octopus." These poems, which have often been read as premiere examples of Moore's collage poetry, most closely parallel the full-page assemblages. Quotation—marking itself as quotation—retains some fidelity to the book, magazine or newspaper from which it came, but with its meaning changed in relation to the other textual elements in the poem, and with the poem as a whole making meaning through these juxtaposed elements. In the notes to "Marriage," for example, Moore explains that the lines where Eve is "able to write simultaneously / in three languages—" with what would seem to be "automatic hand," are derived from <span style="font-style:italic;">Scientific American</span>, January 1922 (<span style="font-style:italic;">PMM</span>, 155 and 379).<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> In doing so, she points to a recent, popular-scientific source, rather than to a literary monument as someone like T. S. Eliot would often do in his famously allusive poem <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> . At the same time, she underscores the process of drawing on the ephemeral, repositioning it to illuminate the mythic re of Eve, and making it more permanent—just as ephemeral scraps are made more permanent in the scrapbook.</p>
<p>In addition to juxtaposing clippings and making assemblages, Moore would often paste one image over another. Sometimes she would do this completely so that only the new image is visible. At other times, she would literally "enjamb" one edge of the new image, pasting only the top, bottom or a side, so that both images are still available for consideration—the clipping swinging open as a door does on its jamb. Recognizing this process as enjambment reminds us that a term generally reserved for the carrying-over of poetic meaning, allowing a word or phrase to be read in relation to both the preceding line and the subsequent line, is etymologically rooted in a material process. In this way, the term is representative of Moore's general project to translate the material into the formal.</p>
<p>By being pasted-over and enjambed, the image is detached from its original caption, or, to privilege the word over the image, the original caption is made to function in new  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> contexts as it is juxtaposed against new images. The page is not restricted to a finite set of clippings that produce a limited number of associations; rather, another clipping can always potentially be added in this open-ended accumulation. Moore uses this strategy throughout the scrapbooks, as when she pastes a cartoon of Kaiser Wilhelm II over a cartoon of two people in an intimate scene.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> The underlined caption, "In the Sentry Box," changes from being a lighthearted commentary on displays of public affection to critical scrutiny of the Prussian Emperor largely responsible for the onset of the First World War. The trace of the earlier context is not completely erased, however, so that there is an affective carrying-over from the lovers, encouraging a consideration of the sexual and fraternal intimacies of war often bred in the trenches.</p>
<p>There is a double example of this pasting-over on pages 88–89 of the First Scrapbook (<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 3</a>). Moore brings together two reviews of George Bernard Shaw's Christmas pageant play, pasting over photographs of two separate scenes. "Where the Romans Trade" is enjambed with a market scene, possibly taken from Rome, but at the very least from a recognizably exotic location. The availability of both images—the photograph of a "realistic" market scene and the absurd staging of Shaw's play—encourages a reading of the real and the absurd as two sides of the same coin. The second example is more politically explicit. Moore pastes a portrait of Dean Conant Worcester, the Secretary of the Interior of the Philippine government who fought against Filipino slavery, over a still partially visible scene of Androcles ting a lion. As a result, Worcester takes on the title "Christian Martyr." The absurdity of the play and the title of the review "Christian Martyrs Burlesqued," however, suggest the ways that Worcester was himself "burlesqued" for his actions, allowing his Christian martyrdom to be read as ironic.</p>
<p>This pasting-over and enjambment of texts suggests strategies for reading many of Moore's sentence-level formal innovations that critics have largely failed to consider. We get something akin to pasting-over in poems like "'The Bricks Are Fallen Down, We Will Build with Hewn Stones. The Sycamores Are Cut Down, We Will Change to Cedars'" (taken from Isaiah 9:10), where the phrase "'defeated ourselves with / false balances'" is a quotation within a long quotation that makes up more than half of the twelve-line poem (<span style="font-style:italic;">PMM</span>, 175). But this is only a particular meta-instance of how Moore often uses quotation: as a precise wording, with a particular texture, which overlays a more general or abstract idea. The quotation may not be a translation of the idea—indeed, it may mask it or expressly contradict it—but it comes to stand in as an alibi for the idea. That is, quotation may not only be the point to discourse, but the point <span style="font-style:italic;">of</span> it: the destination as much as the departure.</p>
<p>Moore's collage aesthetic also informs the use of enjambment in her poetry. In "The Steeple-Jack," a pun at the end of the line allows for "waves as formal as the scales" to anticipate the run of a musical scale before unexpectedly landing "on a fish" (<span style="font-style:italic;">PMM</span>, 183–184). In "The Jerboa," people gave playthings to boys "and made toys for them- / selves: the royal totem" so that "themselves" cleaves along its phonemic break, where an altruistic gesture turns to selfishness (<span style="font-style:italic;">PMM</span>, 190–194). These strategies of pasting-over and enjambment promote the concealment, multiplicity, and contradictory readings that are often associated with Moore's poetry, where it becomes difficult to stabilize the text and, as it were, adhere to definitive meaning. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

</div>
<div class="reEnd"></div>
</div>
<p>In addition to pasting-over and enjambing, Moore would on occasion cut out only the captions or other short phrases from previous sources, severing them from their original contexts altogether, allowing them to be radically recontextualized. These phrases, like the one-liners Moore was so fond of, can be inserted into various constellations to complicate a theme or punctuate a point. This is perhaps the most easily spotted (though often misinterpreted) use of quotation in Moore's poetry, especially evident in poems like "'He Wrote The History Book,'" where the title is itself a quotation and the job  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of the poem is to explicate that quotation (which is also often enjambed with the title [<span style="font-style:italic;">PMM</span>, 101]). One of the adverse effects of excising phrases or short verbal exchanges, however, is that while some of these phrases have been pasted in new places, many are now loose in the scrapbooks, free-floating, completely cut off from both their old and new contexts, never having been pasted or long having fallen out of place. The same could be said for the many untraceable phrases in Moore's poems.</p>
<p>There are, however, striking examples of how these phrases do function in a new context, as on page 87 of the First Scrapbook (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>). As in the previous examples, the collage is constructed by enjambing one image over another. "The Coon That Won't Come Down," originally a caption for a cartoon of a raccoon stuck on a pole, becomes critical commentary on the ascendancy of Mulai Hafid as Sultan of Morocco in 1908, an act that consolidated tribal regions and threatened French and Spanish imperial interests (though Moore's presentation of this position does not necessarily constitute acquiescence). There are racial overtones in the phrase as well, as a slur for African-Americans comes to designate the Moor and, by way of the pun, implicates Marianne Moore herself.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> The collage differs from the previous examples of pasting-over and enjambment, however, in being anchored with the phrase "WILD ANIMALS HE HAS MET," so that meaning is shaped by juxtaposition both with an image and with another verbal text. The phrase may refer to the Sultan, and the difficulties he overcame to declare himself the rightful heir to the throne, but as the Sultan has already been de-humanized in his comparison to the raccoon, the phrase more properly refers to the witnessing of the Sultan's rise.</p>
<p>The collage also differs from previous examples in that it is pasted directly onto the matte paper of the scrapbook and not onto another newspaper or magazine page. This has the effect of isolating and framing the assemblage. The page, most likely dating from November 1913, is the closest that Moore's scrapbooking gets to the aestheticized presentation of the scrap that the historical avant-garde had embraced since the unveiling of collage in the New York Armory Show the previous year. In this case, I do agree with those critics who contend that Moore, who was an active member of modernist circles at this point, is learning from the avant-garde. But it is also important to consider how easily this collage comes out of Moore's previous scrapbooking practices. The collage exhibits the same processes of cutting and pasting, and draws on the same kinds of sources, as any other page in the scrapbook (the same kind of ephemera that the visual collage artists would draw on, for that matter). For Moore, at least, avant-garde collage is not a radical departure from, but a peculiar subset of, the scrapbooking techniques that she (and many others) had long been practicing.</p>
<p>While some of these examples do include scraps of poems along with a variety of other texts, it is near the end of the Second Scrapbook that Moore directly manipulates previously published poems, pasting the stanza of one poem over another. She clips a stanza from Walter Conrad Arensberg's "Out of Doors":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>I hear the wings, the winds, the river pass,<br>And toss the fretful book upon the grass. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <br>Poor Book, it could not cure my soul of aught,<br>It has itself the old disease of thought.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>

</div>
<div class="reEnd"></div>
</div>
<p class="continued">This is enjambed onto the first four lines of a stanza from another poem, "Angelic Service" by W. M. Letts:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>No angel is so high<br>But serveth clowns and kings,<br>And doeth lowly things.<br>He in this serviceable love can see<br>The symbol of a heavenly mystery,—<br>So labor grows white wings.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The resulting stanza becomes:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>I hear the wings, the winds, the river pass,<br>And toss the fretful book upon the grass.<br>Poor Book, it could not cure my soul of aught,<br>It has itself the old disease of thought.<br>He in this serviceable love can see <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <br>The symbol of a heavenly mystery,—<br>So labor grows white wings.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The two poems hinge on "wings," an image which shows up in other poems pasted in the scrapbooks as well as in several poems Moore would write throughout her career.<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> In the first fragment, the wings, metonymic of birds and of nature in general, are contrasted with the book, which itself stands in for cultural production (history, literature). Tossing the effete book in the grass becomes for the speaker an act of relinquishing culture to nature. In the second fragment, by contrast, wings are a symbol of work; they are not simply endowed by nature but must be earned. The conflated poem negotiates these stances on nature and labor, making a more rhetorically complex, dialogic poem, where the wings become the mark of one who has worked her way back into a natural state. This poetic pasting-over not only depicts the nature/culture dialectic that is evident in much of Moore's work, but is also one of the clearest examples of how Moore's scrapbooking practices had direct, specific application to her emerging poetic processes, where bibliographic manipulation could be translated into formal poetic meaning.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Remaking Modernism</h1>
<p>In the end, Moore must have felt successful translating the bibliographical into the formal. Although she would still keep less experimental photo albums recording her personal accomplishments, and would continue to extra-illustrate books all her life—often interleaving them with newspaper articles over the course of several decades—she would stop producing such involved scrapbooks at about the time she started to write her mature collage poems and began to be published in <span style="font-style:italic;">Poetry</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Egoist</span> and other literary journals.</p>
<p>The scrapbooks were not exclusively responsible for Moore's poetic material or for the development of her formal innovations, but they are some of the best evidence of those processes that we have. They point to an array of interests and allegiances that Moore would wrestle with throughout her career, while at the same time displaying physical acts of importation, juxtaposition, assemblage, pasting-over, anchoring, and enjambment that would be translated into her later collage poetry. Likewise, the scrapbooks give us a new way of understanding Moore. They highlight the extent to which Moore engaged with the social and political issues of her time—from American Indian education to the suffrage movement to imperialism and world politics at large—as well as her willingness to champion, criticize and parody those issues in her poetry and other writings. These engagements have yet to be thoroughly considered. The scrapbooks also provide a new set of critical tools for closely reading Moore's poems that gives attention to this historical context as well as to the nuances of poetic form, making her an especially interesting candidate for study in what is amounting to a "New Formalism."<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>These are fruitful endeavors and the poems deserve more sustained and varied readings with reference to these issues than I have been able to supply here. What I have tried to do in these brief examples, however, is to suggest the wide-ranging implications that Moore's scrapbooks had on her most characteristic poetry, while at the same time underscoring how the long tradition of scrapbooking as a feminized negotiation of mass print culture challenges the long-held assumption that the modern collage poem was simply a translation and extension of a masculinized visual avant-garde. Considering the number of modern poets who were dedicated scrapbookers, including e. e. cummings, Hart Crane, W. C. Williams, Amy Lowell, and H. D., as well as Moore's deep and lasting influence on the poetics and the reception of modernism, it is worth further investigating the scrapbook's importance for Moore and for the making of modern poetry.</p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span><p>The fascist dictator, like the Cavalier and the Southern demagogue, supplied William Faulkner with a set of tropes that shaped <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom, Absalom!</span> The parallels between Thomas Sutpen and fascist dictators emerge from and reveal contemporary anxieties about the rise of an American Hitler. Moreover, the novel's structure, by emphasizing the oral transmission of history, dramatizes the constitutive role of storytelling in constructing a national myth and demonstrates the production of fascist subjects. This process depends on Rosa Coldfield, who, by serving as the fascist "mother" to Sutpen's fascist "father," mediates the erotic identification of white Southern men with Sutpen.</p>

<div id="body">
<p>Fascism didn't happen here, but in 1936, when William Faulkner published <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom, Absalom!</span>, Americans didn't know that yet. In retrospect, fascist movements never posed a material threat to the American government. Fascist organizations with direct ties to Italy and Germany, such as the Fascist League of North America or the German-American Bund, and self-proclaimed nativist fascist groups like William Dudley Pelley's Silver Shirts attracted no more than a miniscule following in the United States.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> But in 1934, the American Civil Liberties Union published "Shirts!," a pamphlet surveying a range of paramilitary organizations whose similarities converged, according to the ACLU, in their common hatred for "Communism, democracy and Jews," their appeal to "patriotism," and their desire to "establish dictatorships." "They are disunited, uncertain, with dozens of vague aims, with no one yet to pull their common hatreds together," author Travis Hoke concluded ominously, "but so was Germany split into dozens of wandering parties—before Hitler."<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>While Hoke suggested that the absence of leadership prevented the disparate proto-fascist "shirt" organizations from uniting to gain power, journalist Raymond Gram Swing insisted that potential leaders abounded. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Forerunners of American Fascism</span> , Swing warned that any of a group of proto-fascist demagogues could exploit Americans' "economic dissatisfaction" to rally the impoverished and unemployed with the promise of restored order.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> Manipulating the "psychology" of "fear," Swing claimed, one of these men could defeat "the forces of democratic control" by "resolv[ing]" "social conflicts … through the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> device of dictatorship."<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> Swing profiled a group of likely demagogues—doctor Francis Townsend, Mississippi Governor Theodore Bilbo, radio priest Father Coughlin, and Louisiana Senator Huey Long—not "to personify fascism," he insisted, but to demonstrate the appeal of leaders willing to dispense with "economic democracy and individualism," leaders who, "if invested with autocratic authority," would make the U.S. like Germany or Italy.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The Allied victory in the Second World War insured that fascism didn't happen in the U.S. Postwar commentators attributed the triumph to American democracy, insisting that fascism could only have happened "over there." After Germany's defeat, Depression-era fears of an American-style Hitler seemed quaint, even hysterical, but Cold War constructions of fascism have obscured the fact that for many Americans in the 1930s, the "fingerprints of fascism" were apparent everywhere.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> The cultural productions of the decade—among them films, fiction, and criticism—offer some of the most sophisticated and revealing contemporary assessments of America's vulnerability to nativist fascism. The trope of the American Hitler, the fascist dictator emerging from an American background, red prominently in popular culture in such iterations as Sinclair Lewis's Buzz Windrip  and Orson Welles's Charles Kane , both of whom achieved power by manipulating American economic and democratic institutions.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, Faulkner offered a distinct take on the trope of the American Hitler by demonstrating the interdependence of the fascist leader and his followers. Unlike <span style="font-style:italic;">It Can't Happen Here</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">Citizen Kane</span>, which focus on the fascist leader's rise and the vulnerability of American institutions to his ambitions, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> dramatizes the circular structure of identification by showing how the narrators' desire for Thomas Sutpen simultaneously constructs him as the leader and produces their allegiance to him. <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> bears a complicated relationship to its contemporary moment by combining the Civil War and Reconstruction-era plot of Sutpen's failed dynasty with the "action" of telling Sutpen's story at the apogee of the New South in the fall and winter of 1909–10. The doubled temporal frame within the novel grants telling and listening equal status with the events of Sutpen's life, thus emphasizing the psychological production of white Southern men as citizens of the Southern "nation" at a moment—1936—of regional crisis, and growing national unease about the increasing military power of fascist regimes in Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>If any region in the U.S. seemed ripe to produce a fascist-style "dictator," it was the South, a region shaped by paternalism, a tradition of racial scapegoating, a disposition toward capital rather than labor, a post-Reconstruction history of single-party rule, and home of the "Dixie demagogue."<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> The fascist imaginary—what I call the "fascist fable"—converged with the "Southern family romance" in their shared preoccupation with the cultural politics of nation-building.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> By the mid-1930s, when Faulkner published <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, the narrative of the Southern family romance grounded a political formation, the conception of an alternative Southern "nation," most succinctly articulated in the 1930 Agrarian "manifesto," <span style="font-style:italic;">I'll Take My Stand</span>.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> In its Depression–era iteration, the Oedipal drama of the Southern family mapped the cultural politics of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Southern traditionalism onto a proto-nationalism centered on the white planter-father, who not only represented a past golden age, but also red as the rallying point for a new sectional politics energized in opposition to the emerging power of labor and focused on maintaining white supremacy.</p>
<p>We can see the development of Faulkner's treatment of fascism in the shift from a thematic depiction of fascism in Percy Grimm's "shirt"-style lynching mob in <span style="font-style:italic;">Light in August</span>  to his representation of the construction of fascist subjects in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom, Absalom!</span> In a 1945 letter to Malcolm Cowley, William Faulkner recalled <span style="font-style:italic;">Light in August</span>'s Percy Grimm as "the Fascist Galahad who saved the white race by murdering [Joe] Christmas. I invented him in 1931. I didn't realize until after Hitler got into the newspapers that I had created a Nazi before he did."<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> The racial and gender politics enacted in the climatic murder scene in <span style="font-style:italic;">Light in August</span> have their roots in the Reconstruction, and lynching as a means of enforcing white dominance predates the emergence of European fascism. Yet Faulkner's allusion to his "Fascist Galahad" draws a parallel between the racial politics of the South and of Germany. Hitler's claim to defend the Aryan race against "pollution," especially by "international Jews," finds its analog in Southern racism, Faulkner implies, a connection that was made explicitly by many of Faulkner's contemporaries, including W. E. B. DuBois, W. J. Cash, and Katharine Du Pre Lumpkin.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> By associating Grimm's lynch mob with fascism, Faulkner suggests that the roots of fascism exist already in the sociopolitical upheaval of the Depression-era South and in the dynamics of race and gender on display in Christmas's lynching.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Faulkner's "Fascist Galahad" Percy Grimm anticipates a fuller treatment of the relationship between fascism and the South in the re of Thomas Sutpen, who emerges as a mesmerizing fascist father to generations of white Southerners in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> through the seductive power of voice. Critics have placed Sutpen in a complex matrix of traditions, including the fictionalized Cavaliers of the antebellum South and the "Dixie demagogues" spawned by Reconstruction and the Depression, but Faulkner's comment about the genesis of Percy Grimm invites us to read his fiction in the context of contemporary fascist leaders.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> My point is that the fascist dictator, like the Cavalier and the Southern demagogue, supplied Faulkner with a set of tropes that combined with others and coalesced in the re of Sutpen at a moment when anxieties about "fascism" shaped the discursive context available to Faulkner.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> By exemplifying the appeal and danger of identifying with Sutpen, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> couples a critique of Southern paternalism with a liberal critique of fascism, representing both as products of a broader cultural pathology.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Robert H. Brinkmeyer, Jr. and Ted Atkinson have argued that <span style="font-style:italic;">Light in August</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> demonstrate how Faulkner's critique of economic paternalism and white supremacy converge with his exploration of Southern regionalism and fascist nationalism. However, Brinkmeyer, Jr. and Atkinson largely ignore the formal structure of <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, focusing exclusively on the thematic parallels between Sutpen and fascist dictators. I claim that the structure of <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> reinforces those thematic parallels by shifting the emphasis from Sutpen himself to the narrators' identification with Sutpen.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> By structuring the novel as a series of conversations that reveal Sutpen's enduring appeal as they transmit Sutpen's story to successive generations of white Southerners, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> depicts the constitutive role of storytelling in constructing a national myth and demonstrates the production of fascist subjects. Through the mediating voice of Rosa Coldfield, who becomes the fascist "mother" to Sutpen's fascist father, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> dramatizes the construction of the fascist leader as a product of the desire of his citizensubjects. The dynamics of voice and power dramatized in the characters' speech and embedded in the structure of the book emerge through metaphors of familial—and national—rupture eroticized and aestheticized by the speakers themselves.</p>
<p>By depicting fascism emerging from American culture, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> gives us access to a moment <span style="font-style:italic;">before</span> "democracy" became fascism's "other." In so doing, the novel demonstrates Heesok Chang's claim that fascism becomes "the unnamed precondition of critical speculation itself."<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> suggests that fascism's menace lies in its threat to the ideology of the autonomous subject, which the novel explores through its representation of the narrators' capitulation to Sutpen. By working through the implications of allegiance to the planter-father, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> anatomizes the dangers of fascism, and it represents the role of cultural productions in the creation of fascist subjects. But the novel simultaneously deploys some of the very formations it seeks to resist in a structure that reinforces the monologism of its narrators. In so doing, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> suggests that the formation of a democratic, anti-fascist aesthetic <span style="font-style:italic;">depends</span> on what it seeks to exclude.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">"Decorous Ordering": The Cavalier Myth as Fascist Fable</h1>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s structure foregrounds the activity of witnessing, both literally and ratively. Eyewitnesses observe events and testify to what they have seen; subsequent narrators then bear witness to and repeat the stories of eyewitnesses. The spectacle of Sutpen's exercise of power generates the narrators' testimony to his authority, and, in turn, shapes the scenes of transmission in which witnesses reproduce his domination by insisting on their own authority as speakers. These monological "enunciatory acts," as Stephen Ross dubs them,<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> serve as rituals for confirming Sutpen's authority, an authority that originated in the physical violence he used to build his plantation in Mississippi and that is reproduced in the symbolic violence of his wrestling matches with his slaves. Moreover, they establish Sutpen as a re for identification. The narrators' fantasy of Sutpen's "intact innocence" gives shape to their desire for identity and purity, for what Rosa calls "<span style="font-style:italic;">intricate channels of decorous ordering</span>."<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> Faulkner explores the white South's desire for "<span style="font-style:italic;">decorous ordering</span>" in much of his fiction in the 1930s, but <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> marks a shift in emphasis from representations of physical violence to the symbolic violence embedded in acts of narration. <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s narrators not only recapitulate the acts of violence precipitated by Sutpen's design, they also police the boundaries of the family by insisting on one particular "plot" for Sutpen's story. In so doing, they cast the familial drama of dynastic reproduction as a larger story about the construction of the white Southern "nation." <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>By reconstructing the inception and unfolding of Sutpen's design, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s narrators give dramatic shape to the myth of the Old South, a fantasy of the "intact" white family and, by extension, the white Southern nation. The romantic impulse of <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s narrators finds its complement in the romantic nationalism of Nazism and Italian fascism, which similarly envisions the individual shaped through his association with a collective, mythic past.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> Stark Young provides an explicit bridge between the two formations. In his brief for agrarianism in <span style="font-style:italic;">I'll Take My Stand</span>, Young argues that "a sense of family follows our connection with the land … where [we] have known man's great desire, that generation of himself in the body of life, of which the earth is the eternal and natural symbol."<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> Young's celebration of a "way of life" marked by a "provincialism" "akin to a man's interest in his own center"<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> anticipates his admiration for the mystical agrarianism and Catholicism of the Italian "people" in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New Republic</span> essays of the next year. For Young and for the fascists, a nation—like a family—is a living whole, an organism rooted in a particular soil and shaped by a collective destiny. At the heart of Young's enthusiasm for fascist Italy is the conviction that Italian society shares the Southern traditionalists' organic anti-liberalism. To focus on "identity, purity, regeneration … historical roots, self-emancipation, [and] building the 'new man' and the 'new community'" is not only to subordinate the individual to the collective, but, more importantly, to realize oneself as part of a larger whole.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, the desire for the restoration of Sutpen's dynasty materializes the narrators' vision of themselves as a coherent "people" united, as a nation, by blood rather than rights. Sutpen, as "master to slave, baron to retainer," crystallizes the white South's fantasy of an ordered, hierarchical society even as their stories acknowledge his distinctly humble origins (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 221). If we believe, as Slavoj Žižek argues, that "in the fantasy-scene the desire is not fulfilled … but constituted (given its objects, and so on),"<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> we can see the plot of <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> as an ideological fantasy prompted by the white South's repressed knowledge that the "family" is already ruptured.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> In fact, the novel's structure reflects a consciousness of the narrative of Sutpen's dynasty <span style="font-style:italic;">as</span> an ideological fiction, a point most succinctly revealed in Charles Bon's surviving letter to Judith. Bon's undated letter emphasizes the ideological process of constructing a national <span style="font-style:italic;">mythos</span>. The materials Bon uses for the letter—paper "<span style="font-style:italic;">salvaged</span> … from … <span style="font-style:italic;">a ruined aristocrat</span>" and "ink" made from Northern <span style="font-style:italic;">"stove polish</span>" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 102)—connect the story contained in the letter to its later commodified form as a popular "production" of the New South.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> References to the market value of plantation myths also suggest the ways that such myths could be instrumentalized for political ends. The Agrarians' call for a revitalized regional politics in <span style="font-style:italic;">I'll Take My Stand</span> offers perhaps the most salient example of the mobilization of the Southern <span style="font-style:italic;">mythos</span>, and their critics explicitly connected the Agrarians' program to the politics of fascism, noting the similarities between the Agrarians' traditionalism, Mussolini's commemoration of the Roman past, and Hitler's celebration of the Aryan race.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, Sutpen, as one of the so-called "ruined aristocrats," becomes the emblematic re of the narrators' national <span style="font-style:italic;">mythos</span>, and the transmission of his story becomes the means for cementing subsequent generations to him as the symbolic father.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> By staging Sutpen's history as a series of conversations, Faulkner evokes a certain personal, oral form of Southern history, a kind of familial transmission from one generation to the next that doubles the cultural transmission of the same stories. Imagining time as a series of ripples on successive pools of water, each pool maintaining an "<span style="font-style:italic;">umbilical water-cord</span>" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 210) of connection to the last pool, Quentin presents an image of history that assumes an organic connection between past and present, signified by the "umbilical cord." More specifically, the umbilical cord suggests the transmission of the Sutpen story within the Compson family from grandfather to father to Quentin, and within the Southern "family" from one generation to the next.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> The virtually complete identification of Compson familial consciousness with white Southern cultural consciousness maps the personal transmission of the Sutpen story onto a larger historical landscape. The exchange of stories from one narrator to another doubles the "blood" transmission red through the "umbilical cord," linking Sutpen symbolically to successive generations of Southern men.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> These verbal exchanges reinforce the res of biological transmission connecting the narrators in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> to one another and transforming the listeners into Sutpen's "children." As his father tells Quentin in the opening scene in the novel, Rosa chooses to summon Quentin, someone she barely knows, to listen to her story and help her return to Sutpen's Hundred because "in a sense … [it] will still be in the family" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 8).</p>
<p>The structure of the novel, which centers on debunking the Cavalier myth while dramatizing its continued appeal, points to the tautological structure of totalitarian allegiance. If Sutpen were a "classical Master," to use Žižek's term, his political and social authority would stem from the assumption of his descent from the planter class.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> But the narrators know from the beginning that Sutpen descends from poor whites living on the western Virginia frontier. <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom'</span>s focus on the narrators' identification with Sutpen, despite his personal history, suggests that his authority stems not from his origins, but from the subjects who willingly submit to him. This formulation seems tautological because it is circular: Sutpen's authority originates in the violent imposition of his design, but extending this power beyond his immediate family requires subjects willing to reproduce his design as a representation of their own identity. Sutpen's appeal lies as much in the totalizing experience of identifying with him—becoming his "children," if you will—as in the charismatic power of his personality, a dynamic that repeats the "basic deception" of totalitarianism that Žižek describes. Žižek observes that the totalitarian "Leader's point-of-reference" for "legitimi[zing] his rule (the People, the Class, the Nation) <span style="font-style:italic;">does not exist</span> … except in its fetishistic representative, the Party and its Leader.… [T]he People are the 'real People' only in so far as they are embodied in their representative, the Party and its leader."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> Similarly, the white Southern elite become the "real People" insofar as they are represented by Sutpen. Without Sutpen, they do not exist as a "People." As a result, Sutpen's authority to compel the narrators' allegiance comes through their experience of being represented by him as the father of the "nation." Sutpen himself becomes the "fetishistic representative" of an entity—the Southern nation—that does not exist except through their imagined connection to Sutpen. In fact, bonding with one another <span style="font-style:italic;">because</span> of their shared demystification  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of Sutpen's origins allows the narrators to construct the intact family of their fantasies. Instead of admiring Sutpen because he exemplifies the Cavalier tradition, they understand themselves as kin because identifying with Sutpen as their father (and leader) produces them as citizen-children of a common family and nation.</p>
<p>The narrators' obsessive concentration on Sutpen's dynasty—particularly on its "pollution" by black blood—refracts the economic crisis of the Depression-era South and casts it as a crisis of white <span style="font-style:italic;">cultural</span> power. Sutpen's failure to produce a white male heir becomes emblematic of the South's impotence in the reconstructed nation, and the narrators' pathological attachment to Sutpen becomes evidence of the South's <span style="font-style:italic;">cultural</span> pathology.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> By attributing Rosa's fury, Mr. Compson's decadence, and Quentin's paralysis (and eventual suicide) to their investment in Sutpen's narrative, the novel, in turn, invokes the liberal narrative of fascism as cultural pathology, one of many contemporary explanations offered for the emergence of fascism. If we read <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> in the context of increased labor activism, which white power attributed to the incursions of "foreigners" and "Communists" bent on destroying "traditional values," we need only consider the violent suppression of the 1928 strike of the National Textile Workers Union in Gastonia, North Carolina; the National Miner's Union strikes in 1931 and 1932 in Harlan and Bell Counties, Kentucky; the arrest of Angelo Herndon in 1932 on charges of violating a slave insurrection law; the 1934 General Strike of the Tobacco Workers' International Union in Durham, North Carolina; the persecution of organizers of the all-black Share Croppers' Union and the interracial Southern Tenant Farmers' Union; and the arrest and trial of the Scottsboro Nine to understand the stakes here. <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s white narrators counter the specter of an industrial South controlled by organized labor by displacing their anxiety about the loss of economic and social primacy onto a racialized, fetishized other.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup></p>
<p>Ernst Laclau and Chantal Mouffe's discussion of the emergence of fascist ideology is helpful in making the connection here. They argue that when fascism emerges in Europe it offers monopoly capitalism a strategy for using "mass mobilization against the traditional system of power," while decoupling it from the rhetoric of class struggle. The resulting fascist formation nullifies economic conflict between the classes by mobilizing "popular interpellations"—racism or anti-Semitism—to unite the classes against a common enemy.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> Critics read the South's investment in maintaining white supremacy as a similar attempt to eliminate class struggle in the South by mobilizing racial differences. My claim is that this strategy combines the impulse of German anti-Semitism with the mysticism of Italian organicism. Scapegoating African-Americans through enforced segregation, disenfranchisement, and lynching becomes a means for managing the threat to white elite power, and it puts blacks in the same structural position that Jews occupied in Nazi Germany.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> As a result, the "Southern family romance" and the "fascist fable" share a common response to working class agitation: both formations attempt to neutralize class conflict by unifying whites of all classes against a demonized other—African-Americans or Jews—while retaining and reinscribing the ideological preeminence of the white father.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>From the beginning of <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, the narrators suppress the instrumental role of class conflict in Sutpen's development, transforming his story into a <span style="font-style:italic;">Bildungsroman</span> centered on his appropriation of white paternal authority. Sutpen himself originates this version of events. As Mr. Compson tells Quentin, Sutpen's "code of logic and morality" comes in a burst of light, "a bright glare" from which "the severe shape of his intact innocence ris[es] … like a monument" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 192). As his rifle analogy suggests, Sutpen has already been absorbed into the symbolic order, but his moment of illumination represents the exchange of one strategy for representing patriarchal authority with another.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> In fact, I suggest that Sutpen's symbolic identification with the white planter provides the occasion for him to identify <span style="font-style:italic;">self-consciously</span> with the father as the source of logical coherence and illumination. I draw here on Žižek's distinction between imaginary identification—"identification with the image in which we appear likeable to ourselves"—and symbolic identification—"identification with the very place <span style="font-style:italic;">from where</span> we are being observed, <span style="font-style:italic;">from where</span> we look at ourselves so that we appear to ourselves likeable, worthy of son."<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> In the latter, identification initiates the subject into the logic of the symbolic order by inviting him to identify with the point of view that determines his position in that order. John T. Irwin makes a similar point, arguing that Sutpen "incorporates into himself the patriarchal ideal from which that affront sprang in much the same way that a son comes to terms with the image of the father as a re of mastery and power by impersonating that image as the superego, accepting the justice of the father's mastery even though that mastery has been exercised against the son."<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> However, I would add that symbolic identification with the planter requires Sutpen not simply to identify with the father—we might argue that his rifle demonstrates that he already identifies with the father—but to recognize the distinction between rifles and slaves as modes of representing paternal authority. The metaphors that the narrators use to describe the exchange of one symbolic form for representing the father with another—that is, their substitution of the slave's "balloon face" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 189) for the "rifle analogy"—unwittingly construct the scene as Sutpen's introduction to class differences, which he grasps through the distinction between <span style="font-style:italic;">his</span> father and the planter-father.</p>
<p>The narrators' anxiety about their economic and social position becomes encrypted in their elaborate search for the error in Sutpen's design. Their awareness of the failure of the ideology of the intact family is displaced onto the search for an intact—or whole—story. Their desire for wholeness becomes focused on a painstaking investigation of the "jigsaw puzzle picture integers" that, once in place, will reveal the meaning of Sutpen's—and their own—lives (A, 250). This impulse toward coherence begins with Sutpen himself, who describes his design originating in a moment of illumination that precipitates what Mr. Compson characterizes as "his code of logic and morality, his formula and recipe of fact and deduction" (A, 221). But as John T. Matthews observes, in Sutpen's moment of illumination nothing happens: "Sutpen's innocence remains intact, instructing him, presumably, as it has before."<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> Sutpen's "revelation" offers no insight, yet he and the other narrators persist in reproducing Sutpen's innocence even as they criticize it. Hence, when Mr. Compson observes that even though "you bring  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> them together in the proportions called for" "something is missing," he echoes his father's earlier view that Sutpen believed that "the ingredients of morality were like the ingredients of pie or cake and once you had measured them and balanced them and mixed them and put them into the oven it was all finished and nothing but pie or cake could come out" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 80, 211–12). Similarly, Quentin and Shreve imagine Bon's confusion about his past as a "jumble" of "jigsaw puzzle integers … on the point of falling into a pattern" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 250). They become detectives, searching through the "jumble," just as they imagine Bon does, to find a "pattern" that will reveal—in "a flash of light"—the family of their fantasies (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 250). Sutpen's "recipe," like Compson's "chemical formula" and Quentin's "jigsaw puzzle," relies on a series of equations, formulas, and equivalencies that he hopes will eventually add up. The novel ends with Shreve's concluding equation, an equation that cannot seem to calculate the equivalent of Jim Bond: "So it takes two niggers to get rid of one Sutpen, dont it? … which is all right, it's fine; it clears the whole ledger … except for one thing.… You've got one nigger left. One nigger Sutpen left" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 302).</p>
<p>The persistence of Jim Bond threatens the "intact" white family, but his very name reveals the bond the narrators repress. As this bond suggests, the narrative of the white family depends not only on the erasure of class conflict, but also on the mobilization of what Laclau and Mouffe term "popular interpellations" to cement white Southerners together in opposition to a common enemy. In each iteration of Sutpen's story, the narrators repeatedly offer blackness as the source of corruption in the family and miscegenation as the agent of Sutpen's destruction. If we see Sutpen's history as a synecdochal representation of white Southern history, the fall of his dynasty becomes emblematic of the "fall" of white Southern hegemony, a fall assumed by the narrators to originate in the "pollution" of black blood. Shreve's final equation provides an apocalyptic representation of the results of that pollution. In Shreve's calculation, Sutpen's black descendents cancel out the white until all that remains is the inarticulate Jim Bond, a single black idiot Sutpen, the last remnant of a once-great dynasty.</p>
<p>Given the open secret of miscegenation in the South, the narrators' repeated insistence on the tragic results of racial amalgamation seems out of proportion, particularly since they repeat their accounts of the demise of Sutpen's dynasty in 1909–10. During this period of post-Reconstruction retrenchment in the South, the initial social and political gains enjoyed by freed slaves were erased by institutionalized segregation and disenfranchisement, and reinforced by increased violence against blacks. However, the mobilization of white racism allowed the consolidation of white elite power by channeling white populist anger away from upper-class whites and onto African-Americans, a structure that persisted into the 1930s (and beyond).<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> The persistence of white supremacy invited comparisons to European fascism: Accusations of fascism Southern-style circulated liberally, from W. J. Cash's anatomization of the Klan as "an authentic folk movement" on a par with "the Nazi movement in Germany" to Grace Lumpkin's charge that Allen Tate and the Agrarians promulgated "theories … [that] are quite close to part of Hitler's and Mussolini's programs."<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> As Allan A. Michie and Frank Rhylick argued in <span style="font-style:italic;">Dixie Demagogues</span>, white supremacy was used to "crush the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> infant democracy of Reconstruction," and it was now being used "against the challenge of the New Deal and the labor polities of the CIO": "The Negro has been to the [Southern] Bourbons what the Jews have been to Hitler," they concluded.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">"A Happy Marriage of Speaking and Hearing": Creating Fascist Subjects</h1>
<p>In the post-Reconstruction white Southern imaginary, the white woman consolidated white patriarchal authority by guaranteeing the reproduction of the white family. Protecting white female purity from the imagined threat of miscegenation in the re of the black male rapist displaced class antagonism between elite and poor whites, allowing elite white men to consolidate political power. In addition, it displaced the potential threat posed by a newly-emergent black working class, allowing privileged whites to maintain economic power.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> In both <span style="font-style:italic;">Light in August</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, protecting white women against the "pollution" of black blood cements the white (male) community,<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> but where <span style="font-style:italic;">Light in August</span> represents the ritual sacrifice of the "black" outsider, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> represents the fundamental instability of the community and the ensuing need to reestablish its boundaries through the on-going production of the father and his legitimate white male heirs. In both novels, the structure is circular: the white community requires the expulsion of "pollution," and the expulsion of "pollution" constitutes the community.</p>
<p>Faulkner's representation of the vigilante "platoon" in <span style="font-style:italic;">Light in August</span> dramatizes the symbolic dependence of white male power on the supposed vulnerability of white women to rape by black men.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> It is Joanna Burden's violation more than her murder that inflames the mob, and after Percy Grimm shoots Joe Christmas, he castrates Christmas. "Flinging … the bloody butcher knife" away, he tells Christmas, "'Now you'll let white women alone, even in hell.'"<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> Castrating the black perpetrator ostensibly restores the social order of Jefferson, and the narrator tells us that it leaves Grimm's witnesses with the memory of Christmas's death, not as something "particularly threatful," but as something "triumphant" (<span style="font-style:italic;">LA</span>, 465).</p>
<p>The "triumph" of Percy Grimm adheres as much in his ability to constitute a makeshift militia for "the protection of America and Americans" as it does in avenging Joanna Burden's lost virginity (<span style="font-style:italic;">LA</span>, 454). Faulkner's depiction of Percy Grimm's "shirt"-style lynching mob associates Southern mob violence with both Nazi Storm Troopers and nativist fascist groups.<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> His representation of Grimm and his vigilantes as a quasi-militarist "platoon" distinguishes them from the <span style="font-style:italic;">ad hoc</span> lynching mobs that re in stories such as Faulkner's "Dry September" . What most interests me here is Faulkner's representation of the homosocial bond between Grimm and his followers.<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> Grimm organizes his own "platoon" out of the initially reluctant American Legion members who eventually accept Grimm "with respect and perhaps a little awe and a deal of actual faith and confidence" (<span style="font-style:italic;">LA</span>, 457). Their identification with Grimm transforms them from what the sheriff describes as "fifteen or twenty folks milling around the square with pistols in their pants" (<span style="font-style:italic;">LA</span>, 454) to a cohesive group: <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>[T]hey were almost at the pitch where they might die for him, if occasion arose. They now moved in a grave and slightly awe-inspiring reflected light which was almost as palpable as the khaki would have been which Grimm wished them to wear, wished that they wore, as though each time they returned to the orderly room they dressed themselves anew in suave and austerely splendid scraps of his dream.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">LA</span>, 457)</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The narrator's layered use of conditional statements in this passage subordinates the fact that the men are not literally dressed in uniforms in order to emphasize the way that identifying with Grimm produces a "palpable" uniform. Moving in his "aweinspiring … light" materializes Grimm's dreams like "splendid scraps" of the khaki Grimm "wished that they wore." The men's new "faith and confidence" in Grimm also seems to feminize them, converting individual men with phallic pistols in their pants into a unified and passive mass moving in Grimm's "reflected light."</p>
<p>Accepting Grimm as their leader transforms the group's bearing so that on the Monday morning of Christmas's Grand Jury hearing, the narrator remarks that the "intact" platoon "now wore uniforms. It was their faces" (LA, 457). The platoon's changed relationship with Grimm is literally written on their faces, their awe and confidence in Grimm as manifest as a khaki uniform would have been. In privileging the platoon's appearance over its interiority—that is, in describing the shift in allegiance as a visible sign written on their faces, not as a subjective experience—the narrator recapitulates fascism's critique of bourgeois interiority and emphasizes the aesthetic dimension of their political commitment.<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> By using the metaphor of changing clothes, the narrator materializes the newly forged homosocial bond as a rative "change in uniform." In critic Kenneth Burke's account of changes of allegiance, "the vesting and divesting of insignia" and "clothes, uniforms, and their psychological equivalents" are crucial markers of "one's material and mental ways of placing oneself as a person in the groups and movements."<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> The platoon's passive allegiance materializes their transformation from liberal individuals into a fascist mass.</p>
<p>Joanna Burden plays an instrumental role in the larger drama of Grimm's makeshift militia by serving as the impetus for its eventual action against Joe Christmas. But the focus of Grimm's action centers as much on the constitution of his platoon—and himself as its leader—as on its vengeance for Joanna Burden's violation and murder. In Grimm's imagination, defending "America" and avenging Joanna Burden's murder become conflated, and the mob's organization into the "intact" platoon encrypts Christmas's alleged crime into the group's coherence. The intact group of men—moving in the "awe-inspiring reflected light" of Percy Grimm—seeks vengeance for the assumed violation of Burden's intact hymen, a crime that symbolizes the larger violation of the white community and nation. The structural dynamics of homosocial identification in <span style="font-style:italic;">Light in August</span> reinforce the racial hierarchy that Joe Christmas's uncertain racial identity threatens to undermine. While the novel remains equivocal on the question of Christmas's racial heritage, it is the lynching itself that finally confirms Christmas's "blackness" for Grimm and unifies the whites in Jefferson. The bond among members of the community, then, <span style="font-style:italic;">relies on</span> the expulsion of "blackness": as Mason Stokes writes, "[w]hite supremacy … can be usefully understood as a homosocial network  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that commodifies and appropriates the bodies of white women and black men in order to consolidate both whiteness and heterosexuality as governing ideologies … and political structures."<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup></p>
<p>Faulkner's exploration of the homosocial bonds among Sutpen's "sons" in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> explicitly connects the construction of a white community to the drama of familial reproduction. Many critics have explored the mediating role that Judith Sutpen plays in the relationship between her brothers, Henry and Bon, noting, in particular, the Compson men's preoccupation with virginity, incest, and miscegenation as a manifestation of their desire for genealogical and racial purity and as an expression of repressed property relations.<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> What interests me here, however, is the mediating role that Rosa Coldfield's <span style="font-style:italic;">storytelling</span> plays in the production of Quentin and Shreve as Sutpen's "sons." Quentin and Shreve's bonding occurs as the result of Rosa's precipitating act of narration. Rosa reproduces the immediacy of Sutpen's originating voice, and telling Sutpen's story, as Matthews observes, "disseminate[s] the seed, fostering a family of tellings."<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s "family of tellings" operates through the <span style="font-style:italic;">rative</span> construct of marriage as a trope for conceptualizing "conversation" between like-minded individuals.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> By coupling anxiety about actual marriages—consummated or not—with "marriage" as a metaphor describing scenes of verbal transmission, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> explicitly connects biological and narrative reproduction. In turn, the novel's self-reflexive representation of national mythmaking doubles similar exercises in Italy and Germany and demonstrates the relationship between national myths and the production of subjects.</p>
<p>While both <span style="font-style:italic;">Light in August</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> have narrators who give voice to plots that shape the white community, the present "action" of <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> consists entirely of telling stories. If the men in Percy Grimm's lynching mob become a community by acting out their part in the story of "Negro rape," Quentin and Shreve become part of Sutpen's "family" by telling the story of becoming his sons. As they recreate Sutpen's history, they first imagine themselves riding <span style="font-style:italic;">with</span> Sutpen's sons—"not two but four of them riding the two horses through the dark"—and, then, they become <span style="font-style:italic;">merged</span> with them as "Charles-Shreve and Quentin-Henry" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 267). Their work of collaborative storytelling—and of imaginative connection—binds Quentin and Shreve to Sutpen as his "children" and to one another as members of a common family. Atkinson argues that <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s singular focus on Sutpen's containment in the repetition of his story "mediat[es] disruptions in the social order."<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup> True, but reading <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> as an antifascist "allegory" that "complicates and interrogates theories of racial purity and white supremacy" shared by white Southerners and fascists addresses only part of the novel's critique of fascism.<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup> What Atkinson and Brinkmeyer, Jr. both miss is the novel's exploration of the underbelly of Southern racism: the irrational appeal of belonging to something, signified by becoming Sutpen's "sons."</p>
<p>Beginning with Rosa's account of Sutpen's wrestling matches against his slaves, white witnesses are invited to identify with Sutpen as he exercises power.<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> More importantly, they are initiated into a symbolic order in which they experience themselves as simultaneously <span style="font-style:italic;">like</span> Sutpen and <span style="font-style:italic;">subject</span> to him. From this position, the viewer and then those who listen, experience their domination as a source of pleasure, which they  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> associate with belonging to Sutpen's family. The seductiveness of their subjection to Sutpen shapes the narrators who tell his story as well, and understanding their desire for the white father as the symbol of order helps explain their allegiance to Sutpen despite their knowledge of his origins, his ambition, and his cruelty. The novel's focus on <span style="font-style:italic;">voice</span>, then, fuses the "oratorical" performances of the Dixie demagogue with those of the fascist leader as it explores their complex appeal.</p>
<p>Rosa's voice precipitates the storytelling, and she serves as a physical link between Sutpen and his symbolic heirs. However, in contrast to feminist readings of Rosa, I suggest that Rosa's alternative narrative—her disruptive voice, if you will—works to <span style="font-style:italic;">allow</span>, rather than to challenge, the consolidation of masculine authority in the novel by legitimizing the erotic connection between Sutpen and successive generations of Southern men. The feminine in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, rather than <span style="font-style:italic;">opposing</span> patriarchal narrative, travels <span style="font-style:italic;">with</span> patriarchal narrative, as its <span style="font-style:italic;">necessary</span> "other," to bind subjects more fully to that narrative.<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> Feminist critics of <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> have had to grapple with the fact that Rosa, her vitriol against Sutpen notwithstanding, ultimately assents to—and even participates in—his design. Attempting to reconcile Rosa's "disruptive" voice with her apparent capitulation to patriarchy has prompted critics to split Rosa, casting her simultaneously as a character in the novel and as a disembodied "indeterminate narrative voice"; to make her representative of "both woman's disruptive power" and its consequence, "the annihilation of the female subject"; to cast her as unresponsive object rather than living subject.<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup> All of these readings decouple Rosa's subjectivity from her voice in order to account for the apparent disparity between her act of narration and her interpellation into Southern ideology. What connects these readings conceptually, however, is the assumption that the feminine is always disruptive, that it always operates in opposition to and in the interstices of patriarchal narratives.</p>
<p>In contrast, I contend that the novel dramatizes the necessary coupling of the feminine and masculine impulses, depicting their merger as the foundation of the Southern "nation." Rosa's voice—particularly in Chapter Five—invites identification with its own "<span style="font-style:italic;">I</span>," which, by capitulating to Sutpen's design "became all polymath love's androgynous advocate" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 117). Sutpen's insult prevents Rosa from birthing a literal heir, but she nevertheless gives birth to his symbolic sons. While <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s <span style="font-style:italic;">plot</span> turns on Rosa's refusal to gamble on producing an out-of-wedlock white male heir for Sutpen, its <span style="font-style:italic;">structure</span> dramatizes the creation of that next generation of "heirs" in Quentin and Shreve. Both the Northerner and the Southerner, connected as they are by the "umbilical cord" of the Mississippi River (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 208), become Sutpen's sons through the erotic identification with Henry and Bon that Rosa's voice initiates.</p>
<p>My reading of Rosa as the fascist mother to Sutpen's fascist father maps the "fascist fable" onto the Southern family romance through the mediating re of the white woman. If for Southern traditionalists the open secret of the Southern family romance is miscegenation, its central drama revolves around the reproduction of the white family through endogamous marriages producing legitimate white male heirs. Similarly, the fascist nation centers on a patriarch who embodies the nation and establishes the limits of the family. In both iterations, the sociopolitical formation of the family-as-nation  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> emerges through the incessant repetition of the same plot: identification with the father as the psychological bedrock of citizenship and the subsequent purging of "outsiders" from the (national) "family." As Wilhelm Reich wrote of fascism in 1936, "[T]he authoritarian position of the father reflects his political role and discloses the relation of the family to the authoritarian state."<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup> Central to the ideological construction of the nation in both instances is the equation of public belonging—citizenship—with the private experience of belonging to a patriarchal family. Yet as Reich argues, the father's political role in the family (and the state) depends on what critic Alice Yaeger Kaplan calls "mother-bound feelings."<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup> According to Reich, "[i]n their <span style="font-style:italic;">subjective emotional core</span> the notions of <span style="font-style:italic;">homeland and nation are notions of mother and family</span>."<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup> In the complex dynamic between "mother-" and "father-bound feelings," Kaplan argues that:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Hitler, even and especially Hitler, can be mother in a utopian moment, father in an authoritarian one.… [P]eople can identify with a leader-as-father, in that they imagine the leader's power over the state as being their own over their smaller world. But we could just as easily characterize the same moment as one in which a leader-as-mother 'gives birth' to people's feelings of power and euphoria.<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In the fascist state, as in the white Southern family in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, the psychological desire for belonging to the family depends on both the father- and mother-bound aspects of identification with the father, and it simultaneously enables and explains the perpetuation of social and economic privileges accorded its members.</p>
<p>Rosa Coldfield "gives birth" to Quentin and Shreve by giving voice—literally and ratively—to Sutpen's history, keeping him alive long after his death at the hands of Wash Jones. As the novel opens, Rosa's voice conjures Thomas Sutpen, producing for the reluctantly listening Quentin an almost palpable image of the demonic Sutpen and his gaggle of half-wild slaves. Her voice recounts Sutpen's story; more importantly, it actually <span style="font-style:italic;">produces</span> him. He is "resolved," "evoked," "invoked," made into a "picture" by Rosa's very act of telling (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 8, 9). By combining spectacle with voice, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> depicts the narrators' interpellation as both visual <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> oral: In recounting his story, witnesses conjure Sutpen, their voices making him "visible" to the next generation of white Southerners. <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s emphasis on the incantatory power of voice couples the sound of the narrators' voices with the "sonorous defeated names" "echoing" in Quentin's body and with the sound of Sutpen's originating voice (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 7). Rosa describes the foundation of Sutpen's design as a verbal act of creation—"<span style="font-style:italic;">Be Sutpen's Hundred</span> like the oldentime <span style="font-style:italic;">Be light</span>"—her voice reiterating the original speech act (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 4). If spectacle offers one means of enacting the domination of the father, the incantatory repetition of his voice offers another. Listening elicits the immediacy of presence, until Quentin, this time in response to his father's account, "could see it; he [Quentin] might even have been there" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 155). Yet the novel consistently distinguishes between "listening" and "hearing." Quentin, as audience to endless iterations, often refuses to listen as his only escape from the repetitive voices of Rosa and his father. But refusing to listen doesn't block out sound or consign him to silence. Instead, he "hear[s] … without listening," remembering at one point during his exchange with Shreve that  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> "<span style="font-style:italic;">I didn't need to listen then but I had to hear it and now I am having to hear it all over again because he sounds just like Father</span>" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 102, 171). Quentin doesn't need to listen—he grew up listening—but he "<span style="font-style:italic;">ha[s] to hear it again</span>." The very ubiquity of the story in all its repeated manifestations appears to structure the past as well as the present and the future. Quentin's thoughts turn the question, "<span style="font-style:italic;">Am I going to have to hear it again</span>" into the statement, "<span style="font-style:italic;">I am going to have to hear it all over again</span>," not only now ("<span style="font-style:italic;">I am already hearing</span>," "<span style="font-style:italic;">I am listening</span>"), but forever ("<span style="font-style:italic;">I shall have to never hear anything else</span>") (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 222).</p>
<p>Quentin's syntax suggests a <span style="font-style:italic;">desire</span> to hear that is intimately tied to the confluence of Shreve's voice with his father's. Quentin is compelled to hear, then, not just because he can't escape the speakers, but because the sound itself—the "notlanguage" of the deep South—compels his hearing (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 5). Sound conjures Sutpen's presence for Quentin's (and our) "viewing," and its incantatory power satisfies a deep, extra-linguistic desire. Sutpen's story is, of course, the narrators' story too, but that correspondence does not account for the desire driving Quentin "<span style="font-style:italic;">to hear it all over again</span>." Rather, it seems that his immersion in the repeated sound itself satisfies him as much as the story does. I am suggesting that this duality of "listening" and "hearing" offers another means for explaining why the narrators in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, who recognize (and condemn) Sutpen's ruthlessness and overweening ambition, feel nevertheless compelled to repeat his story, the very sounds themselves offering comfort and familiarity.</p>
<p>The distinction in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> between listening and hearing corresponds to a distinction Julia Kristeva makes between the symbolic and semiotic registers of language.<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65">65</a></sup> If the symbolic register, following Lacan, corresponds to the father and to the image, the semiotic corresponds to the maternal and to the vocal. Kristeva associates the semiotic with "the instinctual and maternal," with "rhythmic, intonal repetitions," and "a sonorous distictiveness" that is "no longer either a phoneme or a part of the symbolic system."<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66">66</a></sup> Faulkner's novel not only materializes the reproduction of culture, it also dramatizes the complex ways that language, through meaning and sound, inhabits and shapes consciousness. Quentin describes himself as a receptacle for sound, a veritable ear, "his very body … an empty hall echoing" with the sounds of "stubborn back-looking ghosts," his imagination and sense of himself products of that echo (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 7). In theorizing the interpenetration of semiotic and symbolic functions of language, Kristeva identifies a <span style="font-style:italic;">social</span> function for the semiotic disruption in poetic language, claiming that semiotic disruption works to counteract the repressiveness of modern culture.</p>
<p>Kristeva's theory of the disruption associated with the semiotic assumes that poetic language undermines rather than reinforces patriarchal structures of authority; however, she concedes that semiotic disruption "sometimes falls in with deeds brought about by the same rationality, as is, for example, the instinctual determination of fascism."<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67">67</a></sup> Highlighting the relationship between "modern rationality" and fascism underscores the difficulty in disentangling fascism from bourgeois political and economic formations, a point reiterated by Zeev Sternhell and Laclau and Mouffe, but it also points to the complex dialectic between the symbolic and the semiotic—or the father- and motherbound—in fascism. Fascism's capacity to yoke apparently contradictory impulses opens  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> up the possibility that the maternal might <span style="font-style:italic;">contribute</span> to supporting the authority of the father rather than always undermining it. Kaplan claims that understanding the work of the semiotic—the maternal, "oceanic" structures of language—in the rhythms of fascist rallies and the incantations of voice helps to explain the deep irrational pleasure associated with identification with the fascist father.<sup><a name="f68-text" href="#f68">68</a></sup> Thinking about the incantatory power of sound that shapes the narrative in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> illuminates, in part, Sutpen's enduring fascination for successive generations of Southerners. Sutpen is the product of speakers who, despite claims to the contrary, wish to naturalize his story, for to tell Sutpen's story is to tell their own and to establish, through the telling, the authority of their own voices. The effects of voice are contradictory for Quentin Compson, producing simultaneously the erotic pleasure of intimacy with the father and the paralysis that eventually leads to suicide. Quentin's "reverence for voice," to use Kaplan's formulation, "denote[s] dangerous desires for the acultural, the antiintellectual, the seductive, the <span style="font-style:italic;">fascist</span>," desires that allow him both to recognize and to suppress other voices, a point to which I will return.<sup><a name="f69-text" href="#f69">69</a></sup></p>
<p>The structural relation between the fascist leader and his followers casts the leader as "masculine" to a "feminized" mass, eroticizing the masses' relationship to the leader. We saw a version of this dynamic in the depiction of Percy Grimm's followers in <span style="font-style:italic;">Light in August</span>. However, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, voice becomes the means for producing fascist subjects. In his 1939 review of <span style="font-style:italic;">Mein Kampf</span>, Burke pointed out that Hitler assumes that the masses are feminine and that they "desire to be led by a dominating male. This male, as orator, woos them."<sup><a name="f70-text" href="#f70">70</a></sup> The "wooing" occurs through the leader's voice, but his voice seduces because it fulfills the masses' desire to be dominated. As many cultural historians have argued, this politicization of the body and of sexuality allowed the fascist leader, as Erin G. Carlson puts it, to substitute "his ecstatic, erotic fusion with the masses" for bourgeois individualism.<sup><a name="f71-text" href="#f71">71</a></sup> In societies that simultaneously privileged virility and persecuted homosexuality, the homosocial bond between the leader and his male followers had to be mediated by the "mother-bound" feelings produced by his voice, feelings which allowed for both their virility and their subjugation.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, storytelling cements the homosocial bonds between Southern men. With the exception of Rosa's conversation with Quentin, all the scenes of transmission are male-to-male, beginning with Sutpen's conversation with Quentin's grandfather, who, in turn, tells the tale to his son, Quentin's father, who then tells it to Quentin. Shreve's conversation with Quentin follows in this pattern, and the fact that Shreve's voice "sounds just like Father's" only reiterates the mapping of narrative and generational transmission that occurs before.<sup><a name="f72-text" href="#f72">72</a></sup> Conversing in the "warm rosy orifice" of their dorm room "above the iron quad (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 176)," the narrator observes that the two:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>stared at one another … There was something curious in the way they looked at one another, curious and quiet and profoundly intent, not at all as two young men might look at each other but almost as a youth and a very young girl might out of virginity itself—a sort of hushed and naked searching.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 240) <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p>Critics have read this scene widely, as evidence of both an actual sexual relationship between Quentin and Shreve and as a metaphoric representation of the erotics of speech.<sup><a name="f73-text" href="#f73">73</a></sup> I am arguing for something in between: the erotic charge between Quentin and Shreve is both real <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> symbolic. That is, an erotic connection occurs as a necessary aspect of their identification with Sutpen, a connection that depends on the seduction of voice.<sup><a name="f74-text" href="#f74">74</a></sup> I accept the claim that asserting normative sexuality becomes a constitutive component of Southern identity through the politicization of sexuality and raced bodies (a structure that mirrors similar structures in fascism). However, reading the homoerotic aspects of Quentin and Shreve's bond simply as a manifestation of repressed homosexuality fails to account for the complex ways that same sex desire is both necessary and anathema to white male identification with the planter–father. That is, the production of white male community and, consequently, white male subjectivity in the South <span style="font-style:italic;">depends</span> on homosocial desire. Quentin and Shreve themselves are vaguely aware of their sexual attraction to Sutpen. The experience of telling Sutpen's story, the narrator tells us, causes Quentin and Shreve to don "that protective coloring of levity behind which the youthful shame of being moved hid itself" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 225). Joking as they tell the story allows them to manage their arousal, which is simultaneously erotic and aesthetic.</p>
<p>Quentin and Shreve's arousal occurs as the result of their collaborative telling, their union producing "people" "out of the rag tag and bob-ends of old tales and talking" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 243). As this passage implies, their erotic speech is generative, suggesting the productive capacity of homosocial desire. The mediation of the imaginary "very young girl" legitimizes their "reproduction." Philip M. Weinstein argues that while <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> "imagines genealogical descent as a fantasy of purely male making," the novel's language encodes "the place of the female," so that "females … reappear … as the space of potential nurture" in, for example, "ripples, pools, feeding, and umbilical cords."<sup><a name="f75-text" href="#f75">75</a></sup> I suggest that the reappearing female red in the "very young girl" is made possible by Rosa's voice, which is itself described in generative terms as "like a stream, a trickle running from patch to patch of dry sand" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 4). Rosa's voice nurtures the "dry sand" of Quentin's imagination, and her invitation to Quentin revives the Sutpen "dynasty" by facilitating the generation of his symbolic heirs.</p>
<p>Sutpen's history unfolds through scenes of telling and listening, but these scenes are less dialogues than they are oratorical performances in which Rosa (and Mr. Compson) almost always insist that Quentin listen to stories he has already heard. Ross claims that the "oratorical" narrative voice in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> "integrates features of a cultural discourse into the fiction."<sup><a name="f76-text" href="#f76">76</a></sup> By evoking the tradition of Southern oratory in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s narrative voice, Ross argues, Faulkner draws attention to aspects of oratory that make oratorical speech a "ritual performed for reconfirmation of shared values."<sup><a name="f77-text" href="#f77">77</a></sup> While the orator "expresses the power of a discourse both orator and audience are caught up in, the orator still … dominates the audience," and this "domination implies violence." In the hands of Southern demagogues, the oratory "manifests a mixture of participation and domination," which is repeated in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>.<sup><a name="f78-text" href="#f78">78</a></sup> The features of Southern oratory that Ross locates in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> could also describe the performative aspects of Hitler's and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Mussolini's oratorical practices, where the fascist father's voice evokes his presence and asserts his authority, a connection made by critics of the "Dixie demagogue." These acts of symbolic violence in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> find a complement in the few scenes of dialogue, which, as Ross argues, "constitute scenes of assault, violence, even murder,"<sup><a name="f79-text" href="#f79">79</a></sup> a point that Warwick Wadlington underscores by suggesting that <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s narrators, by failing to acknowledge others, "produc[e] a desire to subject the other to one's power."<sup><a name="f80-text" href="#f80">80</a></sup> By making these private exchanges coercive and by suggesting that they shape white Southern identity, the novel explores the coupling of force and desire, of power and intimacy.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Democratic Aesthetics: Faulkner's Anti-Fascism</h1>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s focus on the corrosive effects of obsession with Sutpen combines a critique of the aestheticization of politics with a canny manipulation of the very forms that allow the style of politics to be de-coupled from its substance. Faulkner's emphasis on surfaces—on the sensuous effects of language in contrast to his characters' desire for "hidden" meanings—corresponds to fascism's representational strategies. The desire for depth becomes an effect, a means of manipulating reader/listeners, while images conjured through language suggest the operation of fascist spectacle where what a viewer sees is not what "is," but what recapitulates already-held ideas and beliefs.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> also embodies a central contradiction: its narrators reveal Sutpen's violent will-to-power, and the novel demonstrates the reproduction of that will-to-power in the narrators who repeat his story, yet the novel itself repeats a version of the same will-to-power, the same incantatory staging of domination in its own structure. All the narrators in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> tell essentially the same story, yet the allocation of the story to multiple narrators encourages us to see the versions told by Rosa, Mr. Compson, Quentin, and Shreve as distinct and different. Even though each narrator offers an ostensibly distinct point of view, Faulkner uses similar diction and syntax to represent each person's speech. This feature of the novel, which Ross dubs the "oratorical Overvoice," has been noted by many critics and is, in part, the result of Faulkner's practice while writing to move portions of the novel from one narrator to another.<sup><a name="f81-text" href="#f81">81</a></sup> As a result, the voices blend with one another until they sound alike, creating a monological effect in the text that reinforces the dramatized encounters themselves. This interchangeability of voices in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> underscores the novel's insistence on a single story, told from the point of view of the planter class and its descendents, while the totalizing <span style="font-style:italic;">aesthetic</span> perspective works to neutralize the fragmentation of white elite power in the social sphere.<sup><a name="f82-text" href="#f82">82</a></sup></p>
<p>That Faulkner deliberately chose to assign the narrative in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> to these characters—all white, all part of the same social class—is indisputable if we look at an early version of the Sutpen material, the story "Evangeline," which was not published until after Faulkner's death.<sup><a name="f83-text" href="#f83">83</a></sup> "Evangeline," like <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, contains multiple temporal frames: the first-person frame narrator, a newspaper writer who gets a tip about a "ghost" in an old Mississippi house from a local-color painter, goes to the old Sutpen house where he gets the story of the Sutpen children and Charles Bon from an old  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> slave woman who witnessed the Civil War-era events. This eyewitness—whom we learn is Henry and Judith's half-sister—anticipates the character of Clytie in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, but with a crucial difference: whereas "Evangeline" gives us the actual voice of the slave, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> grants Clytie no similar occasion for telling any of the interlocutors what she saw. By limiting <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s narrative point of view, Faulkner emphasizes the <span style="font-style:italic;">repetition</span> of Sutpen's story among its narrators as much as the content.</p>
<p>I suggest that this repetition points to the fact that identification with the father is never complete or final. Perpetually repeating the story simultaneously produces subjects and underscores the fragility of those subjects' identification with Sutpen, which, because it is never total, must constantly be reenacted. If we see the repeated stories as versions of Sutpen's wrestling matches—both are scenes of ritual domination—we might also understand each telling of the story as an opportunity for the narrator to <span style="font-style:italic;">withdraw</span> from identification with Sutpen by telling another story. But these alternative stories never get told. <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> suggests alternative narratives in the stories of Wash and Milly Jones and Sutpen's black children, but the white narrators appropriate these narratives, reframing them as stories about the consequences of being outside the "family."</p>
<p>Wash Jones's story becomes a cautionary tale in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, an occasion for exploring the possibility, as well as the consequences, of challenging Sutpen's authority. Jones's identification with Sutpen crumbles in the instant he realizes that Sutpen has no intention of acknowledging Milly's daughter as his own. Sutpen's failure to "make hit right" with Milly precipitates Jones's revenge, which the novel depicts as a recognition of the difference between "<span style="font-style:italic;">his kind and mine</span>" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 228, 233). Jones understands himself as different in "kind," sees that he is a victim of "men of Sutpen's own kind," who "set the order and the rule of living" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 232). But in Mr. Compson's telling (and Quentin's retelling with Shreve), this moment of difference, this "tech" of the real, becomes subsumed in accounts that deny the specificity of Sutpen's betrayal and Wash's disillusionment. Compson's representation of these events makes Wash's attack a capricious act of personal vengeance, rather than an act of class violence.</p>
<p>Repeating his father's story, Quentin acknowledges Jones's disillusionment, but he, too, neutralizes its challenge to Sutpen's class (and his own) by universalizing the story of flight. To run "from men of Sutpen's own kind" is to exchange "one set of bragging and evil shadows for another, since they (men) were all of a kind throughout all of earth" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 232). Quentin's assertion that all men are the same belies Jones's earlier awareness of a schism between himself and Sutpen, which Quentin, following his father, ignores. Jones's passivity and ultimate death reflect not only an awareness of the impossibility of escaping Sutpen's "kind," but also the fantasy of <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s narrators who thereby contain and neutralize the meaning of Jones's violence as an act of protest. By depicting Wash's self-immolation as a means for him and "<span style="font-style:italic;">all who remain of us</span>" to avoid disillusionment (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 233), Quentin and his father can imagine the wholesale destruction of the white working class as the result of the Jones's personal failure to identify with Sutpen. In short, they can imagine Jones's destruction as the inevitable outcome of challenging Sutpen's preeminence. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The narrators ultimately contain the threat of Wash's protest, but at least his story appears in some form. Unlike "Evangeline," which features the narrative of Sutpen's black daughter, none of <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s black characters offers an account of Sutpen's life. Instead, white narrators present Sutpen's history as the only Southern history, while the experiences of the Sutpen's black descendents emerge only through the mediation of white narrators. Jim Bond, the last "nigger Sutpen," remains a stubborn cipher, a zero who only maintains some presence through his inarticulate howls and groans (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 302). But Jim's name—Bond—exists as a reminder to Quentin of his historical and familial bond with Sutpen's black descendents, and it encrypts an acknowledgement of the continuing bondage of Southern blacks.</p>
<p>The challenges that Wash and Sutpen's black descendents represent to the white narrators' authority reflect the always partial identification of subjects with Sutpen. They also illustrate the power of the dominant narrative to circumscribe other narrators' ability to form counter-narratives. Resistance remains inchoate, a set of signifiers still seeking form, but glimpsed in Wash's scythe, felt in Clytie's touch, and heard in Jim Bond's howl.<sup><a name="f84-text" href="#f84">84</a></sup> Similarly <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, the novel, enacts a critique of fascism, without offering an alternative, anti-fascist narrative. By dramatizing the appeal of totalizing political and aesthetic formations to its narrators, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> provides an account of the power of national myths to shape the subjectivity of its citizen-characters. The novel makes visible the effects of these formations in Quentin's paralysis and suicide and Rosa's fury. However, <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> never suggests how subject-citizens might resist Sutpen, who, even after death, remains "somehow a thousand times more potent and alive" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 225).</p>
<p>We can read <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> as an instance of what Burke calls "debunking"—the liberal impulse to criticize without offering alternatives<sup><a name="f85-text" href="#f85">85</a></sup>—but I suggest that we might also see that <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s debunking produces a crucial kind of critique. The novel simultaneously affirms and challenges liberal narratives that pit fascism against democracy as democracy's opposite, or "other." <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> suggests that the danger of "the authoritarian personality" lies in its appropriation of all discourse into the "one voice" of fascism and the consequent distortion of individual subjects and whole cultures<sup><a name="f86-text" href="#f86">86</a></sup>. In its representation of the corrosive effects of monologism in the South—one party rule, white supremacy, arrested cultural development—<span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> affirms liberalism's assertion of fascism's absolute difference. However, the novel's structure, its "infection" by the totalizing impulse it criticizes, complicates the liberal narrative of democratic difference. <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s conversations <span style="font-style:italic;">suggest</span> dialogue while insisting on a single point of view, thus showing the vulnerability of democracy's "Babel of voices" to the power and appeal of "one voice."<sup><a name="f87-text" href="#f87">87</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s critique centers not only on the fascist tendencies of the Dixie demagogue, but, more importantly, on the very real possibility that democracy itself might spawn fascism.</p>

On popular cultural representations of fascist leaders, see Ted Atkinson, <span style="font-style:italic;">Faulkner and the Great Depression: Aesthetics, Ideology, and Cultural Politics</span> (Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 2006), Chapter 3.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f8" href="#f8-text">8. </a>Contemporary observers with liberal or radical politics were most likely to accuse the region of fascist tendencies. See for example, Katharine Du Pre Lumpkin, <span style="font-style:italic;">The South in Progress</span> (New York: The International Publishers, 1940), 113–119 and W. J. Cash, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Mind of the South</span> (New York: Vintage, 1991 [1941]), 134. However, Southern conservatives were also interested in exploring what a reactionary movement could learn from fascism. See Stark Young, "Notes on Fascism Today" I, II, III, <span style="font-style:italic;">New Republic</span> LXVIII (22 July, 29 July, and 5 August, 1931), 258–260, 281–83, 312–14; and Seward Collins's writings on fascism in the <span style="font-style:italic;">American Review</span> between 1933 and 1936, when Collins also published the work of the Southern Agrarians. On the connections between the Southern Agrarians and fascism, see Edward S. Shapiro, "American Conservative Intellectuals, the 1930s, and the Crisis of Ideology," <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Age</span> 23:4 (Fall 1979), 370–380; Albert E. Stone, Jr., "Seward Collins and the <span style="font-style:italic;">American Review</span>: Experiment in Pro-Fascism, 1933–1937," <span style="font-style:italic;">American Quarterly</span> 12:1 (Spring 1960), 4–19; Thomas Underwood, <span style="font-style:italic;">Allen Tate: Orphan of the South</span> (Princeton, NJ and Oxford: Princeton University Press, 2000), 201–210, 239–42; and Eugene Genovese, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Southern Tradition: The Achievement and Limitations of an American Conservatism</span> (Cambridge, MA and London: Harvard University Press, 1994), 88–91. All point out that none of the Agrarians actively supported a fascist  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> regime or group. Nevertheless, the accusations shaped cultural debate in the region during the 1930s when Faulkner was writing <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, as Robert H. Brinkmeyer, Jr., demonstrates in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Fourth Ghost: White Southern Writers and European Fascism, 1930–1950</span> (Baton Rouge, LA: Louisiana State University Press, 2009), Chapter 1.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f9" href="#f9-text">9. </a>The phrase "Southern family romance" comes from Richard H. King's <span style="font-style:italic;">A Southern Renaissance: The Cultural Awakening Of The American South, 1930–1955</span> (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1980) and refers to the Oedipal dynamics of the mixed race Southern "family," which revolves around a strong father and both his legitimate and unacknowledged offspring (26–38). For a reading of the Oedipal family in Faulkner's fiction, see John T. Irwin, <span style="font-style:italic;">Doubling and Incest / Repetition and Revenge: A Speculative Reading of Faulkner</span> (Baltimore, MA: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1975). The complex politics of family in the South (and in Faulkner's fiction) find a complement in the cultural politics of German and Italian fascism, which also coalesce around a father who defines familial—and national—belonging in racial terms. The reading of fascism as family pathology emerged first in Wilhelm Reich's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Mass Psychology of Fascism</span> (Vincent Carfagno, trans. [New York: Touchstone, 1970 ], 53), but this work was indebted to Freud's <span style="font-style:italic;">Group Psychology</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Totem and Taboo</span>. Psychoanalytic approaches continue to shape interpretations of fascism, which attempt to account for the appeal of fascism to its followers. See, for example, Hannah Arendt, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Origins Of Totalitarianism</span> (Cleveland, OH: Meridian, 1958); Alice Yaeger Kaplan, <span style="font-style:italic;">Reproductions of Banality: Fascism, Literature, and French Intellectual Life</span> (Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 1986); Emilio Gentile, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sacralization of Politics in Fascist Italy</span>, Keith Botsford, trans.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f12" href="#f12-text">12. </a>Italy and Germany provide the primary source of fascist iconography in the U.S.; however, Southern conservatives were also influenced by Action Française, a proto-fascist group Tate learned about during his Guggenheim year in Europe in 1928–29.

However, neither considers the emerging dependence of democratic culture on fascism's construction as its opposite.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f14" href="#f14-text">14. </a>On the connection between Sutpen and the Southern demagogue, see Stephen M.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f15" href="#f15-text">15. </a>Atkinson also argues that fascism shaped the discursive context in which Faulkner wrote; however, I suggest that Faulkner is able to draw on fascist formations because they overlap with already-existing tropes, such as the Southern demagogue and what King in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Southern Renaissance</span> calls the "Southern family romance."</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f16" href="#f16-text">16. </a>In the 1930s U.S. understandings of fascism were shaped by the politics of the beholder. Members of the Communist Party of the United States of America (C.P.U.S.A.) followed the Third International, which asserted in 1924 and then again in 1936, that fascism was the instrument of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> capitalism. Left-liberals (including some Marxist intellectuals) tended to see fascism as a product of decaying bourgeois culture, emerging from cultural fragmentation and social conflict, from a decayed middle-class family structure, and/or from the economic and social insecurity of the middle class. See Frank A. Warren, <span style="font-style:italic;">Liberals and Communism: The "Red Decade" Revisited</span> (New York: Columbia University Press, 1993), 89–101; Zeev Sternhell, "Fascist Ideology," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Fascism: A Reader's Guide</span>, ed. E. W. Laqueur (Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA and London: University of California Press, 1976), 315–76; and Payne, <span style="font-style:italic;">A History of Fascism</span>, 451–53. As Payne points out, the cultural pathology thesis appeared in work by Benedetto Croce, Georg Lukács, Wilhelm Reich, Adorno and Horkheimer, Erich Fromm, and American sociologists Harold Lasswell and Talcott Parsons (and it anticipated Hannah Arendt's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Origins of Totalitarianism</span>). Historians and political theorists continue to debate the origins of fascism. For more on the terms of this debate, see Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, <span style="font-style:italic;">Hegemony And Socialist Strategy</span>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (London: Verso, 2001); Walter Laqueur, <span style="font-style:italic;">Fascism: A Reader's Guide</span> (Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA and London: University of California Press, 1976); George L. Mosse, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Fascist Revolution: Towards a General Theory of Fascism</span> (New York: Howard Fertig, 1999); Ernst Nolte, <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Faces of Fascism</span> (Henry Holt and Company, 1966); and Sternhell, <span style="font-style:italic;">Neither Right Nor Left: Fascist Ideology In France</span> (Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA and London: University of California Press, 1986). The cultural pathology thesis matched up with contemporary views of the South as a place particularly vulnerable to authoritarian tendencies in its efforts to maintain white supremacy and suppress labor activism. For contemporary sources on the South's cultural pathology, see Allan A. Michie and Frank Rhylick, <span style="font-style:italic;">Dixie Demagogues</span> (New York: Vanguard Press, 1939); Lumpkin, <span style="font-style:italic;">The South in Progress</span>; and Cash, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Mind of the South</span>. In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Fourth Ghost</span>, Brinkmeyer, Jr. argues for the South's "irrationality" as exemplary of its "pathology" and connects the region's "irrational" culture to fascism's similar irrationality (7–11).</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f25" href="#f25-text">25. </a>In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sublime Object of Ideology</span>, when discussing the role of fantasy in ideology, Žižek observes that the object of "social-ideological fantasy is to construct a vision of society … which is not split by an antagonistic division, a society in which the relations between its parts is organic, complementary" . However, according to Žižek, in addressing the "distance between this corporatist vision and the factual society split by antagonist struggles," the society must introduce the fetish—for fascists, the Jew—which "simultaneously denies and embodies the structural impossibility of 'Society'" . According to Žižek, the fantasy of wholeness is always already corrupted; it is "the way the antagonistic fissure is masked.… [<span style="font-style:italic;">F</span>]<span style="font-style:italic;">antasy is a means for an ideology to take its own failure into account in advance</span>" .</p></div>

Vann. Woodward argues that the romanticization of the Old South was "one of the most significant inventions of the New South … a new idea in the eighties, and a legend of incalculable potentialities" . According to Michael O'Brien's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Idea of the American South, 1920–1941</span> (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1979), "Within the concept of the South, competing ideologies of agrarianism and industrialism reached an accommodation.… In truth, the first success of the New South was ideological" .</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f28" href="#f28-text">28. </a>Many critics have noted the yoking of the Southern historical narrative with the Compson family history. Focusing on repetition, Irwin in <span style="font-style:italic;">Doubling and Incest</span> observes, "This feeling that an ancestor's actions can determine the actions of his descendents for generations to come by compelling them  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> periodically to repeat his deeds is the form that the fate or doom of a family take in Faulkner" . King suggests that the Southern patriarchal tradition should be read as an attempt to come to terms with the "Southern family romance" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A Southern Renaissance</span>, 7). In <span style="font-style:italic;">Reading Faulkner</span> (Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press, 1989), Wesley Morris (with Barbara Alverson Morris) connects the story of a crisis in cultural and familial transmission with "a crisis of aesthetics" in Faulkner's fiction .</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f29" href="#f29-text">29. </a>The trope of the umbilical cord reappears in other narrators' accounts of the story to describe their connection to Sutpen as well. When Clytie touches Rosa's arm on the stairs at Sutpen's Hundred the day Henry kills Bon, Rosa describes herself "<span style="font-style:italic;">joined by [Clytie's] hand and arm … like a fierce umbilical cord, twin sistered to the fell darkness which had produced her</span>" . At this climactic moment, Rosa imagines herself made Clytie's twin through the agency of Clytie's touch. Clytie's hand connects Rosa to Sutpen like an umbilical cord, collapsing the distance between Rosa and Sutpen and suggesting the exchange of blood between the father and his two "daughters," one actual and one symbolic. The re reappears in Quentin's conversation with Shreve, when the narrator describes the Mississippi River as the "umbilical cord" that links Shreve's Canadian home to Quentin's Southern one .</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f32" href="#f32-text">32. </a>This sense of impotence also prompts the critical reflections of the high modernist Southern Renaissance and the plethora of nostalgic popular narratives—from Stark Young's <span style="font-style:italic;">So Red the Rose</span> to Margaret Mitchell's <span style="font-style:italic;">Gone with the Wind</span>—that construct and circulate the myth of the Old South.

I would add that the "pleasure" of narration lies not only in the recognition that  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> "truth is a matter of invention, not inquiry," as Matthews claims , but in the ways that narrating Sutpen's story produces an intimate connection between the tellers, who, by speaking of Sutpen, construct themselves as his sons.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f58" href="#f58-text">58. </a>It's tempting to read Sutpen's matches against his black slaves with the Max Schmelling versus Joe Louis ts in mind, especially given the symbolic meanings attached on both sides to a black American pitted against an exemplar of the Aryan race. While Faulkner does not refer to the Louis-Schmelling contests in his published correspondence in the 1930s, their first bout occurred in 1936, the year Faulkner published <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, and the press build-up for the match began well before that. Rosa's representation of Sutpen's ritualized ts recalls the structures of the fascist "cult of war and danger" by establishing violence as a regenerative activity and by associating hand-to-hand combat with virility and the representation of national power (Sternhell, "Fascist Ideology," 341). For more on the cult of violence and its representation in fascist spectacle, see Falasca-Zamponi, <span style="font-style:italic;">Fascist Spectacle</span>, 26–41. We might think about these staged events in the context of staged fascist spectacles like Mussolini's march on Rome or Hitler's Nuremberg rallies, which worked in the Italian and German contexts as the source of central national myths for the Fascists and National Socialists.

Robin Pickering-Iazzi (Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 1995), 76–99. Notions of "masculinity" and "femininity" structured the discursive spaces in which fascism maintained power; as a result, critics have distinguished between actual subjects and the ideology of gender that shaped fascist representations of the state and family. Because these discursive formations were decoupled from actual subjects, critics have also explored the ways that actual women appropriated gendered discourse within fascist societies both in support of fascist regimes and in protest: see Barbara Spackman, <span style="font-style:italic;">Fascist Virilities: Rhetoric, Ideology, and Social Fantasy in Italy</span> (Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 1996) and Nancy Locke, "Valentine de Saint-Point and the Fascist Construction of Woman," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Fascist Visions: Art And Ideology In France and Italy</span>, Matthew Affron and Mark Antliff, eds.

On fascism's anti-liberalism, see Sternhell, "Fascist Ideology," 325–37. On fascism and the individual, see the same source, 344–349. Spackman argues that "the [fascist] cult of youth, of duty, of sacrifice and heroic virtues, of strength and stamina, of obedience and authority, and of physical strength and sexual potency … are all inflections of that master term, virility" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Fascist Virilities</span>, xii). For more on the "Rhetoric of Virility," see Chapter 1. On fascist masculinity, see George L.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f72" href="#f72-text">72. </a>In using the word "conversation" to describe the scenes of telling and listening, I deliberately invoke the several meanings of the term, suggesting that these verbal exchanges occur because the characters (including Shreve) share values. In the case of the Compson men and Rosa Coldfield, they also share a heritage; that is, they reproduce the culture in which they have been born. In claiming that Shreve shares the interests of the Compsons, Sutpen, and Rosa Coldfield, I build on Matthews's claim that Shreve projects onto his account of Bon's desire for a father his own desire "since he too seeks patriation in an adopted new land" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Play</span>, 144). We can see Shreve's desire for a father—and a "fatherland"—as akin to the other characters' desire for Sutpen as the fascist-father. As Matthews points out, Shreve's "references to 'Aunt' Rosa Coldfield betray his senses of the South as a vast family and of his own need for adoption" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Play</span> 145). I suggest, therefore, that we can see Quentin and Shreve's "happy marriage of speaking and hearing" at the end of the novel not as a departure from the earlier conversations, but as a similar reproduction of established lines of power through the rative allusion to marriage (<span style="font-style:italic;">A</span>, 253).</p></div>

Jones—"Coming Out Through History's Hidden Love Letters in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom, Absalom!</span>," <span style="font-style:italic;">American Literature</span> 76:2 (June 2004), 339–66—read this conversation as a partially obscured scene of actual sexual climax, arguing that telling Sutpen's story is a form of sexual expression for Quentin and Shreve and that the novel's representation of suppressed "deviant" sexuality recapitulates the expressed threat of miscegenation (Entzminger, 90, 98–100; Jones, 339, 344–347). Matthews reads the scene metaphorically, arguing that the narrator's desire for an absent other is "analogous to the desire of the storyteller for his subject's representation" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Play</span>, 130).</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f74" href="#f74-text">74. </a>Entzminger emphasizes the "seductive power of speech," drawing on Shoshana Felman to argue—in Felman's terms—for the "'pleasure-taking performance of the very production of speech'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Passing as Miscegenation</span>, 99). I suggest that the erotic pleasure of speech must be connected to the "originating" power of the paternal voice in order to understand fully how the fascist father "seduces" rather than simply subjugates through his voice.</p></div>

On the similarity of voices in <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>, Ross claims that <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span>'s "oratorical voice" is "monological in form and content, for it articulates certainty." He observes that "[m]any commentators on the novel have emphasized differences among the narrators, finding each discourse to be motivated by the psychic needs of the storyteller. The distinctions in tone, style, or type of metaphor, however, seem in the final analysis incidental compared to the overwhelming consistency of an oratorical Overvoice pervading the entire text … All the narrators more or less 'sound like father'—and 'father' names a principle of authority greater, of course, than Mr. Compson" ((<span style="font-style:italic;">Inexhaustible Voice</span>, 213 and 220–21).

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f84" href="#f84-text">84. </a>Slavoj Žižek, drawing on Laclau and Mouffe, argues that "'[i]deological space' is made of non-bound, non-tied elements, 'floating signifiers,' whose very identity is 'open,' overdetermined by their articulation in a chain of other elements." These signifiers are "structured into a unified field through the intervention of a certain 'nodal point' … which 'quilts' them, stops their sliding and fixes their meaning" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Sublime Object</span>, 87). The "nodal point" that fixes signifiers into one "quilt" as opposed to another is always situated; it consolidates and focalizes a point of view, a position within the ideological field that is one of many (unequally) possible points-of-view. Žižek's description of an "ideological quilt" helps explain how <span style="font-style:italic;">Absalom</span> might construct non-identical narratives—the "Southern family romance" and the "fascist fable"—from the same pool of "floating signifiers." I point out the lability of the ideological space in order to support my claim for the co-existence of the "Southern family romance" and the "fascist fable," but also to suggest that the "Southern family romance" ultimately succeeds in fixing meaning more effectively than the "fascist fable," as the scholarly literature reveals. I am not arguing that the "fascist fable" is "truer" or more representative of "what really happened," but, rather, that the legibility of one narrative over the other <span style="font-style:italic;">itself</span> illuminates the operation of the ideological field, a point I cannot develop at length here.</p></div>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span><p>The influx of Russian film theory through the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Close-Up</span> (1927-1933) provided English audiences with their first glimpse of Russian Formalism, many of whose proponents, most notably Victor Shklovsky, had turned to film criticism and production in the early twenties. Drawing on H. D.'s review of a film written by Shklovsky and her essay on Carl Dreyer's <span style="font-style:italic;">Joan of Arc</span>, this essay reads H. D.'s contributions to <span style="font-style:italic;">Close-Up</span> in conjunction with her prose experiments, to identify a tension between her idealization of film as a universal language and her lingering anxiety that film restricts the creative agency of spectatorship.</p>

<p>[One] should have expected the history of "imagistic art," as they call it, to consist of a history of changes in imagery. But we find that images change very little; from century to century, from nation to nation, from poet to poet, they flow on without changing. Images belong to no one: they are "the Lord's" … Images are given to poets: the ability to remember them is more important than the ability to create them.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Images are often taken as peculiar icons of "presentness." This prevailing myth suggests that images tell essential stories about the conditions of modernity, since their very form (as Lessing once insisted) is one of simultaneity. And yet, images—whether visual or verbal—are also uncanny products of time; they stand in a mysterious relation to their present usage. This may explain Viktor Shklovsky's contention, in his 1917 essay "Art as Technique," that a rigorous history of poetics must be based upon changes of technique, since the images presented in poetry are not themselves essentially new. His point is not that images are strictly speaking "ahistorical," but simply that their histories cannot be concretely narrated. As Shklovksy suggests, images are profoundly impersonal—they "belong to no one"—because, as heightened forms of remembrance, they recall histories of use and reference that exceed their immediate appropriation. We might say, then, that part of what images conceal is their distance from us, just as what they reveal is our distance from our own perceived modernity. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The observation that images are by nature untimely pertains to the ongoing reappraisal of the relation between modernist literature and the culture of film, since cinematic form has so often been called in to support narratives of stylistic modernity.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> Indeed, it is often taken for granted that the novelty of cinematic practices provides a self-evident paradigm for modernism's own obsession with formal innovation. According to this assumption, the striking features of film's representational mechanisms—montage, close-up, the flicker of moving images—become the stylistic models for textual practices, whether or not such connections can be substantiated beyond the barest analogy.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> Yet, if cinematic style does not correspond in neatly material ways to the experiments of modernist literature, and if, as David Trotter rightly points out, our critical desire to affirm such a relation often betrays a disconcerting anachronism, we still need to be able to account for the ways that the concept of cinema itself offered writers a kind of analogy, through which the distinct aims of literary representation were articulated and modified.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> Although the "literary" and the "cinematic" can have only limited use if taken as axiomatic empirical categories, or as self-fulfilling indices of medium specificity, they often operate, as rhetorical res, with a curious disregard for this fact. Attending to the ways that modernist writers reflected on literary form in their engagements with film may not always confirm direct or concrete narratives of influence, but it does shed light on the contested reception of cinema as it came to be considered an art, and the reciprocal ways in which the identity of "literature" was redefined in the process.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The entanglement of literary and cinematic form is especially prominent in the criticism and prose work of H. D. in the 1920's and early 1930's. As Susan Stanford Friedman has argued, H. D.'s prose experiments reflected a concerted attempt to trouble her reputation as an Imagist poet.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> This shift of stylistic modes, as H. D. framed it in a 1919 letter to John Cournos, arises out of the conflicting ways of seeing implied by each genre: "You must remember that writing poetry require[s] clarity, a clairvoyance almost … But in the novel I am working through a wood, a tangle of bushes and bracken out to a clearing, where I can see <strike>clearly</strike> again."<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> The obstruction, if not the elision, of clarity that H. D. identifies as the perverse capacity of prose fiction, provided a model for her contributions to the film journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Close-Up</span>. These reviews, like her remarkable prose experiments from the period, depart from a typically Imagist attempt to transcend rhetorical verbiage through the crystallization of the visual, exploring instead how the complexities of vision solicit and are transformed by the thickets of language, metaphor, and reference. Indeed, it might be said that her critical engagement with cinema provided a crucial vocabulary for her "Dijon" novellas of the late twenties and early thirties.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> The index of this influence, however, is not limited to the ways that H. D.'s fiction emulates cinematic technique; rather, in H. D.'s film criticism she develops a kind of literary spectatorship, a way of writing about the act of seeing, that begins to double for the detached omniscience of prose works like her novella, "The Usual Star."<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>In locating a connection between H. D.'s narrative practices and the impersonal forms of spectatorship modeled by her criticism, I hope to show that the coincidence of H. D.'s experimentation in prose fiction and her interest in cinema can help to contextualize the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> ambivalent tone of her articles for <span style="font-style:italic;">Close-Up</span>, which mix literary and cinematic categories in ways that are strikingly, often frustratingly, oblivious of the ostensible "specificity" of these mediums. This tonal ambivalence can be flummoxing, but we should resist the temptation to ignore it by neatly assimilating her film criticism either to the contemporary psychoanalytic models developed by Freud or to the theories of montage and reception put forward by Eisenstein.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> As Laura Marcus observes of <span style="font-style:italic;">Close-Up</span> generally, the journal sought to establish film as an art precisely by "finding a form of writing and language adequate to the cinema … a discursive medium and forum commensurate with the new art."<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> For this reason, I find it less productive to reduce H. D.'s essays on film to their more well-known definitions of cinematic beauty than to underscore the modes of writing in them which cinematic spectatorship enables. Her dense and elusive commentaries must be read carefully as themselves mini performances of the ideas they are trying to convey. Drawing on H. D.'s review of <span style="font-style:italic;">By The Law</span> (written by Viktor Shklovsky and directed by Lev Kuleshov), I take Shklovsky and H. D. as exemplifying two distinct and admittedly extreme approaches to the relation of cinema to literature. While Shklovsky subordinates cinematic style to formalist literary categories, H. D. seeks to reconre narrative conventions through an enthusiastic emulation of the mode of visionary consciousness epitomized by cinematic spectatorship. Using a common text—<span style="font-style:italic;">By the Law</span> —as a way to clarify these divergent strategies, I suggest that H. D.'s writing shaped itself through gestures of comparative differentiation, even as it sought to transcend the antagonistic rhetorical conditions that structure film's relation to literature.</p>

<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>The cinema has no laws; the best proof of this is that in our language only one brochure in all has been written on the 'laws of cinema' (by V.

<p>Viktor Shklovsky, father of Russian formalism, made a name for himself as a proponent of the science of poetics, the inner "laws" of literature and what he called the "revolution of the word," but he was equally a commentator on film. Between 1923 and 1930, Shklovsky was the author of more than 15 articles and multiple monographs on film,<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> and one can see in his work the ways in which his early definitions of literature shaped his appraisal of cinematic form. In "Art as Technique" (also translated as "Art as Device"), for example, Shklovsky seeks to define literary art by displacing the centrality of images. For Shklovsky, art cuts through the layers of habit and memory in order to reopen the world to the immediacy of unformed sensation, a sensation that has been reawakened, or "turned over like a log in a fire," as he puts it in <span style="font-style:italic;">Literature and Cinematography</span> .<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> Methodologically, this required a critique of what Shklovsky considers the false economy of images that facilitate a dubious efficiency. This false  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> impression of immediacy arises, he argues, from the comparative structure of verbal res which "clarify the unknown by means of the known."<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> This kind of "thinking in images," Shklovsky contends, brings the world too quickly to us as a predigested abstraction, while the aim of literary form is precisely to restore the "unknown" to perception through techniques of repetition and delay ("impedence" and "deceleration"), and by renegotiating the history of literary conventions (which need, periodically, to be replaced). In this way, the formalist definitions of "literariness" also carried basic, and often contradictory, assumptions about the discontinuous temporalities of literature, and about its constant need for renewal or "evolution."</p>
<p>Shklovsky's engagement with film (as theorist and screenwriter) in the twenties can be seen as an extension of problems endemic to his study of literature, rather than as a general application of the "formal method" to a new medium. Although Shklovsky was, among the members of the formalist school (OPOYAZ), the most prolific commentator of film, his attitude towards it betrays a marked skepticism. Indeed, it is fair to say that Shklovsky conceived of film almost entirely from the perspective of literature. He himself was a screenwriter (working notably with Abram Room and Lev Kuleshov), and while his criticism often attempts to specify the "form and material" unique to each art, his account of film relied heavily on the vocabulary derived from his work on literature.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> Shklovsky's mostly inconclusive attempts to locate "poetry and prose" in film,<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> his many discussions of film "semantics,"<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> his emphasis on the impossibility of abstract film and on the centrality of plot (in spite of the contemporary achievements of Vertov and Eisenstein in the creation of increasingly non-narrative forms of documentary and historical drama,)<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> and the concomitant privilege he accorded to the creative authority of the script<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup>—all of these point to the awkward and apparently antagonistic relationship that he discerned between literature and film. In his criticism literature colonizes film; its interpretation is inflected with distinctly literary categories, values, and criteria.</p>
<p>It is perfectly emblematic, then, that his first foray into film production, Kuleshov's 1926 film <span style="font-style:italic;">By the Law</span> (Po zakonu), was a literary adaptation.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> For Shklovsky, film needed to be explained in the language of literature if it was to be accepted.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> Cinematic expression (as technique) imitates literature, Shklovsky suggests, in its ability to "tak[e] representation out of its usual focus," and yet Shklovsky argues, somewhat perplexingly, that cinematic art, like linguistic art, cannot be based on the composition of its images but only on the movement of its plot.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> Shklovsky's reluctance to define film in terms of its visual imagery, as in the similar reluctance to admit imagery a central role in literature, stems from his distrust of the promise of expediency held out by the image; and it is in this way that Shklovsky exiles cinema from art on Bergsonian grounds:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Human motion is a continuous magnitude; human thought represents continuity as a set of impulses, a set of segments infinitely minute, minute to the point of continuity … The cinema is a child of the discontinuous world. Human thought has created for itself a new non-intuitive world in its own image and likeness … A film does not move; it only appears to move. Pure motion, as such, will never be reproduced in cinematography. Cinema can only deal with the motion-sign, the semantic motion … The semantic motion-sign triggers  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> our recognition; we complete it; it does not demand our attention … Fundamentally, cinematography is extraneous to art.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In other words, the motion of cinematic images is always remembered, always a product of synthesis and reconstruction on the part of the viewer, and because of this Shklovsky holds that it can only approximate the rejuvenating function of art. Film "art," in this sense, is defined as implicitly borrowed, and the primary source of its translations, he argues paradoxically, is literature (which offers, in its techniques of delay, a more "true" representation of human thought). The formalist attention to film thus locates it as the principle sign of growing confusion in the arts, a fact that is confirmed all the more by Shklovsky's attempts to explain it according to a "literary science." Shklovsky's ambivalent writings on film, however, ultimately testify to the failure to fulfill this ambition. As he writes in a 1927 article entitled "The Temperature of Cinema," "Everything that I have written is disproved by cinema."<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> In his writing this is practically true—nearly all of his articles end in mid-thought, as if halted by the forms of discontinuity he sought to describe.</p>
<p>H. D. reviewed Kuleshov's <span style="font-style:italic;">By the Law</span>, which was adapted for the screen by Viktor Shklovsky, for the July 1928 issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Close-Up</span>.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> All of Shklovsky's care for the ordering of the plot, however, may have gone unnoticed—for H. D. arrived at the theater roughly twenty minutes late.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> Perhaps for this reason, but in any case in spite of it, her reading of the film has very little to do with what happens, or with any of the elements of plot construction which so obsessed Shklovsky.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> Instead, H. D.'s reading of the film is focused precisely on the dispersed temporality of discrete images, which Shklovsky believed disqualified film from the realm of art. For H. D., film offers a vehicle for "abstract … remote … symbolical" meanings, suggestions of mythic or visionary parallels that bear only indirectly on the film's plot (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 126). Such images stand apart, exerting a cryptic power upon their viewer and on the extra-filmic "preparations" of the viewer—that time spent before entering the theater, wandering the streets. H. D. views film as addressing itself to the gap between the ordered time of the film's narration and the erratic time of viewing, a gap in which the image becomes subject to variable "intentions."</p>
<p>"Someone had apparently killed someone," she writes of her confusion at arriving midway through the film,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Someone was heaving a weight of something and against an upright ledge of mud, the rain poured and soaked and ran and gorged runnels in the already over-soaked bit of bed earth. Bad lands, something wasted, wasteful, over-done and done with. Rain poured over a slab of earth and I felt all preparation of the extravagantly contrasting out of doors gay little street, was an almost ironical intention, someone, something "intended" that I should grasp this, that some mind should receive this series of uncanny and almost psychic sensations in order to transmute them elsewhere; in order to translate them. Rains soaked across a slab of mud, runnels bored and jabbed and pockmarked and gusseted it. There was never an earth that could be ever again so drab, so unproductive.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 125–126). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The process of singling out these "uncanny" details—images of waste and rain and mud—for a heightened attention serves a double function. It exaggerates the materiality of these shots, their recalcitrant resistance to narrativization, while at the same time leaving this wasted field of visual signs to be all the more completely subsumed—"transmuted … translated"—by the generality of reading in which such details are construed as merely occasions for imaginative expansion. Here we see H. D. straining language to capture the elusive scintillesence of water on the screen during the film's scene of burial—"the rain poured and soaked and ran and gorged"; "runnels bored and jabbed and pockmarked and gusseted"—straining, in other words, to demonstrate the remote singularity of an image that cannot be translated, and which remains, from a narrative perspective, recalcitrantly "unproductive." At the same time, such translation involves a decontextualization, a stripping of content, that leaves such images tied only to "somewhere," "someone," "something."</p>
<p>In becoming loosely symbolic, then, the images at once free themselves from the utility of narrative and open themselves to an unstable signification in the creation of an atmosphere that is partly depicted and partly imagined. The labor of such spectatorship consists in a heightened form of "reading," a recalibration of visual tropes into codes of reference and allusion. The effect of such reading, as H. D.'s criticism attests, is two-fold and contradictory: it lends emphasis to the fragmentary or non-narrative agency of images, while at the same time offering a form of interpretive consolidation that essentially looks beyond what is shown to discover a landscape of imageless truths and ancient types. This is what H. D. in effect elaborates as she continues with her description, employing the language of classical culture in order to characterize the wasteland that Kuleshov's film presents:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Death and all its drab significance rose in its starkness to some almost Eleusinian note of purity. So abstract the land, so remote and symbolical the two res of the living that dragged the two sacks or canvas sails that had been wrapped about the two long bodies of the slain, so heavy and dreary the rain, so slippery the mud, so terrible the lowering of the sky above the rain (which one sensed was there simply for the re-harrowing of these living res) that the spirit as in the Aeschuylean drama rose above, shouted almost audibly with the elements, <span style="font-style:italic;">the soul, the soul survives</span>. The soul was embodied in two res, man and woman, if that long ungainly creature with the hair whipped about lean, gargoyle face was a woman … like some wan and exquisite Persephone, crying to be buried, dragged in and taken back and back away from human consciousness, like those two others, … But the intention of the story, greater than its mere plot, could not possibly be misread; death and death and death and bad lands and waste and the Aeschuylean lowering of the blank skies (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 126).</p></blockquote>
<p>What such a reading of cinematic images asks after, we might say, is the status of embodiment at the fragile edge of language. Where do the wasted fragments of rain and damaged earth end, and the Aeschuylean drama begin? It is as if, for H. D., the very qualities that detach these images from the film's plot, and which define the material of their visual contours, in fact exacerbate the language of universality that finally  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> sweeps in, overtaking them. Despite her protestations to the contrary, then, it would seem that any reading of film flirts with "misreading," since it must reconstitute the dramatic movements of the screen into a chain of symbols.</p>

<p>The border between visual and textual representation is clearly porous for H. D., though in a different sense than we saw in Shklovsky's theorizing. For H. D., writing and film share precisely what Shklovsky wished to remove from consideration: the image as the element of a work that stands eerily outside of its narrative strategies, thereby challenging any attempt to define art in terms of its "internal laws." The image—in writing as in film—opens the work to an intertextuality that grossly exceeds a particular narrative or set of themes or motifs, for it always exists "outside" of its present usage. Images "belong to no one," as Shklovsky puts it, "they are 'the Lord's.'" For H. D.'s work this statement rings doubly true; in this case, the particularity of the image is what withdraws from the work, as well as what defines it, and H. D.'s articles can be read as an attempt to make representation "mirror" such withdrawal. Film, as it were, becomes the place where writing loses itself in the shared "destiny" of the image. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

</blockquote>
<p>H. D.'s criticism on film, it might be said, is always about something else, not about something other than film, but about the "something else" that constitutes film. To understand the uncanny nature of her writing about film, it should be noted that H. D. rarely refers to the most basic analyzable elements of cinematic composition. She doesn't, for example, elaborate on the effects of lighting, or the dynamics of framing or mise-en-scene. For this reason Laura Marcus has observed that H. D.'s writing on film tends to take the form "not [of] retrospective judgment on a film, but a performative running commentary on the processes of spectating which became a form of 'inner speech,' acting as a screen onto which the film images could be projected."<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> This is certainly true, although H. D. is less interested in recounting the waves of emotion and feeling that films might provoke (that is, less interested in using film as a springboard for the stream-of-consciousness model of criticism offered by Dorothy Richardson's "Continuous Performance" column in the same journal) than in describing the impersonal  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> terrain communicated by a film's images. What interests her is how perceptions unite the visible register with something that also exceeds it—a hidden layer of reference and symbolization. In this sense, the model of spectatorship constructed by H. D. is non-subjective, or, if you prefer, it is constituted by a fantasy of non-subjectivity.</p>
<p>Her aggressive style of writing about film, then, becomes a strategy for creating the objectivity of such depersonalization. The act of writing about film is not obliged to help us understand it, she implies, but should make us see in a new way by foregrounding a sense of film's indeterminacy in the act of reception. This may be why H. D.'s essays on film avoid speaking of characters, but describe instead the properties of face or profile, the imposing res cut by the bodies on the screen. Such is her interest in "Edith" from <span style="font-style:italic;">By the Law</span>, who assumes the role of a kind of cipher in place of any fictive personality:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The gestures of this woman are angular, bird-like, claw-like, skeleton-like and hideous. She has a way of standing against a skyline that makes a hieroglyph, that spells almost visibly some message of cryptic symbolism. Her gestures are magnificent. If this is Russian, then I am Russian. Beauty is too facile a word to discuss this; this woman is a sort of bleak young sorceress, vibrant, febrile, neurotic, as I say almost cataleptic … She is skeleton-like and death-like … Her teeth protrude, and her cheek bones are hollow, her skull is picked, so to speak, of its meat by misery and waiting. Her mind is on the raw edge of breaking, her eyes roll in terror and madness and numbness of misery … Her face can be termed beautiful in the same way that dawn can be termed beautiful rising across stench fever of battle … there is no word for such things. Her mind, her soul, her body, her spirit all vibrate, as I say, almost audibly. One is beyond personal discernment. This is psychic, compelling, in a way destructive. I could not see many of these Russian films if there are others like this …" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 126–127).</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In passages such as these, the field of visual detail begins to crumble away before a seemingly endless chain of description, analogy and comparison. Once a certain "vibration" is reached, H. D. suggests, cinematic representation begins to push in multiple directions at once, casting light on a "cryptic symbolism."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> This way of reading, she notes, lies "beyond personal discernment," in the domain of myth and sublimity. This perspective no doubt mystifies things, demanding of films nothing less than ecstatic revelation, in which, as she goes on to say, "I can 'witness' almost fanatically the 'truth'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 127); and yet H. D. spiritualizes film precisely by highlighting its most ruined, "skeleton-like," aspect. The dual emphasis on "withered" materiality and symbolic "life" indicates the way in which H. D. universalizes perception, though only at the cost of destroying its objects.</p>
<p>In a sense, H. D. is not far off from Woolf's insight—in her 1926 essay, "The Cinema"—that cinematic perception maintains its effect of presence by presuming the loss of subjective life, presenting only "life as it is when we have no part in it."<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> Here the point is the same, except that for H. D. the recognition of loss does not carry an elegiac force. Rather, the loss of self is seen as the point of departure for an ecstatic vision that promises transcendental elevation. Kuleshov, she writes, "uses the screen almost as a psychic medium, art on the high almost un-natural level of Aeschuylean  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> trilogies" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 127). The beauty offered by such exceptional films, she goes on to say, must of necessity "destroy" the sense of reality as such; "… it was my first Russian film and I have said that it is perhaps destructive. Beauty is that. This sort of raw picked beauty must of necessity destroy the wax and candy-box 'realism' of the so much so-called film art. It must destroy in fact so much that perhaps it does 'go' as one of our party said 'too far'" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 127).</p>

<p>But if the film destroys the reality of the world, or—what amounts to the same thing—subsumes the "presentness" of the world in the mythic reach of its symbolic movement, filmic "beauty" (a term she continues to use after signaling its insufficiency) remains irreducible to either visual surface or linguistic abstraction. From the skeleton to the symbol, H. D.'s contradictory aesthetics of the image straddles a heightened materiality.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup></p>
<p>In fact, what might be most distinctive about H. D.'s reading of film is her insistence on the restless antagonism and violence that underwrites cinematic spectatorship. Her essays on film constantly make reference to largely conventional categories of aesthetic judgment—"beauty," "truth," the "classic"—and yet these categories are relentlessly qualified by her description, where "beauty" becomes "dawn … rising across stench and the fever of battle … there is no word for such things," or "skeleton-like … death-like." H. D. employs the language of idealism or spiritualism in order to describe a world that always seems to fall somewhat short of its exalted epithets.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> The importance  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of the iconic detail is that it encrypts a relation that is always "half-finished"—which in turn is "helped" and completed in the act of spectatorship.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>The world of the cinema, the world of ghostly particularity, then, must be reconstructed. H. D.'s film criticism testifies both to the exalted claims for the power of spectatorship to evoke a "universal" community founded on a shared symbolic experience, and to the felt impossibility of sharing symbols whose erratic inscription in the material world makes their common legibility problematic. H. D. certainly subscribed to the utopian understanding of film as a "universal language," and to its ability to reach across national boundaries. "The world of the film to-day," she writes in her review of Russian cinema, "is no longer the world of the film, it is the world. It is only those who are indifferent to the world itself and its fate, who can afford to be indifferent to the fate of the film industry and the fate of the film art … We are no longer nations. We are or should be <span style="font-style:italic;">a</span> nation" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 135–136). If film sustains sociality through the creation of or reference to common memory, this utopian aim can only be ambivalently aided by H. D.'s sense that "classicism" is the name for this shared form of remembrance. The vocabulary of classicism may only be a name for what is most "universal" in cultural memory, but it highlights the naiveté of a desire to consolidate the world in the image of the West. What is powerful about her writing on film, however, is the eloquent imbalance between a language that prioritizes universality—and so turns everything and everyone into symbols—and a language that nevertheless emphasizes the allure of the film's broken details.</p>
<p>H. D.'s film criticism replays this drama of referentiality as the tragic intersection of image and commentary, of verbal and visual representation. The question of what gives the new medium value, what gives it specificity, is constantly displaced by an implicit recognition of the susceptibility of perception to the starker agencies of representation which animate image and text alike. For H. D., the world of film is traversed equally by the names of classical references (Aeschylus, the Eleusinian mysteries, etc.) and by the images which they mime and obscure. What needs to be stressed is that, precisely due to this ambiguity, H. D.'s speculations are grounded in an awareness of the permeability of our overlapping experience of these media in the moment of spectatorship. The act of viewing a film, she implies, involves not just our perception of it but an active process of mutual mediation. If there is a formalism to H. D.'s work, then, it refers not to the advocacy of the virtues of a specific medium, or the "in-itself" of aesthetic experience; rather, it follows from her insight that we cannot escape the loss of history foretold by our means of accessing it.</p>

<p>To look at a star by glances—to view it in a side-long way, by turning toward it the exterior portions of the retina (more susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the interior), is to behold the star distinctly—is to have the best appreciation of its lustre—a lustre which grows dim just in proportion as we turn our vision fully upon it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The language of depersonalized spectatorship with which H. D. analyzes <span style="font-style:italic;">By the Law</span> and other films helped to shape her contemporaneous fiction, which frames cinematic and literary practices in parallel ways. The narrator of <span style="font-style:italic;">HER</span> , for example, anachronistically refers to the "precinematographic conscience" of the young Her Gart, suggesting that the novel's backward-looking perspective into the as yet undeveloped mind of its protagonist is itself predicated on cinematic modes of consciousness.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> In her novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Palimpsest</span> , the palimpsest, as a model of ancient textual history, is repeatedly paired with the cinematic language of superimposition in ways that describe the ecstatic "interwashing" of modernity and the ancient past.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup></p>
<p>The most substantive form of incorporation, however, is not reflected so directly. As I have suggested, H. D. drew less on the rative meanings of film's material mechanisms than on the narrative detachment implied by cinematic spectatorship. In her fiction, H. D. treats characters and events of her own creation as if they were projections from a film, subject to the same fog of reconstruction and remembrance as the images described in her reviews. Her novella, "The Usual Star," (dated 1928, but published 1934) is illustrative in this respect. It concerns the love triangle of a poet and aspiring novelist, Raymonde Ransome, her lover, Daniel, and prospective suitor, Marc. H. D.'s narrator, however, is blithely unconcerned with developing the relationships of the central characters through the action of plot and dramatic scenes. Instead, the novella conjures a constellation of erotic potentialities, which then are viewed abstractly from a series of slightly adjusted comparative viewpoints.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup></p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>It seemed that they were one pin-point … one star-point, to let some sort of outer light into this cumbrous city consciousness. "We see beyond this, but we must be in it, to see it." They were nothing, being a flaw in the solid substance of it. "We are a sort of pin-prick." Daniel felt as she felt (pin-prick of Danielraymonde) saw as she saw.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The novella's reality is reconstituted, not by the characters themselves, but by the voice of the narrator, who hovers behind their statements. Indeed, the narrator of this passage is not a person, per se, but a point in space where images, characters, and phrases erratically intersect.</p>
<p>The organization and construction of this impersonal perspective—or at least the novella's desire for such a perspective—through the "pin-point" or "star-point" in the world's fabric, requires an impersonal way of seeing. Such a form of collative visuality becomes a model for the novella's detachable "subjectivity" which <span style="font-style:italic;">imitates</span>, but doesn't exemplify, traditional omniscience.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>I want to see all sort of things with all sorts of eyes set sideways. I want to see Lila with the eyes of Ermy, I want to see Daniel with the eyes of Marc de Brissaic.

<p class="continued">The multiplicity of perspectives that Woolf, for example, realizes in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, is here reduced to a perverse and impossible fantasy. The emphatically material tone of the passage seems meant to disturb precisely the narrative authority that would make such devices as "point-of-view" appear transparent. H. D.'s narrative concerns, among other things, the desire for omniscience, and, in formulating it as an object of desire rather than as a medium of knowledge, she conceives of omniscience as a kind of grossly exaggerated fetish. "That is what it is to be a novelist," the narrator reflects at one point, "isn't that what she [Raymonde] was always after? To see what it is to be. I want to be what Ermy is, see what Ermy sees, be and see with one focus, not this always measuring and weighing and seeing things distorted, themselves and the, so to speak, reflections of themselves, like ghost things seen in water" (<span style="font-style:italic;">US</span>, 53). And yet, novelistic perspective—that elusive synthesis of seeing and being "with one focus"—is precisely what eludes H. D.'s novella, which remains mired in the circuitous distortions described here, "reflections … ghost things seen in water."</p>
<p>In contrast to traditional novelistic omniscience, "The Usual Star" suggests that the perspectival morass of the novella (imagined as the borrowing of eyes) is indebted to cinematic sight, in which vision appears to have been disembodied and made fragmentary. Indeed, the language of film comes to substitute and stand in for the combinatory textuality so relentlessly pursued by H. D. The "palimpsest" style, which turns characters into perpetual conduits for anarchic associations, displays a mixing of mediums, as we might infer from the passage in which the narrator describes the bizarre likeness of her lover, Daniel, to the "Swedish film star" Freda Berling.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup></p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Incandescence of Nordic beauty that was the Swedish film star. Daniel was staring at her … Freda Berling, if Freda Berling had a mind, incandescence of mind, to cauterize the open swan-thing wounded, that her eyes were, would be a sort of Daniel … Freda Berling was a dead swan gilded with garish grease paint.</p>
<p>Snow shrugged snow shoulders, detached triangulated white on white … swan's wings. Freda Berling, was to Raymonde's apprehension, swan wings, beauty that had condescended, chosen the despised screen for its shadow medium. Freda Berling of last night's screen, stayed with her. "I am haunted by the Berling." Daniel was like the Berling. Daniel was like the Berling … if Freda Berling would cauterize, "fix" so to speak the rolling thing her odd inhuman eyes were, she would be a sort of Daniel. "Her eyes look out at nothing." "People criticize, say her eyes look too far inward. They are simply ice-bergs rolling." The eyes of remembered blatant screen wax beauty were projected there before them. The gods choose curious mediums. The gods chose Freda Berling, Daniel, herself and some others. Mediums. They were all sort of mediums. "We're all sort of mediums … the Berling is a doped swan. You're a sort of real one … without grease paint."</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">US</span>, 22–23)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The impersonality of the cinematic "star" provides a crucial comparison for the action of the narrative voice, in which the confusion of interior and exterior speech, dialogue and narration, becomes doubled by the cryptic re of cinematic eyes which appear to "look too far inward" but which in fact "look out at nothing." The eyes of the film star Freda, who is also a kind of Leda here, betray the visitation of some "beauty that had condescended, chosen the despised screen for its shadow medium." The mark  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of this godly visitation, "the open swan-thing wounded" which Raymonde wishes to "cauterize" and "fix," (and which is apparently shared by Daniel as well as the narrator) is that perception has already been, in a way, disembodied. These "odd inhuman" eyes do not lead back to the self, but spread around them a winter of impersonality ("detached triangulated white on white"). Later, the narrator wonders whether her affair with Marc has injured Daniel, asking "Did he feel that? Did his odd eyes in the dusk <span style="font-style:italic;">see</span> or simply <span style="font-style:italic;">was</span> he? Did he resort to some old old Greek trick?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">US</span>, 68). Not being able to tell, the narrator concludes that Daniel is distant, like a star or like a starlet. But if this distance results from being possessed by a "beauty that had condescended," Raymonde's response is not to assume the typical aesthetic stance of disinterestedness. Rather, her erotic attention becomes a textual mirror to his odd withdrawal of personality. Weaving through repetitions between dialogue and interior notations, H. D. emphasizes the materiality of literary representation in order to insist that romance is always a matter of mutual mediation. The story's central relationship—between Raymonde and Daniel—is never fully established, in part because H. D. does not depict characters so much as "mediums," mercurial res of likeness and analogy through which the narrative can offer textual constructions in lieu of erotic resolution.</p>
<p>Daniel (star, eyes, cinema) and Raymonde (poet, narrator) do not meet in any final scene of intimacy, rather the novella posits its own textual agency as a substitute. In "The Usual Star," the meeting of literature and cinema provides the formal conceit for staging this romance. "People and things make patterns on the mind," the narrator writes, "independent of the place, the time, the people, the things themselves. What good then is unity, is cohesion, is time and place, sequence, the brave beginning, the sustained middle, the bold climax and the inevitable end?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">US</span>, 79). "The Usual Star" can make this claim in part because the action of the narrative has been supplanted by a receptive gaze, a mode of discursive reflection that seems to mimic the spectatorial epistemology of H. D.'s writing on film. In this way, the novella's use of cinematic tropes suggests a crucial analogue to the processes by which the story makes claims about the ecstatic "identities" of romance. To desire another person, or to "like" them, we infer, is also to uncover the way in which intimacy is deferred along a chain of likenesses. "The Usual Star" supports this insight in part by exploring the ways in which literary and cinematic representation share modes of reference. But if H. D.'s fiction finds the two "mediums" in a carefully constructed balance, her writing on film often betrays the fact that in many ways such a relation could only ever be partial, and perhaps unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>In a way, the very transferability of H. D.'s notion of cinematic consciousness to literary texts points to its problematic constitution. Indeed, the most remarkable text in her film criticism comes at the moment when she articulates the limits of her identification with film; or more exactly when she indicates an incongruity of sorts between the technical elements of film style and what she consistently identifies as its spiritual potential. As we have seen, the value of the cinema very often consisted in a strange kind of disembodied expression that never quite coincides with film itself. In her critique of Dreyer's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Passion of Joan of Arc</span>, however, this tension or latent incompatibility takes on its most striking formulation; for though H. D. acknowledges the stylistic success of the film and the enormity of its achievement as a purely technical artifact, she cannot admit to enjoying it. Admiring the film while registering a distance from it, H. D. attempts to justify her poetics of spectatorship in a perverse way by articulating the reasons why the film fails to move her despite fitting every criteria which she can name. In this way, H. D. implicitly reasons, her failure to appreciate the film is a necessary consequence of understanding it—and she casts her emotional remove from the film's dramatic world as a fantastic extension of its very logic, so that in seeing the film, and in disliking it, the viewer assumes the role of Joan herself, subject to the impersonal designs of Dreyer's torturing force.</p>
<p>"<span style="font-style:italic;">The Passion and Death of a Saint</span> is a film that has caused me more unrest," H. D. begins her review, "more spiritual forebodings, more intellectual racking, more emotional torment than any I have yet seen" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Close-Up</span>, 130). Commenting on the film some months later, H. D. recalled that "I have written about <span style="font-style:italic;">Jeanne d'Arc</span> a little spitefully and a little unharmoniously. Jeanne d'Arc … set me out of key. It positively bullied me as no film has yet done. I was forced to pity, pity, pity. My affections and credulity were hammered. I was kicked. I was throttled. I was laid upon a torture rack. Quite solemnly I was burned at the stake and lifting eyes to heaven I had forgiven my malefactors. Yes, the magnificent technique of Dreyer did that for me. But was I moved?" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 143). The farther away H. D. claims to have been driven from Dreyer's film, the more completely her writing seems to have been drawn into it and permeated by its res. Again and again, she complains of a sense of "claustrophobia" created by the film, an objection precisely inverse to those she makes of other films. For whereas other films fail to create such a compelling sphere of identification, pity or compassion for their characters (which function only as so many moving parts in a great narrative machine), <span style="font-style:italic;">The Passion of Joan of Arc</span> establishes these responses so effectively and indeed so inescapably that one feels trapped within its perfection. "I am shut up in here," H. D. writes, "I want to get out. I want to get out" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 132).</p>
<p>H. D.'s critique of Dreyer's film, however, is mitigated by her sense that it is the total realization of film as an art.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> That is, what she perceives as the purity of the work, its typification of film itself (or as she puts it, the film's "sheer perfection of the medium,") contributes to her perception of its problems (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 143). "The Jeanne d'Arc of the incomparable artist Carl Dreyer is in a class by itself," she writes at the conclusion of her review, "And that is the trouble with it. It shouldn't be" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 133). This is a tricky claim, and perhaps insupportable. Nevertheless, a case can be made for seeing in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> H. D.'s reading of Dreyer's film not simply a general misrecognition of the film's aims,<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> but an inevitable and essential misrecognition of certain consequences of cinematic form. In the end, H. D.'s dislike of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Passion of Joan of Arc</span> may speak less to the film itself, or to any deficiencies which it might contain, than to the instability of H. D.'s reading of film more broadly. What fascinates her about film, at least, is not what defines it <span style="font-style:italic;">as film</span>, or what separates it from other arts. Instead, H. D.'s reviews suggest that film can be read alongside literature, so long as one approaches spectatorship symbolically.</p>
<p>Her aggressively tropological reading of film suggests that, for H. D., the very intensity with which <span style="font-style:italic;">The Passion of Joan of Arc</span> succeeds in creating a significant atmosphere works paradoxically against it. "For being let into the very heart, the very secret of the matter," she writes, "we are let out of … something" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 130). This "something," her review goes on to suggest, is the spiritual side of Joan's character, her visionary essence. Dreyer, on the other hand, depicts only Joan the sufferer, the martyr whose passive grace inspires sympathy, but in a way that leaves off any indication of the presumed divinity of the Joan as prophet. This exaggerated personality—the mystic persona of Joan which had been popularized in the romantic tradition and which H. D. seems to have adopted wholeheartedly—this is what Dreyer failed to convey, reducing both Joan and spectator alike to, in H. D.'s words, a "senseless animal" (<span style="font-style:italic;">CU</span>, 132).</p>

I pay him my greatest compliment. His is one among all films, to be judged differently, to be approached differently, to be viewed as a masterpiece, one of the absolute masterpieces of screencraft.

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Dreyer's "slur on human consciousness," it seems, derives in part from the tragic consequences of any film—that we are unable to act in it, along with it, and that we are reduced to a form of passivity ourselves—"standing aside and watching and watching <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> watching and being able to do nothing." If Dreyer's film depends on this passivity to heighten our sense of her vulnerability, and if he accentuates and attempts to glorify a corresponding helplessness in his portrayal of Joan—who after all was a military as well as visionary re—H. D. seems to suggest that this has something to do with the perfection of the film itself, which leaves nothing of substance to be added by the spectator. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>If the passivity of film viewing never caused H. D. any concern in the past, it is in part because, as we have seen, she openly advocated a method of creative spectatorship. Reading mythological analogues and symbolic likenesses into the texture of films like <span style="font-style:italic;">By the Law</span>, H. D. developed a reading of film that depended on the forms of visionary consciousness that the viewer could bring with them. This spectatorship completes the suggestiveness of film. In this way, H. D. positions Joan of Arc as an inevitable model of the visionary consciousness of film viewing. Just for this reason Dreyer's film would seem to provide an apt example for her film theory in general—or at least this would have been true, if not for the stubborn silence with which Dreyer treats Joan not as a dynamic visionary agent but rather as a re of piety and submission, innocence and suffering.</p>
<p>H. D. sees in Dreyer's film precisely an absence of the ecstatic modes that she desires of film in general, and it is telling that her only moments of allusive embellishment—so characteristic of her criticism in general—come when attempting to note what is missing from the film.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Whether or not Dreyer's film presents Joan's martyrdom without poetry, of course, is open to debate, though even this is not the main claim of H. D.'s criticism. Certainly she does not deny that such poetry exists in the film, although she calls it, a little roughly, "artistry," and tends to imply that that the film is technically proficient but emotionally lacking. This is not the case, however, and H. D.'s rhetoric may only signal the difficulty of identifying and articulating two separate orders of success or failure.</p>
<p>Certainly one could argue that H. D. simply fails to see the complexity with which Dreyer dismantles the very realism for which she critiques him, and that she fails to comprehend the significance of what he called the film's "realized mysticism."<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> The truth, however, is that H. D. understands very well the spirituality of the film, as well as its appeal to subjectivity. The real crux has less to do with the film itself, than with certain inconsistencies in H. D.'s film theory more generally—especially the form of subjectivity it prescribes for film, which always refers to the relational process of a decoding spectator, rather than to the finality of the self-contained drama of the film. In Dreyer's film the very fullness of the vision leaves no place for the viewer. Accordingly, Dreyer's film makes H. D. question the very grounds on which such a visionary consciousness might meet up with the logic of pictorial manifestation. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

The angels were there all the time and if Jeanne had reached the spiritual development that we must believe this chosen comrade of the warrior Michael must have reached, the half-hypnotized numb dreary physical state she was in, would have its inevitable psychic recompense. The Jeanne d'Arc of the incomparable Dreyer it seems to me was kicked toward the angels. There were not there, nor anywhere, hints of the angelic wing-tip, of the winged sandals and the two-edged sword … Such psychic manifestation I need hardly say, need in no way be indicated by any outside innovation of cross lights or of superimposed shadows. It is something in something, something beyond something. It is something one feels … For all our preparation, we are unprepared. This Jeanne d'Arc is sprung upon us and why should it be?

D. certainly doesn't call for Joan to become "psychologized" through what she calls an "outside sort of beatific screen craft of heavenly vision"—she does not, in other words, believe that the film's characterization would be improved by "seeing" what Joan saw.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> The soul cannot be reduced to any "outside innovation of cross lights or of superimposed shadows" but rather through the evocation, as she says, of "hints." What is called for, then, is a special form of non-depiction that can only be named as a "link … to human consciousness," something to bridge the "gap" left open by the impoverished reality of cinematic representation. This missing psychic "recompense" would not necessarily be something that is positively registered. Rather we might say that H. D. demands of the film a "sign" in much the same way as do Joan's interrogators. Her purpose, however, is not to guarantee the dogmatic truth of these visions with respect to the Church, but rather to serve as an indication, even if indirect, of the poetic aspect of her consciousness, to signal that it exists behind the material surface of Falconetti's "numb dreary physical state."</p>
<p>In this respect, however, H. D.'s complaint seems especially precarious—since Dreyer deliberately taunts the viewer with tight close-ups of Joan's face, substituting this exterior perception for an approximation of Joan's point-of-view. The viewer, in this way, is emphatically placed outside of her visionary consciousness, even while she is clearly in the throes of ecstasy. Although Dreyer intended Falconetti's face to act as a medium for her faith, a window into her soul, such a strategy clearly threatens to negate the primacy of the viewer, who is held at bay from this drama by the very technique that was to have mediated its proximity. We may long for Falconetti's interiority, or for Joan's, H. D. observes, but we are never satisfied of that desire, and instead of Joan's luminous grace, Dreyer has forced us to accept our own longing sent back to us is amplified form. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Of course, this formal difficulty may be said to arise from the film's structuring principle: namely that rather than provide a fanciful visualization or dramatization of the myth of "the maid," <span style="font-style:italic;">The Passion of Joan of Arc</span> was to take the trial proceedings themselves as the starting place for the film's events (although condensing the timeline from a month into a single day). The film's first shot, fittingly enough, is not of Joan's oracular face, but of the damaged binding of the trial proceedings themselves, as the hands of a narrator-re leafs briskly through the pages as if the existence of the text could prove that such things really happened.<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> There is a mysticism in Joan's face throughout the film, to be sure, but Dreyer makes clear that whatever we can know of her, or of her visions, comes to us through a parallel "miracle," that of the survival of the text of the trial.<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> "At the Bibliotheque de la Chambre des Deputes in Paris resides one of the most extraordinary documents in the history of the world," the film begins, "the record of the trial of Joan of Arc, the trial that ended in her death. The questions of the judges and Joan's responses were recorded with great exactitude. Reading it we discover Joan as she was—not in armor—but simple and human … a young woman who died for her country, and we are witness to an amazing drama: a young, pious woman confronted by a group of orthodox theologians and powerful judges." In this way, <span style="font-style:italic;">Jeanne d'Arc</span> exploits the documentary aspect of cinema in order to play upon our consciousness of the film's textual mediation.</p>

</div>
<p>The images are not meant to be fanciful extrapolations, recreations of the epic siege on Orleans or any of Joan's participation in the royal intrigue and affairs of state, such as Cecil B. DeMille's 1917 film contained. In exclusively focusing on what had been recorded of Joan's own speech (or at least its reconstruction by the court scribes), Dreyer suggests that the <span style="font-style:italic;">film</span> itself can testify more forcefully to the story's "simple, human" elements. Further, by making the film an elaboration of the trial, or an elaboration of a text (which is always true of a film's relation to its screenplay), the film asks us to consider the role of mediation as an integral part of the film's dramatic principles.</p>
<p>The relation of the film's main action to the text of the trial is significant, then, because it contextualizes H. D.'s sense that the viewer remains hopelessly outside of the visionary  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> heart of the protagonist. In fact, this distance from the content of Joan's subjectivity is shown to be endemic to the text of the trial itself, in which Joan notoriously refused to make an unqualified oath to tell the truth to the court about her visions, making it clear at the beginning of each day of examination that whatever she told would not be the entire truth. Concerning her revelations, especially, Joan refused to give any details, and those which do emerge are emphatically vague. As Karen Sullivan notes in her study of the interrogations, Joan's unwillingness to give any signs as to the veracity of her claims to divine knowledge all but guaranteed an unfavorable verdict:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The visionary who insists upon her subjective impressions of a spirit, impressions that are by definition inaccessible to others, cannot convince others of what she perceives as its identity, nor can she be convinced by a more expert third party, such as a theologian, that she is mistaken. She remains alone, unjudged and unjudgeable, in her inner perceptions.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">If the text of the trial promises a greater proximity to the reality of Joan's story, it almost ensures a corresponding distance from the "subjective impressions" that constitute the living text of her revelations and visionary consciousness, for this is the one area that she was most protective of, and which therefore the texts illuminate the least. For this reason, the close-ups in the film reflect on this tangled relation all the more acutely. The close-up models the film's reliance on its textual foundation because it arrogates itself as a technique of intimacy and direct address, while showing us with startling clarity the limits of such knowledge and the remoteness of Joan's consciousness. For despite all the time that her face spends at the center of the frame, or just for this reason, the close-up images reveal that her eyes are always looking somewhere else.</p>
<p>H. D.'s sense that the film failed to live up to the "truth" of Joan's visionary personality, then, reflects the insistent incongruity between the film as emotional spectacle and the film as object. This is in part due to the fact that H. D. sees herself as a visionary re, and assumes that a "true" representation of Joan's saga will not only conform to her own understanding of ecstatic consciousness, but will do so by unifying the expectations and emotions of the spectator with the film itself. That is, the form of Dreyer's film posits Joan's subjectivity as dependent on its destruction or its disarticulation. And while the film provides the sympathetic monk Massieu (famously played by Antonin Artaud) as reassurance that something of Joan's character is not entirely lost, H. D. maintains that such a sense of identification is made thoroughly unstable.</p>
<p>Joan, in H. D.'s review, becomes a re for interiority itself, for what cannot be shared without violation or loss, without rendering it unrecognizable. Implicit in her critique of the film is the assertion, odd coming from H. D., that language violates subjectivity less (or perhaps violates it better). This is why Joan's name, which H. D. renders affectionately "<span style="font-style:italic;">Jeanne</span>" (and only once "Johanna," as it exists in the only written document bearing her signature), plays such a heavily repetitive and symptomatic role. Such repetition indicates something of the desperation with which H. D., turning away from the implied absence of cinematic representation, asks language to bear, in the increasingly empty space of a name, the burden of identity. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>I think it is that we all have our Jeanne, each one of us in the secret great cavernous interior of the cathedral (if I may be fantastic) of the subconscious. Now another Jeanne strides in, an incomparable Jeanne, indubitably a more Jeanne-ish Jeanne than our Jeanne but it isn't our Jeanne. Worse than that it is a better, more authentic Jeanne than our Jeanne; scathing realism has gone one better than mere imaginative idealism. We know we are out-witted. This is a real, real, Jeanne (poor Jeanne) little mountain Newfoundland puppy, some staunch and true and incomparably loyal creature … This is Athene stripped of intellect, a Telisila robbed of poetry, it is a Jeanne d'Arc that not only pretends to be real, but that is real, a Jeanne that is going to rob us of our own Jeanne.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The very "authenticity" of Falconetti's mediumistic performance, H. D. argues, negates Jeanne's hidden subjectivity, her own recursive "Jeanneness." The film achieves this, perversely, by convincing the audience that nothing of such interiority remains undepicted. In so doing, the film also negates the subjective structure of cinematic spectatorship in general, replacing the anarchic trail of association and fantasy with the "claustrophobic" unfolding of the film's restricted universe ("This must be right … <span style="font-style:italic;">I</span> must be wrong.") In the face of such "perfection," language seems paralyzed, trapped inside the impotent gesturing of naming.</p>
<p>Joan is, paradigmatically, called "incomparable," in the same way that H. D. refers to the film as a piece of "incomparable art," and to Dreyer as an "incomparable artist." This damaging singularity denies both art and experience, insofar as H. D. understands them according to the ecstatic logic of likeness, metaphor, and comparison. Despite her enthusiasm for the felicitous interrelation between literature and film, H. D.'s layered disavowal of Dreyer's <span style="font-style:italic;">Jeanne d'Arc</span> (in spite of all of the ways in which it is structured by a reconstruction of textual modes) reveals her sense that in its "perfect" expression film <span style="font-style:italic;">needs</span> literary consciousness to restore the "poetry" and "intellect" missing from the bare image. In this respect, H. D.'s reading of <span style="font-style:italic;">Jeanne d'Arc</span> unexpectedly echoes Shklovsky's sense that film cannot be understood outside of a literary grammar. The fiction of "pure" cinematic form, nevertheless, plays a crucial role in H. D.'s theorization of film, as well as in her fictional practice, for it sustains her sense that art thrives on its impurity, and that the truly "incomparable" art denies itself because it denies what is not itself.</p>

Nonetheless, as I hope to show, his comments might also be read in the context of film's influence on the literary culture of the early twentieth century, a context, that is, in which "image" and "technique" increasingly could not be made so discrete.</p></div>

D. articulates her relation to film if we wish to understand its structural importance for her writings. Dianne Chisholm is right to point out that "H.D's is surely a mixed <span style="font-style:italic;">medium</span>, a Freudian-Fenollosan-Eisensteinian medium, and auto-bio-thenato-telepatho-cinemato-graph" (Dianne Chisholm, <span style="font-style:italic;">H.

Indeed, it is  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> indicative of his treatment of cinema that he feels the need to preface his discussion of it by turning first to a catalogue of existing arts, in this case music, painting, and literature. Implicitly then, "art" itself, or the "artfulness" of all art, must be reinterpreted if we are to understand how film operates as a form of expressive representation. This is the conclusion reached by Boris Eikhenbaum in his 1926 essay "Literature and Cinema," where he writes: "One thing is clear: we are going through an era in which literary material is being re-examined from the point of view of film. In the face of cinema, literature must realize its own methods in a new way. The development of film poses anew the ancient problem of the relationship and differentiation of the arts."

The tendency of the individual life is to be static rather than dynamic, and this tendency is made into a propulsion by civilization, where the obvious only is seen, and the unexpected rarely happens. When the unexpected does happen, however, and when it is of sufficiently grave import, the unfit perish.

Eisenstein, of course, also conceptualized film from the vantage point of language, and the "'Japanese ideogram"' in particular, but he took this point of origin in a vastly different direction, seeking to discover in language an archaic justification of the "depictability" of meaning.)

Brown's point that the discourse of sensation offers H. D. "a fantasy of experiencing ourselves without the mediation of technology … as originals rather than copies," is especially appropriate, but can be qualified . For it is precisely through the articulation of this immediacy in her criticism that H. D. constructs the saving power of language to counterbalance sensation; and it is in this construction of a language that the mediation of technology is most active.</p></div>

<div id="body">
<p>Although it is less widely read than her classic novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> , we might consider Djuna Barnes's 1958 play <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>—with its baroque language, its fraught relation to autobiography, and its bizarre and challenging anachronism—the most 'Barnesian' of the author's texts. Of all the works in Barnes's oeuvre, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> has suffered the most from the charges of difficulty and unreadability—and in this case unperformability—that have marked her critical reception. For certain feminist critics, such apparent "difficulties" have been recast in part as editorial issues: these critics read the play's obscurities as problems caused by cuts at the hands of Edwin Muir and, above all, T. S. Eliot. In what was, to date, the only published study of the play's revision history, Lynda Curry concludes by proposing that if three hundred-odd lines (removed from the final edition) could be reinserted, "the original <span style="font-style:italic;">Antiphon</span> would emerge as the beautifully coherent and poignant tragedy that its author had envisioned."<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> This fantasy is problematic not just because it relies on theoretically questionable and practically unsustainable notions of authorial intention and textual integrity, but also, in its conflation of coherence, affect, and aesthetic pleasure, misses the point of why <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> is such a remarkable play. As Barnes's last major work, and her fullest engagement with the complexities of a traumatic sexual experience we can reasonably imagine as broadly autobiographical, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>'s obscurities and opacities are powerfully connected to its theme. In what follows I want to consider how the changes made during the play's  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> revisions need not be viewed with regret, but in fact produce a shift in emphasis that captures the performative nature of remembering trauma. I also want to consider the limitations of a feminist discourse surrounding the sexual and textual corpus, according to which Eliot and Muir, like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>'s abusive father, are cast as powerful violators of a vulnerable and pure body.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> is a three-act tragedy in blank verse detailing the sinister reunion of the Hobbs family. While the play is not without moments of dark humour—occasioned in part for this reader by linguistic excesses as richly camp as "Curbing the waspish bodkins of her eyes / Spurring the fornication of the mint"—it is Barnes's most singularly bleak work.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> The family reunite in Burley Hall, the ruined ancestral home of the mother, Augusta, and a former college of chantry priests, situated in the fictional English town of Beewick.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> The family have been brought together by one son, Jeremy (disguised as "Jack Blow, coachman,") who acts part court-jester, part advocate, as he restages the childhood abuses suffered in an unorthodox, polygynous, and probably incestuous family home not unlike the one depicted in Barnes's 1928 novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Ryder</span> and in her own biographies.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> It emerges that Miranda, now middle-aged, has been abused by her father, Titus, and raped by "a travelling cockney thrice [her] age" at Titus's arrangement and with Augusta's acquiescence (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 186). Augusta has been repeatedly wounded by her late husband's dalliances, and is angry not only with Titus, but also with his deceased mother, Victoria, and, less reasonably, with Miranda too. The other Hobbs sons, Elisha and Dudley, are unsympathetic characters who function in the play as a critique of capitalist excess and philistinism: they have also been abused by Titus but harbor equal resentments towards both Augusta and Miranda. The collective witnessing of the past takes place in front of Jonathan, Augusta's uncle, a genteel and apparently kindly old man who still lives in Burley Hall.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>'s journey from first incarnation to published play was a long and difficult one. Barnes was returning to a form with which, alongside poetry, journalism, and short stories, she had begun her career in the teens. With the exception of two unpublished three-act plays, <span style="font-style:italic;">Ann Portuguise</span> (undated) and <span style="font-style:italic;">Biography of Julie von Bartmann</span> , her earlier experiments with drama had been one-act works written, as others have noted, in styles reminiscent of Synge and Wilde. We cannot be absolutely sure when Barnes began writing the play we now recognize as the published <span style="font-style:italic;">Antiphon</span>, but while she was certainly working on the project for nearly a decade, it may well have been closer to two. In 1948 Barnes made an unsuccessful application for a Guggenheim Fellowship in which she states her aim to "bring to the drama that dignity of concept and poetic utterance which in the present practice of realistic comedy and melodrama has been forgotten."<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> But Louis F. Kannenstine cites a letter to Charles Henri Ford of 4 August 1936, in which Barnes states that she had begun to write a verse drama, as evidence that she was beginning work on the play at the time of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>'s publication.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> It does seem that if Barnes started writing a play in the late 1930s, any real progress would be slow until around 1950 when she started to overcome (or at least better manage) some of her significant personal problems, which had included a breakdown (for which she was hospitalized), alcoholism, and severe financial hardship.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The earliest complete drafts of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> in Barnes's archives at the University of Maryland date from July 1954, and were followed by four further significant stages of redrafting before the play was accepted by the board at Faber &amp; Faber in November, 1956.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> was published in 1958, and Barnes made further (relatively minor) changes for the reprint in her <span style="font-style:italic;">Selected Works</span> .<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> Eliot assumed editorship in 1954, and Muir became involved in 1955. The archive also includes an undated typescript for each of the first two acts, both catalogued under the heading "Early Draft." These two undated acts, however, do not appear to match up: while Act 1 represents, I think, the oldest extant version of this act, Act 2 is a later, post-July, 1954 draft.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> Many—though not all—of the revisions occurring between 1954 and 1956 relate to simply reducing the length of the play, especially the overlong Act 2. I shall return to Eliot's role in this, and feminist interpretations of the editors' excisions relating to details of sexual abuse, but it is perhaps important to note that material unrelated (or at least less directly related) to the abuse narrative was also cut, some of it on the basis of editorial advice, some of it apparently at Barnes's own initiative. Jack Blow's speeches, particularly in Act 1, are much lengthier in earlier drafts of the play, where he resembles more closely the garrulous Matthew O'Connor, whose speeches in <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> were also cut after suggestions from Eliot.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Another change involves a character referred to variously as Elivira/Countess Castaigne/Prudence/the old <span style="font-style:italic;">Belle Laide</span> of Lange d'Oc. In the published play, Elvira, the "old <span style="font-style:italic;">Belle Laide</span> of d'Oc" is discussed briefly by Jack in Act 1 (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 110). Elvira is a Burley sister who "got herself to France" and whom, Jack tells us, Miranda met in Paris aged 91 (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 110). Like Miranda, she is a rather theatrical woman, inhabiting "a slashing zone of taffeta" with her head "gabled in a cone of voile" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 110).<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> The lines relating to Elvira, and those in particular to her braided hair, which are absent from the published text, exist in increasingly vestigial form throughout the drafts.</p>
<p>A more crucial change—and one that involves rewriting rather than mere excision of lines—relates to the characters of the "merchant" brothers, Dudley and Elisha. The brothers' language and behaviour powerfully captures the affective complexities of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>'s family scenario. When, for instance, Elisha steps up to Augusta and, "<span style="font-style:italic;">tapping her with his closed hand</span>," asks "Who killed Cock Robin?", the play's atmosphere of malice, blame, and reckoning is conveyed in an economic and impersonal manner (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 141, italics in original). In the undated "Early Draft" there are three, not two, brothers—Barnaby, Oliver, and Kit—but by July 1954 they are two: Barnaby and Elisha.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> The general trend in revision is that the brothers' dialogue is reduced in quantity and transparency: in these early versions of the play their dialogue is less stylized, less opaque, and more prosaic—indeed they speak in prose rather than verse throughout "Early Draft"—and they have fewer outstanding lines. In Act 1 of July 1954's "Finished Copy" there are eight pages containing dialogue between the brothers that was subsequently cut. In prose in parts, their speech is less aphoristic than it would later become, containing more factual information about their lives.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> By September 1955's "Copy 1" the dialogue between the brothers (now Elisha and Dudley) is predominantly written in the dense verse we find in the final version. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>This increased emphasis on a less realist, more theatrical and affectively ambivalent mode of dialogue, better characterized by the brother's chilling performances of nursery rhymes than bald statements about the their lives and intentions, is part of a larger trend that I want to consider further. The changes with which this essay is largely concerned relate to an increased emphasis on performance, theatricality, and—the change that dominates Curry's discussion—the excision of the "hayhook" scene in which certain explicit facts about the rape are given. I want to consider the productive relationship between these changes in relation to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>'s treatment of traumatic memory. I am interested in considering how the play's revisions might be read as generative rather than damaging, and how excision of several of the play's balder statements about the Hobbs family's history of sexual violence is matched by an increased emphasis on characteristics I relate to the trauma response: performativity and performance, stylized ritual, and affective complexity. While I do not wish to subscribe to a "Whig interpretation" of textual history, reading each draft as an improvement on the last, I want to question the benefits of the kind of reparative re-editing suggested by Curry, while challenging the fiction of an ideal and authorially pure textual body that was violated by Eliot's editorship.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup></p>
<p>One of the tasks for Barnes's readers, and for the reader of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>'s narrative of sexual trauma in particular, is to make sense of the author's complex understanding of the relationship between the personal and the fictional. Notions such as veiling and hiding are unhelpful when it comes to understanding the relationship between textual opacity and personal history because of the ways in which <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> makes the reader aware that testimony is an activity in which the past is not simply revealed, overtly or covertly, but created anew.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> invites us to problematize the idea of a transparent and unmediated narrative of sexual trauma with static and clearly defined subject positions of victim and perpetrator. Similarly, Barnes seems to reject the value of anything amounting to a confession. As such, the play forces us to question the usefulness of feminist approaches that privilege these very things as the hallmarks of a "successful" testimony to sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Barnes remained anxious about the politics of personal disclosure throughout her writing life. This anxiety increased when the disclosures related to sexual injury, as is evidenced by the claim that she terminated her early career as a journalist by refusing to report on the victims of rape.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> Barnes's concerns about such revelations, and the focus on the victim's sexuality they might provoke, are suggested by Miranda's refusal to confess her own (adult) sexual history or to confirm that she has led a life that is debased or in some way fitting for a sexual abuse survivor. A critique of the salacious interest in confession is expressed through Augusta's aggressive questioning of her daughter: '<span style="font-style:italic;">Is it true that you had forty lovers?</span>' (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 204, italics in original). Barnes suggests that confession might lead to the demand for further confession, and is anxious about the paths that this demand might take. In this context, the exchange between Miranda and Augusta half way through the final act is significant:</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The repetition of 'nothing' echoes <span style="font-style:italic;">King Lear</span>, suggesting the impossibility of understanding between parent and child, and thus implies that Miranda's speech might be pointless as a tool for change. Miranda's refusal to answer may be more empowering than "speaking out": her silence is "hard-won" and therefore valuable in the context of the demand for revelation about her sexuality. In this sense, Barnes seems to preempt Foucauldian anxieties about bringing sexuality into discourse, while tapping into a rich feminist pre-history about the force of self-elected female silence. Equally, announcing one's status as a victim is treated with some scepticism in the play. When Augusta protests "I was a victim" she is mocked by Elisha's "Oh not <span style="font-style:italic;">that</span> again," the implication being that she has clung too readily to this identity (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 159; 160, italics in original). For Augusta, the appropriation of victimhood appears to be inseparable from the fetishization of psychic wounds and a simultaneous inability to accept her own agency within the family. Yet while Barnes remains sceptical about the celebration of wounded identities, she does not settle on silence as the best option either: <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> demonstrates a serious engagement with precisely <span style="font-style:italic;">how</span> one might testify to traumatic experience. I want to suggest that, through a self-conscious representation of the performative nature of testimony and witnessing, Barnes gets beyond categories of victimhood and <span style="font-style:italic;">ressentiment</span>.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>The sexual abuse of Miranda—who is generally read as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>'s Djuna Barnes re—has been singled out as the play's most significant example of trauma and victimization. While this focus is entirely justified by the text, some critics have oversimplified Barnes's treatment of the dynamics of sexual trauma. Louise DeSalvo's reading relies heavily on Judith Herman's <span style="font-style:italic;">Father-Daughter Incest</span>, a foundational text in the feminist study of incest and child sex abuse. DeSalvo argues that the reader must "live through" Miranda's "terror, fear, and self-loathing moment by moment" and "learn her language, the language of the incest-victim, which simultaneously masks and reveals."<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> While pathologizing Miranda, DeSalvo reifies her victim status and takes up Herman's argument that incest is an initiation into prostitution, suggesting that child abuse is the beginning of an endless cycle of victimization. Herman argues that child abuse leads to a "life of repeated victimization" and serves as "an early and indelible lesson in woman's degraded condition."<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> Herman's account is based on the belief (key to many feminist analyses of incest) that it is not only the incest survivor but woman in general whose identity is fixed through patriarchy's various violences and oppressions.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> Although Herman does account for some variety in the experience of incestuous abuse, for her the result is predetermined: "The actual sexual encounter may be brutal or tender, painful or pleasurable; but it is always, inevitably, destructive to the child."<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> As Janice Haaken notes, the belief that objective abuse inevitably results in psychic shattering "is not so far from the idea that virginal women are 'ruined' by  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> early, culturally unauthorized sexual experiences as well as by sexual abuse."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> Although traumatized by her childhood abuse Miranda is in no sense "ruined"—she is depicted as a forceful and articulate woman who has built a successful life among the theatrical elite of Europe. The possible reference to Ibsen's reworked "fallen woman" play in the doll's house scene suggests that Miranda's sexual abuse, although traumatic, might not have automatically led to disempowerment and disfranchisement.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">A Doll's House</span>  depicts a middle-class married woman who, when her shameful history is revealed, not only avoids ruin but actively chooses a life of empowered independence outside the family. Nora's crimes ultimately serve as anti-patriarchal pedagogy rather than victimhood within patriarchy. Barnes's characterization of Miranda challenges the inevitable link between unsanctioned sexual activity (whether consensual or not) and a permanent state of sexualized victimhood.</p>
<p>And just as certain critics have written Miranda's agency out of the text, narratives of the play's editorial and redrafting process have tended to replicate this gendered dichotomy between victim and perpetrator(s), whereby a vulnerable Barnes in confessional mode is hampered by the prudish censoriousness and censorship of Eliot and Muir. Eliot's editorship in particular is described by some critics as akin to the sexual interference of Barnes's fictional fathers. In her otherwise sensitive analysis of Barnes's treatment of incest, Broe makes a direct comparison between Eliot and the re of the abusive father: "the cuts form a painful 'textual masquerade' of the daughter's painful violation … by the authority of his pen, Eliot reproduces the incestuous desires of the violating father by his intrusion in the daughter's script."<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> Broe's comparison is problematic precisely because it risks replicating the "Daddy Warbucks essentialism" that she so accurately identifies as a characteristic of incest discourse, the "fixed male hegemony over the powerless woman who lacks agency, maturity, or voice."<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> My study of the play's manuscripts and attendant correspondence suggests that this version of events is in fact an inaccurate representation of the relationship between Barnes and her editors.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> Furthermore, in their emphasis on the violation of penetrating the textual body, critics such as Broe and Curry bring a particular kind of sex-negative politics to editorial discourse, reiterating an understanding of sexuality and sexual abuse most clearly articulated in DeSalvo's feminist reading of the play—a sexual politics which <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> in fact opens up for critique.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> And, crucially, the desire for narrative clarity implied by the anxious emphasis on textual gaps ultimately obscures a nuanced understanding of the play's engagement with the complexities of traumatic testimony.</p>
<p>Curry emphasizes Barnes's powerlessness in the face of editorial control, blaming Eliot in particular for compromising Barnes's vision and thus ensuring the critical and popular failure of the play. As Daniela Caselli observes, "Curry's argument that Eliot's and Muir's excision greatly damage [sic] the play is not sustained by Barnes's own notes."<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> Caselli cites as evidence Barnes's annotation of "I didn't accept much. D.B." next to Muir's "But as for my excisions I don't know yet whether Miss Barnes will accept them or reject them" in a 1955 letter to Eliot.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> Further indication of Barnes's agency in the editorial process may be found in a 1956 letter to Eliot, where she reports a discussion  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> with Muir: "He had remarked that the first act needed cutting, in 'some of the best lines' because it was 'too busy in a static sort of way'—an observation that I thoroughly enjoyed."<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> Barnes claims to have left "some parts of the first act on the cutters [sic] floor, where I saw that perhaps he was right—in other cases I either removed lines, or rearranged, corrected, or rewrote."<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> Rather than allowing us to reconstruct Barnes as a bullied or manipulated victim, this archival material might also produce a more dynamic image of editorial relations, in which a gendered dichotomy of power is not central to our reading.</p>
<p>It is not, however, Muir's editorship that forms the center of Curry's focus; rather her attention rests on a specific letter from Eliot (dated 10 August 1956) which she claims instigated a final revision from which the play "never recovered."<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> While Muir's suggestions for major omissions (not mentioned by Curry) relate to the first act, Eliot finds the second act the most in need of cutting.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> Emphasising Eliot's "severe demands" on Barnes to "accept his editing and make further cuts of her own" Curry cites his call for "much more drastic cutting, twelve to fifteen pages. Don't cut anything at the end, but I feel sure that there are pages in the middle that can be disposed of."<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> Curry's essay focuses on excisions made in this middle section of Act 2, and she places particular emphasis on the importance of an omitted scene where, in his attempt to make Miranda "mutton at sixteen— / Initiated vestal to his 'cause'!" Titus</p>

<p class="continued">This scene occurs in the undated "Early Draft" and the September 1955 copies, but not in what I deduce to be Barnes's earliest extant versions of this act, which date from July 1954 ("First Copy" and "Finished Copy"). The scene takes the form of a reminiscence by Dudley, and occurs in the middle of Act 2 before the brothers attack the women. In "Early Draft" the speech is difficult to decipher: as many typed lines are crossed out in ink as are left untouched, and Barnes's hand-written annotations and rewrites cover the page. On might argue, therefore, that Barnes was unsure about the wording of the scene even at this stage. The lines are included in Dudley's speech in the September 1955 Copy 1 with two additional typed lines at the end which are just legible although Barnes has crossed them out several times in ink: "You know, I've seen heifers dangling from an halter / Just like that, while he charged the rape-blade in."<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> In Muir's Copy 2 from September 1955 there is no direction to drop this scene but in Eliot's copy from the same time there is indeed a light pencil "x" through the entire block of lines from Dudley that include the hay-hook reference.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> In the fourth September 1955 copy the scene still exists but the last four lines are heavily altered and annotated in Barnes's red and green ink.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> And in the February 1956 typescript, the scene is again heavily annotated.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> It seems that, regardless of Eliot's suggestions, Barnes was not entirely satisfied with how these lines were reading, although at this stage she was trying to improve them. Among a file of <span style="font-style:italic;">Antiphon</span> drafts marked "April-June  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> 1956 Miscellaneous pages" there is a page containing the "hay-hook lines" headed "(new page—July 31—56)" in Barnes's hand.<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> There is a line across the whole page and Barnes has written "decided out" next to the text. Barnes's excision need not be seen as forced but rather as a measured decision to delete a scene about which she was unsure from an act that was excessively long.</p>
<p>But rather than simply locating Barnes's agency in this excision, which admittedly still leaves us in the territory of intentionality, I want to challenge Curry's reading on other grounds. By clinging to the fantasy of an entirely pure, uncorrupted, and unequivocally elucidating original text, one risks privileging an image of the play as an unmediated confessional narrative. In this case, textual "integrity" amounts to an impossible confidence in the closeness of the text to the author's traumatized psyche; a closeness that recovering and reinserting excised material can restore. A similar imperative has also governed certain analyses of Barnes's earlier family narrative, <span style="font-style:italic;">Ryder</span> . Ann B. Dalton, for instance, imagines a lost textual history that might help us access <span style="font-style:italic;">Ryder</span>'s hidden incest narrative and align murky fiction with solid biographical fact.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup></p>
<p>As Brenda R. Silver has written, some feminist textual critics in the 1970s and 80s saw textual editing as "a means to break through the surface of established texts and established views and bring to light 'submerged' texts."<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> Interestingly, Louise DeSalvo's work on Virginia Woolf's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, in which she recovers the "submerged" text of the author's very first novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span>, is discussed by Silver (and other editorial theorists) as a key example of such work. For DeSalvo, the problem with <span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia/The Voyage Out</span> is not editorial intervention but <span style="font-style:italic;">self</span>-censorship: Woolf chose not to publish <span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span> because there were revealing autobiographical parallels in the work, and so produced a less personal, less intense, less emotional, "disguised" version in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Voyage Out</span>, viewed by DeSalvo as a form of "masquerade"<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> In her introduction to <span style="font-style:italic;">Melymbrosia</span>, DeSalvo describes her original speculation that pages of the early versions of the text might be scattered through the extant manuscripts, "although now dismantled, <span style="font-style:italic;">mutilated</span>, cut in pieces, cancelled or overwritten."<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> This notion of the text as a mutilated body—mutilated, in this case, by the author herself in response to (patriarchal) literary conventions—is not reiterated directly in DeSalvo's work on <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>, but res as a kind of spectre in feminist readings of the play's revisions, in which Curry's narrative that Eliot interrupted or damaged Barnes's narrative of sexual abuse is taken for granted and yoked together with an emphasis on the violence of sexuality. While Broe makes this link explicit with her comments about Eliot's "violating" pen, we might also note that DeSalvo takes the title of her essay about patriarchal abuses (which, for her, paradigmatically include sexual abuses) from the key excision identified by Curry: "'To Make Her Mutton at Sixteen': Rape, Incest, and Child Abuse in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>." Such connections serve to underscore Jane Gallop's argument that</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Notions of integrity and closure in a text are like that of virginity in a body. They assume that if one does not respect the boundaries between inside and outside, one is "breaking and entering," violating a property. As long as fantasies of integrity and closure are upheld, a desire to penetrate becomes a desire to rape.<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The impulse to treat <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> as a damaged text that must be restored, is, I suggest, not very far removed from the impulse to see Miranda/Barnes as a sexually ruined woman who might be healed if only she could tell her story in an uninterrupted, unmediated fashion. Regardless of whose decision it was to cut the lines, we might, I suggest, dwell on the consequences that this shift in emphasis produces as opposed to restoring the scene and "repairing" the text.</p>
<p>Besides raising questions about the politics of authorial intention and textual integrity, the assumption that the published <span style="font-style:italic;">Antiphon</span>'s narrative is incomplete invites us to consider our understanding of what testimony should look like. Curry's particular focus on the hay-hook scene and attendant lines relates to her wish to clarify the narrative of sexual abuse she sees (quite accurately) as central to the play. But behind such an intention seems to lie the assumption that the most unambiguous incest/sex abuse narrative is the most "true." By reinserting the lines she claims that Barnes was "forced" to cut, Curry offers a clarified plot—which equates to a clearer incest narrative—imparting "complete and coherent sense" to apparent discontinuities and ambiguities.<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> Curry argues that because certain speeches have been cut from the final draft "the problems that the family has inherited seem less specifically overpowering" and so the children "appear obsessed with trivia, struggling with shadows, arguing with a dead man."<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> Such an interpretation of textual history would seem, again, to be connected to a particular moment in feminist debates about sexuality, specifically sexual abuse. The intense controversy surrounding memories of child abuse "recovered" during psychoanalysis or other therapeutic scenarios has meant that the terms of the debate became fixed in the dichotomies of belief and non-belief, truth and falsity. Haaken suggests how "layers of gendered and ambiguous meanings" in women's recollections of childhood abuse are incompatible with an approach that "overlooks the truths contained in even false accounts about the past. Framing the controversy in terms of true and false memory is sorely inadequate because it misses the range of meanings and partial truths that lie between these polarized, absolute categories."<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> During the feminist focus on incest in the 1980s, Haaken argues, "the ambivalences and complexities of eroticized power relations were anxiously re-pressed within much of the storytelling that took place in the sexual abuse survivor moment."<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> The urge to get to the factual heart of Barnes's incest story is, troublingly, also a desire to smooth out its powerful ambivalences and explain and contextualize the explosive affect of her dramatic work.</p>
<p>Perhaps underlying such desires for clarity is an understandable wariness about invoking misogynistic stereotypes of female hysteria. Linda Alcoff and Laura Gray note that in sexual abuse survivor discourse "too much" emotion can be seen as "a conscious manipulation, evidence of lack of control, or as simply inappropriately personal."<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup> Yet Alcoff and Gray also argue for the importance of questioning "a position that assumes that it always a good thing for survivors to 'control' our emotions in regard to our experiences of sexual violence," and ask the important question of who benefits the most from such control.<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> Similarly, Haaken finds "something amiss" in the contempt for "emotional excess and irrationality" in clinical discourse and notes that "at the base of hysteria is a battle for recognition, one that women must wage in a way that does not  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> alienate their audiences."<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup> Curry indeed links the play's apparent confusions, discontinuities and excesses—caused, she claims, by Eliot—to the alienation of its audience. Although the play's early reception was not generally favourable, and it has not been widely performed, some of the more positive responses suggest that an audience's ambiguity about the plot is no barrier to their affective engagement.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> Ivar Harrie, in the audience of the play's performance in translation in Stockholm, remarks that</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Yes, the audience really caught on—gradually. After the first act the people were very awed—and a little afraid of showing how lost they felt. The second act has a bewildering—but unescapably [sic] exciting effect. The third act … broke down all resistance: there was no alternative but to surrender to the dramatic poem.<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Harrie's reaction is cited frequently perhaps because it conveys a common experience in those who value Barnes's play: his comments suggest that one is not affected by <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> because one fully comprehends the narrative, but rather that feeling might, in some unexpected way, stem from bewilderment.</p>
<p>Just as the play's history of composition and redrafting should not be understood exclusively through the category of loss or absence, neither should obscurity or opacity be confused or equated with absence in the case of Barnes's representation of trauma. In his essay on Barnes, Walter Kalaidjian focus on excisions and gaps as signs and symptoms of trauma in themselves:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Antiphon</span> [sic], the latent trauma of incest leaves its trace variously in the linguistic distortions and gaps that punctuate the verbal character in the play; in the extensive editorial cuttings that both Barnes and Eliot made to the explicit presentations of the event; in the pattern of censorship marking the history of its stage productions; and in its general silencing in the reception of Barnes's oeuvre.<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Unlike the feminist readings I discuss above, Kalaidjian's reading appreciates that meaning does not depend exclusively on narrative clarity, but in stressing the role of "gaps," "cuttings," "censorship," and "silencing" he represents trauma as functioning only as a negative shade in the play. Despite its status as a category that undermines representational certainty, trauma functions not merely as absence in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>, but makes itself felt in multiform ways in both the corporeal and textual body. The excision of the hay-hook scene does not only or exclusively create a gap (indeed, it functions as such only if one knows of its original existence), but rather it changes the nature of the play's treatment of trauma. It is in some of the apparently "obscure" passages of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> that the affective force of traumatic memory is impressed on the reader, through the complexity and ambivalence of Barnes's writing, rather than words not written. We might consider, for example, this affecting speech by Miranda:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>The salt spilled, the bread broke. Unmuzzled bone<br>Drew down the hood of flesh, entombing laughter:<br>Tongues came forth, and forth the hissing milk<br>Its lashing noose, and snared the gaping mouth. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <br>A door slammed on Eden, and the Second Gate,<br>And I walked down your leg.</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 194–195)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The sinister domesticity of images such as the spilled salt and broken bread impart a certain <span style="font-style:italic;">unheimlich</span> feeling to the reader, and the image of bodily horror that follows suggests the Kleinian notion of the trauma of birth. Yet these bodily images also suggest a threatening sexuality—the "unmuzzled bone" and "hood of flesh" imply a grotesque representation of both the act of conception and the act of birth. The experiences of Miranda before and during her birth, and later as a sexually abused child apparently robbed of "innocence" ("a door slammed on Eden") are mapped onto each other to illustrate the confused, overdetermined, traumatic memory, where image precedes narrative clarity.</p>
<p>Barnes's scepticism about disclosure, her fears about victimization, and the sense one has from reading her work that the most clear or realistic narrative is not always the most expressive, have something in common with recent queer approaches to the questions of incest, sexual abuse, and trauma. Ann Cvetkovich has emphasized the value of obscurity and digression, arguing that the work of Ann Randall and Dorothy Allison, while showing a commitment to "truth telling," actually "demonstrates how imaginative work that may bear an oblique relation to the actual event of sexual abuse can ultimately be more healing than an explicit rendering of the event."<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> While <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> names rape and abuse, its focus is on the complexities of telling and witnessing as much as on these acts themselves. And crucially, like the texts chosen by Cvetkovich, Barnes's play "point[s] to healing as a process that engages the body and consists in rituals of performance that defy simple notions of disclosure."<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> The "queer healing practice" identified by Cvetkovich provides an alternative to certain feminist approaches to trauma, and emphasizes the performative structures I find central to Barnes's work.<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup> As I will now elaborate, the published play offers an alternative to disclosure and "narratives of innocent victims" in its representation of the performative nature of testimony, the role of witnessing, and the possible therapeutic value of repetition and ritualized violence.<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup></p>
<p>Curry finds it regrettable that, due to the excisions, "the audience has to get most of its information from Jack's crystal speech in the dollhouse scene of act 2."<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup> However, this shift in emphasis moves us from the realm of the revelatory—from the constative narrative of "what happened" found in the hayhook scene—to the realm of the suggestively performative. The re-enactment of the trauma within this play-within-a-play is a compelling feature of Barnes's text and one that benefits from such centrality. After Augusta has played with dolls representing her dead husband and his mistresses, she, and the rest of the cast, are forced to witness anew the events of the past, which are linguistically re-staged as the characters look into the doll's house. Horrific images of the "ting shadow of the Devil and the Daughter," and Miranda "Dragging rapeblood behind her, like the snail" are witnessed as performances within the house as opposed to being narrated as completed actions (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 185). In his "crystal speech" Jack gives a more factual account of events, where the narrative has been put into the past  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> tense, and we are told that Augusta submitted to having the sixteen-year-old Miranda "Tipped" to the "travelling Cockney," Bridgid-Matilda's brother, who was procured by Titus (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 186). However, even in this more blunt narrative of the traumatic event, Jack notes the performative dimension of traumatic memory when he says (to Augusta): "The eye baby now you're pregnant with / You'll carry in your iris to the grave" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 185). The notion of an "eye baby" suggests quite succinctly (and horrifyingly) how the traumatic image is brought into the world by its testimony and witnessing. The doll's house scene and Jack's lines within it allow Barnes to explore the notion that trauma is not merely exposed but rather created through its telling. And significantly, just as this scene gains prominence through revision, the theatrical emphasis becomes increasingly evident elsewhere in the play throughout the redrafting process.</p>
<p>Historically, critics have been largely sceptical about the role of the theatricality I find so important to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>, emphasizing instead, and oppositionally, its poetic qualities.<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup> Yet the distinction between language and action, poetry and drama, is perhaps not a helpful one in the case of Barnes's play, where language itself takes on a theatrical or, as Caselli writes, a "spectacular" quality.<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup> The significance of the work's dramatic form is emphasized, however, in a 1991 essay by Meryl Altman. Stressing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>'s self-referentiality and the role of the gallery as a vantage point for spectators within the play, Altman suggests that this significance resides chiefly in the suitability of drama for Barnes's "final anatomy of the deceptions and manipulations women and men practice upon those closest to them."<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65">65</a></sup> While Altman is correct in acknowledging the importance of performance to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>, her emphasis on deception promotes an arguably puritanical understanding of drama. Although the tropes of masking and concealed identities are used (by Elisha, Dudley, and Jack), I understand these devices rather differently. Barnes emphasizes the staginess of Jeremy's role as Jack, and the pig and ass masks worn by Elisha and Dudley do not so much disguise them as form part of a ritualized re-enactment of a traumatic event. Indeed, Altman's defence against the charges of Barnes's anti-theatricalism relies on an anti-theatrical concept of drama: Martin Puchner notes that "anti-theatrical prejudice" comes back to a limited number of obsessions: "the immorality of public display, of arousing the audience, and, most importantly, of those who professionally practice the art of deception."<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66">66</a></sup> I want to suggest that Barnes's theatricality relates not to the manipulation of any of these apparently negative associations, but rather to her recognition of performance as an appropriate means of testifying to and witnessing hurt. In this respect, Barnes's choice of form is powerfully connected to her traumatic theme. An emphasis on deception is problematic partly because it reinscribes the play into the dynamics of hiddenness and exposure associated with the kind of confessional narratives that Barnes attempts to avoid, while relying on a notion of objective reality that the trauma structure brings into question. And like the trauma structure, where origins are created through performance, Barnes's emphasis on acting as reality forecloses the celebration of originality.</p>
<p>As I have suggested with the example of the doll's house scene, performing and restaging events allows for a focus on the process of remembering rather than the revealed, already remembered event. In her urgency to problematize the truth claims associated  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> with "looking back" at sexual abuse, Haaken stresses the usefulness of privileging "the verb over the noun—<span style="font-style:italic;">remembering</span> as opposed to <span style="font-style:italic;">memory</span>."<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67">67</a></sup> Art historian Jill Bennett makes the distinction between narrative and traumatic memory, connecting the performative nature of remembering trauma with a non-narrative communication of affect. Bennett claims that traumatic memory offers a realm of secondary imagery in which affective experience is "not simply referenced but activated or staged in some way."<sup><a name="f68-text" href="#f68">68</a></sup> The idea of memory being "staged or activated" reflects the psychoanalytical understanding of the trauma narrative as testimony to an absence, "to an event that has not yet come into existence."<sup><a name="f69-text" href="#f69">69</a></sup> Before this process, writes Dori Laub,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The trauma—as a known event and not simply as an overwhelming shock—has not been truly witnessed yet, not been taken cognizance of. The emergence of the narrative which is being listened to—and heard—is, therefore, the process and the place wherein the cognizance, the "knowing" of the event is given birth to. The listener, therefore, is a party to the creation of knowledge <span style="font-style:italic;">de novo</span>. The testimony to the trauma thus includes its hearer, who is, so to speak, the blank screen on which the event comes to be inscribed for the first time.<sup><a name="f70-text" href="#f70">70</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">While indicating the performative dimension of testifying to a traumatic event, Laub stresses the importance of the witness; the listener. By structuring her work as a play with an implied audience and by including a significant play-within-a-play, Barnes emphasizes the role of reception or witnessing.</p>
<p>While several direct statements about the family background and abuse were ultimately excised, the revision process saw the inclusion of further details capturing the performative nature of traumatic testimony and witnessing.<sup><a name="f71-text" href="#f71">71</a></sup> In its published form, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>'s theatrical qualities are apparent from the opening stage direction, which points to its metafictional setting. With its gallery, balustrade, and arched doorway, the old hall's architecture forms a kind of stage set, complete with theatrical and circus accoutrements, which, as Jonathan Burley later reveals, belong to Miranda. Miranda is an actress and "wardrobe mistress" and her brother Jeremy is disguised as a clownish re who refers to himself as "Jack" and claims to have first met Miranda in Paris (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 210). Both Jack and Miranda wear theatrical costume: in a line only added in the September 1955 revision, Jack says "In the shutting down of Paris, we took off / In whatsoever part we had been playing" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 131). In the undated "Early Draft" the opening scene and stage direction contains fewer references to the theater.<sup><a name="f72-text" href="#f72">72</a></sup> There is "a lay-re in uncertain military, bandboxes, musical instruments and stands" and although there are references to "Carnival gear" there is no mention of stage costumes or Miranda's theatrical career. By July 1954 there is a greater theatrical emphasis in the opening stage direction and description of Miranda and Jack. The stage direction includes a reference to the "parts of stage costumes" strewn over the balcony rail, and for the first time Barnes mentions her carnivalesque, mythical stage-upon-a-stage: "the divided halves of what was once a merry-go-round griffon."<sup><a name="f73-text" href="#f73">73</a></sup> Miranda's dress is now described as "a costume suitable for the last act of a tragedy" and Jack enters the stage theatrically holding his hat above his head "as though expecting audience in the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> gallery."<sup><a name="f74-text" href="#f74">74</a></sup> By September 1955 Miranda's costume is described in even more explicitly as "obviously of the theater," the line that will remain in the play.<sup><a name="f75-text" href="#f75">75</a></sup> While Barnes's principal "testifiers" are performers from the play's first incarnation—in "Early Draft" Act 1 Jack is already jester-like, "ducking and bowing"—this tendency is exaggerated through revision.</p>
<p>Equally, the role of the audience becomes more significant during the redrafting process. In a letter of September 1955, Barnes explains to Eliot her decision to include a group of travellers specifically to provide an audience (or group of witnesses) for Augusta.<sup><a name="f76-text" href="#f76">76</a></sup> Barnes also adds meta-fictional references to an audience during her revision of the lines at the beginning of Act 1 when Jack wonders where their uncle Jonathan is, and worries that he alone will see and hear Miranda's testimony. There is no mention of the testimony as a "scene" with its absent "actor" and "audience" until September 1955, although by July 1954 Barnes has modified the speech to include the line "My hands will have to be your clamour, lady."<sup><a name="f77-text" href="#f77">77</a></sup> In his copy of the September 1955 version, Muir recommends the cutting of these lines, but while Barnes acquiesced with a number of his suggestions—reducing Jack's speeches in the first act and excising references to Elvira—she kept this significant line about the importance of an audience.<sup><a name="f78-text" href="#f78">78</a></sup></p>
<p>While the doll's house scene exists in all drafts of the play, it assumes greater prominence through excision of the hay hook scene and other references to abuse. The prop itself is mentioned earlier in later versions: in the "First" and "Finished" first acts of July 1954 Jack tells Burleigh (sic) that his luggage is "a kind of ark" to which Burleigh replies "Noah's?" but by September 1955 (Copy 1) Jack suggests to Burley:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>This luggage that you mention<br>Could it be, good sir, or could it not?<br>A beast-box, say, a doll's house, or an ark?</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Jack himself behaves in the manner of a malcontent in an early modern revenge play, enraptured by the theatrical nature of his own plotting: "Do I unplot my head by plucking hairs? / Or throw my lines away between my teeth" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 93). These meta-fictional references increase through Barnes's revisions, and the references to "unplot my head" and "throw my lines away between my teeth" were not added to the first act until the "First Copy" of September 1955.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>, theatricality in both a literal sense and as a broader concept is crucial when testifying to affective experience. When Jack discusses details about Miranda's life in Paris he also speaks of the theater: performance and biography, acting and self, are kept in close proximity. If Miranda has already turned the hall into a kind of stage (she has left her theatrical props, "bonnets, flags and boxes") when she first talks plainly about the house and her mother, Jack turns the testimony into a kind of double act, playing the role of clown or jester, rolling the hat up and down his arm (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 95). Jack's advice to Miranda about speaking is also a kind of stage direction:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>Whip up your splendours and your consternations,<br>Stand to the trumpets and the terrors,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <br>Give tongue for tongue,<br>For all the tapestries have thrown their spears!</p></div>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 112)</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Rather than a vulnerable turning-inwards, then, it is suggested that testimony about the past might look more like a rather camp piece of theater, where stylish performance precedes values such as sincerity, honesty, and solemnity. The image of tapestries that have thrown their spears suggests a theatrical tableau of stylized and collective action, where agency is not located at the level of the individual, but rather as part of the work of art itself. Importantly, Miranda and Jack's double-act implies that testimony does not have to be a solitary experience but can be a collaborative public performance.</p>
<p>Equally, performance is crucial to Barnes's discussion of abuse partly because it allows for empathic identification between characters as they act out each other's roles. This kind of identification between victim and perpetrator provides a challenge to the kind of models of victimhood endorsed by critics like DeSalvo. Central to this strategy is Miranda's occupation as both an actress <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> a "wardrobe mistress, tiring many parts": she both performs and enables others to perform (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 210). Miranda and her mother have exchanged clothes and rings, and by reminding her mother of this intergeneration cross-dressing Miranda brings Augusta "<span style="font-style:italic;">back to pleasant thoughts</span>"—she wants to "pretend we're girls again; let's play" (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 210, italics in original). As James Scott notes, in the third act Barnes seems to rely on a double meaning of the word "play."<sup><a name="f79-text" href="#f79">79</a></sup> In the course of the act, Augusta's enthusiasm about an imagined lost youth and "innocence" occurs while she acts out the role of her daughter. Both kinds of play seem to be intimately related and Augusta's imagined nostalgia for her own lost youth is also in part an imagined nostalgia for the time before her daughter was raped and abused. The idea of <span style="font-style:italic;">imagined</span> nostalgia is important, as the idea of acting removes the emphasis from any real originary event, thus emphasising the particularity of the affective scenario occurring in the present tense of the play. When Augusta swaps shoes with Miranda and says "Love puts forth her foot; let's to the opera," she hopes to play the part of Miranda <span style="font-style:italic;">as a performer</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 198). The identificatory process is reciprocal: Miranda imagines the idyll and the subsequent destruction of Augusta's childhood. The emphasis on "playing" has the function of allowing for the imagination of certain affective scenarios without the assumption of specific identities. Through a process of empathic identification the two women explore their feelings about their individual and collective trauma. This comfortable and productive overlapping of self and other means that Miranda and Augusta do not assume the polarized identities of victim and perpetrator.</p>
<p>A similar identification between victims and perpetrators occurs in the doll's house scene, in which context we might ask again how well certain feminist analyses of sexual abuse capture the complexities of Barnes's trauma narrative. I want to conclude this essay by considering further the affectively complex and politically challenging reenactments of sexual trauma by Miranda and Augusta. In particular I want to consider how, unlike the excised hayhook scene, the doll's house lines offer a potentially troubling scenario of phallic identification on the part of a female "victim." In this scene,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Augusta's play allows her to possess the phallus of her dead husband, and so engage in a ritualized repetition of his harmful sexual activity.</p>
<p>In much psychoanalytic discussion of trauma, repetition is treated as a symptom of disturbance that must, through the creation of a narrative, be prevented. This conventional understanding of repetition and trauma governs DeSalvo's reading of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>, which maintains a hygienic distinction between normal/abnormal and healthy/unhealthy behaviours. DeSalvo sees Miranda's re-enactment of past trauma as a undesirable but inevitable symptom of her identity as a victim of sex abuse: "Like every victim of incest, Miranda has internalized a sense of worthlessness, a compulsion to repeat the degrading experiences that gave her both the only attention she has had as a child and the only power she had known."<sup><a name="f80-text" href="#f80">80</a></sup> But in her longer work, <span style="font-style:italic;">Conceived with Malice</span>, DeSalvo emphasizes the therapeutic value of an apparently different kind of repetition, the writing and revising process for Barnes: "Working and reworking the story of her life gave her a certain mastery over her trauma … This was a necessary stage for her healing."<sup><a name="f81-text" href="#f81">81</a></sup> For DeSalvo, certain kinds of repetition—the re-enactment of sexually violent and traumatic events and bad feelings associated with them—can only be the sign of a pathology, yet the therapeutic value of confession, where Barnes may situate herself as someone who has had things "done to her," is taken for granted. The distinction here may be related to the temporal difference highlighted by Daub: only when Barnes re-externalizes and historicizes what has happened through creating a narrative can healing begin. By re-enacting violence, however, she is trapped within the endless cycle of unwilled repetition. DeSalvo thus makes the distinction, identified by Cvetkovich, "between 'working through,' the successful resolution of trauma, and 'acting out,' the repetition of trauma that does not lead to transformation."<sup><a name="f82-text" href="#f82">82</a></sup> Cvetkovich critiques this distinction by pointing not only to its apparent tautology ("good responses to trauma are cases of working through; bad ones are instances of acting out") but also by emphasising that performativity or "modes of acting out" are a crucial resource for responding to trauma.<sup><a name="f83-text" href="#f83">83</a></sup></p>
<p>Even Richard Espley, who, inviting us to dwell on the play's obscurities, implicitly critiques the "working through" model suggested in the work of DeSalvo and Ann Marie Wagstaff, relies on this distinction between good and bad repetitions.<sup><a name="f84-text" href="#f84">84</a></sup> Espley argues that in such feminist biographical studies the "literary artefact becomes 'scriptotherapy,' and its very annunciation of trauma renders it a healing triumph."<sup><a name="f85-text" href="#f85">85</a></sup> Espley accurately identifies the utopian connection between speaking out and healing, yet he ultimately dismisses the play's therapeutic value by focusing on the kind of repetitions that might be classed as "acting out" rather than "working through," such as Elisha and Dudley's violence, and Augusta and Miranda's deaths. The distinction between the two seems largely to be one of negativity versus positivity: the "hopelessly bleak plot rather questions attempts to celebrate the play as a brave rejoinder to patriarchal abuse and repression."<sup><a name="f86-text" href="#f86">86</a></sup> The play's redemptive qualities are thus discounted because Espley cannot imagine any healing practices that incorporate negative affect. Like DeSalvo's work, Espley's essay ultimately treats the ritualized repetition of violence as an essentially bad, if inevitable, response to trauma. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Cvetkovich, conversely, considers the possibility of a "queer healing practice [that] would turn negative affect or trauma on its head, but by embracing rather than refusing it."<sup><a name="f87-text" href="#f87">87</a></sup> Cvetkovich discusses a controversial performance by the rock group Tribe 8 that included the lead singer, Lynn Breedlove, cutting off a strapped-on dildo with a large knife while performing a song about sexual abuse survivorhood. For Cvetkovich, this performance is significant because it "blurs the distinction between pro-sex practices, sexual violence, and incest survivorhood in order to reveal that their intimate connections may be productive rather than a cause for alarm."<sup><a name="f88-text" href="#f88">88</a></sup> Cvetkovich challenges the view that "acting out" trauma is necessarily harming (or a sign of harm) and suggests the "ambivalent power of repeated, and especially ritualized, violence to heal and/or perpetuate an original trauma" and claims that the "violence" of the performance can be understood as a "ritualized repetition that transforms earlier scenes of violence."<sup><a name="f89-text" href="#f89">89</a></sup></p>
<p>Barnes's use of the doll's house scene to re-enact the trauma of abuse is important not just because it captures the performative dimension of traumatic memory, but because it also involves a potentially therapeutic repetition of violence, especially for Augusta, who, placed in front of the house by Elisha, sits cross-legged and childishly plays with it. Seeing Titus shrunk and "tamed," nothing but "a chip, a doll, a toy, a pawn," is a source of painful pleasure for Augusta as she plays with a "<span style="font-style:italic;">stick hung with dolls</span>" of Titus's mistresses (<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 145, italics in original). This re-enactment is even more significant for Augusta because the stick in question seems to be the one with which Titus terrorized his family:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Was this the stick that leapt me, gentlemen?<br>Where now the stallion yard lay beating on the turf<br>Its whistling vent? So proud of it he was<br>He asked to be but laid beside it in the grave.<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">SW</span>, 182)</div></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The phallic implications of Titus's fetishized stick are clear: it is an animal's pizzle, which was historically used as a whipping instrument.<sup><a name="f90-text" href="#f90">90</a></sup> The stick that Augusta wields is therefore a symbol of the patriarch's sexual (and non-sexual) violence. In the act of possessing this stick (and feeling empowered) Augusta is re-enacting the scene of violence from the perspective of the family's abuser. As a violent ritual involving identification with a perpetrator, Augusta's actions might be compared to Tribe 8's dildo-cutting. Both rituals, while locating power in the phallus, appropriate it in such a way that the association between phallus and penis is ultimately challenged. Most importantly, the acts fuse aspects of sadism and masochism in a way that defies simple notions of victimhood: "The violence of castration," Cvetkovich notes, is directed as much at Breedlove herself "as it is externally, refusing any simple division between the subject and object of violence."<sup><a name="f91-text" href="#f91">91</a></sup> As puppet-master, Augusta acts as Titus, appropriating his power, while participating in—and sharing—his humiliation. Her actions therefore point towards the ambivalent but possibly therapeutic value of ritualized repetitions.</p>
<p>My reading of the phallic identifications of the doll's house scene contributes to an understanding of the play as a work that pre-empts the queering of the somewhat  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> polarized view of sexuality and sexual abuse evidenced in certain feminist analyses of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>. And, as I have suggested, Curry's narrative of the play's editorial and revision history reiterates this gendered polarity in power and agency, while casting the existing textual corpus as interrupted, mutilated, and penetrated. Such a fantasy of original textual purity and integrity shores up the kind of sexual politics and understanding of the female body (displayed in work by Broe, DeSalvo, and Wagstaff) that Barnes's play indeed challenges. Barnes's text does not, as it were, denounce the dildo, and neither does it imagine all penetration as rape, and all rape as structurally identical and affectively unambivalent.</p>
<p>In a very real sense, the text of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> was subject to ongoing revision for decades: the author herself simply could not leave the play alone, even after publication. Barnes's scribbled "corrections" may be observed in both her personal copy of the 1958 first edition, and, perhaps more surprisingly, in her copy of 1962 edition, a text that she had already had the opportunity to change.<sup><a name="f92-text" href="#f92">92</a></sup> We might therefore consider the "work" of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span> as comprising living, changing documents: there is no single, stable, authoritative text.<sup><a name="f93-text" href="#f93">93</a></sup> I have stressed <span style="font-style:italic;">one</span> reading of the play's textual history in order to emphasize the value of theatricality and performance in its communication of traumatic experience but, more broadly speaking, the case of Barnes's <span style="font-style:italic;">Antiphon</span> perhaps points to the interpretative acts that produce histories of redrafting, revision, and editorship: just as the play offers multiple readings, so do the narratives about its construction, and about where its textual boundaries might be located. I have not wanted to suggest that any project to reinsert certain excisions—or at least make them available to the reader—is without value, but rather to examine some of the possible political imperatives behind the wish to "restore" <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>. Whether as readers, as editors, or as readers of editorial histories, we would do well to recognize our own agency (and the role of our own politics) in making <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>. By this logic one might consider T. S. Eliot in the same light as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>'s (fictional) contemporary feminist editor: both contribute to the notion of Barnes's play a fully socialized and unstable public text.</p>

The specific nature of the violation has been confused or forgotten but it seems that Barnes blamed her father either directly or indirectly: in one statement she apparently claims that he raped her, but elsewhere she claims he consented to her rape by a neighbour. Sexual abuse has also been identified in a series of letters written by Barnes's paternal grandmother, Zadel. Zadel's letters to the adolescent Djuna include pictures of breasts and mammary-related nicknames such as "Cuddlers" and "Pink Tops"—see, for example, Zadel Gustafson to Djuna Barnes, 11 April 1905 (Djuna Barnes Papers, Special Collections, University of Maryland, Series I, Box 6, Folder 20); 11 June 1908 and 29 September 1908 (Series I, Box 6, Folder 21).

On the basis of the names and numbers of sons (and the complexity of their characters), the wording of specific lines, and references to the griffin that appears onstage, I would date Act 2 to some time between July 1954 and September 1955. This implies that there may have been another stage of redrafting in 1954/1955, with acts one and three having been lost. However, the changes between this 'undated' Act 2 and the 1955 versions are quite small, and this may not represent a full redrafting of the whole play.</p></div>

S. Eliot: Authority, Resistance, and Acquiescence," <span style="font-style:italic;">Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature</span> 12.2 : 289–313. Cheryl J. Plumb has produced a "restored" version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span>, reinserting the parts she claims that Eliot encouraged Barnes to excise (<span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood: The Original Version and Related Drafts</span> [Normal, IL: Dalkey Archive Press, 1995]). As is the case with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>, access to these earlier drafts is illuminating, and an invaluable resource for the Barnes scholar. Although we might pose similar questions (to the ones I ask here in relation to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>) about the faith in authorial intentions and indeed the demonization of Eliot that her project involves, one crucial difference is that Plumb's work does not connect (implicitly or explicitly) the discourses of sexual and textual violation. Indeed, I would argue that a much more convincing case can be made for the significance of Eliot's censorship of <span style="font-style:italic;">Nightwood</span> than <span style="font-style:italic;">The Antiphon</span>.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f29" href="#f29-text">29. </a>By "sex-negative" I am of course referring to a particular strand of second-wave feminism, reflected here in the work of DeSalvo (in particular), but most famously represented in the antipornography stances of Catherine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, and the foundational analyses of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> rape by Susan Brownmiller.

<div class="abstract">
<span style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span><p>This article aims to undo the double abstraction at work in current enquiries into modernism's material culture: of form and function from raw material, and of meaning from form and function. It argues for the emergence in modernist literature of a "techno-primitivism" attuned to the tensions between the raw and the cooked, between plantation and chemical laboratory, made manifest by the production and marketing of rubber (a semi-synthetic plastic) during the first three decades of the twentieth century. The focus is on Lawrence's understanding of Connie Chatterley as an exemplary modern woman in the final version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span>.</p>

</div>
<div id="body">
<p>There is now a rich tradition of sophisticated, far-reaching enquiry into Modernism's material culture.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> Within that tradition, the object of study has always been the mechanism of a double abstraction: first, of form and function from raw material; secondly, of meaning from form and function. The terms in which the enquiry has hitherto been conducted—product, commodity, good, possession, fetish, gift—continue to illuminate the poetics and politics of matter's self-transcendence in Modernist literature and culture. To a large extent, the enquiry has remained faithful to its ultimate origin in the political and economic theories of Karl Marx, for whom wood held little philosophical interest until it took shape as a table, and began to get ideas about its status as a commodity.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> As yet, there is no sign in Modernist studies of the turn recently taken in the study of Marx's contemporaries. Historians of Victorian literature and culture, while traditionally attentive to matter's self-transcendence,<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> now also work back in the opposite direction, from the variously shaped and variously meaningful commodity to the raw material out of which it was made.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> Modernist wood, by contrast, is still strictly for tables, it would seem, and what the mind does with them.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> Brief reflection on Miriam Henderson's encounter with the "strange strong subdued emanation" coming from the grand piano in the family drawing-room, in Dorothy Richardson's <span style="font-style:italic;">Honeycomb</span> , a "mingling of the smell of aromatic wood with the hard raw bitter tang of metal and the muffled woolly pungency of new felting," would suggest that this won't really do.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Where Modernism was concerned, wood, metal, and felting were the least of it. From the 1880s, Western societies and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> cultures have been shaped not so much by the enduring usefulness of stone, wood, iron, and glass as by the proliferation, as a result of extraordinarily rapid technological advance, of semi-synthetic and synthetic materials. The strange, strong, subdued emanations of plastic soon became the thing to worry about, or take delight in. Jeffrey Meikle has described in exemplary fashion how plastic, more or less pervasive from the late-1930s in public and private experience alike, acquired for post-war generations the status of "emblem of modernity."<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> The discourse of a "plastic age"—an era of unprecedented opportunity or of unprecedented deprivation, according to taste—began almost as soon as there were plastics to celebrate and deplore, and is still going strong today. Drawing on Meikle, scholars have begun to examine the cultural connotations of materials such as cellophane, widely available from the late-1920s onwards.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> The difficulty, for cultural theory and history, is to grasp plastic's relation to modernity without reproducing a discourse which res its ubiquity merely as an index to the modern: to unprecedented opportunities or deprivations. For it is not altogether true to say that a material such as cellophane became a "sign of the new."<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> In the first place, while a particular plastic might be conred so as to signify in a particular context—an avant-garde opera, say, or a Cole Porter song, or a quip by Mae West—it did not do so in and of itself. Plastics were and are often present, both in life and in representation, without noticeably signifying. Presence, at a particular rhetorical or narrative conjuncture, can matter a great deal and yet not symbolize. In the second place, the plastics which amounted to something in Modernist literature were on the whole <span style="font-style:italic;">semi</span>-synthetic; that is, compounds of the organic and the inorganic, joint creations of agriculture and chemistry. The Modernist "age" was the age not of plastics in general, but of specific natural plastics such as shellac, the raw material out of which phonograph records were made; and of specific semi-synthesized plastics such as cellulose nitrate, a combination of nitric acid, camphor, and cellulose derived from sources such as cotton. Cellulose nitrate became the stuff of a wide range of essential commodities, including dental plates, billiard balls, dolls, combs, collars and cuffs, and, of course, photographic film.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> As the name implies, cellophane, or waterproofed viscose sheet, is a derivative of cellulose. Even when they did signify, semi-synthesized substances did not always signify the absolutely new. In developing these objections to "plastic age" discourse, my argument will qualify the current tendency to conceive the effect of chemical enhancement on literature, cinema, and the visual arts as an immediate short-circuiting of natural process met by an equally immediate turn to the abstract, or short-circuiting of representation itself.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> It will draw where appropriate on the social anthropology of material substances.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>I have chosen to concentrate on rubber because it was among all plastics—that is, all materials which between their first and final compositions pass through a stage in which they can be molded—the substance most widely understood as being at once ancient and modern, exotic and mundane. Rubber began as a natural plastic, but proved of little use industrially until, in the late 1830s, someone (in fact, two people separately) worked out how to combine it with sulfur at a high temperature: a process known as vulcanization. Thereafter, it gradually became ubiquitous. Electrification  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and the motor car, the two most spectacular consequences of the second industrial (or techno-scientific) revolution, and between them the stimulus to momentous social and cultural change, both ran on rubber. And yet this substance which variously coated, supported, and interlined the miracles of modern engineering, in a way no mere natural substance could have done, was itself, or had once been, a product of nature. During the nineteenth century, chemistry transformed the natural substance, endowing it with suppleness and strength, but not out of all recognition. By the 1920s, furthermore, in Britain at least, the "nature" in question had become quite explicitly an ideological effect of empire, since by then the bulk of the world's supply of natural rubber came from the British East Indies (consisting primarily of modern-day Malaysia). Rubber, we might say, reinscribed the ancient in the modern, the colonial plantation in the metropolitan drawing room (and indeed bedroom). Its hybridity—the combination it encodes of the raw and the chemically cooked—made it the focus of a compelling techno-primitivism.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, rubber has only ever been of interest to scholars of literary Modernism, and of James Joyce in particular, when abstracted into the form and function of a contraceptive device.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> According to Thomas Jackson Rice, the explicit reference to rubber goods in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> constitutes an ingenious meta-commentary on Modernist style as prophylaxis or sheathing against the "disease" of mass culture. Modernism's notorious difficulty "results from what we might call the <span style="font-style:italic;">condomization</span> of the text."<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> I want here to read in the opposite direction: not, by analogy, from the form and function of a specific commodity to the form and function of the text in which it has been represented; but rather, adhering to the text's self-proclaimed techno-primitivism, from form and function back into substance—into a strategic failure to signify. Conrad's Professor, "grasping lightly" the "india-rubber ball" which will detonate his bomb, has grasped and been grasped as the power of insignificance, of absolute reduction: of the ancient <span style="font-style:italic;">within</span> the modern.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> "Jingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay." The sight of Blazes Boylan's "jaunting car," en route for the Ormond Hotel, and ultimately for 7 Eccles Street, has cut Bloom down yet further, at an already low moment in the "Sirens" episode.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> Assonance ("supple rubbers") cradled by alliteration ("Jingling … jaunted …") thickens style itself, reducing rhetorical form and function (what the carriage looks like, what its mode of progress at this particular time on this particular day might mean) to something close to sound.</p>
<p>In this essay, I will attempt to define the nature and scope of Modernist techno-primitivism by means of a case study of D. H. Lawrence's <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span> , a text which, though scarcely central to current understandings of literary Modernism, remains the focus for productive enquiry into the cultural politics of sexual expression.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> And there seems to be complete agreement among critics with regard to its primitivism. The novel has been said to derive its force from the contrast it draws, often and furiously, between "contemporary industrial reality" and a "lost sexual wholeness."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> It has been said to advocate in an "explicitly evangelistic manner" a return to "a preindustrial, a precivilized, indeed a primeval, world" (the ancient woods in which Connie and Mellors achieve consummation representing "that lost territory of a wild,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> authentic existence where the life of the body is still possible").<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> Lawrence, we are told, thought and wrote at all times within the "classic paradigm of modernist primitivism."<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> His was a primitivism of the most conventional kind, forever rooting out alternatives to techno-industrial modernity, in ancient England or a contemporary elsewhere. That's not the whole story, I think, or indeed the most interesting part of it.</p>
<p>It might well seem perverse to write about <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span> without attending to the ways in which it represents either contemporary industrial reality or lost sexual wholeness, since these representations are what the novel is now mostly read for; and doubly perverse to do so by magnifying the significance of a descriptive detail which at first glimpse has little to do with either—Connie Chatterley's choice of footwear on slipping out of Wragby Hall in order to spend the night with Mellors in his cottage for the first time.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> My hope is that the second perversity will cancel out the first, by demonstrating that the detail at issue constitutes, if understood in historical context and in relation to other comparable details, a vivid description of how a person might live, not uncomfortably, and not by sexual mystique alone, within and against techno-industrial modernity. So hyperbolic, in fact, is the primitivism which mediates this narrative of sexual-romantic fulfillment—a new-old identity, please, to go with the new-old behavior—that it almost <span style="font-style:italic;">requires</span> its own further mediation. That further mediation is my topic. But I need first to define the historical context within which Connie's choice of footwear might begin to seem like a strategy: that of the colonial production and metropolitan marketing, in the 1920s, of a particular kind of rubber.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">A Brief History of Rubber</h1>
<p>The industrial exploitation of natural rubber, a substance familiar to the indigenous peoples of the Amazon basin for centuries, dates from the second half of the eighteenth century. The name given in English to latex extracted from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hevea brasiliensis</span> tree derives from its original function in Western culture: rubbing.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> Small blocks of a substance thereafter known as rubber turned out to be a distinct improvement on breadcrumbs when it came to erasing pencil marks.</p>
<p>For pencil marks were the least of it. In 1785, Francois Blanchard crossed the English Channel in a balloon varnished with a mixture of rubber and turpentine. By the 1820s, further ingenious uses had been found, from belts for driving heavy machinery, through buckets, cylinders, pipes, and a wide range of mattresses and cushions, to gaiter straps and elastic bands. However, rubber in its natural state still posed major—indeed, insuperable—problems from the point of view of manufacture. It became sticky when hot, and brittle when cold. Modern rubber was the product of chemical science. In 1838, the American inventor Charles Goodyear managed to stabilize raw latex by mixing it with sulfur and white lead. A Londoner, Thomas Hancock, who may or may not have got hold indirectly of one of Goodyear's samples, obtained a British patent for the process of "vulcanization" in 1843. Goodyear's US patent, which dates from the following year, brought him little benefit; he died in poverty. Vulcanization, Hancock was later to note triumphantly, brought about an "extraordinary change" in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> raw latex, rendering it at once durable and elastic. He and Goodyear had between them devised a method by which sheets of pure rubber "could be immersed in a sulfur bath, and changed to any required degree, from the softest and most elastic up to a state of hardness similar to horn, and capable of being wrought with carpenters' tools, or turned like ivory and ebony on a lathe."<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> The "changed" substance, which became known in its hardest and most durable form as Vulcanite, was used in the manufacture of dental plates, matchboxes, penholders, and jewelry. "Vulcanite may be regarded as the first truly semi-synthetic plastic, since it is made from a natural material, rubber, which has been chemically altered, its composition and properties being changed by the addition of sulfur under controlled conditions."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Vulcanite could be thought of as rubber <span style="font-style:italic;">over</span>-stabilized: a substitute for or imitation of wood, stone, and metal, remarkable only in so far as it gave rise to the form and function imposed during the process of manufacture. Rubber at its most supple, by contrast, did what no traditional substance could do.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Gutta-percha, a relative of rubber drawn from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Palaquium</span> tree native to Malaysia, turned out to possess excellent insulating properties. Wire insulated with gutta-percha was laid across the Hudson River at Fort Lee in August 1849 for the Morse Telegraph Company. Other submarine cables soon followed, including that laid across the Atlantic by the <span style="font-style:italic;">SS Great Eastern</span> in 1866. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Society and Solitude</span> , Emerson defined modernity as the breeding of invention upon invention. "No sooner is the electric telegraph devised, than gutta-percha, the very material it requires, is found."<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> Rubber made modern connectivity possible. During the same period, the gradual introduction of electric lighting, inside and outside the home, and electric traction, in factories and underground railways, further increased the demand for the material sharply; though no more sharply than the fitting of tires, solid at first, but from 1888 pneumatic, to horse-drawn carriages, bicycles, and, from around 1900, the automobile. Rubber had become ubiquitous in daily life. In John Lethaby's short story "A Rubberless World," first published in 1910, a particularly sulfurous London fog dissolves the very element or condition of modern urban life. Bootheels subside, papers once held together by elastic bands tumble apart, a doormat dissolves into a "film of smoke-coloured fluff." Worse is to follow. "But now, in a flash, we saw that motor lorry and brougham, bus and bicycle, had been stripped clean of their rubber tyres, and jolted, banged, shook, and rocked from side to side of the muddy road."<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>By 1910, a further momentous transformation was underway in the production and marketing of rubber, this time geopolitical rather than scientific. During the nineteenth century, Brazil and the countries that share the Amazon basin were the only major exporters of natural rubber, for the most part through Para, the port of the Amazon delta. Brazilian or Para rubber was wild rubber, the trees tapped where they stood in the jungle between early June and late January, by methods which did progressive damage to their ability to yield latex. This was an era of low production, high wage costs, and elevated prices.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> By the end of the century, tropical Africa provided an alternative source. The supply of wild rubber from these sources was just about sufficient to meet the worldwide demand created by electrification and the craze for cycling.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Congo rubber became a focus for fierce debates about imperialism.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> In Chapter 23 of E. M. Forster's <span style="font-style:italic;">Howards End</span> , Margaret Schlegel, by no means an enthusiast for empire, visits Henry Wilcox at the offices of the Imperial and West African Rubber Company. "She was glad to go there, for Henry had implied his business rather than described it, and the formlessness and vagueness that one associates with Africa itself had hitherto brooded over the main sources of his wealth."<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> Lethaby's stories are all set in Africa or South America. All that was about to change.</p>
<p>In 1876, at the request of the India Office, Henry Wickham, an Englishman living in Brazil, obtained 70,000 <span style="font-style:italic;">Hevea brasiliensis</span> seeds and sent them back to Britain. 2,700 plants were germinated from these seeds at Kew Gardens, and sent on to Ceylon (Sri Lanka) and Singapore, where they were to form the basis of a systematic attempt to establish rubber plantations. Twenty years or so of discontinuous experiment ensued. At the turn of the century, however, the rapid expansion of the automobile industry in the United States and elsewhere created a massive global demand for rubber which simply could not be met from Africa and South America.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> Investment in rubber plantations in Ceylon and Malaya, and in the Dutch East Indies, began in earnest. Initial high returns ensured a steady flow of capital.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> In 1907, a Rubber Growers Association (RGA) was founded in London to protect and develop the interests of British firms operating in South-East Asia. By October, sixty companies and thirty-four individuals had become members; an Executive Committee was formed, together with committees for each of the various countries in which plantations had been set up. During the Association's early years, discussion centered for the most part on proposals concerning the management and supervision of Malay estates: labor supply, hospital provision, drainage works.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> By 1914, the supply of cultivated rubber from the British and Dutch East Indies had outstripped the supply of wild rubber from Africa and South America. In that year, Malaya exported 47,600 tons and Ceylon 15,800, while 12,900 tons came from the Dutch East Indies and elsewhere; a total of 75,700 tons. The total amount of wild rubber produced in Africa and South America was 48,586 tons. By 1922, the total output of cultivated rubber had risen to 373,700 tons (214,000 tons of it Malayan), while the total output of wild rubber had dropped to 26,874 tons.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> The era of high production, low wage costs, and falling prices had set in. If empire informed metropolitan culture in Britain during the 1910s and 1920s, it did so to a large extent by means of the trade in plantation rubber.</p>
<p>It was the steady and apparently irreversible fall in the price of rubber after 1910 which made this ultramodern substance the focus of a techno-primitivism as formative in commercial practice as it was in literature. By 1921, the bottom had fallen out of the market, and the British colonial authorities persuaded Malayan rubber producers to take part in a scheme to restrict production. An export quota was set for each plantation. In the event, the so-called Stevenson Committee restriction enjoyed some initial success, but competition from the Dutch East Indies and elsewhere soon drove prices down again. The scheme came to an end in 1928.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> The underlying problem—an over-investment in capacity, coupled with a reduction in demand brought about by technological advances in the automobile industry—required a different solution.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> New uses had to be found for rubber. In 1921, the RGA created a Publicity Department, under the control of the Propaganda Committee, whose function was to develop "press propaganda advocating the use of rubber for all conceivable purposes," as well as closer links with manufacturers.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> By May 1923, the propaganda fund set up at the same time had received contributions totaling £40,000.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> The Propaganda Committee's deliberations with regard to publicity, as recorded in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Minute Books</span>, provide crucial insight into the selling of the <span style="font-style:italic;">idea</span> of rubber to an ignorant or skeptical public.</p>
<p>The most significant initiative undertaken by the Publicity Department during the 1920s concerned the exploitation, primarily for the leisure market, of the "crudeness" of crude rubber. After collection, the coagulum from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hevea brasiliensis</span> was prepared for export either as crêpe or as ribbed smoked sheet. Unlike sheet, crêpe underwent a "tearing or disintegrating action" in the mills which produced its characteristic corrugations. In the early 1920s, it represented about twenty-five percent of output from the British East Indies, the relatively high costs of manufacture and transportation restricting the uses to which it might profitably be put.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> Crêpe rubber did not require vulcanization before use. The material out of which a commodity was to be made could be prepared on the plantation itself, by "native" artisanal labor, rather than in a factory in Europe or the United States, by chemical process. Maximum profits were thus ensured for the grower, whose interests the RGA had been brought into being to protect. At a council meeting on 3 October 1921, there was extensive discussion of the recent arrival on the market of a new item which seemed likely to open up "a large field for consumption of rubber": crêpe soles for shoes and boots. Naturalness, or the degree of the chemical alteration of a crude substance during the process of manufacture, was definitely on the agenda. Although it had always been necessary to "compound rubber with mineral matters for practically every purpose," a "minimum percentage" of raw material could none the less be established.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> The great thing about crêpe was that the proportion of raw material to added mineral matters in any commodity made from it was very high indeed. The RGA saw the chance to develop a new and distinctive field for rubber products. It sounds like the ultimate Modernist challenge. How to devise and market a luxury item whose very luxuriousness connected it back to a natural origin or source?</p>
<p>The solution was the sports shoe. On 7 November 1921, the Propaganda Committee reported that shoes with crêpe soles had been sent to tennis professionals for testing.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> In December, the Pure Plantation Rubber Products Co. Ltd. began trading at 40 Fenchurch Street, in central London; 100,000 circulars were sent out.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> By the following July, demand had exceeded supply. Striking while the iron was hot, the Propaganda Committee prepared folders for distribution to golf, tennis, bowls, and cricket clubs, in order to "produce a demand which will compel manufacturers to manufacture shoes with crêpe rubber soles in the next few months for next summer's stock."<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> In May 1923, a decision was made to concentrate RGA resources on "publicity for crude rubber products," and especially crêpe rubber soles.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> The Propaganda Committee must have been very pleased to receive confirmation of the material's "high standard of hygienic merit" in a report from the Incorporated Institute of Hygiene which came  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> up for discussion on 1 October 1923. It was, the report noted, "very durable," and of a "firm and <span style="font-style:italic;">gristly</span> texture." "It is finally milled at the plantations and undergoes no further manufacturing process so that it is cheap and also retains the natural resiliency and flexibility of pure, natural rubber."<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> Of course, you could have <span style="font-style:italic;">too much</span> naturalness. Concerns raised by the local Propaganda Committee in Kuala Lumpur about the advisability of promoting unvulcanized rubber, "especially in the tropics where rubber quickly becomes tacky," came up at a council meeting on 4 June 1923.<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> But tacky in Kuala Lumpur might well mean resilient and flexible in Brighton or Scarborough.</p>
<p>Sports shoes and boots could be characterized as the medium for a rekindling of hitherto dormant energies and aptitudes. Crêpe rubber had proved to be the "ideal sole" because, according to an advertisement placed in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> in June 1924, it "responds to every foot movement, braces up the muscles, and at the same time affords a perfect grip." "The cushion of 'live' rubber lessens fatigue and makes walking a pleasure, adding hours to endurance and a spring to every step." The "special process" of plantation finishing meant that nothing had been done, chemically or otherwise, to "impair the natural live quality and nerve of the virgin product." The implication was that the "live" or "virgin" quality of crêpe rubber—its "nerve"—would refresh and reinvigorate the wearer of shoes fashioned from it; while at the same time ensuring that he or she could henceforth get a "perfect grip," with the aid of its "peculiar gristly texture," on the earth's surface.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> In August 1923, George Cummings, Professional Walking Champion of the World, set out to walk from London to York in crêpe-soled shoes. He was to be paid £100 by the GPA, with a further £150 if he beat the equestrian record for the distance set by Mr Tyrwhitt-Drake on a horse called The Sheik. On the way, Cummings had periodically to commend his footwear for its "durability, resilience, absence of road-shock, etc."<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> A Pathé Gazette newsreel film shows him on his way out of Trafalgar Square, and then bustling along a country road past some apprehensive cattle, accompanied by a publicity-car and an entourage of cyclists, a man on horseback, and a dog. In September, Harrods mounted a special display featuring his footwear, and his staunch testimonials to its durability and resilience: 600 pairs of the same brand were sold within a week.<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> Crêpe rubber had by now become very strongly associated with golf and tennis shoes in particular. The June 1924 <span style="font-style:italic;">Times</span> advertisement claimed that leading players in both sports had worn crêpe-soled shoes "exclusively" for the past two years. Images of the material's distinctive gristly texture began to proliferate. From April 1923 onwards, the Fortmason Golf Shoe, previously seen in advertisements in sober profile only, turned up its corrugations for all to see.<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> In April 1924, the Chairman of the Straits Rubber Company told its fourth annual general meeting that the crêpe rubber sole was the most important of the new uses which had been found for the material: "it is firmly established for sports footwear in this country, and from all accounts it appears likely to become quite as popular in the United States of America." Its extension to ordinary footwear was "only a matter of time."<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup></p>
<p>It didn't quite work out that way, at least not in Britain in the 1920s. Periodic attempts were made to broaden the material's appeal. In May 1925, a letter headed "Natural Crêpe Rubber (Plantation Finished) for Everybody's Everyday Wear" was  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> sent to footwear manufacturers soliciting their cooperation.<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> In October 1925, the Propaganda Committee agreed to co-fund a Morton Bros. campaign to "popularise crêpe soled footwear among the working classes" through advertising in magazines such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Police Chronicle</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Railway Review</span>.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup> Trials involving naval cadets and postmen apparently came to nothing.<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> The larger reluctance could perhaps be blamed on national character: "There is considerable prejudice against the use of rubber footwear in this country which requires to be got rid of before the public generally will buy overshoes." A proposal that steps should at once be taken to explain the "medical advantages of rubber footwear from the point of view of the British climate" does not seem to have received funding.<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup> When it came to "stunts," the Propaganda Committee's elixir, there was simply no substitute for a (preferably genteel) sporting hero. In July 1924, the committee had high hopes that the Wimbledon Championships would be won that year by "wearers of crêpe rubber soles," since (disobliging Americans apart) practically every player of repute had endorsed the "natural product."<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> In January 1925, it heard to its gratification that Mr John de Vere Hazard's crêpe-soled boots had performed admirably during a successful ascent of Everest, except for a certain "slippiness" on wet, smooth surfaces; while Captain John B. L. Noel, in charge of the filming party, was known to share his sentiments. Alas, the timing of Hazard's success proved unfortunate. His testimonials had no sooner been formulated than the winter sports season came to an end, and the newspapers promptly lost interest in the topic of adhesiveness.<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup> Still, stunts there had been, of a kind. The committee was able to report that the International Shoe and Leather Fair held at the Royal Agricultural Hall in October 1924 had featured a large portrait of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales wearing golf shoes with crêpe rubber soles.<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup></p>
<p>Vulcanized rubber was a modern semi-synthetic substance. By putting the emphasis on an un-vulcanized version, "virgin" product of colonial abundance, the RGA cleverly sold reinvigoration to the (literally) well-heeled metropolitan middle- and upper-classes: a bit of wildness on golf course and tennis court. Its crêpe rubber campaign amounted to techno-primitivism in action. We need now to consider how such an emphasis might have found its way into literature; or at least into <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span>.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Rubber Tennis-Shoes</h1>
<p>During the First World War, Lawrence finally became convinced that Europe was in the process of destroying itself, and that renewal—if renewal were still possible—could only come from sources in a mentality at once beyond and before the civilization it had brought about. In works like <span style="font-style:italic;">Fantasia of the Unconscious</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">St Mawr</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">The Plumed Serpent</span> , and <span style="font-style:italic;">Mornings in Mexico</span> , he drew a stark contrast between a white European and North American civilization rendered lethally sterile by its commitment to Christian-Platonic idealism and doctrines of scientific-industrial "progress," and that of aboriginal peoples whose custodianship of ancient intuitive and animist modes of consciousness had encouraged momentous if ultimately futile resistance to colonial expansion. After the War, he traveled, to Italy, Ceylon, Australia, and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> New Mexico, in search of the few remaining custodians. His letters of this period express both contempt for Western attitudes and ways of life in toxic decline, and uncertainty about what the available alternatives might add up to.<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> A good deal of the contempt was reserved for what England had become. So it is not surprising that the novel he wrote when he decided once again to write about England, <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span>, a novel permeated with the melancholy of his final return to his "native Midlands" in September 1926, should lapse into polemic;<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> or that the utopia reflected faintly back from its polemical <span style="font-style:italic;">furor</span> should exist in imagination at once beyond and before what England had so palpably become in his eyes.</p>
<p>Primitivism of a conventional kind has been inscribed in the topography of the tale, consistent through all three versions. The hut and the cottage where Constance Chatterley undergoes her rite of passage, redeemed by male sexual tenderness, constitute a liminal space deep in the heart of old England: a sacred realm distinct from the equal and opposite profanities of decaying manor and brash suburb. That much is obvious. The topography, however, has been overlaid with polemic; indeed is in some sense constituted by polemic, and polemic's faint reflection back as utopia. When Lawrence rewrote the novel for the second and last time between 23 November 1927 and 8 January 1928, he thickened it discursively. As Frieda Lawrence put it, the first version came as though "out of his own immediate self," but in the third he was "also aware of his contemporaries' minds."<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup> Most significantly, working-class Parkin in the second version became gentlemanly Mellors in the third, more bookish, more articulate, more dominant (more like Lawrence himself, in short). As David Ellis points out, many readers have "complained that the increased discursive element, together with a much stronger strain of denunciatory rage in the reflections of the gamekeeper, obscure the lyrical celebrations of sexual intercourse which make the second version so impressive."<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup> In his comprehensive study of the making of the novel, Derek Britton notes that Lawrence went out of his way in revision to reduce and qualify the original's "pastoral lyricism."<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup> The displacement of Connie's old feminine sentimentality by a new female sexuality now requires a journey not just from one place to another, but from one discourse to another.<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup> Lawrence's is a discursive primitivism, adjusted both to age-old mythic structure and to what was going on in the minds of his contemporaries.</p>
<p>The most striking aspect of the polemic against modern civilization delivered by the third and final <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span> is that Lady Constance Chatterley and gamekeeper Mellors speak in identical terms under different circumstances and without explicit reference to each other's views. Their shared outlook is, we are bound to feel, the author's. Both elementalize the sorts of people they most fear and hate. Connie frets that the "very material" modern people are made of is "cheap stuff" (<span style="font-style:italic;">LCL</span>, 62). Mellors's vague resolve to protect Connie with his heart for a little while at least "before the insentient iron world and the Mammon of mechanized greed did them both in"  returns with a rippling diagnostic vengeance at the conclusion of the drive Connie later takes through the mining district (a drive based on one Lawrence had himself taken in September 1926). "Creatures of another reality," she observes of the miners, "they were elementals, serving the element of coal, as the metal-workers were  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> elementals, serving the element of iron" . Different elementals, according to the Connie-Mellors diagnosis, serve different elements. When Mellors happily reflects that Connie isn't "all tough rubber-goods-and-platinum, like the modern girl," and that the tenderness she nurtures has "gone out of the celluloid women of today" , his words predict those she will use to denounce Sir Clifford and his set. "They've got about as much feeling as celluloid has," she reflects indignantly to herself. As to her husband, "she found him stupidly insentient, tough and india-rubbery where other people were concerned" . The proletariat, in short, is made of ancient natural stuff that comes out of the ground; the ruling élite of the semi-synthetic products of the modern laboratory.</p>
<p>This shared vituperation has a peculiar autonomy and denseness, even by Lawrence's standards. Striving for literalness, its metaphors lay bare their own metaphoricity. Coal-miners <span style="font-style:italic;">are</span> coal, metal-workers <span style="font-style:italic;">are</span> metal. Well, of course they aren't. It is an aporetic discourse, numbed by its own vigor. It has no diagnostic value. If it proposes anything, it proposes an end to diagnosis, and a consequent reversion to the "primitive" in discourse itself: to dialect, to that naming of body parts and functions which absorbs so much of the time Connie and Mellors spend together in the liminal space they have devised for themselves in the heart of old England. "'What is cunt?' she said" . Or, rather, to pose the primitivist question, as Mellors does by phallic insistence during their second night at the cottage, "What or where in the human body is 'before' and 'beyond' cunt?" At their crisis, the lovers appear to be made only of such stuff as people would be made of who no longer had to worry about coal and iron, celluloid and rubber. But the anti-discourse which has brought them discursively as close to anti-matter as an imaginary living person can get has, in its turn, a peculiar autonomy and denseness as discourse. It, too, is an aporetic discourse numbed by its own vigor. In its third and final version, the novel talks itself to a standstill. Almost.</p>
<p>In September 1927, shortly before he began that third and final version, Lawrence finished translating a collection of short fiction by Giovanni Verga which was to appear as <span style="font-style:italic;">"Cavalleria Rusticana" and Other Stories</span>. In his "Translator's Preface," he raised concerns about the degree of control writers like Verga seemed to want to exercise over narrative, concerns which have some bearing, I believe, on his own work.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>We need an apparent formlessness, definite form is mechanical. We need more easy transitions from mood to mood and from deed to deed. A great deal of the meaning of life and of art lies in the apparently dull spaces, the pauses, the unimportant passages.<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span>, deed coalesces discursively with mood: the deed which is industrial capitalism articulated by fury at the damage it has done to gentry and proletariat alike; the deed which is sexual tenderness by a jargon of John Thomas and Lady Jane. But it is in the "unimportant passages"—"passage" understood both as physical movement from one place to another within a fictional world, and as the sentences given over to description of the means by which it is accomplished—that at least part of the novel's meaning is to be found. It is in those passages that Lawrence  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> reflected most productively, by means of an exact engagement with the minds of his contemporaries, on the nature and scope of a modern life.</p>
<p>Lawrence added Connie's denunciation of Sir Clifford as "tough and india-rubbery" to the novel's third and final version. It is followed by dinner, during which they discuss Proust, and then a passage describing what she has decided to wear on her passage to Mellors's cottage, where she will for the first time spend the night. "Connie returned to her room, threw her pyjamas on the tossed bed, put on a thin night-dress and over that a woolen day-dress, put on rubber tennis-shoes, and then a light coat, and she was ready" (<span style="font-style:italic;">LCL</span>, 195). In the second version, the shoes are "rubber-soled".<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65">65</a></sup> I hope that I have already done enough to suggest why Lawrence might have thought that the association of rubber soles with tennis would find an echo in the minds of his contemporaries. While there is of course no absolute guarantee that the shoes he imagined Connie wearing on this occasion have crêpe rubber soles, the likelihood, given the additional detail of their purpose, and the prominence throughout the period during which the novel was written of the publicity campaigns surrounding the use of such shoes for such a purpose, is that they do. There is a different primitivism at work here, one which no longer looks before and beyond techno-industrial civilization; and Lawrence makes sure that we know it. Wild rubber's wildness equips Connie to dance naked in the rain the next time she and Mellors meet at the hut. "She slipped on her rubber shoes and ran out with a wild little laugh …" By adding in the third version that Connie rehearses for Mellors's benefit the "eurhythmic dance-movements" she had learned in Dresden, Lawrence confirms that this is indeed a thoroughly modern primitivism . After the dance, its enabling substance is granted ghostly reanimation in a thoroughly unimportant passage which none the less attains a remarkable comic-lyrical intensity.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>He took the old sheet and rubbed her down, she standing like a child. Then he rubbed himself, having shut the door of the hut. The fire was blazing up. She ducked her head in the other end of the sheet, and rubbed her wet hair.</p>
<p>"We're drying ourselves together on the same towel, we shall quarrel!" he said.</p>
<p>She looked up for a moment, her hair all odds and ends.</p>
<p>"No!" she said, her eyes wide. "It's not a towel, it's a sheet"</p>
<p>And she went on busily rubbing her head, while he busily rubbed his.</p>
<div class="attrib"></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The actions described, like the sentiments they give rise to, are entirely mundane. The steady reiteration of "rubbed" casts over them, by summoning from within the substance Connie has so recently put to eurhythmic use a memory of its original function in the West, a glow which itself never exceeds the mundane. It is an oddly (that is, comically) beautiful moment; and one which could not have been conceived without the tennisshoes. Connie has brought with her into the ancient forest a gadget which releases her not only from modern metropolitan gentility, but also from the forest. She can be old-new simply by wearing a certain kind of shoe in a certain way. This particular rite of passage has more passage to it than rite. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>An important catalyst for Lawrence's decision to revise the novel for a second and last time was his encounter with Dikran Kouyoumdjian, a Bulgarian-born Armenian who had adopted British citizenship, in Florence on 17 November 1927. Under the pen name of Michael Arlen, Kouyoumdjian had published a sensational best-seller, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Green Hat</span> , which trains a lugubrious prurience on jazz, drug-taking, and sexually-transmitted disease. The fast-living heroine, Iris Storm, turns out to be a good sort in the end. She sends her lover back to his wife and commits suicide by driving her Hispano Suiza into a tree. Lawrence had little time for the novel, but thought of Iris Storm as an exemplary modern heroine. "And there is the heroine who is always 'pure,' usually, nowadays, on the muck-heap! Like the Green Hatted Woman."<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66">66</a></sup> But he liked Kouyoumdjian, and put him in the final version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span> as Michaelis, a hugely successful playwright courted and condemned by the "smart set" his plays describe. Connie has an affair with Michaelis before getting to know Mellors. His introduction imparts a "new moral character" to Connie, as Derek Britton has pointed out; it makes her the "archetype" of the modern woman, seeking sexual satisfaction wherever she can find it.<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67">67</a></sup> Lawrence, of course, continued until his death to comment in the severest terms on the modern woman.<sup><a name="f68-text" href="#f68">68</a></sup> Connie is rather the archetype, in her rubber tennis-shoes, of the modern old-new woman.</p>
<p>The first and more or less last thing we are told about Iris Storm, as the narrator looks down from the window of his apartment into the street, is that her hat is "bright green, of a sort of felt, and bravely worn: being, no doubt, one of those that women who have many hats affect <span style="font-style:italic;">pour le sport</span>." Closer inspection at street level reveals a tall woman who somehow gives the impression "that she had just been playing six sets of tennis."<sup><a name="f69-text" href="#f69">69</a></sup> By the mid-1920s, sport had become a major fashion and mass media event.<sup><a name="f70-text" href="#f70">70</a></sup> To dress and act <span style="font-style:italic;">pour le sport</span> was one way to be modern. The narrator spots a second. "Her hair, in the shadow of her hat, may have been any colour, but I dared swear that there was a tawny whisper to it."<sup><a name="f71-text" href="#f71">71</a></sup> Sport combined with tawniness was the formula for the complete modern primitive. Tawny designates a composite color (brown with a preponderance of yellow or orange), and it could be applied to a person whose skin was somewhere between white and black: a person like Ciccio, the young Italian circus performer who redeems Alvina Houghton from spinsterdom, in Lawrence's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Lost Girl</span> . Tawny-skinned Ciccio gazes lingeringly at Alvina out of "tawny" eyes. When he touches her from behind, it is as if "some unseen creature had stroked her with its paw." Sitting beside this "dark-skinned foreigner" on a tram, Alvina is reminded of "the woman with the negro husband, down in Lumley."<sup><a name="f72-text" href="#f72">72</a></sup> Hollywood adopted tawniness with enthusiasm. Ciccio's nearest female equivalent was María, the working-class Mexican heroine of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tiger's Coat</span> , from a 1917 novel by Elizabeth Dejeans, whose youthful <span style="font-style:italic;">joie de vivre</span> redeems a jaded Californian tycoon, Alexander McAllister. In the novel, Marie (as she is there) has Ciccio-like tawny eyes and Iris Storm-like luxuriant tawny hair, the "gold in her hair" like "the yellow streak in a tiger's coat."<sup><a name="f73-text" href="#f73">73</a></sup> In the film, a local artist, commissioned to paint her portrait, remarks that she has the "tawny skin of a tiger." María was played by the Italian actress and model Tina Modotti, later to become a celebrated photographer and political activist.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Lawrence met Modotti in November 1924, in Mexico City, where she was then living with the American photographer Edward Weston, who took two portrait photographs of him. Thanking Weston for these, on 19 December 1924, Lawrence suggested that <span style="font-style:italic;">Vanity Fair</span> might like some of his "less startling nudes" (the more startling ones were of Modotti), and sent her his regards ("Greet the Signora").<sup><a name="f74-text" href="#f74">74</a></sup> Back in the metropolis, of course, you didn't have to be naked to appear tawny. Bradley Furs would be happy to provide you with a coat in "Natural Tawny Russian Coltskin, collared with mink," a bargain at thirty-two guineas.<sup><a name="f75-text" href="#f75">75</a></sup> Beneath her green hat, Iris Storm wears a "light brown leather jacket—<span style="font-style:italic;">pour le sport</span>—which shone quite definitely in the lamplight: it was wide open at the throat, and had a high collar of the fur of a few minks."<sup><a name="f76-text" href="#f76">76</a></sup></p>
<p>Connie Chatterley, examining her own body in the mirror after the gamekeeper has first aroused her interest, notes, not altogether disapprovingly, that her skin is "faintly tawny" (<span style="font-style:italic;">LCL</span>, 70). The rubber tennis-shoes subsequently add the proper note of <span style="font-style:italic;">pour le sport</span>. Of course, Connie is not Iris Storm, or Jordan Baker, in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Great Gatsby</span>, the golf champion who remembers wearing as a sixteen-year-old "shoes from England with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground"; or any other modern primitive whose primitivism runs skin-deep only.<sup><a name="f77-text" href="#f77">77</a></sup> My point is simply that Lawrence's modernization of Connie, in the third and final version of <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span>, had as profound an effect as the transformation of Parkin into Mellors. He went out of his way to identify her as modern by equipping her with modern synthetic and semi-synthetic substances which not only regulate her passage to and from the ancient woodland's sacred realm, but in and through that regulation bring her to her senses (to senses whose proper functioning will immunize her against Mellors as well as Sir Clifford). It may be that the emphasis put on the comb she uses to tidy her hair before returning home after her first night at the cottage constitutes such an identification. By the 1920s, all cheap combs were made of celluloid.<sup><a name="f78-text" href="#f78">78</a></sup> Even more striking is the "little bottle of Coty's Wood-violet perfume, half-empty," she leaves among his things after her second night at the cottage: "She wanted him to remember her in the perfume" . The manufacturer's name is an addition in the final draft. Coty did not in fact manufacture a perfume called Wood Violet. As Lawrence was revising, in January 1928, they launched L'Aimant (The Magnet).<sup><a name="f79-text" href="#f79">79</a></sup> But wood-violets feature earlier in the novel . As with the tennis-shoes, Lawrence has chosen for Connie a combination of old and new: the natural <span style="font-style:italic;">in</span> the synthetic, not before or beyond it. Connie's strong awareness of synthetic and semi-synthetic substance saves her.</p>
<p>I hope I have been able to show that <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Chatterley's Lover</span> was conceived, in its third version at least, as a rather more topical text than we have for the most part taken it to be. One consequence of the lengthy ban it endured was to obscure the extent of its topicality. But if we take full account of the ways in which Lawrence engaged with the minds of his contemporaries, we can grasp in that engagement a certain accommodation to modern techno-industrial reality which is not without consequences for our understanding of his work, and that of other Modernist writers. The colonies would not be "far enough," Mellors says at one point, for a new beginning. He knows that the "industrial epoch" has no recoverable before or beyond: "I'd better hold my peace, an'  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> try an' live my own life" (<span style="font-style:italic;">LCL</span>, 220). But it is Connie who most fully lives her own life. She is modern literature's most fully rendered techno-primitivist.</p>

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</span><p>This essay attempts to reframe the discussion around which scholars have typically investigated the oriental detective genre. Rather than focusing on the question of whether or not Charlie Chan and his various spin-offs are racist caricatures or else heroic defenders of justice, this essay argues that the oriental detective genre be seen as an iteration of a discourse devoted to positing Asian aesthetics and philosophy as a seemingly more therapeutic and creative way of living within the accelerating cultures of mechanization and mechanical reproduction. By following the appearance of the "Chinese parrot" as it makes its way through a discursive convergence of machine culture, corporate aesthetics, and ethnic and racial stereotyping, this essay shows that the supposedly "oriental" philosophy of Charlie Chan and his iterations was consistently promoted as a means of undoing the dangerous intrusion of technology into modern life, and that, as such, the oriental detective genre was itself presented as a happily self-reflexive product of mechanical reproduction.</p>

<p>In the first full-length Charlie Chan novel by Earl Derr Biggers, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Chinese Parrot</span>, published in 1926, Charlie Chan goes undercover as a pidgin-speaking Chinese houseboy named Ah Kim in order to get access to a Chinese-speaking parrot that has witnessed (assuming, interestingly enough, that "witnessing" is possible for a parrot) a terrible murder.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> "You understand," Charlie Chan explains, "parrot does not invent talk. Merely repeats what others have remarked."<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> The value of the parrot's speech as "testimony" in the novel, we discover, lies in its reproductive, mechanical nature—its <span style="font-style:italic;">lack</span> of invention and thought. The parrot's speech is not "language," but rather a mere "type" of indiscriminate mimetic duplication—important in the story precisely because of its apparent incapacity for duplicity (duplicability, yes, duplicity, no). Descartes, one is reminded, thought of the parrot as something like a ghostless machine.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> As he explains in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Discourse on Method</span>, "One sees that magpies and parrots can utter words as we do, and yet cannot speak as we do … it is nature which acts in them according to the disposition of their organs, as one sees that a clock, which is made up of only wheels and springs, can count the hours and measure time."<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> Parrots are philosophically interesting (Freud would no doubt have said  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> "uncanny") because they reproduce as other-than-human the technology most basic to us as humans: language.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> Parrots speak, and some of them remarkably well, but only as heteronomous creatures—but of course, how could we know for sure?<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps as a result of this weird categorical liminality, parrots have often haunted machine aesthetics and form. Two years before Biggers's novel appeared, the quintessential artist of the machine age, Fernand Léger (who frequently confessed a fascination with parrots) produced an experimental non-narrative film, <span style="font-style:italic;">Ballet Mécanique</span>, in which dancing machine pistons, items of kitchenware, typewriters, and mechanically blinking eyes are juxtaposed with the jerky, similarly repetitive movements of one of Léger's cockatoos.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> As Paul Carter has recently noted, Léger's bird is presented in the film as a media image: "The pathos of Léger's cockatoo is technological," reflecting a collective cultural sense of the parrot as a "memory system, which the inventions of Edison, Bell, and Lumiére superseded. Parrots contrive to imitate telephone bells; they cheerily catch the hiss and click of the phonograph needle; they learn to double the look of the mirror."<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> To point to a more recent example (to say nothing of rapidly proliferating Youtube videos featuring talking parrots), online retailers now offer a USB Parrot, which, according to its creators, learns to "speak random phrases which are picked up in passing when a phrase is repeated enough" complete with "mechanical wings." As the advertisement explains, "Now you can feel like a real pirate while making your illegal downloads with this USB parrot as your sidekick."<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> It's a striking image: the online pirate's USB parrot presiding over endless online iterations of mechanical, and now digital reproducibility (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 1</a>).<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Even before the advent of moving pictures, the exotic connotations of this speaking animal allowed it to play a rather curious role in the development of "talking" pictures. Spanning the entire history of Western art, the hundreds (probably thousands) of "woman and parrot" paintings that appeared throughout Europe and America are interesting for not only what they communicated about an artist's mastery of form, but for the artistic conversations they articulated above and beyond their subject matter.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> When, for example, the French Realist Gustav Courbet painted <span style="font-style:italic;">Woman With a Parrot</span> in 1866, it was widely understood to be a critique of Édouard Manet's famous nude prostitute, <span style="font-style:italic;">Olympia</span> , which Courbet had already criticized as rather too realistic, reportedly describing it as "the Queen of Spades stepping out of her bath."<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Art historian Arden Reed's explanation of Courbet's use of the parrot as a way of "talking" to Manet through his painting might seem a bit tenuous at first, but when we notice Manet's own response to Courbet in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Jeune Dame en 1866</span> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Young Lady in 1866</span>], Reed's take is difficult to dispute. In his painted response, Manet reproduces the woman-and-parrot genre, but conspicuously refuses to reproduce the marketable sensuousness of the traditional female nude, thereby sending the message to Courbet (by way of a mute parrot next to a much less exotic and fully clothed young woman) that Courbet had too spinelessly abandoned the artistic principles of French realism in favor of a more bureaucratic and bourgeois orientalism.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> Manet's parrot, in other words, signals a kind of parodic polyglossia—and the pun here on "polly," as Paul Carter has argued, is neither trivial nor rare.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Of course, these moments of polyphonic speaking-through-genre only scratch the surface of the role of the parrot in literary and visual culture. As Manet's critique of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Courbet implies, for centuries parrots have red prominently in Western aesthetics as an iconic emblem of exotic imperial gathering. Bruce Boehrer, author of one of several studies on "parrot culture," notes that, "parrots have the distinction—or misfortune, depending on how you look at it—of being the first animal to be exported from the New World to the Old."<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> Collected and displayed as part of an "ongoing process of [colonial] acquisition," parrots became a decorative reflection of Western imperialism.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> Indeed, in addition to Boehrer, Paul Cater, Julia Courtney, and Paula James have all recently published studies detailing the cultural role of the parrot in selected texts from Ovid to Jean Rhys—arguing, in short, that this "talking" animal has functioned throughout history as an important re in aesthetic explorations of the delineations and slippages between West and East, machine and human, self and other.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup></p>

<p>As we shall see, the idea of an "oriental detective" when it first appeared in the 1920s conjured up many of these psittacine fantasies, and corporations and individuals involved in film production were savvy to its potential marketability. It is hardly surprising, in fact, when at one point in Biggers's novel <span style="font-style:italic;">The Chinese Parrot</span>, when Charlie Chan visits Hollywood to observe a film production team at work, the director of the film—literally between takes—glances over at Chan and says, "By gad, here's a type … Say, John—how'd you like to act in the pictures?" Chan laughs off the suggestion, but he is clearly intrigued. "Warmest thanks for permitting close inspection of picture factory," Chan says about the experience afterwards, "Always a glowing item on the scroll of memory" . Biggers knew already that he was writing this novel to be made almost immediately into a film, and the obvious self-reflexivity in the phrase "here's a type," as I will argue, relies on all the correlative associations of the parrot: Charlie Chan is exotic; his speech is strangely both halting and elegant, he is ripe for mechanical reproduction—he is already, in other words, sleuthing towards Hollywood. And when he finally entered film culture, his appearance was certainly grand. Between 1927 and 1949, and not counting his appearance in Mexican, Asian, and other international versions, Hollywood studios alone produced over 60 full-production films featuring either Charlie Chan or one of his oriental detective spin-offs.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>For perhaps obvious reasons, most discussions of the oriental detective genre have tended to focus on whether or not the character reflects a positive or negative stereotype for Asian America. Defenders of the genre have been, until recently, mostly non-academic, arguing that the oriental detective is very consistently portrayed as smart and heroic. Keye Luke, the Asian-American actor who played both the voice of Charlie Chan in the 1970s animated series and Charlie Chan's "Number One Son" in the original films, argued, "They think [the character] demeans the race. I said, 'Demeans! My God! You've got a Chinese hero!'"<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> Ken Hanke, the author of <span style="font-style:italic;">Charlie Chan at the Movies</span> insists that "anyone familiar with the films knows that if anyone comes off badly in most Charlie Chan movies, it is invariably Charlie's white counterparts—those dimwitted, cigar chewing Hollywoodized upholders of law and order who get nothing right until Charlie solves things for them."<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> But for Charlie Chan's detractors, the oriental detective narrative is practically a crime scene. The most caustic of Chan's critics is undoubtedly Frank Chin, who has argued that the oriental detective should be characterized as culturally akin to real-world villains like "Lee Harvey Oswald, Adolf Eichmann, [and] Richard Speck."<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> The National Asian American Telecommunication Association and the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium have been similarly, if more diplomatically, negative. In an effort to pressure the Fox Movie Channel to cancel its recent plan to showcase some early Chan films, the two associations issued a joint statement arguing that the Chinese American sleuth represents, "an offensive stereotype who revives sentiments and social dynamics that should be relegated to the past."<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Without dismissing these concerns—and, indeed, as a way of more fully understanding them—this essay attempts to reframe the discussion around which scholars have typically investigated the oriental detective genre. More specifically, rather than focusing on the question of whether or not Charlie Chan and his various spin-offs are deplorably racist caricatures or else heroic defenders of justice, I want to follow the trail of the "Chinese parrot" as it makes its way through a discursive convergence of machine culture, corporate aesthetics, and ethnic and racial stereotyping, pausing to notice not only what the oriental detective genre says about American racial attitudes during the 1930s and 1940s, but also what it says about the corporate production of film and film culture (and, in proper sleuth-fashion, all will be revealed in the end). The first clue in such an investigation will be found at the scene of a discourse I call Asia-as-<span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span>.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">
<span style="font-style:italic;">Asia-as-</span>Technê</h1>
<p>It is certainly no secret that the long and enthusiastic romance between Western culture and modern technology has had its ups and downs.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> Indeed, the "golden age" of the oriental detective genre (from the early 1930s to the mid-1940s) coincided with an era of deep technological anxiety in Euro-American culture. Oswald Spengler's <span style="font-style:italic;">Man and Technics</span> , for example, lamented an ongoing Western exultation in mechanization, predicting a massive ecological crisis as machines came to dominate the landscape. Lewis Mumford's highly influential <span style="font-style:italic;">Technics and Civilization</span>   <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> decried the unrestrained imposition of a mechanized modernity over the organic, anticipating many of Siegfried Gideon's later arguments in the 1940s in his similarly influential volume <span style="font-style:italic;">Mechanization Takes Command</span> . In the early 1940s, reflecting what would eventually become a common theme in Frankfurt School criticism, Max Horkheimer and Theodore Adorno characterized technology as the "essence" of Enlightenment knowledge, arguing that the question of whether or not technology can be brought under control is "<span style="font-style:italic;">The supreme question</span> which confronts our generation today—the question to which all other problems are mere corollaries."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> Herbert Marcuse would make the connection between enlightenment rationality and the technological exploitation of man and the environment even more explicit: "The more reason triumphed in technology and natural science, the more reluctantly did it call for freedom in man's social life."<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> For these critics, mechanization meant inevitably the ominous hegemony of the culture industry.</p>
<p>It is important to note, however, that such anxieties were not unique to Western intellectuals and radical Marxists. In the 1930s, in addition to the general sense that an acceleration of mechanical reproduction had contributed to the euphoric surplus of the 1920s, and, therefore, the massive depression, many Americans were also highly skeptical that the mechanization of cultural production necessarily constituted a step forward in the arts.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> The Federal Radio Commission in the early 1930s, for example, legally required as a service to listeners that radio stations describe on air whether the program being broadcast was an actual performance or a mere "mechanical reproduction."<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> Some of the earliest television broadcasters even (however shortsightedly) boasted that they were not simply training the lens on reel-to-reel pre-recorded production, but were delivering "live" and therefore less mechanically tainted programming.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup></p>
<p>Many commentators on technological anxiety at the time began reminding their readers that the original concept of technology, as embodied in the Greek word <span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span>, had initially, before the Euro-American domination of nature, conveyed something more subtle and healthy than the exploitative cultures of mechanical reproduction and heavy industry. The most famous (and problematic) of these anti-modernist recourses to etymology was that of Martin Heidegger, who, in his philosophical search for redemptive alternatives to the massive "enframing" [<span style="font-style:italic;">gestell</span>] of the emerging technological world order, turned to the word <span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span> in an effort to rescue forms of thinking and handicraft from the systemic metaphysics of modern technology—in short, to distinguish between what we might call the modern <span style="font-style:italic;">techno</span> and the originary <span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span>.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> As he explains in "The Question Concerning Technology," "There was a time when it was not technology alone that bore the name <span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span>. Once, the revealing that brings forth truth into the splendor of radiant appearance was also called <span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span>." Not simply a return to Nature, then, the move toward <span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span> was for Heidegger (or at least "late Heidegger") an attempt to resurrect some ancient skill or craftsmanship, and to identify—against the efficient and inhumane technologies of modernity—an ontological aesthetic more conducive to a more romantic concept of organic wholeness.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup></p>
<p>That Heidegger was dabbling in orientalism while writing "The Question Concerning Technology" is interesting, even if (after beginning, and then almost immediately giving up on learning Chinese) he turns to Greek etymology and Western poetics rather than  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Taoism or Zen Buddhism as the philosophical wellspring for his therapeutic ontology.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> Heidegger hinted that Asian aesthetics and philosophy offered a means of countering the Western "enframing" of world mechanization, but never felt confident enough to fully articulate it. However, surprisingly enough, this was an idea already widely circulating in Euro-American popular discourse. T. J. Jackson Lears' <span style="font-style:italic;">No Place of Grace</span>, for example, details an especially interesting and generally overlooked tendency in European and American culture to characterize Asia's <span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span> as the potential solution to the problems of Western over-technologization.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> As Lears argues, a number of Euro-Americans saw in the East a particular form of <span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span>, generally feminized and mystical, that might somehow provide a therapeutic alternative to Western industrial or Taylorized forms of mass production and machine technology.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> Unlike the more traditional protocols of orientalist discourse (in which the East is either characterized as stagnantly "tech-less" or else dangerously imitating Western technoculture), the advocates of Asia-as-<span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span> asserted that the technologically superior West had too aggressively espoused the dictates of industrial life, and that it was necessary to turn to the culture and tradition of the East in order to recover the essence of some misplaced or as-yet-unfulfilled modern identity. J. J. Clarke's <span style="font-style:italic;">Oriental Enlightenment</span> similarly argues that contrary to the idea that the West has consistently characterized the East as irrational and antipathetic to Western cultures of science and technology, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, "Western science and Eastern mysticism formed an improbable coalition, with many thinkers looking upon Buddhism as an ally in the struggle of science against indigenous metaphysical traditions."<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> Indeed, evidence for the promotion of Asia's <span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span> as a more therapeutic means of living with modern technology is everywhere in twentieth century Euro-American culture: from the romantic tenets of late-nineteenth century Boston orientalism to the mystical visions of Shangri-La in James Hilton and Frank Capra, from the anti-technocratic visions of the beat poets to the post-counterculturalist values of Robert Pirsig's <span style="font-style:italic;">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</span>, Asia-as-<span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span> has emerged again and again as a critical response to Euro-American overconfidence in Western technoculture.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>I contend that the oriental detective genre should be seen in a new way: as another, crucial, iteration of this discourse. But how exactly did the oriental detective reflect a seemingly more therapeutic and creative way of living within the accelerating culture of mechanization and mechanical reproduction? What did the "Chinese Parrot" have to say about these problems? Here I would suggest two interrelated answers: first that Charlie Chan and his spin-offs were, by way of their supposedly oriental philosophical outlook, constantly involved in reframing and even undoing the dangerous intrusion of technology into modern life, and second, that the oriental detective genre was itself a happily self-reflexive product of mechanical reproduction.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Technological World of the Oriental Detective</h1>
<p>In developing this argument, I want to point to something in the Charlie Chan films that, to my knowledge, has never been articulated in the critical discourse (including  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> those in both academic and non-academic venues): in addition to the novelty of having a Chinese detective hero, technology is a central, perhaps even <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> central, concern of the film series. Consider, for instance, how many of the Charlie Chan films feature some kind of techno-trick at the center of the narrative (see <a name="tab01-text" href="#tab01">Table 1</a>).</p>
<p>As the accumulation of evidence here clearly suggests, throughout the entire Charlie Chan film series one finds a constant return to the problems and solutions posed by modern technology, such that Chan's solving of the mystery in film after film depends on his ability to utilize (or else uncover the criminal use of) technological devices: microscopes, phonographs, picture wires, photoelectric cells, radiographs, laboratory experiments, ultraviolet film project, and so on. It is important to note here that these moments of gadgetry are not peripheral to the narratives; indeed, they routinely constitute the most distinctive parts of each film. While it is often difficult, for example, to keep track of the various characters in the oriental detective films (such that until the revelation of who the criminal is, it is rather complicated sometimes to distinguish who is who), it is very easy to mark where and how the techno-trick enters the plot.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup></p>
<p>It is perhaps not surprising that this particular species of detective genre should be preoccupied with the potential problems and solutions of modern technology.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> Ronald Thomas has recently shown that the "history of detective fiction is deeply implicated with the history of forensic technology."<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> Indeed, technologies such as photography, telegraphy, cinematography, radiography, lie detectors (and on and on) appear with striking regularity in detective fictions from the first moments of the genre. As such, Thomas argues that the genre has sometimes functioned to provide reassurances regarding the place of modern science in western culture, even as it also sometimes "exposed, and in so doing … challenged the emerging culture of surveillance and the explanations of individual and collective identity it promulgated"—in short, that detective fiction at various times "both reinforces and resists the disciplinary regime it represents."<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup></p>
<p>What is unique about the oriental detective films, however, is that Charlie Chan's stereotypical "Asianness" is consistently portrayed as a cultural asset in solving the problems created by modern technology. Chan understands and yet crucially stands apart from the dangerous Western technological systems he is called in to remedy. Unlike the hard-boiled and frequently violent lonerism of characters like Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe, Chan helps to solve the problems of mechanical culture without becoming corrupted by them. He is infinitely polite and gracious (his most famous catch-phrase was "thank you so much"). He's a family man (he's portrayed as having 13 children). He's a far cry from the haughty bohemianism one finds in Sherlock Holmes. And he's portrayed as having a kind of limitless supply of oriental wisdom. For example, one of the most memorable and often parodied character traits that audiences remember about Chan is his trademark penchant for quasi-Confucian aphorisms, known as "Chanograms" in Hollywood circles, where he says things like, "only foolish dog pursue flying bird" or "truth, like football, receive many kicks before reaching goal," or "murder case like revolving door; when one side close, other side open."<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> Audiences would often "parrot" these sayings after the show, and no doubt came to Chan films <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">expecting these rhetorical flourishes (one large advertisement for a Charlie Chan film even promises, in large lettering, "Chinese Wisecracks of Laughter").<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> Clearly, none of these particular aphorisms have any currency in Chinese culture, but of course that was never really the point. What mattered was that this highly "oriental" re seemed to have both an authoritative grasp of modern technology and a sagacious ability to transcend the dangerous and systematic mechanicity of American culture, even as he confirmed the fundamental place of technology within that culture. Take, for example, Twentieth-Century Fox's <span style="font-style:italic;">Charlie Chan in Egypt</span> . In this film, set in an exotic locale (and capitalizing, no doubt, on the ongoing public fascination with the discovery of Tutankhamen's tomb), an archeologist's son dies suddenly while playing the violin. Chan suspects foul play, and in a scene that offers a number of important clues in our investigation, he discovers that a small tube made of extremely fragile glass and filled with poisonous gas had been placed inside the violin and designed to explode when exposed to the violin's sound vibrations ( <a name="2-text" href="#2">2</a>–<a name="3-text" href="#3">3</a>). Chan's demonstration of this technotrick before the other inspectors functions as a narrative turning point in the film, and, combined with a series of memorable Chanograms (e.g. "Hasty conclusion easy to make, like hole in water"), the film develops what would become a familiar pattern in the oriental detective genre: the wisdom of the East resolving the techno-perils of the West, and doing so in a way that did not reject technology, but rather seemed to demonstrate a wise and more organic way of living with it.</p>
<p>But beyond this rather obvious instance of Asia-as-<span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span>, I want to argue further that a closer inspection of the larger oriental detective genre reveals a surprising degree of meta-cinematic self-reflexivity, such that one can readily imagine both the filmmakers and their audiences detecting that the posited <span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span> in these films is a parodic, technological construction—a mechanically reproducible stereotype that continually acknowledges the limits of its own authenticity. In short, that the ethnic or even racial identity of the oriental detective becomes itself a kind of generic technology, exposing that at the heart of the genre lies a composite picture of celebrated reproducibility. In developing this argument, I will be relying on a particular discourse in film studies that focuses on the presence of what might be called extra-diegetic managerial signals that allow the films to speak as products of "corporate art."</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Cinematic Corporation and the Chinese Parrot</h1>
<p>Characterizations of Hollywood cinema as the work of corporate "industries" devoted to the mass-production of visual products (rather than as the unified, self-contained work of a single "auteur") have been useful in drawing attention to the critical economic processes of film production and distribution.<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> Seen in this light, the oriental detective genre fulfilled, usually, a very specific role in the economic structure of the Hollywood studio system. As primarily "B" films, or else "programmers" (those occupying an in-between position "straddling the A-B boundary"), the films of the oriental detective genre are part of that massive "other half" of Hollywood that has often been neglected in critical discourse.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> This despite the fact that, as Brian Taves argues, since <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p class="continued">the Depression-era advent of the "double bill," the B-film was essentially "<span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> basis of production, the underlying commercial and artistic means by which the industry survived—as well as the vast quantity and range of films offered to spectators during the studio era" (<span style="font-style:italic;">GD</span>, 313). Indeed, B films were what "fueled the engines of production, distribution, and exhibition" in the 1930s.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> For example, when asked what he thought of B film productions in 1938, John Stone (the assistant to Twentieth Century-Fox's producer Sol Wurtzel, who made most of the Chan films) noted that these films "are really the products which count in the long, steady pull," and then adding, with a smile, "They don't lose money."<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup></p>
<p>Two crucial pieces of evidence, however, begin to complicate the effort to characterize the oriental detective films as the slavish products of generic industries. First, as a number of scholars have shown, what the financial stability of the B film process meant in practical terms was that (provided the filmmakers finished on time and within their allocated budget) the cheap genre films we typically think of as adhering most faithfully to the reproduction of inherited form were in fact allowed a greater degree of artistic freedom than were their more carefully regulated A-list counterparts.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> As B film director Robert Florey once explained, "As long as I remained on schedule, I could shoot all the angles and set-ups I wanted, and move the camera whenever and wherever I wanted to, in the limited time I had."<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> Second, as Jerome Christensen has recently noted, "looking at Hollywood as a generic industry has the considerable disadvantage of erasing the strategies of individual studios, each of which—oligopolistic agreements notwithstanding—had a distinctive corporate intention that informed the meanings its films communicated to their various audiences."<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> Christensen's point here is that <span style="font-style:italic;">corporate</span> authorship quite often played a much larger role in film production than has previously been understood—often shaping a film's final content above and beyond even economic considerations. As he succinctly puts it, "When Jolson sang, Warner Bros. performed. When the lion roars, MGM speaks" . What would it mean, then, in our investigation of the oriental detective films to take seriously Christensen's argument that "numerous Hollywood films could only have been made by the studios that released them"?<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup></p>
<p>To answer that question it will be useful to look at a few of the many attempts to capitalize on the success of the Charlie Chan series from Twentieth Century-Fox (the two studios merged in 1935, at the peak of the series' success). When Fox realized that audiences were enjoying the Charlie Chan films faster than they could make them, the studio quickly set up another film crew and introduced the "Mr. Moto" series staring Peter Lorre, which was soon enjoying as much success as the Charlie Chan films.<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> Indeed, the Mr. Moto films followed the familiar pattern of techno-gadgetry and oriental wisdom, interestingly tinged, however, with an occasionally violent unpredictability that, coupled with America's entry into WWII, clearly spelt the end of Moto as a moment of Asia-as-<span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span> (when Japan could <span style="font-style:italic;">only</span> be seen as a techno-threat). In 1938, the Monogram Pictures Corporation, one of the leading small studios in what is referred to as "Poverty Row" (typically characterized as the "dregs" of the Hollywood studio system), seeing Twentieth Century-Fox's success with not only Charlie Chan  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> but now Mr. Moto as well, introduced yet another oriental detective, Mr. James Lee Wong played by Boris Karloff.<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> In fact, there were so many oriental detective films circulating at the time that one reviewer at the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> only half-jokingly noted, "This subtle discrediting of the West, this constant insistence on the superior finesse of the yellow races in the presence of homicide, is something which every red-blooded American should resent."<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup></p>
<p>Hiring Boris Karloff to play Mr. Wong meant that Monogram's budget for these films would be tight, but with the generic Asia-as-<span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span> forms already clearly established by Fox, most of Monogram's work was done before they had even begun filming.<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> The first installment in the Mr. Wong series, William Nigh's <span style="font-style:italic;">Mr. Wong Detective</span> , is perhaps one of the most fascinating, meta-cinematic films of B Hollywood, though it has certainly never been recognized as such (there's a legitimate reason, I would argue, that Jean-Luc Godard was being only partly ironic when he dedicated "<span style="font-style:italic;">Breathless</span>" to Monogram pictures). In the opening shots we encounter one Mr. Dayton, a businessman who suspects that his life is in danger, and so we see him rushing to Mr. Wong's residence. Let into the study by Wong's Chinese servant (played by Lee Tung Foo), Mr. Dayton enters the screen on the right, just as a parrot resting on a small perch in the center of the room squawks, "What do you want?" Mr. Dayton then glances nervously about the room, as though he is not sure from where the voice has come, "I … I am looking for Mr. Wong" (the effect is, of course, comically unbelievable). The camera cuts to another angle, and Mr. Wong has appeared suddenly, startling Mr. Dayton, "Good evening Mr. Dayton. I am James Lee Wong. I beg you to forgive my feathered friend. He delights in his own voice, but like so many humans, the words don't seem to matter" (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 4</a>).</p>
<p>Karloff's wardrobe is not immediately Chan-like. With a shimmering silk-robe, Chinese slippers, his exotic furniture, and the delicately feminine way he holds his cigarette (between his thumb and index finger), Karloff seems more Fu Manchu than Chan in these opening shots. But when Wong arrives the next day at Mr. Dayton's office, he is dressed in a Western suit, and has become much more of the Chinese detective that Monogram is attempting to parrot. Unfortunately, however, Wong arrives just a few minutes too late, and discovers that Mr. Dayton has been murdered, the only clue being a few small shards of very fragile glass lying near the body. Taking the glass to a laboratory, Wong reconstructs the original unbroken glass object, a small, spherical orb that fits into the palm of his hand. When the autopsy on Mr. Dayton's body reveals that he died of a poisonous gas, Mr. Wong is convinced that the small glass sphere is somehow involved. But how could the glass break and release its deadly gas when Mr. Dayton had been alone in his office?</p>
<p>One is reminded here that Fox's Charlie Chan had rather smoothly solved this problem in <span style="font-style:italic;">Charlie Chan in Egypt</span> in 1935. And the filmmakers at Monogram clearly know that they are directly parroting not only the Chan character, but also the technotrick at the center of the Chan genre. As a "parrot," then, Monogram's Mr. Wong is both parodying and speaking to the original "Chinese Parrot." Back in his study, Mr. Wong carefully places the fragile glass sphere on a tiny pedestal on his desk (<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">Behind him on the left-hand portion of the screen is his parrot. On his desk, a variety of Chinese musical instruments—the exotic accoutrements of Wong's supposed <span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span> culture—have been laid out in preparation for the experiment. Wong reaches for a suona (a kind of Chinese oboe), points it directly at the glass orb, and begins to play.</p>
<p>The resulting noise is terrible, a kind of screechingly dissonant, a-tonal whine, and Mr. Wong's Chinese servant (played by Lee Tung Foo) turns toward Wong with a painful grimace on his face. However, the glass orb remains intact. Puzzled, but deep in concentration, Wong sets down the suona and picks up a zhongruan (a kind of miniature Chinese guitar). Plucking the strings awkwardly, the sound is again dissonant and clumsy, and Wong's Chinese servant seems even more annoyed, perhaps even embarrassed. The glass orb still undamaged, Wong picks up an erhu (a kind of Chinese violin with only two strings), and begins to play it in precisely the same way that Charlie Chan had played the violin in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Egypt</span> film (compare <a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a> and <a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>). However, unlike Chan's smooth, methodical demonstration in that film, Wong's erhu playing is so cacophonous and jarring that his Chinese servant scowls and puts his fingers in his ears. Wong's <span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span>-powers would seem to be lacking in this particular case. Mystified by the glass orb's resistance to his experiments, Wong stops playing and looks down. And then suddenly his parrot squawks, loudly, and the shrillness of the sound—wait for it!—causes the glass orb to shatter into tiny pieces on his desk (<a name="7-text" href="#7"> 7</a>). Startled by the parrot's "speech act" Wong looks back at his parrot, down again at the shattered glass, and then walks back over to his parrot, and "bows to form," as if to say "Thank you so much," Charlie Chan's famous catch phrase (<a name="8-text" href="#8"> 8</a>).</p>
<p>But of course what we are witnessing here is not simply Mr. Wong thanking his parrot. This scene is Monogram's way of speaking to Twentieth Century-Fox, as if to say, we know we are pirating and parroting the Chan genre (good pirates always have a parrot on their shoulder), and "Thank you so much!" Monogram knows that Mr. Wong is not their invention, and so his homage to the parrot (the "Chinese" parrot) is explicitly metonymic. Wong's uncovering of the techno-trick is clumsier and more primitive, and lacks the high-budget polish of Chan's demonstration with the violin, but this is again Monogram's highly self-reflexive way of communicating its debt to Twentieth Century-Fox, as if to say, yes, we know that without Chan, Mr. Wong's techno-tricks would have never existed, and this is our way of playing with the piracy, riffing on it as one might a musical variation.</p>
<p>Mr. Wong's more-Chinese servant, played here by Lee Tung Foo, is not entirely impressed with Mr. Wong's parroted mimicry. As Lee Tung Foo's grimace (and his subsequent fury at having to clean up the glass shards) seems to indicate, Wong's piracy is only making a mess of Chinese culture (<a name="9-text" href="#9"> 9</a>). But Monogram had an interesting reason for casting Lee Tung Foo as well. As Krystyn R. Moon has shown, Lee Tung Foo, beginning with his career in vaudeville, was for quite a time the most famous Chinese-American in the entertainment industry.<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup> In 1906 Lee's act became a smash hit when, after singing a Cantonese song or two in traditional Chinese dress, Lee would return to the stage in a tuxedo, and sing popular ballads like "My Irish Molly O," and other Tin Pan Alley favorites in English with a flawless Irish accent. After touring Europe in 1909,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Lee Tung Foo returned to the U.S. with a Scottish number, having learned to perfectly mimic a Scottish accent, wearing an authentic Scottish costume (<a name="0-text" href="#0"> 10</a>). Audiences at the time described it as "screamingly funny," and Lee was widely credited with having debunked the popular assumption that Chinese people could not reproduce Western accents and musical sounds.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> Lee Tung Foo had already demonstrated, in other words, the fascinating (and highly marketable) affect made possible by the "other" faithfully "parroting" speech back to the "self."</p>

<p>In 1941, Twentieth Century-Fox responded with a Charlie Chan film entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Dead Men Tell</span>. In this film, a terrified elderly woman claims to have seen the ghost of a pirate on a ship recently at harbor, and so Charlie Chan (now played by Sidney Toler, following Warner Oland's death) is brought in to investigate. Going below deck, Chan is inspecting some high-tech sea-diving equipment when he hears a strangely distressed voice: "Look out, it's the cops! Beat it, it's the cops!" Chan looks over in the direction of the voice, and the camera zooms in slowly onto the face of a plastic pirate mask, propped up in the corner. The voice continues, "murder, murder, murder!" As Chan walks over to the corner, the mask suddenly lifts and a parrot flies up into Chan's face (<a name="1-text" href="#1"> 11</a>). Thus, Chan learns that the source of the phantasm is really just someone dressing up <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">and imitating a pirate (parroting a pirate, as it were). Chan's investigation soon focuses on the captain of the ship, a strangely Karloff-ish looking character who is rarely seen without a parrot on his shoulder. And perhaps not surprisingly, the piratical captain's chief assistant and co-conspirator in <span style="font-style:italic;">Dead Men Tell</span> is none other than Mr. Wong's (the Monogram pirate) servant, Lee Tung Foo.</p>
<p>In 1942 Twentieth Century-Fox, like most other major studios, was facing pressure from anti-trust suits to reduce its B-film units, and so allowed Sidney Toler to secure the rights to the Charlie Chan character, which he took with him to Monogram Pictures for the remainder of the Chan series. As a full-fledged Monogram product, Charlie Chan was now a part of the very studio that had so self-reflexively parroted and paid homage to him in the form of Mr. Wong just a few years previously. And in these increasingly low-budget Chan films, Monogram seems to revel in its playful cribbing of the same old techno-tricks and <span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span>-forms from previous inter-corporate conversations. Fifteen minutes into <span style="font-style:italic;">The Scarlet Clue</span> , for example, we learn that Chan's suspect is one "Mr. Horace Karlos" (pronounced so as to rhyme with Boris Karloff) and we are hardly surprised to discover that the murderer has planted a small glass capsule filled with poisonous gas into a studio microphone, which shatters when exposed to, again, a concentrated sound frequency.<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup> In the <span style="font-style:italic;">Docks of New Orleans</span> in 1948 we find Roland Winters playing Charlie Chan, back at home in his study, holding a small radio tube in his hand, and pondering the now-very-familiar mystery of how the tube's glass could shatter on cue. Chan's chauffer (Mantan Moreland) and Number Two Son Tommy (Victor Sen Young) are, much to Chan's annoyance, in the next room playing jazz music. When the music causes the familiar breakage, Chan picks up another radio tube and walks into the next room where the comic duo had been playing: "Excuse interruption of music festival, please," Chan says, "but would mind repeating excruciating sound made with assistance of cat intestines?" Tommy jauntily picks up the violin again and plays, causing the second radio tube to explode with a loud <span style="font-style:italic;">pop</span>. "Ah ha!" Chan exclaims, to which Tommy responds—in what can only be described as a parodic twist on what he calls his parent (parrot?)—"Discover something new, <span style="font-style:italic;">pop</span>?" (<a name="2-text" href="#2"> 12</a>).</p>
<p>As many in the audience would have certainly known, there was nothing new about Tommy's "pop" at this point, and, indeed, nothing new about the acoustic "pop" of this particular techno-trick. Indeed, one could posit here an ongoing metonymic parity between the representation of a given technology (that is, the "pop" caused by a given frequency within acoustic space), the "pop" (or father/predecessor) of these films caused by the "frequency" with which these mechanisms were recycled through the Hollywood studio system (reflecting here the <span style="font-style:italic;">generational</span> nature of genre—the genre film being a moment of <span style="font-style:italic;">re</span>familiarization rather than artistic defamiliarization), and, finally, the attempt to characterize this endless reproducibility not as a product of industrial mass culture, but as a simultaneously organic, exotic, <span style="font-style:italic;">pop</span> culture.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Conclusion: The Mystery Exposed</h1>
<p>Here, then, is the mystery exposed: what really pops out from within the glass encasing of Asia-as-<span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span> is the not-so-subtle characterization of <span style="font-style:italic;">cinema</span>-as-<span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span>.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Inasmuch as the wonders of oriental aesthetics and exoticism are supposedly transmitted by means of the mechanical reproducibility of film, the realm of the cinematic apparatus is portrayed as taking on its own mysterious, exotic splendor. To put it very simply, the cinema wants nothing so much as to become the Chinese parrot. Indeed, from the very beginnings of film theory and production, one finds an ongoing effort to amplify the aura of the cinematic apparatus with the <span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span>-cultural equipment of the orient. Metaphors for the cinema as a kind of universal orthography went hand-in-hand with ideographic characterizations of Oriental script.<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup> The juxtapositional processes of montage, according to early film theorists like Vachel Lindsay, Sergei Eisenstein, and Jean Mitry are precisely those of the Chinese ideograph.<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> And certainly nothing better evokes what might be called the Architectural School Of The Chinese Parrot than the dozens of polychromatic Oriental Theater palaces built across America in the 1920s and early 1930s. There were Oriental-styled theaters in Chicago, New York, Denver, Milwaukee, Portland, Seattle, Detroit, Boston, and, of course, the most famous and iconic of the Oriental movie palaces, Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood in 1927—which, I would argue, looks like nothing so much as a massive parrot (<a name="3-text" href="#3"> 13</a>).<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> In one of the publicity photos for the opening of the theater, usherettes stand beside the massive black projection machines, dressed in ornate Chinese costumes and headdresses (<a name="4-text" href="#4"> 14</a>). The middle projector is turned on, and the camera seems ready to burst with light from within, mirroring in microcosm the bursting spectacle of light from the theater itself on film premier nights—events that at least one spectator described as "a veritable furnace of energy" (<a name="5-text" href="#5"> 15</a>).<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup></p>

<p>The frequent and self-reflexive turn to Asia in the process of constructing a discourse of the cinema-as-<span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span>, in other words, reflects an ongoing and highly self-conscious response to charges that the reproducibility of cinema be understood solely as a product of capitalist, machine culture. Whereas Adorno would rather unforgivingly characterize the "culture industry" as a means of inducing—in "<span style="font-style:italic;">parrot</span>-fashion"—a kind of social resignation and impotency, the oriental detective emerges as a means of evoking the pleasures and self-reflexive artistry of generic reproducibility.<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup> Thus, the Chinese parrot flies closer to Walter Benjamin's realm in the second version of his magisterial essay "The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility."<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup> Written in 1935, the same year that <span style="font-style:italic;">Charlie Chan in Egypt</span> appeared in theaters, Benjamin admits that the inherent "political advantage" of the cinematic apparatus will remain latent "until film has liberated itself from the fetters [feathers?] of capitalist exploitation."<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup> Just a few paragraphs later, however, Benjamin argues that the "pol[l]ytechnic training" of technological reproducibility has the power to induce a "progressive attitude … characterized by an immediate, intimate fusion of pleasure—pleasure in seeing and experiencing—with an attitude of expert appraisal" . If then, for Benjamin, the "shattering of tradition" in the loss of artistic aura coincides with an "emancipation" of the work of art "from its parasitic subservience to ritual,"<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup> we might argue that the Chinese parrot's refamiliarization of technology (by way of the frequent "shatterings" of glass tubes in film after film) was presented as the celebrated, iterative broadcasting of a new  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> kind of ritual—<span style="font-style:italic;">a tradition of pleasurable "frequencies."</span> In 1938 (coincidentally, again, the very year Mr. Wong would be bowing to Twentieth-Century Fox's Chinese parrot), Benjamin turned his attention to an exhibit of Chinese paintings at the Bibliothéque Nationale, pointing specifically to the recent revelation that very few of the paintings on display had actually come from the earlier, and more celebrated Yuan period (most of the paintings being Ming or Qing-era hand-reproductions): "It seems," he wrote, "that we have been swooning mainly over copies."<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65">65</a></sup> But this swooning over simulacra did not disappoint Benjamin. Rather, the implication is that there is something delicious in this irony, something that allows him to draw a metaphorical line between traditional Chinese art and the liberatory power he found in technological reproduction: "It is from this blending of the fixed and mutable that Chinese painting derives all its meaning. It goes in search of the thought-image."<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66">66</a></sup> If we are going to be parrots, the logic of both Charlie Chan and Walter Benjamin seems to be, then let us be <span style="font-style:italic;">Chinese</span> parrots.</p>
<p>But what I have been arguing here is not simply that the oriental detective film is really only "about" cinema. Nor has it been my intention to redirect attention away from the socio-political consequences of these stereotypical representations of Asians and Asian Americans. On the contrary, Frank Chin's lament that the Chan re has so oppressively overshadowed Asian American self-representation (as he writes, like an unwanted father re that "never dies, never. That Pop waits in the darkness of every theater, in every TV, ever ready to come to light again at the flick of a switch") reminds us that the talkative "parrot" as it appears in the West has only ever been a creature of captivity.<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67">67</a></sup> As Paul Carter points out, "parrots do not imitate other birds in the wild" (<span style="font-style:italic;">P</span>, 8). It is time for us notice, he argues, "not the parrot but the cage through which we look at it" (<span style="font-style:italic;">P</span>, 171). Thus, in cultural discourse surrounding the Chinese Parrot, there is a striking disparity between those who celebrate and those who despise him. This says less about the specific traits of the oriental detective than it does the contradictory aesthetics and sociopolitical inequalities of the cinematic cage. From a rather straightforward historical perspective, for example, we are reminded that Hollywood studios restricted roles and production control in highly racist ways. Lee Tung Foo might have been a fine Charlie Chan, but was not allowed to be an "oriental detective" because he was not white. But of course the problem has never been one of simply controlling one's own stereotypes. The more puzzling dilemma of this simulation cage (or, as Plato would have it, "cave") is that the perceived dangers of mechanical duplicability—stereotype, erasure of individuality, the possibility of forgery—directly coincide with the mimetic faculties that make us human.<sup><a name="f68-text" href="#f68">68</a></sup> As one of the detective's many Chanograms reminds us in <span style="font-style:italic;">Charlie Chan at the Circus</span>, "Even if name signed one million times, no two signatures ever exactly alike." My signature speaks only for me, in other words, when it is something I can repeat a million times, and yet I am supposed to find it reassuring that I can never reproduce it in <span style="font-style:italic;">exactly</span> the same way (even though, in the end, this hardly makes it more difficult to forge a signature).<sup><a name="f69-text" href="#f69">69</a></sup> Perhaps this is why the parrot so fascinates us: it becomes a kind of autograph, reproducing—with exotic flourish—our most basic <span style="font-style:italic;">technê</span>, and yet never fully collapsing the boundaries of the self and the other. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f5" href="#f5-text">5. </a>As Simon Critchley has argued, parrots are "surely the most unnerving of animals because of their uncanny ability to imitate that which is meant to pick us out as a species: language.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f6" href="#f6-text">6. </a>The most impressive case for an argument against the notion of parrots as "mindless mimics" is found in Irene M.

However, as Paul Carter observes, "Pepperberg's experimental situation proves mainly that her experiments work. They work because of a strange untested assumption, which is that Alex [her parrot] will mimic his trainers <span style="font-style:italic;">knowingly</span>, that he will internalize what they do, and identify it with his own desire, in this way learning to behave in a non-mimetic, self-motivated way" .</p></div>

See <span style="font-style:italic;">Andy Warhol, 1928–1987</span> (New York, NY: Prestel Publishing, 1993), 103. The techno-romantic Walt Whitman also saw something beautiful in the mechanical reproducibility of the parrot: "I have probably not been afraid of careless touches from the first—and am not now—nor of parrot-like repetitions—nor of platitudes and the commonplace.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f11" href="#f11-text">11. </a>An in-depth study of "woman and parrot" paintings is well beyond the scope of this essay, but it is worth mentioning a few important contributions merely to demonstrate the historical and geographical breadth of the genre, which begins in earnest in the early 17<sup>th</sup> century and continues on into the present: see paintings by Quiringh Gerritsz van Brekelenkam (1622–1669), Jan Havickszoon Steen (1626–1679), Pieter de Hooch (1629–1684), Frans van Mieris the Elder (1635–1681), Rosalba Carriera (1675–1757), Giovanni Battista Tiepolo (1696–1770), Jean-Honoré Fragonard (1732–1806), Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863), Charles Louis Bazin (1802–1859), Valentine Cameron Prinsep (1838–1904), Paul Cêzanne (1839–1906), Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841–1919), William Sergeant Kendall (1869–1938), Viktor Rafael (1900–1981), Salvador Dalí (1904–1989), Frida Kahlo (1907–1954), and Fernando Botero (b. 1932).

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f13" href="#f13-text">13. </a>As Reed notes, Courbet's own stated goal in <span style="font-style:italic;">Woman with a Parrot</span> was not to "represent the customs, the ideas, the appearance of my own era according to my own ideas," as he had declared in his realist manifesto of 1855; rather, in preparing for this painting, he suddenly foreswore allegiance to realism, producing "a highly readable picture by invoking one of the most potent of narrative lures: erotic fantasy" .</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f36" href="#f36-text">36. </a>Ken Hanke sees the centrality of this "techno-trick" as the unique contribution of director H. Bruce "Lucky" Humberstone, who directed a number of Chan films in the 1930s: "Humberstone was absolutely awestruck by mechanics, inventions, and scientific gadgets on an improbably 'Mr. Wizard' level. All of his Chan outings contain at least one scene where the action stops dead for an enlightening scientific demonstration" <span style="font-style:italic;">Charlie Chan at the Movies</span>, 74. However, although Hanke may be right that Humberstone accelerated the narrative role of these techno-tricks in the Chan genre, he does not seem to notice that they were very consistently present before Humberstone's Chan films, and that they would continue to appear for years after.</p></div>

Many of these films, she argues, "tended to have scenes that marvel at the technology available to police," which eventually became "the focus of the procedural" (90–91).

Critics of detective fiction have argued that detective plots evidence a kind of Althusserian "interpellation" such that a hegemonic encoding of the technocultural regime is inevitably mapped onto readers. Dennis Porter, for instance, sees the detective genre as inherently conservative, "a literature of reassurance and conformism." Dennis Porter, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Pursuit of Crime: Art and Ideology in Detective Fiction</span> (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1981), 220. Franco Moretti has argued that the genre's tendency to isolate guilt serves a similarly conservative purpose: "Detective fiction … exists expressly to dispel the doubt that guilt might be impersonal, and therefore collective and social." Franco Moretti, <span style="font-style:italic;">Signs Taken for Wonders: On the Sociology of Literary Terms</span>. (New York, NY: Verso, 1983), 135. Defenders of the genre, such as Marshall McLuhan, have argued that what is so admirable about the detective re (as opposed to the bureaucratic re of the "cop") is his autonomous "integrity," which McLuhan sees as offering a model for uncovering the hidden mechanisms of the culture industry.

Rewriting the plot as a Moto film, Fox found a reason for Chan's Number One Son, Lee, to be working with Moto (taking a "detective class" from him at the college), and released the film as <span style="font-style:italic;">Mr. Moto's Gamble</span> .

When Monogram purchased the rights to Wiley's "Mr. Wong" series, it was not in fact the first time that Mr. Wong would make it to the screen, as Victory Pictures had been quietly incorporating a "Mr. Wong, San Francisco detective," into their Bela Lugosi vehicle <span style="font-style:italic;">Shadow of Chinatown</span> .

A sixth Mr. Wong film in the series at Monogram, <span style="font-style:italic;">Phantom of Chinatown</span>  starred Keye Luke as the Chinese detective, and is sometimes incorrectly labeled as the only Hollywood film of the period to have an Asian detective played by an Asian actor (In fact, the first three Charlie Chan pictures had Asian actors, and Sessue Hayakawa played a very heroic Chinese detective in Paramount's Fu Manchu film <span style="font-style:italic;">Daughter of the Dragon</span> in 1931).</p></div>

With grand gestures and a distinctly Karloffian trilling of the tongue, the man (played by Leonard Mudie) exclaims, "Sir! To meet a gentleman who apologizes for <span style="font-style:italic;">bumping</span> you in these days is a rare thing indeed. He is either a coward or a gentleman," and then, with a flourish, "I give you credit for the latter." In an over-the-top melodramatic voice, Karlos gives a brief monologue about his great days on the stage, before turning to radio, film, and television, but unfortunately now playing "only the mad monster." "Still," he adds, "it <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> a living." The word "bumping," according to the <span style="font-style:italic;">OED</span>, was widely used in the 1940s to mean "dismiss[ing] someone from a position, or tak[ing] the position of another, especially by exercising the right to displace a less senior member of an organization." Given the fact that Monogram studios had already given up on the Mr. Wong series, and that Twentieth Century-Fox had given up on the Charlie Chan films, Chan had clearly "bumped" his way over to Monogram in a way that would prevent Karloff's Mr. Wong from ever making it back on the screen.</p></div>

As Adorno argues in "How to Look at Television," "Since stereotypes are an indispensable element of the organization and anticipation of experience, preventing us from falling into mental disorganization and chaos, no art can entirely dispense with them.

<p>This article summarizes the early career of Kievborn writer John Cournos, with emphasis on his exposure to the October Revolution and his treatment of its politics and literature, culminating in a long series of reviews of Russian literary periodicals for T. S. Eliot's journal, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Criterion</span>. The purpose of this article is briefly to outline Cournos' background, his entry into the London literary world, and to concentrate mainly on his neglected work in bringing Soviet literary debates to English-language readers in the 1920s and 1930s. The general purpose of this research is to assess the cultural impact of the Russian Revolution on Modernism, especially in the 1920s. Cournos' reviews forg <span style="font-style:italic;">The Criterion</span>, informed by his commitment to Russian letters, show that a detailed account of Soviet literary culture was available to an Anglo-American literary audience. The present work was supported by a Fellowship funded by the Leverhulme Trust.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="body">
<p>John Cournos had been born near Kiev to Russian-speaking parents with the family name Korshoon in 1881.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> His mother emigrated with her children to Philadelphia in 1891 where they were later joined by Cournos' stepfather, a Hasidic Jew. Cournos worked for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Philadelphia Reporter</span>, rising to the status of assistant editor, then in 1912 moved to London to pursue a literary career. In London, a city which he idealized, Cournos introduced himself to literary society by a series of interviews with leading literary res commissioned for American periodicals. His interviewees included Wells, Masefield and Chesterton<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> and were later fictionalized in his autobiographical novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Babel</span> ,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> based principally on his London years.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> Cournos formed friendships with Edward Gordon Craig and John Gould Fletcher, and was also introduced to the circles of Pound, Epstein and Gaudier-Brzeska.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> Cournos testifies to his own modernist credentials with the claim that his response to the singing of a non-conformist family opposite his own Kensington flat was to place a copy of the first issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Blast</span> in the window, a gesture which he claims invariably silenced them.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> Although he aspired to be a novelist, Cournos also produced some poetry—later collected as <span style="font-style:italic;">In Exile</span> —under the influence of the imagist group, and was for a time strongly associated with H.D. and Richard Aldington. His autobiographical novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Miranda Masters</span>  is an undisguised account of his brief affair with H.D. which began at a 1916 retreat in Devon following Aldington's conscription, with H.D. as Miranda Masters—whose fondness for all matters Greek leads her to prefer the name 'Aspasia'– and Aldington as her husband Arnold ('Was Arnold a fool to tire of this beauty which implored violation?'<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup>).</p>
<p>While Cournos was integrating himself with the London literary scene and working on his first autobiographical novel later published as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Mask</span>  he struggled for income and welcomed the request to work as a translator of Russian Government Wireless at the Wireless Press in Marconi House in the Strand. Cournos was motivated by the pay and short working hours which enabled him to work on his novel, although he was excited at the thought of being the first in England to see important and sensitive news, such as the first account of the Kornilov affair.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> The next development came when Cournos was contacted by the novelist Hugh Walpole who was already based in Petrograd where he led the Anglo-Russian Bureau (also known as the British Propaganda Office). The specific role of this Bureau had been to persuade the Russian press to give more favorable reports of British material support for the joint war effort.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> Following the March Revolution, Walpole's mission was expanded. Walpole contacted Cournos at the end of August or early October 1917 and invited him to the Foreign Office, where he was invited to join the 'Anglo-Russian Commission to Petrograd.'<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> Walpole's novels <span style="font-style:italic;">The Dark Forest</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret City</span>  draw on his Russian experiences. Aside from Walpole, Cournos names two other members of this commission, Harold Williams, the Russian correspondent of the <span style="font-style:italic;">London Chronicle</span> and later foreign editor of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Times</span>, who had lived in Russia for many years, had numerous Russian political contacts, and was a chief source of information for the British Government.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> Cournos also mentions Philip Dukes, who he identifies only as a former assistant to the pro-Russian British conductor, Albert Coates. Coates himself is a remarkable re. Of mixed English and Russian parentage, he had been born in St. Petersburg, conducted at the Mariinsky Theatre, and initially supported the revolution, conducting concerts in Petrograd in October 1917. Yet Philip Dukes was no mere conductor's assistant, as Cournos might well have known when he authored his autobiography. Dukes was a famous spy, knighted for his role in the Revolution in 1924. His activities as a British Secret Service Agent are documented in <span style="font-style:italic;">Red Dusk and the Morrow: Adventures and Investigations in Red Russia</span> , later amplified in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Story of 'ST 25': Adventure and Romance in the Secret Intelligence Service in Red Russia</span> . Cournos shows little awareness of the intelligence role of the commission, perhaps because in the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> context of an autobiography designed to write himself into literary history he prefers to downplay the political dimension of his career. One slight sign that he is aware of the intelligence context is a reference to meeting Colonel Thornhill, head of British intelligence in Russia (although Cournos does not mention this fact) and who, Cournos indicates, is mentioned in Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart's <span style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs of a British Agent</span> , which was a best seller when first published, though Lockhart was a diplomat, not a secret agent. Cournos is instead concerned to emphasize his literary connections. He worked with Korney Chukovsky, at that time the literary critic and Russian translator of Whitman and not yet the famous children's author, with whom he wrote occasional articles for the Petrograd press, some 'critical' some 'purely journalistic'.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> He also met Fyodor Sologub, whose work he had already translated into English.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> In his <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span>, Cournos is keen to document the responses of these writers to the Revolution, although he apparently did not do so at the time.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Sologub was one of the many intellectuals who for years had been preaching revolution, but could not accept it in the form in which it came. A decadent and a symbolist, Bolshevism horrified him. [ … ]</p>
<p>I remember the excitement among the intellectuals when Alexander Blok flung a bombshell with an article in a newspaper asserting that this was the revolution they had been working for [ … ]. He was alone among the great writers of the day to take this stand, and was regarded by the others as a traitor.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Cournos seems to penetrate no further into questions of literary politics than these few remarks.</p>
<p>Cournos did not stay long in Russia once the October Revolution had begun, claiming in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span> that his stay there no longer had a purpose, and escaping via Murmansk in an adventure that is given more narrative space in that book than the Revolution itself. Following a period with the Ministry of Information which ended in 1920, and of which he left little account, Cournos resumed life as an independent man of letters. Cournos' fiction and poetry draw very little indeed on his experience of the Revolution, but he did prepare a short text, published as a propaganda pamphlet in 1919 by the Russian Liberation Committee,<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> called <span style="font-style:italic;">London Under the Bolsheviks: A Londoner's Dream on Returning from Petrograd</span>.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> The Russian Liberation Committee was a very active anti-Bolshevik exile organization which in 1919–20 issued a series of pamphlets and bulletins, as well as a weekly, <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Russia</span>.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> The Committee had been founded by the exiled historian Mikhail Ivanovich Rostovtzev in January/February of 1919 and was very well funded.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> The executive was mainly Russian but included Harold Williams, who Cournos knew from the Anglo-Russian Commission. Rostovtzev's own contribution to the pamphlet series was <span style="font-style:italic;">Proletarian Culture</span> [probably 1919] which dealt with the Proletkult of Lunacharsky (his nephew), while Williams contributed <span style="font-style:italic;">The Spirit of the Russian Revolution</span> [probably 1919]. Other contributors included the author Leonid Andreiev and the historian and founder of the Constitutional Democratic Party, P.N. Miliukov.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> The tone of the series was set by the first  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> volume, L. V. Shklovsky's <span style="font-style:italic;">Russia Under the Bolsheviks</span>, which was introduced by Harold Williams. Shklovsky was an ethnographer whose work had appeared in English as <span style="font-style:italic;">In Far North Siberia</span> . He had settled in England as correspondent of the Moscow daily, <span style="font-style:italic;">Russkiya Vyedomosti</span> and as 'Dioneo' had been part of Williams' project of placing articles on British democracy in the Russian press. Shklovsky points out that many former opponents of Tsarist autocracy, including authors known in Britain, are now opposed to the Bolsheviks, and strongly rebuts the tendency of some British Labour and Trades Union commentators to idealize Bolshevik Russia as an industrial paradise by quoting res showing falling production and emphasizing the difference in material comforts between the Bolsheviks themselves and the starving populace.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>Cournos' <span style="font-style:italic;">London Under the Bolsheviks</span> is of a piece with these other publications in terms of its hostility to Bolshevism, but differs in its subjective and literary nature. The inside front cover carries an advertisement inviting those 'interested in the overthrow of Bolshevism' and who 'want to help save civilization from the menace of anarchy' to contact the Committee at their Fleet Street address.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> Eschewing facts and arguments, Cournos recounts a 'dream' in which experiences and impressions from Petrograd are relocated in an imaginary London. Some of these impressions are recapitulated in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span>, but some of the more dramatic incidents are absent, perhaps because Cournos did not actually witness them himself. In the dream, Cournos returns from abroad to a London which has been taken over by Bolsheviks, and wanders the streets observing the descent into poverty and anarchy, seeking explanations for what he sees from people he encounters by chance. In this London, the deposed Kerensky is (Ramsay) Macdonald, whose government, the dreamer is told, 'were bad enough, well-intentioned but weak.' Macdonald's rule has been ended by MacLenin and Trotsman; counter-revolutionaries, who include Viscount Grey, Asquith and Lloyd George along with H. G. Wells, are confined to the Tower and likely to be executed; the 'comrades', who are drunk on wine from ransacked wine-cellars, drive down the Strand in a 'tank', shooting at random, 'to give people a scare and show them who's boss of the town.'<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> Recalling the weight given to the famous incident in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Secret Agent</span>, the dreamer moves to the Embankment where a horse is being barbarously beaten. Such a beating would not have been permitted in the old days, comment bystanders, but the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals have been disbanded as 'counter-revolutionaries.' Matters escalate from this very English period concern with animal welfare when the dreamer moves to Westminster Bridge and witnesses the summary execution of a thief by a mob, an incident which testifies to the absence of law and policing. The dreamer then witnesses a moment in the London equivalent of the October Revolution, as an unarmed crowd demonstrating support for the elected Popular Assembly is dispersed by armed guards. Once again a bystander provides the narrative:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The Popular Assembly was to meet today in the old House of Commons [ … ] but the Bolshevik Red Guards, representing a mere minority consisting mostly of the worse elements, have got orders from MacLenin and Trotsman to keep the Assembly from meeting at all costs. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The bystander explains that the Bolsheviks attract only 'criminals and rowdies' whose 'one object in life is to live without working'.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> The despairing dreamer seeks out an old literary acquaintance at the Karl Marx Flats (formerly the Queen Alexandra Chambers) who he finds reduced to penury and in daily fear of the arrival of the 'comrades'. This once respected writer comments: 'They can only shoot me [ … ] but they cannot <span style="font-style:italic;">confiscate</span> my intellect.' As the narrative closes the dreamer himself is arrested and, at the point of execution, awakes.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>If the tone and setting of Cournos' short fiction owes a little to Wells' vision of refugees arriving in central London in <span style="font-style:italic;">The War of the Worlds</span>, it should nevertheless not be mistaken for any kind of lost prototype for <span style="font-style:italic;">1984</span>. The attempt to present the street-level reality of the Revolution by transferring it to London is well conceived according to its straightforward agenda, and the narrative might be thought to achieve something that dry statistics and tendentious political claims cannot. The tendentiousness is there, though, even if Cournos does not express any plain interest in the politics of the situation, but is among the first to present Russian politics in terms of the absurd, an approach more strongly taken up, and from a quite different perspective, by William Gerhardie in <span style="font-style:italic;">Futility</span> .</p>
<p>In subsequent work Cournos makes little use of his 1917 experience. His collection of poetry, <span style="font-style:italic;">In Exile</span>  assembles poems written between 1915 and 1920, including a handful attributed to this period of his life.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> 'Home-Coming', subtitled 'Petrograd—November 1917', is the most politically explicit. 'I hoped to see my childhood home,' but 'Terror opened the door to me' in the person of an 'old hag' who has replaced the 'mother' that the poet hoped would welcome him to the 'house'. The metaphor of the 'house' and 'hag' is sustained to the end of the poem, further reference to the Revolution taking the form of scowling servants who 'eyed me with an evil look' and 'envied my stranger's clothes', an allusion to incidents in 1917 Petrograd of the well-dressed being robbed of their clothes.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> In presenting his personal experience through the shallow metaphors of the 'home', 'mother' and Terror as 'hag', Cournos fails to leave any impression in this poem. Even the story of a friend whose clothes were stolen, which vividly particularizes the feeling of anarchy, is pushed into the background here and its potential impact squandered. Other poems from this group focus on the poet's feeling for London. Plainly worded in the then modern manner, none do much with the Russian setting. 'London: The Call' (located Petrograd, December 1917) praises London and concludes: 'Today I stretch out my arms to you from Petrograd.' 'London: A Memory', written at the same time, concludes: 'Even your darkest fogs I love better/Than sunlight in this strange and sinister city.' Attempting to return to London from Murmansk, the potential for striking narrative (as presented later in <span style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span>) is unrealized in 'Arctic Circle: Stranded' (located Murman[sk], March 1918) as Cournos prefers again a general feeling of nostalgia and weakly deploys the re of himself as a returning Odysseus.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">In Exile</span> is a disappointing volume, and not only from the point of view of its use of the Revolution. In style it imitates, variously, the free verse of Aldington, H.D. and Pound without achieving much in the way either of imagistic impact or sophisticated,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> laconic irony. A longer sequence, 'My Companion', might have been a model for Nancy Cunard's <span style="font-style:italic;">Parallax</span> , but the idiom remains prosaic and the poem's contemplation of its own failure is its most memorable moment:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>How pleasant it would be, I thought,<br>To put down<br>What I saw and felt and heard<br>In a poem, picture or song.<br>Why not add a tome or two<br>Of 'human documents'<br>To that most venerable institution<br>Museum Brittanicum<br>Which has forty-five miles of books—<br>According to the guide—<br>So they cannot mind<br>Another six or seven inches<br>All toned down to grey<br>Under a coat of dust<br>As thickly as the rest?<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">These lines, which the present researcher found in the very copy which Cournos donated to the British Library, attempts to assert an ironic control over the marginality of literature as conceived according to the aesthetic model, by acknowledging a future, 'Ozymandias'-like perspective, in which the poem will indeed become a mere 'document' at the British Museum, a fate which the author secured with his donation.</p>
<p>Cournos, then, showed neither the desire nor the ability to exploit his short exposure to the Russian Revolution. His plain intention in his novels, autobiography, and single volume of poetry is to establish himself as a literary re. Even <span style="font-style:italic;">London Under the Bolsheviks</span>, while it makes the author's political sentiments absolutely plain, does not manifest a strong engagement with political matters and survives now as merely the least transient residue of a three year involvement in intelligence and propaganda work. Cournos' reviews of Russian Periodicals in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Criterion</span>, then, should be read against this background. These reviews began in 1926 and continued (though not in every issue) until January 1938, appearing at first signed simply J.C. Rather than pushing an anti-Soviet agenda, which would have been consistent with the tendency of several writers in the journal, Cournos adopts a stance of even-handed, reasonable skepticism towards the politics of both Reds and Whites, and concentrates on questions of literary interest and merit. In terms of the balance of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Criterion</span>, this makes Cournos an already wise choice. More than this, Cournos also demonstrated real coherence in his attempt to value literature above politics by concentrating on questions of literary value rather than political and literary ideology, at a time when few Russian writers, whether in exile or at home, could have felt other than strongly constrained by political imperatives. Cournos' rhetorical strategy in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Criterion</span> may have represented a conscious account on his part to distance himself from the predominantly anti-Soviet stance of that journal, but more than that his approach could have been construed as  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> quite visionary. In a general climate and in a particular journal that frequently valued cultural commentary over literary criticism, Cournos' reviews attempt not simply to transmit elements of the most current Russian literary activity to an English-speaking audience, but also to set up a framework of judgment and perhaps intervene in the longer term reception of Russian writers. The map of small-journal culture which Cournos describes goes well beyond what any non-Russian reader could possibly know; unlike, say, the situation with French literature, where a non-native French speaker might look for guidance as to what to tackle next, Russian-language literature was not within the purview of the averagely-educated literary reader at that time and Cournos' assiduity in presenting the unpresentable is quite notable. There may be an irony here too that <span style="font-style:italic;">The Criterion</span> attempted no similar overview of British literature and indeed found very little poetry, in particular, worthy of publication.</p>
<p>In early 1928 Cournos tackled a range of Soviet periodicals. The opening of his review is even-handed:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The Soviet periodicals show considerable vigour; on the whole, more than their <span style="font-style:italic;">émigré</span> contemporaries. This vigour is sometimes misdirected; but, then, so is that of the exiles. The political bias which characterizes either camp is too often reflected in their writings. [However] vigour, if that be a virtue, does, undoubtedly, belong to those who have stayed at home and have drawn into their bones the sap of the native soil.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Trotsky makes a similar point in <span style="font-style:italic;">Literature and Revolution</span>, although his attitude to the exiles is more dismissive. Cournos reviews the two main Soviet literary periodicals, <span style="font-style:italic;">Novy Mir</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">The New World</span>) and <span style="font-style:italic;">Krasnaya Nov</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Red News</span>). His main task is to identify the new 'big names' although he acknowledges they 'can hardly have any meaning for English readers.' Boris Pasternak's epic poem 'Lieutenant Schmidt' earns him first place in Cournos' list as 'a poet of real gifts'. Known much later in the West for <span style="font-style:italic;">Doctor Zhivago</span>, Pasternak is still thought of in Russia principally as a poet. It is a pity that Cournos discusses 'Lieutenant Schmidt' no further, as its presentation of the leader of the 1905 naval mutiny celebrated in Soviet mythology is an artful combination of documentary sources with sophisticated literary complication of official notions of revolutionary heroism—even though the poem was framed by Pasternak as part of an attempt to habilitate his modernist poetics with the 'masses.'<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> Among authors who might be known to English readers Cournos lists Alexey Tolstoy, Veresayev and 'that superb artist, Sergeyev Tzensky.' Keen to distinguish literary merit from external political accident, Cournos explains that the hero of Tzensky's short story, 'Living Water', 'is a Bolshevik only by courtesy' and could as easily be a White Guard as a Red. Isaac Babel is identified as 'the greatest of all creative Soviet writers', even though he is not represented in these journals other than by a critical appraisal. He wryly notes that the Soviet review of Babel has nothing in common with what Cournos calls 'Western' critical priorities: the reviewer 'is rather too anxious to show how Babel has advanced from a bourgeois-romantic position; what would interest a Western critic is that Babel began with pure art and that he is still a pure artist.'<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> Cournos would repeat this evaluation  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of Babel in his Foreword to <span style="font-style:italic;">Short Stories out of Soviet Russia</span> , a collection which he edited and translated.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup></p>
<p>Cournos' review of Soviet periodicals also begins to give a flavor of Soviet literary and cultural criticism. Trotsky's 'Culture and Socialism' began as a speech made in Moscow in February of 1926 that subsequently appeared in essay form first in <span style="font-style:italic;">Krasnaya Nov</span> and subsequently in <span style="font-style:italic;">Novy Mir</span>.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> In 1928, three years after the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Literature and Revolution</span>, Trotsky's views on culture are not necessarily a novelty. Cournos presents Trotsky's view that, in Trotsky's own words, 'culture is an outgrowth of the struggle of man with nature for existence' and that 'as for religion, we shall sweep it away completely.' Cournos does not go to the effort of a lengthy engagement with Trotsky's views but points out simply that Trotsky does not answer the 'plausible charge that Marxism itself is a kind of religion.'<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> Cournos is content to summarize, identifying interesting features, such as the engagement with the East which, he suggests, is conditioned by the political situation (that is, by the Chinese Revolution and the desire to export revolution to the East), as manifested by articles on Chinese theatre and Afghan poetry. Cournos is amused by comment on Sinclair Lewis, whose work had been translated into Russian and is mentioned in <span style="font-style:italic;">Literature and Revolution</span>. Lewis is treated 'as though he were all but Shakespeare' and problems of style are assumed to stem from the translator. Looking across to the Paris based exile journal, <span style="font-style:italic;">Sovremenniya Zapiski</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">Annales Contemporaines</span>), Cournos lights on discussion of Biely's <span style="font-style:italic;">Petersburg</span> (which he much later translated) and Zamyatin's <span style="font-style:italic;">We</span>, only then being serialized in Russia but which, he points out, had already been translated into English.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> Prominence is given to Nicolai Berdyaev's views on the Christianization of Russia as a positive effect of the Revolution which has freed Christianity by separating church and state, and found a new appeal among the <span style="font-style:italic;">intelligentsia</span>. Cournos reports Berdyaev's views neutrally, even though it might have been logical to set them in the context of other currents in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Criterion</span>.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup></p>
<p>While Cournos continues to affirm the autonomy of art, he takes care to report on the politicized literary-critical situation in relative depth. The April 1930 issue contains what might be the earliest English-language discussion of Mikhail Bakhtin, with reference to an article by Anatoly Lunacharsky, at that time the Soviet Commissar of Enlightenment and one of the editors of <span style="font-style:italic;">Novy Mir</span>, on <span style="font-style:italic;">The Problem of Dostoevsky's Creativeness</span>, titled 'The Many-voicedness of Dostoevsky'. Cournos summarizes the concepts of 'many-voicedness' and the 'polyphonic novel' in Bakhtin's work fairly and briefly. Cournos is more interested in what he regards as the political exaggeration in Lunacharsky's appropriation of Bakhtin as 'the most superb recorder of the multiple-voiced chaos created by the capitalist régime' and by Lunacharsky's flat contradiction of Bakhtin's theory of the novel with the claim that Shakespeare too embodied a similar 'many-voicedness', this time presenting, in Lunacharsky's words, the 'vari-coloured Renaissance, shattered into a multitude of gleaming remnants.' While we might note that Lunacharsky confronts Bakhtin over periodization and genre (Bakhtin ignores the polyphonic potential of drama in his modeling of the transition from the univocal poem to the polyphonic novel) Cournos intrudes his own reflections on what he takes  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to be the politics of this essay: '"Many-voicedness" comes from a many-voiced social order, and we have no doubt that Lunatcharsky would be delighted to hear only one voice, and that of the Communist.' Yet, Cournos goes on, the situation in Russian literary circles remains a 'many-voiced conflict', citing 'recent attacks on Pilniak and Zamyatin' and 'the symposium in the periodical, <span style="font-style:italic;">Petchat and Revolutzia</span> on whether a writer has a right to express himself in any manner he sees fit, without interference from political dictatorship.'<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>In January 1931 politics becomes the dominant topic of Cournos' review of <span style="font-style:italic;">Oktiabr</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">October</span>) where the RAPP (the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers) has launched an attack on the critic V. F. Pereverzev. 'The "literary front" in Russia is showing signs of great activity in every "sector".' Cournos cites the vocabulary of the RAPP which reflects the fashion for glorifying civilian activities by applying to them the military vocabulary of the revolution. Cournos identifies other terms now current in this militarization of literary struggle: 'the enemy within the camp'; 'mobilization'; 'the shock battalions of the cultural revolution'; the attack on 'individualism' and 'the cult of personality'. The RAPP demands more proletarian writers narrating the life of the factory, and claims that critics who are saturated with 'the notions of the gentry' are to blame. Hence the attack on Pereverzev's approach which Cournos describes in some detail. Pereverzev identifies himself with socialist criticism but defends the notion of the autonomy of the artwork; RAPP argues for the 'Bolshevization of criticism.' Cournos also reports the unsympathetic attitude of RAPP commentators on the suicide of Mayakovsky, whose conduct they regard as 'faint-hearted'. Turning to <span style="font-style:italic;">Zvedzda</span> (The Star), Cournos addresses literary matters—Gorky's novel <span style="font-style:italic;">The Life of Klim Samgin</span> now in its third volume, with one volume already published in English, before again being draw to literary polemics, this time with reference to attacks on Zamyatin, Pilniak, Tzensky, Nikitin and Vsevolod Ivanov. The most interesting find in this journal though are despairing notes from the Diary of Alexander Blok dated from 1915 and 1916. Although Cournos does not say so, these are dates at which the expression of despair rather than revolutionary enthusiasm is permissible. <span style="font-style:italic;">Krasnaya Nov</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Red News</span>), another Moscow journal, again has items of literary interest, but once again there is polemic, this time more against Pereverzev. Cournos notes that Pereverzev is condemned for his 'Menshevism' and 'objectivity', despite noting dryly that Plekhanov, still the scion of Soviet literary criticism, had been a Menshevik. Although Cournos reports extensively the Communist attack on Pereverzev's claim that literature cannot be subordinated to politics, he does so adopting a rhetoric which sees 'Communist' and 'Western' imperatives as quite distinct. While he does find 'coercion' in the Communist approach, and notes that 'criticism in Soviet Russia takes unity for granted', he does not begin to register the dismay which the unfolding situation at the end of the 1920s might be held to warrant.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup></p>
<p>In April 1932 the focus on politics in Cournos' account of these journals is dominant. While continuing to identify and praise 'gifted young writers' Cournos warns that Communist demands on art threaten these talents—'propaganda is what will kill the goose that lays the golden egg.' . Pasternak is again singled out for praise—'he is  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> incapable of writing badly either in poetry or prose'  and 'goes his own way, keeping equally clear of politics and the machine'—while Gorky's attacks on Dostoevsky's politics are singled out for censure—a 'live ass kicking the dead lion.'  Describing an account by Metcheriakov of the life of the future in which villages and towns will be replaced by socialist collective facilities and a population that changes location and occupation frequently, Cournos notes the influence on this thinking of Fourier and Owen, but rejects a comparison of Russian and English society: 'The Russian people is gregarious, and such an experiment may succeed there; but whether an Englishman, whose "home is his castle", would agree to live in this hive-like habitation for the sake of communing with his fellow-beings is open to grave doubt.'  Cournos admits that Russian experiments force the comparison with England or 'the West' but continues to find Russia ethnically and politically different. A new and intriguing element in this review is Cournos' account of reports in Russian periodicals of literary sympathizers of the Soviet State. Bernard Shaw, according to <span style="font-style:italic;">Krasnaya Nov</span>, is 'not at all an authentic revolutionary, or an authentic Socialist, or an authentic enemy of the bourgeois order.' Shaw is encouraged to re-examine his past and commit to the revolution. The 'spectacle of Shaw's new friends talking to him like so many Dutch uncles I find more exhilaratingly amusing than anything Shaw has ever concocted for the stage,' Cournos notes, 'and no longer can he pat himself on the back from having been a Communist all along.' (568,9) Another Moscow journal, <span style="font-style:italic;">Projector</span>, has an interview of H. G. Wells with Lunacharsky. Alongside indiscreet remarks about John Galsworthy, Cournos quotes at length Wells' defense of art as propaganda, and his claim that 'essentially, I've never done anything else.'  An aspect of U.S. cultural relations with the Soviet State is seen in an article by Albert Rhys Williams for <span style="font-style:italic;">Novy Mir</span>. Cournos does not explain that Williams was a pro-Communist who had visited Russia early in the Revolution where he was joined by John Reed and Louise Bryant, had worked for Trotsky and was friendly with Lenin. Williams' <span style="font-style:italic;">Through the Russian Revolution</span> had been published in Britain in 1923, and his <span style="font-style:italic;">The Russian Land</span> in 1929<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup>, his short pamphlet <span style="font-style:italic;">76 Questions and Answers on the Bolsheviks and the Soviets</span> was sold in the U.S. for ten cents and is said to have sold two million copies,<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> and it may also be that he needed no introduction to a British readership. Cournos quotes extensively but without comment from Williams' account of his later visit to collective farms with an investigative group from the U.S. Senate, right down to Williams' conclusion that 'You feel that Bolshevism must conquer and all opposition is useless'. The party of Senators 'all expressed themselves in favour of the recognition of the Soviet Union.' </p>
<p>The political focus which has become uppermost in Cournos' cultural reviews is reflected by his reviewing a selection of recent books about the Soviet Union in 1933 and 1934.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> His article 'Myth in the Making' appears in the main pages of the January 1934 edition and confirms his topic of the socialization of culture in an examination of the mythification of Lenin and the rapid creation of 'an immense volume of songs, legends and tales widely circulating among the toiling masses of the Soviet East.'<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> There is an 'immense unwritten literature' in many of the languages of the Soviet Union which is in part being collated by historians of folklore. Cournos' source this time is  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> an issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Voks</span>, the journal of the Soviet Union Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. However his aim here is to present this as an interesting cultural phenomenon from the margins, not an example of the centralized, propagandistic use of literature, and his introduction to the piece is an attempted clarification of the Soviet rejection of 'art for art's sake' which explains that politics in the Soviet Union is a question of the 'whole mode of life' and 'unity of human interests', not a matter of party political partisanship.  So even as he reports the Central Committee's decision 'to merge all the existing literary organizations into one powerful union', Cournos attempts to challenge 'the judgement we have formed of Soviet art as a weapon of propaganda.' </p>
<p>By 1934 Cournos' reviews of periodicals are addressed to an audience that is increasingly aware of the politics of the Soviet Union, and offer a detailed account of Soviet artistic organization. The April 1934 review includes an extensive account of the manifesto in <span style="font-style:italic;">Oktiabr</span> which called for the creation of 'socialist realism' and the celebration of the worker as the 'hero' of fiction. Cournos adds his own commentary, explaining that he has read some of the works in question and finds that of the politically condemned 'backsliders' to have more merit than the laborious novel of labor. The positive line required of such literature draws from Cournos the concluding remark: 'this deliberate erasure of history surely serves neither truth nor art.'  The review of <span style="font-style:italic;">Krasnaya Nov</span> describes conferences organized as part of the second Five Year Plan between writers, artists, workers and farmers, designed to create a 'new intelligentzia', with the principal aim of acculturating the workers, and the secondary goal of bringing writers into contact with the Soviet 'heroes' they are meant to depict. The aim and form of some of these exercises, if not the textual outcomes, find parallels with the British Mass Observation movement and other examples of proletarian fact finding. However, here the intent is to introduce rather than record 'culture', and Cournos claims that the workers turn out to be more intelligent than the writers, with broader literary interests than those of their mentors, a preference for Russian literary classics, and a low opinion of the official 'heroic' literature.</p>
<p>The rhetoric of Cournos' commentaries could be seen as one of merely affected neutrality, but is perhaps better interpreted as an attempt to maintain openness despite strong skepticism. Certainly by 1934 Cournos' judgment on the Soviet situation is plain, as his review of Malcolm Muggeridge's account of his eight months as Moscow correspondent of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Manchester Guardian</span> makes clear: '<span style="font-style:italic;">Winter in Moscow</span> is the most savage indictment of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat I have yet read, and I should say the most honest one, and it must provoke savage indignation in every honest man.' Cournos considers Muggeridge's strength to be his 'sense of humour', a quality possessed by 'two few' of the stream of foreign visitors to the Soviet Union, that 'enables him to evaluate Bolshevik reality in terms of absurdity.'<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> This idea of the combination of humor and sense of the absurd might well have been characterized as 'British' by Cournos, but he does not do so, though he contrasts it with the attitude of the numerous American's conducting the 'pilgrimage' to the Soviet Union. Cournos clearly prefers the exposure of absurdity and of a certain kind of wrong-doing to the ideological positioning of fascist anti-Communism. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Cournos' 'Russian Chronicle: Soviet Russia and the Literature of Ideas' is not the usual periodical round-up but instead appears in the main pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Criterion</span>.<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> It is a nuanced and detailed piece in which Cournos is able to draw on the knowledge his readers might be assumed to have gathered from his own accounts, as well as the growing general knowledge of the Soviet state in 1935. According to Cournos the Golden Age of Russian literature has ended with the 'physical death of Dostoevsky in 1881 and the creative death of Tolstoy about the same time.'  The 'social direction' of Russian literature began with Belinsky who 'played the role of John the Baptist to Plekhanov'. The influence of the 'army of Belinskys' now dominating Soviet literary criticism has now begun to move abroad—Cournos cites the example of Granville Hicks in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Great Tradition</span> and V F. Calverton. (285, 290) Social ideas have 'driven out art' and all that remains is 'the formula of social reform'.  This much is consistent with the tenor of Cournos' reviews, but the remainder of the article draws on his close knowledge of the Soviet literary scene to explain that the artistic poverty of Soviet literature has now begun to cause lively debate within the Soviet critical establishment. Cournos rehearses his opinion that the best writers since the revolution, such as Babel and Pasternak belong to older traditions, and uses the conclusion of his article to praise Andrey Biely's <span style="font-style:italic;">Petersburg</span> as 'the greatest novel since Tolstoy and Dostoevsky' which, Cournos notes, has been compared to <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> although Biely's novel appeared first. As a novel presenting a philosophy of Russian history through imaginative means, <span style="font-style:italic;">Petersburg</span> avoids the extra-narrative intrusions and lack of artistic integration found in Wells. (290–1) A pity then that <span style="font-style:italic;">Petersburg</span> had to wait until 1959 for its first English translation—by John Cournos.</p>
<p>The periodical reviews in the remaining years of existence of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Criterion</span> document further developments in Soviet debate, include a cameo for G. Lukitch (Georg Lukács) writing in <span style="font-style:italic;">Literaturny Kritik</span>, brief comment on D.S. Mirsky—'formerly Prince, now <span style="font-style:italic;">tovaristch</span>'—who has now returned to Russia and writes in Soviet literary journals, and mention in passing the partial translation of and commentary on <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> It is only the final installment of January 1938 which sounds a more somber note among familiar themes.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> By now the Trotskyite trials have come to public attention; Trotsky's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Revolution Betrayed and I Stake My Life</span> had been published in London by Faber in 1937; in general the situation within Stalinist Russia had become better known in Britain. Now, really for the first time in Cournos' reviews, the element of menace surrounding literary-critical debate is brought into focus, albeit still through an optic of humor and irony: 'A Soviet litterateur easily runs the risk of being dubbed a 'Trotskyist-Fascist' bandit [ … ] and if he doesn't behave in a proper Stalinist fashion there are still worse things in store for him.'  This is Cournos' first mention of 'Stalinism', and he does not give examples of what might be in store for uncooperative writers. However he goes on to show how the attack on 'Trotskyism' has come to dominate literary periodicals such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Literaturny Kritik</span> which had hitherto 'made some effort to produce efficient criticism within such limitations as Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism afforded.' Now the same journal hosts an article proclaiming that 'the struggle with Trotskyism in literature has been the one inevitable consequence of the development  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of Soviet literature' and complaining that 'there are fragments of Trotskyism in our literature to this day.' The governing claim of <span style="font-style:italic;">Literaturny Kritik</span>'s leading article is that 'Trotsky in literature has preached his liquidatorial, Menshevistic theory that the proletariat cannot create its own culture and literature.'  <span style="font-style:italic;">Novy Mir</span>, keen to disassociate itself from Trotskyism, fields a similar piece, condemning 'the foul Trotskyist bandits, who have always shown a particular interest in literary affairs.' In a clarifying detail, Cournos observes that former contributor to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Criterion</span>, 'ex-Prince Mirsky' is one of a large number of authors singled out by name for condemnation in <span style="font-style:italic;">Novy Mir</span>. Mirsky had criticized the quality of writing of Fadeyev, a writer favored for his proletarian stance, applying 'Western standards' with, Cournos believes, 'inevitable' results.  Contrasted with 'the Trotskyist, Zinovievist and Bukharinist bandits' is the work of Maxim Gorky, whose death in 1936 has set the seal on his elevation as the ideal proletarian writer. Cournos furnishes numerous examples of the rhetoric which now rules Soviet criticism. His piece breaks off in suspension points midway through a quotation from yet another bad piece of Soviet criticism with the words 'But why go on? It is altogether too sad a business.'  Following the turn documented in the 1937 issues of these journals he has surveyed here these are fitting words.</p>
<p>Cournos had the literary career he had wished for, even if his critically well-received fiction did not secure him the eminence he would have wished for. His literary background, linguistic ability, his important if limited direct knowledge of the Russian Revolution, and his continuing keen interest in Russian letters even though he had opted for the English literary scene, were all factors which made him ideally placed to mediate the world of Soviet letters in the pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Criterion</span>. Avoiding propagandistic or ideological anti-communism, at the same time that he was not open to propagandistic influences emanating from the Soviet Union which had drawn in so many influential writers, Cournos lucidly portrays the world of Russian writing as the <span style="font-style:italic;">émigré</span> scene loses interest and the Soviet succumbs to direct political control. It is hard to know whether these pages in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Criterion</span> were much read, although as the 1930s progressed it is increasingly apparent what the potential value of Cournos' accounts might have been to both pro-and anti-Soviet readers. Perhaps his pioneering translation of <span style="font-style:italic;">Petersburg</span> is Cournos' most important legacy, while his fiction is of interest now mainly to specialists, but these infrequently-noted <span style="font-style:italic;">Criterion</span> reviews, patient, detailed and revealing, constitute a vital thread in the cultural-political discourse of the later 1920s and 1930s.</p>

<p>When Alexandra Kollontai addressed the First National Congress of Women Workers in November of 1918, she used the story of Cinderella to add some punch to her remarks. As Elizabeth A. Wood recounts, the famous feminist revolutionary "painted a vivid picture of women's suffering under capitalism, telling her listeners that they were like Cinderella waiting for a liberator prince who would show up in a golden carriage. `But comrades, we are done with princes, and the golden carriages have all been expropriated. Your liberator is the worker, but he doesn't have anything.'" Arguing that women were themselves needed as "builders of a new, more just, more perfect Communist order," Kollontai called for the end of traditional "forms of marriage, of housework, and of motherhood."<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> Her speech offers a pointed contrast to the radical women's labor culture that emerged at roughly at the same time in the United States. Young Italian and East European Jewish immigrants in the garment industry played a leading role in developing this culture, which wove a love of fashion, romance-adventure fiction and Hollywood film into a distinctive form of labor militancy. Anchored in the Cinderella plot of their favorite dime novels, where "marriage to the wealthy hero" stood as "the ultimate reward" for a working girl's fearless clashes with adversity, this culture inspired the famous New York City shirtwaist strike of 1909–10 and went on to yield a series of historic victories in the teens.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> But it also cast marriage and stay-at-home mothering as the proper reward for work-place activism in one's youth.</p>
<p>During the same period, the AFL focused its own t on securing a "living wage" (later called a "family wage") for its  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> white male workers.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> The strike culture that working girls created allowed women to assert new forms of leadership and independence on the job but it endorsed, rather than challenged, Hollywood's and the AFL's preferred `happy ending' for women under capitalism. Meanwhile, in Russia that same happy ending was being tossed out with the golden carriage. Following passage of the revolutionary Family Code of 1918, the state began setting up trial communal kitchens and nurseries in urban centers. In 1920, Kollontai began a two-year stint as the Director of Zhenotdel, which oversaw women's revolutionary activities, and used her position to promote a model of socialist marriage in which "the public upbringing of children" secured the right of both working parents to sexual and creative self-fulfillment. In the same years, prominent members of the Russian avant-garde began to redesign common household articles such as beds, cookware and clothing as part of the larger societal effort to create a <span style="font-style:italic;">novyi byt</span>, or new everyday life.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>In this essay, I argue for the need to read Anzia Yezierska's domestic novels of the 1920s in this double context. Uniformly set on the Lower East Side, all three novels—<span style="font-style:italic;">Salome of the Tenements</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">Bread Givers</span> , and <span style="font-style:italic;">Arrogant Beggar</span> —rework the Cinderella plot central to working girls' labor culture along lines that resonate strongly with the revolutionary ideals of Kollontai and other Russian intellectuals. When read in conjunction with one another, the novels present a new neighborhood ideal, one in which working-class women re-assign various forms of domestic labor to the public sphere in order to escape age-old oppression and enrich the common lot.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> Reading Yezierska's major fiction in this way not only sheds new light on the novels themselves; it also resolves troubling inconsistencies in her reputation as a writer and forces us to question long-sanctioned critical arguments about the avant-garde and its radical relationship to modernism and mass culture.</p>
<p>As critics love to recount, Yezierska herself enjoyed brief fame as a "Sweatshop Cinderella" when she received a Goldwyn contract in 1921 to adapt her story collection, <span style="font-style:italic;">Hungry Hearts</span>, to the screen. But she later sank into obscurity. Feminists revived her work in the 1970s. Since then, scholars reading along lines of gender and ethnicity have regularly celebrated the "radical"—even "revolutionary"—nature of her literary achievement. Such assessments have helped to secure an important place for Yezierska in the emerging canons of "middle-brow" or "popular modernism" and the "ethnic avant-garde." At the same time, claims made about the radical nature of her achievement have functioned to legitimate new categories of modernist literary practice and contemporary academic inquiry. But these claims have not gone uncontested: scholars reading along lines of labor and class consistently fault Yezierska's politics for being assimilationist at best. Finding no clear condemnation of capitalism in her fiction, they question her inclusion in an avant-garde tradition, whose proper definition—if we look to the profession's most influential accounts—continues to be dominated by Western Marxist categories of thought.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> This aporia comes to a head in Adam McKible's 2002 reading of <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome of the Tenements</span>, whose Russian Jewish immigrant protagonist, Sonya Vrunsky, walks out of a fairy-tale marriage with an uptown millionaire to start life over as a garment worker and aspiring fashion designer. McKible objects to Alan Wald's  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> inclusion of the novel in his series, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Radical Novel Reconsidered</span>, citing Sonya's saucy remark: "All I want is to be able to wear silk stockings and Paris hats the same as Mrs. Astorbilt, and then it wouldn't bother me if we have Bolshevism or Capitalism, or if the democrats or the republicans win. Give me only the democracy of beauty and I'll leave the t for government democracy to politicians and educated old maids" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 27). He asks, "If <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome of the Tenements</span> is left-wing and radical, then what are we to do with Sonya's rejection of politics, particularly if that rejection is condoned by Yezierska?" <sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>McKible's question rests on the assumption that the proper field of labor activism is the sphere of production, not the domestic sphere with its overlapping tasks of consumption and social reproduction. Such an assumption is not surprising, given organized labor's long history of endorsing bourgeois forms of marriage and family life in the U.S. But like so many of her counterparts in the Russian avant-garde, Yezierska did not endorse those forms. Instead, she consistently sought out alternatives, participating in numerous local attempts to collectivize domestic life. At eighteen, she left her parents' home for a series of communal living situations at the Educational Alliance, the Clara de Hirsch Home for Working Girls, and the People's House of the Rand School. After marrying Arnold Levitas in 1912, she made repeated attempts to live apart from him and struggled to find a non-familial care provider for her infant daughter. In 1913, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Survey</span> published her letter to the editor outlining a plan to start a cooperative nursery for professional working mothers. A year later, Yezierska's friend Henrietta Rodman, the famous labor activist and dress reformer, embarked on a plan to build a "feminist apartment house" in Greenwich Village, equipped with a "co-operative kitchen, laundry, dining rooms and nursery," and "a Montessori School on the roof." Neither plan came to fruition and by 1916 Yezierska was living in San Francisco, where she occupied and demonstrated "a model flat" in a settlement house and boarded her daughter out—prompting the scandalized secretary of the Oakland Women's Protective Bureau to inform Arnold that Yezierska "was going to place the child with some people who are at present mixed up indirectly with the bomb throwing episode in San Francisco." In the fall of 1918, amid heightened anti-Red agitation, Yezierska was pursuing plans, again never realized, to start "a small community centre in New York."<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Yezierska closed out the decade witnessing—and protesting—the Palmer Raids which flushed hundreds of radicals out of the country.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> By the time she arrived in Hollywood in 1921, she had met with repeated failure in her practical attempts to remake the conditions of working-class women's everyday life. But those failures did not mark the end of her labor activism. Instead, I will argue, Yezierska turned to her fiction to pursue the same vision in a different form. In the process, she developed a radical literary practice informed by Eastern European, not Western, Marxist priorities. This practice focused on engaging and transforming the mass cultural foundations of U.S. working girls' labor culture. Through her persistent rewriting of the dime novel Cinderella plot, Yezierska sought both to expose the pitfalls lurking in the emerging American ideal of marriage on the family wage and to offer creative alternatives to it.</p>
<p>In each of her novels of the twenties, the protagonist's ability to forge such alternatives hinges on an international consciousness which is linked to her immigrant status and—just  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> as importantly—to her embrace of a modernist aesthetic. The life-transforming power assigned to this aesthetic aligns Yezierska's working-girl protagonists with a transcontinental avant-garde project to reconstitute art as the basis of a new daily life. The same aesthetic grounds Yezierska's own avant-garde project to turn the readymade templates of American mass culture into vehicles for reshaping the aspirations of American labor.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> Occupying and amplifying an international space <span style="font-style:italic;">within</span> American mass culture and the American working class, her fiction mobilizes an immigrant Marxism that seeks to fuse rather than oppose the radical claims of gender and class.</p>
<p>As her daughter, Louise Levitas Henriksen, reports, in 1912 (the year Louise was born) Yezierska worked extensively on an unpublished story entitled "Rebellion of a Supported Wife." Written in the true-confession style popular with working girls, the story features a working-class woman who has to fish through an abusive husband's pockets to find money to eat. Roughly a decade later, Yezierska launched a more calculated strike on the same ideal in her first novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome of the Tenements</span>. After contracting for the novel's publication with the upscale Boni and Liveright in 1922, she secured a working-class female audience for her story by selling reprint rights to Bernarr Macfadden, publisher of <span style="font-style:italic;">True Story</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Movie Weekly</span>, who serialized the novel in another pulp magazine, <span style="font-style:italic;">Beautiful Womanhood</span>. When sales took off, she sold the movie rights to a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures, and a screen version appeared before mass audiences in 1925.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> Yezierska's next two novels, <span style="font-style:italic;">Bread Givers</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Arrogant Beggar</span>, did not gain a mass readership, but it is only when we read all three novels in conjunction that the full impact of her vision is felt. Read one by one, the novels tell almost identical stories of an Eastern European Jewish immigrant working girl who struggles against all odds to achieve professional status and a lover who cherishes her work. Read together, they tell the story of a <span style="font-style:italic;">novyi byt</span>—or new everyday life—sprung up on the Lower East Side.</p>
<p>In the early 1920s when Sonya Vrunsky declared indifference on the question of whether "we have Bolshevism or Capitalism" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 27), liberal reformers in the U.S. and revolutionary socialists in Russia had both made significant attempts to transform working-class domestic life and both had, in different ways, failed the women they hoped to help. As other scholars have documented, Yezierska was a relentless critic of domestic reform efforts in the U.S., faulting the era's settlement houses, working girls' homes, domestic science programs, and model housing developments for their false charity and thinly veiled exploitation of the poor. Products of the era's powerful maternalist reform movement, these initiatives sought to disseminate the American middle-class ideal of the "supported wife" and stay-at-home mother among the urban immigrant working class.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Embraced by labor—and, increasingly, by the state—this ideal released women and children from the highly exploitative industrial workplace, but left them vulnerable to the more traditional forms of exploitation and abuse which Yezierska portrays in stories like "Rebellion of a Supported Wife."</p>
<p>During the same period, Russian revolutionaries were trying not to shore up the family but to get rid of it as fast as possible. The 1918 Code on Marriage, the Family and Guardianship stood as the linchpin of these efforts. Desacralizing marriage, easing  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> divorce procedures, providing universal access to alimony, and abolishing the category of illegitimacy, the Code sought to create a transitional social order, based on "individual rights and gender equality" for working couples, until the state could assume full responsibility for child care. But the state, plagued by Civil War and widespread economic crisis, never made it that far. High unemployment and continued male preference in hiring, combined with the new Family Code and a desperately inadequate state welfare infrastructure, pushed thousands of abandoned women and children onto the street. When famine hit the Volga in 1921, more than one third of the region's children died; by 1922, roving bands of starving women and children numbered in the millions.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> Yezierska makes direct reference to this humanitarian catastrophe in <span style="font-style:italic;">Bread Givers</span>, where Reb Smolinsky stints women in his own family to answer "the cry of those starving Russians" who send him "those begging letters for help" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 90).</p>
<p>The same catastrophe haunts Leon Trotsky's 1923 book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Problems of Life</span>, written just after "the lowest point" of Russia's recent period of economic "destruction and ruin" and in the midst of "the destructive period in family relations that we are witnessing now." Trotsky argues that the most pressing task currently facing Soviet society is "a genuine transformation of life" to be achieved through the "revolutioniz[ing]" of "all our domestic habits." For "unless there is actual equality of husband and wife in the family," Trotsky writes, "we cannot speak seriously of their equality in social work or even in politics." Given the state's current lack of "material resources" and the proletariat's lack of "preparation," he rules out "a thought-out scheme, initiated from above" as a solution to the present "deadlock," and warns against the dangers of "rushing too far ahead, or lapsing into bureaucratic fanciful experiments." Instead, he argues that "the first step" must be taken by ordinary citizens, and calls for an approach based on "private initiative, supported […] by the local Soviets," and "the creation of model communities."<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Trotsky's endorsement of "private initiative" reflects the pro-entrepreneurial spirit of the NEP era, when the state authorized a mixed (capitalist and socialist) economy in an effort to stabilize society and raise badly needed cash. The spirit of volunteerism came to define Zhenotdel, which, massively underfunded, relied heavily on ordinary women's efforts to meet the nation's myriad educational, food, health and housing needs. It also characterized various forms of avant-garde activity, as leading artists took up the challenge of creating a new everyday life. During the NEP era, the state hired avant-garde artists to design and advertise a distinctive line of household products, which were to be understood not as alienated capitalist commodities but as "active socialist things," "comradely object[s]" which would "not isolate people from life but [help] them to organize it." Women's clothing proved to be a particularly attractive addition to this venture. In the fall of 1923, a state textile factory began to produce Liubov' Popova's and Varvara Stepanova's boldly patterned fabrics for mass consumption. Popova went on to incorporate these fabrics in fashionable designs inspired by the loose and simple lines of Western flapper dresses.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup></p>
<p>The significance of local ventures of this kind in Russia provides a needed context for understanding the professional and entrepreneurial ambitions of Yezierska's young  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Lower East Side protagonists in her novels of the twenties. Such ambitions have typically been read as evidence of the characters' and Yezierska's own pro-capitalist and assimilationist bent.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> But they might better be read as part of a broad spectrum of attempts, launched in the U.S., Europe, and Russia, to use a mixed—socialist and capitalist—approach to solving the problems of everyday life. At the same time, Yezierska's emphasis on local and private initiative suggests an acute distrust of state-sponsored plans for social transformation, at a time when the social cost of such plans was palpably evident in both the U.S. and Russia. Her characters' ambitions—to sell clothes, to teach children or to run a small restaurant—all place traditionally unpaid domestic work on a new public and paying basis while providing new forms of material support to neighboring women. Veering sharply from the emerging U.S. welfare paradigm of the supported wife, these ventures also avoid the large-scale risk that left so many women and children without support in Russia. Just as important as its salutary material impact on the neighborhood, the work Yezierska's protagonists do produces new forms of personal development and heterosexual partnership outlined in Soviet blueprints for a <span style="font-style:italic;">novyi byt</span>.</p>
<p>For Russian speakers, the term <span style="font-style:italic;">novyi byt</span> promised to sublate a longstanding opposition between <span style="font-style:italic;">byt</span>, the debased and feminized plane of domestic routine, and <span style="font-style:italic;">bytie</span>, the higher plane of "spiritually meaningful existence" traditionally reserved for men.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> The importance of this sublation stands behind the unexpected emphasis Trotsky places on the emancipated personality in <span style="font-style:italic;">Problems of Life</span>. As N. Minsky writes in his introduction to the book's English translation, Trotsky "says now that the development of personality is an absolute necessity for the evolution of a new type of family." Trotsky links the "t for higher culture" with "the ascent of human personality," and makes a point of affirming contemporary expressions of "the awakened personality, wanting to reorganize in a new way," despite its growing pains.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> In these remarks, Trotsky directly echoes Alexandra Kollontai, who defines the new Soviet woman not as "a mate—the shadow of a man," but as "a personality—a Woman Human Being" willing to assign sexual love a "subordinate place" in a life also devoted to work, children and the collective. In her widely read 1918 collection, <span style="font-style:italic;">The New Morality and the Working Class</span>, and again in her famous 1923 essay, "Make Way for Winged Eros," Kollontai rails against the possessive, ego-shattering love of the bourgeoisie, and hails a "new society" where a "transformed Eros" will sponsor the creation of a "love collective," characterized by the proliferation of "spiritual and soulful bonds in all areas of life, creativity, and living" and by new, short and long-term, forms of sexual partnership that will overcome the current isolation of married couples.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup></p>
<p>The high value theorists like Trotsky and Kollontai placed on a widened (sexual and social) field of "awakened personality," "creativity," and "spiritual and soulful bonds" will immediately strike a chord with Yezierska's readers, for her young protagonists all yearn for life and love on precisely these terms. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome of the Tenements</span>, Sonya Vrunsky has a working girl's "hunger" for "love" and "beautiful clothes" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 23, 182). This hunger first propels Sonya into a story-book marriage with a millionaire, and then pushes her beyond that marriage into a Kollontai-style union with a fellow designer  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> who vows to help her clothe her East Side neighbors. The novel's plot line, inspired by the headline-grabbing marriage and divorce of Yezierska's friend Rose Pastor Stokes,<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> meticulously cites formulaic elements of romance-adventure fiction, even as it infuses those elements with a Soviet bent.</p>
<p>As Nan Enstad recounts, in the standard plot of working girls' dime novels, a working-class heroine becomes orphaned, jobless and homeless early in the novel. After meeting a wealthy love interest and then parting with him due to a misunderstanding, she plunges into a series of adventures which test her mettle and prove her virtue. The revelation of noble birth and a secret inheritance near the middle of the novel paves the way for reunion and marriage to the wealthy hero.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> In <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome of the Tenements</span>, Yezierska systematically inverts this plot-line. At the novel's start, Sonya, an "American Cinderella" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 8), is orphaned but securely employed as a reporter for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ghetto News</span> when she interviews the wealthy uptown reformer, John Manning, who runs a settlement house on the Lower East Side. Through trickery, not misunderstanding, she marries him, only to have her deception uncovered in the revelation not of a secret inheritance and noble birth but of unpaid debts and John's "hidden hate of the Jew" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 156). Fleeing her husband's contempt for her origins, Sonya finds herself jobless and homeless. Starting again with "nothing" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 163), she enters the garment trade and embarks on a labor trajectory that will culminate in the revelation of her own talent for design and a partnership with Jacques Hollins (né Jaky Solomon), the world-famous designer who created the beautiful dress in which she originally snagged John. Both work and love unite the couple, and the novel ends with Jacques agreeing to open a Grand Street shop for working girls, one that will traffic in "beauty for those that love it, beauty that is not for profit" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 178).</p>
<p>Throughout the novel, Sonya's hunger for love and beauty defines her character. This sign of a radical lack inverts the conventional sign of working girls' value in romance adventure fiction, standing in for the secret inheritance which, as Nan Enstad has suggested, serves to affirm the "unassailable, <span style="font-style:italic;">inner</span> worth of women workers."<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> Sonya's "need for beauty" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 72) makes want, not plenty, the source of the U.S. working girl's personal and social power. McKible usefully connects the fire imagery attached to Sonya with the Russian revolution, but surely the "starving" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 23) and "famine"-like (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 66, 72, 182) proportions of her hunger group her with the Bolsheviks as well, even as Yezierska provocatively locates that hunger not on the material plane of <span style="font-style:italic;">byt</span> but on the spiritual plane of <span style="font-style:italic;">bytie</span> traditionally barred to women.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> For McKible, the spiritualized and aestheticized nature of Sonya's hunger disqualifies her as a labor radical; "far more interested in the pursuit of modernist beauty than in revolutionary politics," Sonya, in his view, prioritizes the task of "designing a better commodity" over that of "challenging social inequities."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> But as both Kollontai and Trotsky insist, the revolution of everyday life required change on both the spiritual and material level—required, in fact, the overthrow of that very opposition. Like her Russian counterparts, Sonya uses her own hunger to forge a connection between modernist beauty and revolutionary politics and seeks through the design of a better commodity a way to rectify otherwise entrenched social inequities. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Sonya's hunger for love and beautiful clothes also neatly concretizes Trostky's and Kollontai's demands for a widened field of personal and social development. Initially drawn to John Manning's dream of "abolish[ing] poverty and want in every form" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 13), Sonya embraces his settlement "gospel of the Simple Life" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 75) only to realize that it would cheat her East Side neighbors of both material and spiritual fulfillment. In contrast, the clothes Jacques Hollins makes for Sonya "express and reveal the human soul" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 29), while dressing her gives him "the first chance of [his] life to work for love" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 28). Sonya finds her own "deepest self-expression" in "the art of designing" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 165), and exults in the fact that her union with Jacques, a man with whom she can both "work" and "play," allows her to "be [her] own free self" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 179). But the free self's final articulation comes only when Sonya reaches beyond the confines of the sexual couple to a wider community of workers. Trading in the pinched authoritarianism of John's "father-and-mother-like settlement" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 82) for the erotically-charged egalitarianism of Kollontai's "love collective," she vows to share beauty with "those who love beauty, not only [with] those who can buy it." "In the midst of the ready-mades of Grand Street," she rejoices, "a shop of the beautiful—that's to be my settlement!" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 178).<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup></p>
<p>In her plans to offer working girls "beautiful plainness" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 169) instead of the "gaud[y] finery" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 123) they currently wear, Sonya seeks to popularize a modernist aesthetics among the masses. This ambition has troubled several critics, who, while recognizing the integral connection between "modernist beauty" and politics, understand that connection to support rather than defy reigning hierarchies of class and class taste.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> But this line of argument makes more sense today, in the wake of the corporate and academic embrace of modernism in the U.S, than it would have made in the twenties, when modernist beauty was receiving radically different political articulations in different parts of the world and different (often moving) populations. In fact, one of the most striking aspects of Sonya's modernist aesthetic is how fluidly it draws on and lends itself to competing social visions during the course of the novel. Behind these competing visions stands a relationship, emerging internationally, between modernism and the state—one very much tied to the project of reconstructing everyday life but not to any one model for doing so.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup></p>
<p>State interest in John's gospel of the Simple Life crops up throughout Yezierska's text. A descendent of the "friendly visitor[s]" who poison Sonya's childhood (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 76, 135), John is a maternalist reformer and shares the movement's aims of building "a strong foundation for the right kind of womanhood, manhood and citizenship" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 86). His calls for "model tenements, play-grounds for children, [and] old-age pensions" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 12–13) involve him in "conferences at Washington, labor arbitration committees" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 6), and "reconstruction plans propounded by the Senator from Oklahoma" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 97), and place him on the ground floor of efforts to create a welfare state. When Sonya seduces him with strategic displays of modernist beauty, she plays directly into his fantasies of a new day. In her meticulously crafted designer dress—"nothing but simple lines" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 26)—she appears as a "vision in grey, a glowing face rising above morning mists" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 33). And her redecorated flat, whose aura of "unscheming naturalness" and "spontaneous harmony" derives from "many days and nights of planning and experimenting" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 73,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> 65), res in miniature an edenic planned society to be built from small, voluntarily embraced units of domestic virtue and contentment.</p>
<p>But while Sonya's aesthetic lends itself to John's planned society, it does not require it. Sonya still possesses the same aesthetic at the end of the novel, but she has rearticulated it to support—and even inspire—a new set of social relations. Pointedly designed to operate without state direction or support, Sonya's plans for a shop on Grand Street nevertheless resonate with NEP-era Soviet attempts to design and market new lines of everyday commodities. Like the "comradely objects" and "active socialist things" of her avant-garde counterparts in Russia, Sonya's dresses and home décor do not function to "isolate people from life but [help] them to organize it," serving as strangely animate (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 65, 73, 171) signs and catalysts of "awakened personality, wanting to reorganize in a new way." Just seeing the Sonya Model pulls Hollins to its maker's workplace, where he is newly able to recognize his former client as "an equal" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 159). The spirit of equality that springs up between them also radiates outwards in dress designs that collapse market hierarchies. Through those designs, a common hunger—the hunger for love and beautiful clothes—finds expression as a sui generis force of social change.</p>
<p>The same modernist aesthetic redirects the lives of two subsequent protagonists, Sara Smolinsky and Adele Lindner, who use dress and décor to translate a youthful hunger for love and beauty into mature lives of work, love and personal development. They too are drawn to and then past the Cinderella plot, whose discrediting clears the way for a new organization of everyday life. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Bread Givers</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Arrogant Beggar</span>, Yezierska makes looser and freer use of the formulaic elements of working girls' fiction as she develops a thematic preoccupation with motherhood not found in dime novels of her day. Through this latter focus, she voices mounting objections to the domestic reform agendas of U.S. maternalists. Continuing to seek out an imaginary middle ground between rival, U.S. and Russian, state agendas for transforming the domestic sphere, Yezierska finds inspiration but also a limit in working-class maternity as a matrix for change.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Bread Givers</span>, Sara's domestic quarrel with her parents focalizes a larger struggle between the emerging American ideal of the supported wife and the Old World Jewish ideal of the supported scholar-husband. Outraged by a man "who lives on the blood of his wife and children," she dares her mother to "arrest" her father "for not supporting [her]" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 130, 265). He, in turn, associates his rebellious daughter with all the other "educated old maids" whose efforts "to make over the world" are responsible for "all that's false in politics" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 205).<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> When it comes to marrying off his daughters, however, the Reb warms considerably to the old maids' maternalist political vision. He separates two of Sara's older sisters from penniless suitors they prefer and corrals them into Cinderella marriages with wealthy strangers before pushing a third sister, Bessie, into marriage with Zalmon, the neighborhood fish peddler. A widower and father of six, Zalmon boasts that he will "make" Bessie "for a lady with nothing to do but stay home and cook for me and clean the house and look after the children" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 93). But the joys of being a supported wife turn out to be illusory for all three sisters. Trapped by loneliness, backbreaking labor and lack of access to their husbands' money, they struggle to love the children who "chai[n]" them "to this misery" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 148) <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>To avoid the fate of her sisters, Sara flees her parents' house and the interest of yet another wealthy suitor. These actions leave her penniless, homeless and symbolically orphaned halfway through the novel, at the point where most dime novel heroines would be discovering their secret inheritance. The long years of hardship and deprivation required to make it through school rere the dime novel heroine's spectacular clashes with adversity and set the stage for an equally pointed revision of the happy ending that habitually serves as her reward. In a chapter entitled "My Honeymoon with Myself," Sara celebrates life with a college degree. "Once I had been elated at the thought that a man had wanted me," she muses. "How much more thrilling to feel that I had made my work wanted! This was the honeymoon of my career!" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 241). For Sara, fulfilling work in the public sphere is not an alternative to love, but its condition. Explaining to her mother that she cannot "marry myself to a man that's a person" until she first makes herself "for a person" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 172), she answers Alexandra Kollontai's call for a woman who defines herself not as "a mate—the shadow of a man," but as "a personality—a Woman Human Being."</p>
<p>Sara uses a modernist aesthetic to enact and represent the new life she has made for herself. The "graceful quietness" of a "plain serge" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 239) suit provides the look she needs for her new line of work (BG 255) and serves to identify her as a New Woman.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> Similarly, a modernist domestic décor helps Sara find love. Her "beautiful and empty" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 277) one-room flat, accented with the strong, simple shapes of "shining pots and pans" and "bright dishes" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 241), draws compliments from the school principal, Hugo Seelig, when he steps in for tea. His praise confirms and deepens the "understandin[g]" she feels in his presence and releases her from her "long loneliness" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 277). Grounded in the "clean emptiness" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 277) of a modernist present as much as a shared past in Russian Poland, their camaraderie blossoms into the kind of working partnership outlined in contemporary Soviet blueprints for a <span style="font-style:italic;">novyi byt</span>.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup></p>
<p>Being "a teacher of the schools with an all-year salary from the Government" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 245) allows Sara to forge a new kind of relationship not only with a prospective male partner but also with the state. Unlike the other women in her family, who are dubiously served by new state and federal investments in the ideal of the supported wife, Sara works for the state and in return receives the income, "the leisure and the quiet" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 241) for ongoing self-development and for love on equal terms. Her work also makes self-development possible for the next generation. All the children in Sara's "class of fifty" "eleven-year-old[s]" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 271) enjoy opportunities denied to Sara, who began her working life at "about ten years old" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 1). Like the "little boy" whom Sara and Hugo seize from the oncoming "wheels of a racing truck" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 276), her students are rescued children, whose enlarged prospects stem directly from her labor outside the home.</p>
<p>Sara's service to the state successfully translates a traditional portion of women's domestic labor—raising children—into a new, public, trained and salaried form. But her success is jeopardized by the incomplete nature of this translation, which leaves other parts of women's traditional work untouched. When her mother dies, leaving her father in her charge, Sara tests and painfully discards all the available means for assigning his daily care to someone else, running through the options of "a boarding  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> house" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 291) "the Old Men's Home" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 291), and a second marriage in short succession. The remaining option—to invite him to live with her and Hugo—fills her with dread. Forced to choose between her father's well-being and her own, Sara confronts the limit of her individual power to remake the conditions of her everyday life. Her problem—"the problem of Father" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 296)—is, like the problem of childcare identified in Yezierska's 1911 <span style="font-style:italic;">Survey</span> letter to the editor, a working woman's "individual problem," but one "that can no longer be solved individually."<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> The novel ends moodily with it "still unsolved" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 296).</p>
<p>Yezierska returns to the problem—and the possibilities—of substitute care in her next novel, <span style="font-style:italic;">Arrogant Beggar</span>, using the stepmother motif in the Cinderella story to generate her narrative. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Bread Givers</span>, Sara's father languishes under the care of a second wife "like a poor orphan with a stepmother" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 286). In <span style="font-style:italic;">Arrogant Beggar</span>, the orphan resumes the shape of a working girl, Adele Lindner, who passes along a whole chain of substitute mothers before she, too, becomes one. Most of these mothers, like Cinderella's stepmother, block rather than aid Adele's development, until one woman, who nurtures the chain of substitution itself, offers her a model of care that forms the basis for a new everyday life.</p>
<p>The novel opens with a choice of mothers after Adele, the American-born child of Polish Jews, quits the care of two landladies in succession. Mrs. Hershbein, a working-class neighbor looking for a wife whose wages "will help" her son "go on with his learning" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 16), hails from the ethnic past."<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> Mrs. Hellman hails from the Americanized future: "President of the Federation of Charities, Director of Working Girls' Associations" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 67), and "founder" of a "Home for Working Girls" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 10, 8), she is a leading maternalist of the day. Adele quickly opts for "the Hellman Home" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 15) only to discover that it is repackaging domestic drudgery as a new civic ideal. Impressed by Adele's performance in the Home's "training school for domestic service" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 37), Mrs. Hellman dreams of making her "a leader among [her] people" primed to use the latest breakthroughs of "domestic science" to teach other women how to "bring into their homes this self-sacrificing attitude toward life" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 46). In the meantime, she hires Adele on as a maid at a below-market wage. Mrs. Hellman celebrates the power of her Home to give working girls "a higher vision of their obligation to be patriotic and useful women" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 35). Recalling John Manning's attempts "to build a strong foundation for the right kind of womanhood, manhood and citizenship" (<span style="font-style:italic;">ST</span> 86), she would tie the social citizenship of working-class women to an updated capacity for domestic "self-sacrific[e]."<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup></p>
<p>Mrs. Hellman's character makes clear that the task of reproducing of women's domestic roles has reached beyond the family circle to become the official responsibility of public "[b]enefactors" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 42) and the emerging welfare state. In Yezierska's portrayal, the Cinderella story sutures working girls' desire to this modern state agenda, even as they recoil against it. Steeled against further charity from the wicked "stepmother" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 88), Mrs. Hellman, Adele nevertheless falls for the princely charms of her son, Arthur, until she realizes that, were she to flee the woes of a working girl's life by marrying him, "I'd never feel your equal even though I was, because I'd be smothered by your  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> possessions. Your house, your cars, your servants, all the power that your money gives you over me" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 117). Done "waiting for a liberator prince," she returns to the Lower East Side, where she discovers a group of working-class women whose small and quite ordinary efforts to collectivize domestic life contain the germ of a better happy ending.</p>
<p>Turning Arthur down leaves Adele—like Sonya and Sara—homeless and penniless until a dishwashing job, taken "for something to eat" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 91), introduces her to Muhmenkeh, a fellow worker and the last of her many mothers.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> Muhmenkeh offers Adele a bed for the night on the strength of her resemblance to Shenah Gittel, a granddaughter in Poland whom Muhmenkeh hopes to bring to America. When Adele falls sick, the old woman spends her savings to nurse her back to health. Her willingness to care for a coworker in place of her granddaughter crowns a larger chain of substitute care that links all the women of the neighborhood. This care chain draws on its participants' collective strength while tailoring itself to the frequently isolated and solitary nature of their labor. Providing precious opportunities for women to socialize and to leave the house, it also guards against unwelcome attention from the welfare state.</p>
<p>Muhmenkeh's care of Mrs. Mirsky's children has kept both the "truant officer" and "the Board of Health" at bay (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 104), while another woman's gift of food brightens her own morning routine. Secure within this informal network of exchange, she can rejoice, at seventy-six, "that I did not yet fall into the Old People's Home" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 96). In these moments, Muhmenkeh and her neighbors use a longstanding working-class practice to meet the trials of the modern urban environment. Through a creative spark nurtured by the bond Muhmenkeh forms with Adele, Yezierska develops their practice into a third alternative to contemporary liberal capitalist and revolutionary socialist templates for reorganizing everyday life. In the U.S., the irreplaceable nature of a mother's care stood at the foundation of a welfare state committed to the ideal of the supported wife, while in Russia, the all too fungible bond between mother and child, stretched to the breaking point by a cash-strapped state, left women and children starving in the fields and streets. Standing between these two historical alternatives, Muhmenkeh uses substitution to make loss and separation—the common condition of the orphan and the immigrant—into the building blocks of viable community. As "a godmother, grandmother of lost ones" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 105), she mediates between the fixed and the broken attachment, allowing working-class mothers lives beyond the home while keeping their dependents close.</p>
<p>After Muhmenkeh dies, Adele vows to "start something with Muhmenkeh's spirit in it" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 125), but can only do so when she too learns to substitute. Her ability to part with a pair of Muhmenkeh's shoes prompts a vision of her friend feeding a "surging" flock of neighborhood children at a makeshift <span style="font-style:italic;">Purim</span> feast (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 124–5), and inspires Adele to open a public dining hall in the old woman's basement flat. Using the modernist aesthetic instilled in her at Hellman House, she creates a quasi-socialist environment, like the famous basement cafeteria that Yezierska once patronized at the Rand School.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> Adele runs her restaurant on an "open cash bowl" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 129) system that relies on the generous payment of some diners to allow others, "here and there" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 130), to eat for free. As a result, artists and intellectuals, professionals and low-wage workers all find a  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> seat at the same table. The existence of such a table makes it possible for a young East Side doctor and her husband to run their clinic on equal terms and ensures that even the neighborhood's poorest children get a "daily dinner" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 130).<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> Her public table also kindles love, reuniting Adele with the immigrant composer, Jean Rachmansky, and inspires art, affording Jean the closeness to his "own people" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 149) that he needs to create his "original composition[s]" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 74).</p>
<p>In Adele's view, Jean has the real "genius" while she is just "a plain plodder" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 148). His music brightens <span style="font-style:italic;">byt</span> with glimmers of <span style="font-style:italic;">bytie</span>, and offers his "[h]ungry, restless" East Side listeners coveted chances to "breathe in a fullness of life denied them in life" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 145, 144). But when judged by the standards of the Russian avant-garde, she is the one who practices the more radical art: an art that fuses <span style="font-style:italic;">byt</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">bytie</span> in order to fill bellies, enliven tradition, promote gender equality, and seat all classes at the same table—and the same piano. In this regard, Adele resembles Yezierska herself, who anchors her own artistic project not in virtuoso displays of original word play but in a doggedly unoriginal recycling of existing mass-cultural forms and desires. For it is only through the strategic use she makes of working girls' established investment in the Cinderella plots of American mass culture that Yezierska can hope to generate broad support for a new culture of everyday life. JoAnn Pavletich has argued that "[e]xcept in a few texts, and then in passing," Yezierska does "not represent the possibilities in working-class culture." In fact, the opposite is true. Like Muhmenkeh's Coffee Shop, her fiction consistently draws and builds upon existing expressions of U.S. working-class women's hunger, solidarity, and creative flair in order to imagine "a culture within which one can thrive."<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup></p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Problems of Life</span>, Trotsky draws up a list of tasks that individual citizens will have to shoulder in the absence of adequate state efforts to socialize the domestic sphere. "We need more socialistic economic forms," he insists:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Only under such conditions can we free the family from the functions and cares that now oppress and disintegrate it. Washing must be done by a public laundry, catering by a public restaurant, sewing by a public workshop. Children must be educated by good public teachers who have a real vocation for the work. Then the bond between husband and wife would be freed from everything external and accidental, and the one would cease to absorb the life of the other. Genuine equality would at last be established.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Something very close to this emerges from the cumulative vision of Yezierska's novels of the twenties, where a high-quality, affordable dress shop, good public schooling and a community restaurant remake life on the Lower East Side. When they translate traditional forms of unpaid domestic labor into professional work in the public sphere, Yezierska's protagonists not only create new conditions of self-support and personal development for themselves; they also change the playing field for other women and girls. This pattern culminates in Adele and Jean's decision to use profits from Muhmenkeh's Coffee Shop to bring her granddaughter to the U.S. As they wait for her to arrive, Jean philosophizes, "Of course we can't live up to all Shenah Gittel will expect. We can only give her the chance to get it for herself" (<span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 152–53). But that chance is now better  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> than any Yezierska's own protagonists had. Through their efforts, Shenah Gittel's daily life will include well-made clothing, nutritious food, a lively, multidisciplinary culture of the arts, first-rate co-education, and the health care of a woman doctor. On top of these material resources, an expanded range of satisfying work options in the public sphere will provide her with non-exceptional alternatives to the contemporary cross-class ideal of the supported wife.</p>
<p>No doubt, the Shenah Gittel in us all is quick to see the flaws. Yezierska's protagonists, working individually, devise local and partial responses to the doubly exploited nature of working-class women's labor, but no one attempts to disrupt the capitalist economy as a whole. In fact, her protagonists' good ideas consistently depend on it: low-wage workers are still needed to make Sonya's clothes, clean Sara's classroom and wash Adele's dishes. Despite the new opportunities opened up for some women in the public sphere, the strongly gendered nature of domestic work remains intact. The men who take part in the novels' innovative labor schemes—as famous designers, school principals or world-class musicians—all have higher status, more "genius" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 28, <span style="font-style:italic;">AB</span> 148), and less (much less) messy, hands-on contact than their far more daring female partners. "[T]he problem of Father" (<span style="font-style:italic;">BG</span> 296)—and of long-term illness or infirmity more generally—is ultimately ducked. Finally, none of Yezierska's protagonists bears or raises children of her own. Refreshing in the respect given to the social contributions of childless women, the novels nevertheless end up reinscribing an unacceptable choice between satisfying paid work and motherhood.</p>
<p>But to make these points is to identify a historical project whose unfinished nature points up the inadequacy of our own critical paradigms as much as it does Yezierska's fiction. Occupying an imaginary space between revolution and reform, Yezierska's novels elaborate a labor politics that exposes and seeks to overcome the failures and contradictions of each. That it too should fail only underscores our continued lack of a comprehensive model for addressing labor in all its exploited forms. At the same time, the fact that Yezierska's labor fiction has been illegible to us as such for so long points to a blind spot in our critical engagement with the major struggles of her era. This blind spot is, ironically, a direct result of our successful efforts to preserve the memory and defend the value of the historical avant-garde. For the labor tradition in which her fiction participates has been obscured by the particular form those efforts have taken.</p>
<p>The high prestige that we continue to assign to the historical avant-garde, which is inseparable from the ongoing case made for its radical status, stands in sharp contrast to the pronounced volatility of the aesthetic and political values assigned, at one point or another, to modernist and mass cultural texts from the same period. In the wake of the arguments made by Peter Bürger in <span style="font-style:italic;">Theory of the Avant-Garde</span> and Andreas Huyssen in <span style="font-style:italic;">After the Great Divide</span>, this radical status has come to inhere in the identification of the historical avant-garde with the project to transform everyday life—a formulation that, as Bürger writes, owes its "concept of the historical avant-garde movements [ … ] primarily to Dadaism and early Surrealism but also and equally to the Russian avant-garde after the October revolution." Bürger's assurances notwithstanding, the actual form this conceptualization has taken clearly owes more to the historical  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> particularities of Dada and Surrealism than to the Russian avant-garde. This is due in no small part to the intervening intellectual and political impact of Lefebvre, Debord and the Situationists, for whom the Dadaist and Surrealist precedent was paramount. As a result, our memory of the historical avant-garde's project to transform everyday life privileges the analytical categories of spectacle, festivity and consumption over the (often invisible) labor of social reproduction. To put this in a slightly different way: the very strength and tenacity of Western Marxists' investment in the memory and value of the avant-garde project to transform everyday life has occluded the focus on labor and women's oppression that was central to revolutionary Russia's articulation of that same project.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup></p>
<p>This lost connection to the particularities of the Russian experiment—and its impact internationally—blunts our power to respond to the political urgencies of Yezierska's moment and our own. Today, as the global reach of capital's grip on labor jeopardizes the social policies of First World welfare states, labor's own global migrations are pushing new generations of women to the very bottom of the market in food preparation, hotel and office cleaning, sex work, invalid and child care, and domestic service jobs. At such a juncture, Yezierska's labor fiction—international in its conception, unorthodox in its approach, and activist in its address—provides a legacy worth reviving.</p>

Yezierska's friendship with Rose Pastor Stokes, which remained active until Stokes' death in 1933, may also have kept her informed about Kollontai's work with Zhenotdel. In 1922, Stokes  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> went to Moscow as a delegate to the Fourth Congress of the Communist International, and, among other writings about the trip, published "an ardent article on the women of Petrograd."

In addition to the housing arrangements mentioned in the main text,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Yezierska began her married life with Arnold Levitas in the Vanderbilt Apartments, "a new development of `model' dwellings," and briefly participated in another cooperative housing venture in New York during the Great Depression (Henriksen 58, 254–55).

</blockquote>
<p>In March 1920, the era's leading avant-garde literary magazine, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Little Review</span>, risked ridicule by publishing the controversial elegiac sound poem "Klink—Hratzvenga (<span style="font-style:italic;">Deathwail</span>)" by the equally controversial German émigré poet and painter's model Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven (1874–1927; <a name="1-text" href="#1">re 1</a>). The poem appeared alongside her German poem "Irrender König," a eulogy dedicated to Leopold von Freytag-Loringhoven, her husband who had committed suicide just a year earlier following his release from five years as a prisoner of war. The publication of the poem was a provocative gesture, given also that in the very same issue, poet and editor Evelyn Scott criticized the Baroness's "strange and beautiful obliviousness," writing: "I call the Baroness a naked oriental in the sex dance of her religion."<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> It was the corporality of her verse, as well as her <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">unbridled and uncensored emotionality, that aroused controversy and debate, but also fit squarely in the Dada aesthetic, as foreign editor John Rodker was the first to note in a mock review of "Klink—Hratzvenga (<span style="font-style:italic;">Deathwail</span>)" in the magazine's July–August issue of 1920: "It is possible that Else von Freytag-Loringhoven is the first Dadaiste in New York and that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Little Review</span> has discovered her."<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> Corroborating Rodker's assessment in the spring of 1922, the magazine's coeditor Jane Heap proclaimed the Baroness, "the first American dada … the only one living anywhere who dresses dada, loves dada, lives dada," while adding provocatively: "we do intend to drop the baroness—right into the middle of the history of American poetry!"<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> In fact, this is precisely what <span style="font-style:italic;">The Little Review</span> had done since 1918, when the New York magazine embarked on its Dada course, featuring the Baroness's poetry prominently alongside the installments of James Joyce's <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>. Like no other's, the Baroness's corporeally-charged  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> poetry embodied the Dada motto of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Little Review</span>: "Making no compromise with the public taste."<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> A maverick who consistently confounded the boundaries of life and art, the Baroness was known for her remarkable do-it-yourself art aesthetics, adorning her body with objects and self-made costumes, while also producing mischievously titled assemblages made from junk she found in the streets. But it was her sound poetry that provided a touchstone that created a neat division between mainstream critics who dismissed the Baroness as insane, and her admirers who championed her precisely because they recognized in her practice the promise of a new corporeal language.</p>
<p>Thus in the magazine's "Reader Critic" column (April 1920), New York writer Maxwell Bodenheim observed that "Else von Freytag Loringhoven's 'Klink—Hratzvenga' has the virtues of so many languages and the deficiencies of none, since she can create sounds for shades of meaning that have no dictionary equivalents." Chastising those who claim not to understand the Baroness's language, Bodenheim continues:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Her poem is a masterpiece of bitter simplicity, from its choked beginning to its satiated "Vrmm." Now, all together, boys: come on with your "impossible to understand it," "there's nothing to understand," "charlatan," "she's insane," and other rotten tomatoes. At your best you prefer the complex, intellectual sterilities of a Dorothy Richardson. Any new simplicity confounds you.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Bodenheim was on to something. A simple glance at "Klink—Hratzvenga (<span style="font-style:italic;">Deathwail</span>)" as sound text conveys how the Baroness's made-up constructions sensually evoke representational analogues, and in this case, echo a mourning cry for a generation that survived World War I. In the epigraph above (and, indeed, throughout the entire poem), the dominant construction is the word "Mardoodaar," a recombination of German word "Mord," the French term "meurtre," and the English "murderer," in clinamatic proliferation.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> Making for an emotive howl alternating between the baritone "oooo" sound, and a higher pitched "aah," the poem resonates with despair. This anguish is mirrored in the repetition of "<span style="font-style:italic;">masré</span>," evoking massacre, and the sonic reconration of "kill" in "alquille" or "all/kill, I'll kill," and "paquille" as "don't/pas kill" and even "pakill," intoning the proverbial death of the father in a striking liquidity of "l" consonance. The permutational repetition of "Arrkarr-barr," sounding its roar throughout the poem, echoes not only the German "Bär" meaning "bear" (with its growling howl), but also the thematic bareness ("bar" in German meaning "bare"). The emphatic and multiple exclamation marks throughout the poem serve to reinforce its emotional bellow.</p>
<p>While the Baroness's word-like constructions such as found in "Klink—Hratzvenga <span style="font-style:italic;">(Deathwail</span>)" are predominantly emotive and sensorial, it is clearly possible to parse apart their semantic origins. Inherent both visually and sonically in the poem's title is the German word "Klinke," meaning "door handle," which is appropriately <span style="font-style:italic;">linked</span> to the following word by the Baroness's characteristic use of the dash—itself a punctuative analogue to the practice of collage. "Klink" also evokes German "Klang," literally sound, the poem drawing attention to its material make-up and its sonic waves as a medium of communication. In "Hratzvenga" can be found the merging of "Herr/avenged," but also the word "heart" as well as its German analogue "Herz," and so  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> intones "an avenged heart." In the "Deathwail" that follows, then, is the poet's elegiac attempt through sound to avenge (by extending the materiality and life of the dead), the singular male subject—the "He" of "He is dead" and the "Herr" of "Hratzvenga," but also all those rent by the vicissitude of war. The subtitle "Narin—Tzarissamanili" can be read as a transliteration of the German "Narbig," meaning scarred, referring most obviously to the lasting trauma of the horror invoked, but also sonically suggesting the collapsed linking of "Ne're again" as in: "he <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> no more." While "Tzarissamanili" evokes both the tsar of Russia and Tristan Tzara, the Rumanian-born leader of the Zurich and French Dada movement,<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> the evocation of Dada functions as a kind of fractal echo of the entire poem.</p>
<p>The second and third lines of the poem repeat "Ninj—iffe kniek—" which, despite its relative obscurity certainly conveys a sense of violence, the short "i" sounds piercing their own formulation. Sonically, "Ninj—iffe" can be heard as a reconration of "knife." A phoneticized semantic reading of the arrangement emerges from an understanding of "kniek" as a truncated version of "kniekehle," the German word for "hollow of the knee," the knee itself evoking the role of hinge. Furthermore, exclamations of despair occur throughout the poem, as in "Goorde me!!!" (suggesting "Gott," the German word for God, joined with the English "my God!"), as well as the devastated and sympathetic utterance of "oje," meaning in German "oh dear" in the metamorphosing iteration: "Ojombe—ojoombe—oje—" with its darkly mournful "o" assonance. The appearance of "Kardirdesporvorde" in the poem's third stanza echoes one of the foremost nonsense sound poems, Lewis Carroll's "Jabberwocky" from his 1871 <span style="font-style:italic;">Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There</span>.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> Specifically recalling Carroll's brandishing his "vorpal sword," cutting apart normative language and signification, as the Baroness does in her own "slithy toves," the war too has made for a generation "cut off" from its own meaning—simultaneously liberating and annihilating. Yoked together in its Anglo-German palimpsest, the Baroness's imaginary construction can be read implying the impossibility of "hearing" the world as we may have heard it before. Significantly, the poem ends not in the shushing of the penultimate line, its "<span style="font-style:italic;">Sh—sh</span> —", rather in a mechanistic assertion of movement—the "Vrmm" of a motor.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>In this essay we invite readers to listen closely not only to "Klink—Hratzvenga," which has recently been reprinted in the Modern Library edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">American Poetry: The Twentieth Century, Volume 1: Henry Adams to Dorothy Parker</span>, but also to her remarkable unpublished sound poetry such as "Duet: Eigasing Rin Jalamund," and "Herzlücke is Nicke Verpo," the Baroness's song to the hairless Mexican dog. Whereas the Baroness's performance art and body sculptures have been given a great deal of attention in recent scholarship,<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> her poetry, and in particular her sound poetry, has only begun to be considered in the scholarship of modernism and the avant-garde. Taking inspiration from poet Kenneth Rexroth, who acknowledged that "[h]er verse represented a far more radical revolt against reality than [August] Stramm or Kurt Schwitters or Tristan Tzara," and from Cary Nelsen who writes that "the dadaist and surrealist dislocations of Baroness Else von Freytag-Loringhoven … make the verbal risks other poets were taking seem almost tame,"<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> we argue for a gendered and corporeal aesthetic in the Baroness's sound poetry. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>More specifically, we argue that the Baroness's sonic work as constructed of and through her own body, effects an architectural refrain—a spatio-temporal resounding of her own embodiment. Based on sonic concatenation, her sound poems convey the processual making and unmaking of corporeality, yielding provisional insight not simply into her own integrative aesthetics, but into one of the most complex and little understood poetic genres. As Richard Kostelanetz indicates in <span style="font-style:italic;">Texts-Sound Texts</span>, "Though superficially playful, text-sound art embodies serious thinking about the possibilities of vocal expression and communication; it represents not a substitute for language but an expansion of our verbal powers."<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> Such is the very expansion the Baroness sought in all her art. By conjoining, conflating, and blurring distinctions and boundaries of all kinds, the Baroness would expand restrictive categorizations of gender, sexuality and subjectivity. It is from within this aesthetic drive, then, that the Baroness's acoustic experiments must be heard.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Toward a Theory of Corporeal Dada Sound</h1>
<p>In June of 1916, the German Dadaist poet Hugo Ball described creating and performing "'Verse ohne Worte' [poems without words]" or what he called more generally "Lautgedichte [sound poems]," at Zurich's famed Cabaret Voltaire.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> Together with Marcel Janco, Richard Huelsenbeck, Tristan Tzara, and Hans Arp, Ball would help create the Dadaist "simultaneist poem," which was "a high energy, performance oriented cacophony of whistling, singing, grunting, coughing, and speaking."<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> Certainly this phonetic poetry emerged as the language of trauma in the face of war, a counter to the noise of the cannons and gunfire: "Ball's speech emerged as damaged," as T. J. Demos writes, "a telling stutter, a nervous echolalia."<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> Yet radical experiments with the materiality of sound in poetry long predate the heightened engagement with the genre by early-twentieth-century Dadaists (as seen, for example, in the sound poetry by practitioners ranging from Aristophanes, through Erasmus Darwin to Christian Morgenstern and others).<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> Yet in this long tradition, there is a paucity of information on women's involvement in sound poetry, whether as practitioners, theorists, or even simply as listeners. Although the Baroness may have been influenced by Berlin poet Else Lasker-Schüler, who had experimented with sound as early as 1902 in a "linguistic concoction of pseudo-Latin, pseudo-Arabic, some German and pure fun," what Lasker-Schüler called <span style="font-style:italic;">Ursprache</span> (Ur-language),<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> the Baroness's experimentation was without the coterie of predecessors that her male colleagues enjoyed. In its moment then, the Baroness's voice and her vocal texts rang out alone. Not only does this singularity make the Baroness's foray in the field of sonic art all the more remarkable, but it underscores the necessity of asserting her inclusion within the genealogy of sound poetry.</p>
<p>"Sound is language's flesh," Charles Bernstein reminds us in his introduction to <span style="font-style:italic;">Close Listening: Poetry and the Performed Word</span>,<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> and the poems of the Baroness betray the extent to which her training and practice in multiple artistic media informed her use and understanding of the extra-lexical aspects of the word. As Ming-Qian Ma asserts: "For the inarticulate can find its forms of articulation only within the already articulated,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> within, in other words, a language which is itself a sociohistorical construct."<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> Yet by rendering problematic the very concept of articulation, the Baroness's sound poems let her body speak. Indeed, as we shall see below, through her expansive use of sound, the Baroness conveys the fluidity of gender as a constantly changing, polysemous signifier. She also conveys something of what Bernstein describes as the sensuous "noise of language" and the jouissance of linguistic play.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> For some theorists and practitioners of sound poetry, the genre is necessarily a form of body art, while for others the slippages of sense into nonsense are aural pathways into the strictly cognitive: "When sound and syntax slip into place," writes Rachel Blau DuPlessis, "the poem solidifies itself and rests on and inside itself. It embodies what it is."<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> For many theorists of poetry, sound has an inherently libidinal component: "[Sound] is an agency for desire productions," writes McCaffery, "for releasing energy flow, for securing the passage of libido in a multiplicity of flows out of the Logos."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> In sound poetry, Gerald Bruns similarly expounds, "the body becomes the machine or vestibule of gratuitous expenditures of energy."<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup></p>
<p>Importantly, sound and the body are inherently performative. Rasula and McCaffery identify an alternative genealogy to sound poetry that focuses not on the aestheticization of sound, but on</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>the Freudian and Lacanian implications in current semiology … [where,] in the poems of [Hugo] Ball, [Kurt] Schwitters, [Christian] Morgenstern, and [Claude] Gauverau we are promised the disruptive force of <span style="font-style:italic;">délire</span> if, or whenever, the safe typography of the printed text explodes into the sonorous intensities of performance.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">As it leaps from her body to the page, to the acoustic environment of its hearing, the Baroness's "inner articulation releases the coils and complications of Saying's assertion" as Susan Howe writes of Gertrude Stein and Emily Dickinson.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> At once destructive and seductive, the Baroness's sound poems break and remake meaning in an endless refrain. Like a prism that refracts and so distorts or "colors" that which is viewed through it, the refrain, as described by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, is capable of territorializing, asserting its space. It is simultaneously permeating and permeable. In <span style="font-style:italic;">A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia</span>, Deleuze and Guattari posit the refrain as simultaneous reciprocity: "So just what is a refrain? <span style="font-style:italic;">Glass Harmonica</span>: the refrain is a prism, a crystal of space-time. It acts upon that which surrounds it, sound or light, extracting from its various vibrations or decompositions, projections, or transformations."<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> Sound, as described here, is its own spatial environment. Like the haunting melodies produced by the glass harmonica with its other-worldly ranges, the refrain effects a kind of fractal echo. Likewise for Bruns,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Sound poetry aims at the construction not of works but situations or environments.… Sound, after all, is more like a liquid than a solid. There is no grasping, fixing, framing, or settling it. We are always <span style="font-style:italic;">inside</span> of sound, which in turn fills us as we listen to it.

<p class="continued">Similarly, through the Baroness's somatic art she becomes her own space-sound, demonstrating language and meaning to be "auto-compose[d]" and "self-determined"— with signification emerging in and of its own accord.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> As Kurt Schwitters points out in his 1924 essay "Consistent Poetry": "The association of ideas [in poetry] cannot be unambiguous, as it is totally dependent on the combinatorial faculty of the observer. Everybody has different experiences and remembers and combines differently."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> Mirroring her own body, the Baroness's poems are sinewy and muscular—they flex against the page, against syntax, and against language itself, creating a highly transgressive, performative poetics, and allowing readers, listeners, and viewers the expansion of verbal powers that Kostelanetz speaks of.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup></p>
<p>Gerald Bruns frames poetic practice as an on-going engagement with its own past that necessarily results in its futurity. "The history of poetry," he explains, "is a history of the reconceptualization of poetry—and of language as well. If poetry has a purpose, it is to keep history—and not just its own—from coming to an end."<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> Emphasizing a material poetics, Bruns's study engages a rich practice by a number of contemporary sonosophers and shows poetry to be inherently on-going and processual—a characteristic which aptly defines the work of the Baroness. Similarly for Johanna Drucker, the "strongest link between visual and sound performance is their mutual emphasis upon material as a primary, rather than incidental or secondary, consideration."<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> Throughout the Baroness's oeuvre, her own body is the primary material of her poetics; adorning it, as she does in hand-made creations of detritus and found matter, she replicates and extends that praxis acoustically and aurally in her sound poems. By collaging sound bites from her environment—jingles, advertisements, and interrupted strings of conversation, the Baroness links her body to the world around her. As multisensual (not simply visually, acoustically, and orally charged, but also as kinetic and tactile, and deeply aromatic), the Baroness's poems make the reader, listener, viewer sense as she does, and at her will. In particular, the Baroness's sound poems, by necessarily gesturing to their performance and performativity, enliven the poet and her poems by asserting her voice and its presence in and of the world.</p>
<p>Yet the Baroness's "sounding" has been, for the most part, critically silenced until very recently. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Poems of the Millennium</span>, Jerome Rothenberg and Pierre Joris reprint the Baroness's "Holy Skirts" and "Affectionate" (which were first published in the July–August 1920, and Winter of 1922 issues of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Little Review</span> respectively), while "Klink—Hratzvenga (<span style="font-style:italic;">Deathwail</span>)" has been reprinted in Kostelanetz's prescient anthology of sound poetry scores, <span style="font-style:italic;">Texts-Sound Texts</span>, as well as in the Modern Library edition cited above.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> Significantly, there are no recordings (to date) of the Baroness performing her sound poems. We are, therefore, unable to assess her use of acoustic technology for the enhancement or distortion of sound such as was theorized by, among others, Velimir Khlebnikov in 1921, and F.T. Marinetti in 1933, or as is employed in the later work of such sound practitioners as the Four Horsemen, Henri Chopin, Laurie Anderson, and Caroline Bergval.</p>
<p>In the context of her corporeal and collage-based aesthetics, it is possible to understand the Baroness's sound poetry as a means of materializing herself in the world,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> in particular, in a predominately masculinist genre and artistic milieu. By suggesting, invoking, and conjuring sound-space—that is, the sound texts not simply as texts, but as vocalization whether imagined or performed, the Baroness creates a landscape on which to stand—her territorializing refrain. Such somatic spatiality evokes Schwitters' <span style="font-style:italic;">Gesamtkunstwerk</span>, what Rothenberg and Joris describe as the totalizing work of art he strove to achieve, "an amalgamation of elements from all artistic genres assembled through the common synthesizing principle of radical collage."<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> Whereas Schwitters' <span style="font-style:italic;">Gesamtkunstwerk</span> culminates in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Merzbau</span> tower, the Baroness's multisensual architectural expanse as on-going collage was, in fact, her own body. Interestingly, for Schwitters too, the creation of art is not distinct from the body that produces it, as he writes: "As long as I paint, I also model."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> The Baroness's own work as a model is similarly significant for what it can tell us about her theorization of sound. Offering her services as an artist's model in Paris in 1927, the Baroness produced an advertisement in prose poetry, wherein she promises to bring "art into posing," telling artists to "wake up" from a comatose sleep with "somnolent models."<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> As a model, the Baroness challenges photographic fixity by performing her sensory stimulation, her organicism, her kinetic, perpetual becoming. Through the photographs that have survived of the Baroness modeling in performance, we can see that she attempted to embody the processual development of the photographic negative. She is dancing, dynamic, motile even when still, and so is constantly pushing against the frame.</p>
<p>In "Points Toward a Taxonomy of Sound Poetry," Dick Higgins outlines three types of sound poetry, namely, "folk varieties, onomatopoetic or mimetic types, and nonsense poetries," and five sub-classes, what he calls the "relatively modern classes of sound poetry," which comprise " works in an invented language,  near-nonsense works,  phatic poems,  un-written-out poems, and  notated ones."<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> Within this taxonomy, the Baroness's sound work could be described as straddling Higgins's second (near-nonsense) and third (phatic) classes, its value arising from the interstice of the semantically discernable and meaningful, and the nonsensical, but also as emerging from the creation of an emotionality rich with non-semantic and non-linguistic meaning.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> This latter, phatic aspect recalls André Breton's murmur of potentiality as expounded and revered in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Manifestoes of Surrealism</span> . Breton, encouraging violent juxtaposition as a means of attaining the perfect image, urges a yielding to a kind of pre-utterance or pre-conception: "Put your trust in the inexhaustible nature of the murmur," he insists.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> The murmur is a storehouse, so to speak, of perpetual possibility wherein the utterance is indecipherable and therefore unfixed. Similarly, in the word-like constructions that only marginally suggest a semantic origin, the Baroness sounds and resounds the infinite, extending her collage-based aesthetics into the modality and tonality of emotion.</p>
<p>Proficient in two languages, the Baroness had a certain elasticity at her disposal and yet, as we see in terms of her expansive polygeneric experimentations, approximations would not do. The Baroness aimed instead at creating the <span style="font-style:italic;">thing</span> itself. As Gertrude Stein did in ridding her work of nouns, the Baroness breaks both the German and English language apart, reconnecting them in a meandering, circuitous gallantry—an inclusive, democratic refrain that is transnational and transrational. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Like the Baroness's characteristic and highly innovative portmanteau words in her non-sound based poems, the word-like constructions within her sonic work can be read themselves as miniature poems. The constructions are like palimpsests in which the earlier inscriptions are insufficiently erased, brought into discursive view simultaneously with the uppermost script. The poems hinge on the generative, the slippage into perpetual possibility. The very nature of collage, montage, and the palimpsest with which her work is so engaged is such that it is always <span style="font-style:italic;">becoming</span>, encoding that which is absent in being over-written or re-contextualized.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Song to a Hairless Dog</h1>
<p>Take a listen to a brief excerpt from a curious, unpublished sound poem by the Baroness entitled "Herzlücke is Nicke Verpo," which we suggest can be read (and heard) as a companion poem to "Klink—Hratzvenga (<span style="font-style:italic;">Deathwail</span>)."</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>Askose Mastuse<br>Mastitte—ta—ti!<br>Mastititte ta—titte—ta—titte<br>—ta———— —<br>Aaaaaaaajaaaaaa<br>Haaaaaaracka-racka-<br>Rackshuuuuuu—uuuuu<br>—uuuuuujuuuuuuluuuuu<br>Juuuuuuluuuuuuujuuuuu<br>Mum—mumble bum—bum<br>… <sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The Baroness was a lover of animals, and of dogs, in particular. The poem, with its cryptic subtitle, "Sung to Chachuachontepotepetl Hairless Mexican Dog Dead," is undated, but lends itself to an elegiac celebration of the life of Mexican revolutionary General Pancho Villa. We can only speculate that its writing was sparked by the occasion of his violent death on July 20, 1923 (just a week after the Baroness's forty-ninth birthday, and two months after the death of her own father). Dada was preoccupied with death, and so was the Baroness, as many of her poems collected in <span style="font-style:italic;">Body Sweats: The Uncensored Writings of Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven</span> indicate. Not un-coincidentally, 1923 also marked the Baroness's anticlimactic return to Berlin, which she found (after her thirteen-year stay in America) to be cold, unwelcoming, and spiritually atrophied. The devastated post-war Berlin to which she returned was, at least to her depressed psyche, without the rigorous artistic exuberance and life drive it once had, and which characterized the passion that so clearly moved the revolutionary antics of Villa.</p>
<p>An outlaw in his youth, Villa became an important Mexican revolutionary leader, as the commander of the Division of the North and governor of the state of Chihuahua. Devoted to the working people, Villa was celebrated for his Robin-Hood-like stealing from the rich to give to the poor.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> When Villa allegedly accepted German aide in supplying him with ammunition, he was thereafter considered a German sympathizer.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Retiring to Chihuahua following the end of the revolution in 1920, Villa was ambushed and killed there in 1923. Certainly Villa's pugnaciousness, as well as his loyalty to the poor, would have appealed to the fiercely anti-bourgeois Baroness, who also lived in abject poverty. His assumed German sympathy and betrayal by the United States would also have resonated with the Baroness, whose own American sojourn left her feeling alienated and under-appreciated during this period.</p>
<p>Thus the German "Herzlücke" of the title, meaning "heart gap," very likely refers to the hole in the poet's own heart, but also suggests the shots that killed Villa. This "heart gap" is echoed in "kussmaherloze" (kiss my heartless/hearthole), and in "herloze" suggesting "heartless" but also "her loss." Interestingly, although conred as a male subject, the "Nicke Verpo" of the title phonically suggests a yoking of the German "Nicht" meaning "not" and the English "verbal," implying that the heart gap/lacuna experienced is not possible to convey in words, only in feeling, and therefore, only via the emotive howl of the poem's sonic constructions.<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> The title then contains a meta-poetic statement on sound poetry as a genre. The conflation in the subtitle of "Chihuahua" and what appears, at least through phonetic approximation, to be "Queztalcoatl," certainly has tremendous significance to the Baroness's poetic cosmogony. Often depicted as a man-bird serpent, Queztalcoatl is known as the Plumed Serpent in Mexican mythology.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> In some portrayals, Queztalcoatl is the God of civilization, protector of lightness and good. He is pitted against the evil of the deity Tezcatlipoca by whom he was ultimately deceived and banished—left to wander the land until he was consumed by fire. The symbol of Queztalcoatl echoes that of a snake, which res prominently throughout the Baroness's poems as phallic symbol but also, in biting its own tail, as indicative of circularity and perpetuity, an image present in her poems "Snaketale" (with its refrain "All one/One all"), "Orgasmic Toast" ("Thy/Circlebrains/Radiant/Snake/Hails"), and "Circle" ("Behind/Serpent/I wait/Round").<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> In this context, the Mexican breed of small dogs, the Chihuahua (the "hairless Mexican Dog"), becomes the plumed serpent, as an analogy is drawn between the ultimate betrayal of Villa and the re of Queztalcoatl.</p>
<p>Significantly, the occasional words containing recognizable semantic roots do little to anchor the poem, but instead keep the clinamatic flow in motion. The "HAAAAARACKA—RACKA" of the poem plays with the trope of "Haar" meaning literally "hair," referring, we imagine, to Villa's famously hirsute moustache, but most obviously evoking the short-haired dog, all the more as the long-stretched "aaaaa" and the plosive "ck" phonetically sound the growling and barking of a dog. Similarly, the fluid string of soft "a" sounds butt up against the consonants in a strangulated utterance of despair. Moreover, a construction like "Medewrarwrarjor" sounds like a loosely veiled "M'aider in war, major," suggesting a reference to Villa as revolutionary hero. Consider also the ironic evocation of consumerism in the repetition of "marktpliss" (market place/market bliss), central not only to the Baroness's own anti-consumerist art, but also to the fact that Villa notoriously printed his own money to fund his cause.<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> The construction "Orlass-doch-dna" and "Orlassmich" of the final stanza contains the German "Lass doch," meaning "let it be," implying a yielding to the poem's wordless, vibratory signification. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Interestingly, "Herzlücke" rhymes with "Glücke," a poetic term for happiness in German, and so evokes ironically "Her luck." A variation on this theme appears in "mluck," which conjures "my luck," and "frjwück" with its implication of "Frau luck." Thus the poem identifies the poet herself with the central subject of "Nicke Verpo"—at once Villa, and that which cannot be uttered in semantic language. A return to the implication of "heart hole," or gap, is seen in the third stanza through the extensive play on "lack"—the poem's mourning "Cravan/colossal absentee/the substitute dark," as Mina Loy writes in "The Widow's Jazz," her own poem on the disappearance and likely death of her husband Arthur Cravan off the coast of Mexico in 1918.<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Duet: A Love Song in Sound</h1>
<p>In a poem like "Duet: Eigasing Rin Jalamund," subtitled "Man Wooing Maid: Notes in Letters," the Baroness prioritizes the libidinal, erotic aspects of language and sound in its various stages of undress. Take a listen to the opening lines:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>Aggnntárrr—nnjarrré—knntnirrr —<br>Eigasing—kjnnquirrr!</p></div>

</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The poem's couplets seem to oscillate between masculine and feminine voices as a lovers' duet, but also as the song of oneself—the masculine and feminine aspects of us all, the androgyny to which the Baroness's own art and self-presentation espoused. In this sense, "Eigasing" can also be heard as "Ego sing." The poem's dominant play on "Jalamund/Mund" (from the German word for "mouth" and pronounced in German with a long "u"), emphasizes orality, but specifically an eroticized orality. In a letter to <span style="font-style:italic;">Little Review</span> co-editor Margaret Anderson, the Baroness refers to the poem as a "precious <span style="font-style:italic;">sound love</span> poem … and frisky sex play"—yielding lines such as "Mund—avnurrr!" with its sensual purring.<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> The rolling "r's," as they disperse outward rather  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> than inward emphasize the surface, and so contribute to the "lighter" sound of the poem as compared, for instance, to the piercing depth of interiority characterizing the "i" sounds in "Klink—Hratzvenga (<span style="font-style:italic;">Deathwail</span>)." In her handwritten manuscript of the poem (<a name="2-text" href="#2">re 2</a>), the Baroness clearly indicates a visual notation of the intended performance of sound based on an alternation in color scheme from black to red, wherein insistence in emphasis and pacing is signaled in red. A pointedness is certainly conveyed in the Baroness's red dotting of "i's," as is an underscoring of the connectivity she espouses (between media, between the senses, and between herself and her audience in performance) in her use of red ink to inscribe her characteristic and plentiful dashes and hyphens. Affirming life in rhythmical movement, the poem is interspersed with colloquial interjections in a play on the German "Ja," meaning "yes," as in "Trall<span style="font-style:italic;">ja</span>," "Ei—jei—<span style="font-style:italic;">ja</span>," and "<span style="font-style:italic;">Ja</span>lamund." The poem's bawdy song is in keeping with the kinds of limericks we know she enjoyed. (In her unpublished "Verses from 'The Old Inn at the River Lahn,'" for example, the Baroness writes ignominiously: "There's he/Of amazing anatomy/His cock crooked like a 'B'/How he fucks is a/Mystery."<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup>) In the case of "Duet," however, the Baroness makes an explicit reference to the German lullaby "Eia Popeia"—a nonsense rhyme—in her use of "Eia," as well as in "Eigasing," an apparent linguistic hybrid of "Eia" and "gas/sing," as well as "Ei," meaning "egg." In this context, a construction such as "knoxmustwa" in the poem can be heard as "knocking must we," or more clearly, "knocking as they must against one another"—the sex act as staccato sonority. In this un-sentimentalized portrayal of coitus, the suggestion of the German word "Affen" meaning "monkey" in "Affndjnorr!" also contributes a slapstick element to the poem in which the construction "mmrrrei" resonates as "merry/marry."</p>
<p>Finally, the orgiastic aspects of the poem become its paean of bodily function. In a conflation of Freud's famous oral and anal stages of development, the Baroness lets the "ArrLoche" (evocative of "Arschloch," or "asshole") speak—re-sounding Bloom's musical accompaniment to the "Siren" chapter of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>: his orchestral fart. In the Baroness's wind song (her "eiagasing"), the poem's concluding "PPPPFFFFFFPHPHPHPHPHARRRLLLLLLJUUUU," she affirms her sound poetry as bodily performance art, and as the "sonic délire," of which Rasula and McCaffery write; sounding the echo of her own bodily exuberance, the Baroness's poems emerge from the "agnostic struggle between structured semiosis and eruptive materiality."<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> For the Baroness, sound was a means of orientation, a mapping and an on-going arrival. Similarly, for Deleuze and Guattari, "the final end of music" is a deterritorializing of the refrain such as the Baroness accomplishes in her simultaneously destabilizing and transfixing sonority. "[R]elease it in the Cosmos," Deleuze and Guattari urge of the refrain, "that is more important than building a new system."<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup> In the Cosmos, as in Breton's infinite "murmur," and the clinamatic proliferation of the Baroness's linguistic, acoustic, visual, and oral collaging, is the perpetuity of becoming. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>In a letter to Djuna Barnes, the Baroness would confess, "For you know—how I judge by sounds," a motto she exuberantly performed in her sonic poetry. Whether atonal or tonal, emotive howl or seductive purr, the Baroness used sound in all its complexity to effect a continuity (in the face of increasing socio-cultural alienation) between her body, her mind, and a myriad of modernist moments. It comes as no surprise that those who remember the Baroness decades after her death remember the sound of her distinctive voice reciting her poems aloud in the offices of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Little Review</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">The Liberator</span>. In his memoir <span style="font-style:italic;">A Long Way from Home</span>, poet and <span style="font-style:italic;">Liberator</span> editor Claude McKay vividly recalls the Baroness's "masculine throaty voice," while Margaret Anderson depicts her "strewing tin cans down the stairs, hurling terrible and guttural curses over her shoulder for three flights."<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> Barnes too captures the Baroness's voice in its all-too-human physicality, observing that it was hoarse because of her syphilitic condition; while Maxwell Bodenheim perhaps best sums up her corporality of sound when he notes: "It is refreshing to see someone claw aside the veils and rush forth howling, vomiting, and leaping nakedly. In a revel of poised and intricate sensuality and intellectuality, … it is a blessing to come upon an unconscious volcano now and then."<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup> The Baroness's corporeal sounds trumpeted a new post-war era that made her, in the words of Rexroth, "the perfect expression of immediate post-war Rhineland Dadaism."<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup></p>
<p>As we have shown, the sound poems of the Baroness extend the permutational compositions of her collage-based, somatically charged aesthetics, and perform—even as visual texts—the disintegration of boundaries between her body and everyday life. The Baroness's poems (be they sonic, visual, or lyrical) transfix the nerves of her readers with shock (or recognition), intercepting experience and perception, performing the polyvalences of language and communication. Although her sound poems are politically, psychically, emotionally, and physically charged, they are more like electrochemical impulses that can and do work on the level of emotional-sensory vibration. "The acoustic poem," Steve McCaffery explains, "bypasses the cortex and addresses itself to the Central Nervous System. Energy transmits as fragmented linguistic particles, sound, vibration, and electrochemical forces to the spinal column."<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> The readings we have offered here are, of course, provisional and necessarily so given that we are dealing with mostly undated, un-contextualized poems. However, such provision is the point, not only of the Baroness's sound poems, but of her oeuvre at large. As a fiercely anti-categorical artist, the Baroness aimed at a proliferation of representation and signification. By demonstrating our own points of entry into the Baroness's complexity, we have suggested not what the poems mean, so much as how readers and listeners can use the materiality of the sound texts to hear their multisensuality. This investigation into the Baroness's reveling in Dada sound is meant to broaden the scope of future research into her work, while also establishing her contributions to the genealogy of sound poetry—a genealogy in which, until relatively recently, very few women re. Like one such presence, however, her contemporary Gertrude Stein, the Baroness's engagement of language's materiality in and through the body results in a generative expansion of verbal powers and poetics. Ultimately, the Baroness's sonic poems presage  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the tension between the typically rhyming meter and transgressive sound and lyrics characterizing the quintessential punk rock song, with its "Harpsichords/Metallic/Howl—." A precursor to punk singer-songwriter Patti Smith and German rock diva Nina Hagen, the Baroness as her own "Mistress/Plenipotent," voices a "Sensuous/Sense," as she writes in an unpublished poem, dislocating and liberating meaning in an on-going proliferation of fissions and fusions.<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup></p>

Carranza cut off coal supply to Villa's men and the US embargoed  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> arms shipments to Villa. In only the second attack on US land, General Villa raided Columbus New Mexico in March of 1916 for their breech of loyalty, solidifying his severance with the US.

In Mesoamerica, the bird and serpent are symbolic representations of two regions significant to religious and cosmological thought: heaven and earth. In Mesoamerican symbolism, this double entity is a synthesis of opposites: it conjugates the destructive and germinal powers of the earth (the serpent) with the fertile and ordering forces of the heavens (the bird)." Certainly the contradictory dual nature of Quetzalcoatl would have appealed to the Baroness.</p></div>

<h1 class="sec-headA">Introduction</h1>
<p>The automobile headlamp is a modest device, a practical necessity introduced late in the nineteenth century, swiftly standardized in operation and assimilated to driving codes and conventions and, just as quickly, forgotten, except when it fails to work. Yet the headlight—the light produced by the headlamp—introduced a luminous space unprecedented in its ubiquitous mobility. Suddenly in conflict with other, prior spaces, the headlight became distinctly social: designed, regulated, adjudicated, and conditioning the behavior of its occupants relative to their specific position. Inside the headlight, drivers and passengers found themselves at the vertex of a luminous cavity moving through a mantle of dark, while outside, at the headlight's periphery, other drivers and pedestrians were insulted by the visual violence of sudden glare and the peril of collision. The headlight's social dynamism was grounded in its conflict of these new subject positions, each of which required a new kind of vision. Pedestrians learned to overcome "sudden blindness,"  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the ephemeral disability caused by the glare of oncoming headlights, while drivers learned to master a novel visual world.</p>
<p>By day, light fell from above, equally on all things; drivers calibrated their motion against a diverse visual backdrop uniformly rendered in all directions. By night, the headlamp projected a bright, horizontal light. Objects appeared less as solid forms than as conrations of variously reflective surfaces, which changed as the car moved and the angle of the projecting beam changed. For the night driver, the world seen through the tunnel of road ahead became a specular rather than a geometric construct. Drivers focused forward, repeatedly scanned a constantly shifting field of view to classify heterogeneous luminous signals in terms of hindrance, continuance, or irrelevance, and all at relatively high speeds. With the headlight directing attention and forecasting direction, drivers sometimes sensed their headlights as an emanation from themselves, a motorized ocular extramission. Thus, night drivers registered the mechanical energy of the car as a shifting specular world generated by their own forward motion. This auto-specularity suffused the night drive, one of the most thrilling personal experiences in the early twentieth century. Like the early twentieth century's other great visual experience, cinema, night driving was an alloy of visual flux and bodily stasis organized by a beam of horizontal light coincident with the viewer's eye. But it was played out for considerably higher stakes.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Rushing in the Darkness</h1>
<p>Headlamps had been used for some time on moving vehicles such as carriages, bicycles, and locomotives. Typically, on carriages, an oil lamp was hung from a mount at the side of the cab and encased in glass to protect the flame. With neither lens nor reflector, the lamp cast a dim circle around itself, with fraction of the light falling on the road ahead. Reflectors could direct the light but it was still feeble and diluted over a wide arc. For their part, bicycle lamps were dim, awkward to install, liable to sway greatly, and easily extinguished.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> Riding a bicycle at night, particularly along unlighted and unpaved streets, was difficult and motivated only by pressing need or an outsized sense of adventure. Locomotives, in contrast, could carry powerful headlamps that substantially reconred the view ahead but these were limited to use along rail lines, which were isolated, fenced, or otherwise marked off from routine circulation.</p>
<p>Obtaining the point of view of the locomotive engineer in the front cab was rare but by the late nineteenth century a marvel of modernity—the private experience of speed—had become a common literary trope. Speed was most vivid at night, when darkness shrouded distance and diminished motion parallax. To the eyes, speed was an incandescent spectacle, a phantasmagoria of moving lights. To the mind it was a puzzle of trembling flicker, glare, and glint—terms that soon acquired technical definitions—dissociated from and even dissembling the substance and identity of the otherwise coherent objects upon which they played. One of the best descriptions of this visual voyage appeared in <span style="font-style:italic;">Scientific American</span> in 1902. The author, an editor at the journal, began with an account of the pressing demands on the engineer's full attention. As a  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> guest, however, he was at leisure to take in the "pure sensationalism" of the experience and its appeal to his entire body. The train roars like a "strident orchestra"; the "great mass of the engine vibrates and lurches and rolls" and threatens "to rend itself into a thousand fragments." For the eye, the effect was otherworldly: the headlight, aligned with the driver's vision, was focused, bright, and horizontal. Everyday objects caught in it were reconred in terms of the constituent reflectivity of their component surfaces while independent light sources hurtled toward him. All perception of distance was extinguished and the ability to identify objects underlying the glimmer was greatly curtailed, recognized at only the last instant, if at all:</p>

<p class="continued">At high speeds the specular spray emerging from "the near darkness"—vision evacuated of its contextualizing daytime perspective—acquired its own rhythm and luminous sequence, perpetually flowering into lucent form. The most visually intense moments were passing through stations, where various lamps were fused by the observer's speed into a new dimension of light:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>you sweep down upon a mass of white lights, red lights, headlights, whirling hand lamps, dwarf signal lights below, and arc lights above, with two or three switching locomotives to heighten the crowded effect! … at the very front end of this roaring cataract of steel and fire.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Although few would witness the world at such speed, the mass production of automobiles and the steady improvement in automobile lighting equipment meant that thousands and, soon, millions of drivers could venture out in their cars after sundown to occupy a similar position propelling a cone of light into the night.</p>
<p>Modeled on earlier forms of transportation, the first automobiles carried lights of some type. Often, they were hung from the side of the car so that the driver could readily adjust them. Headlamps, either one or two, were mounted on the front of the vehicle and fueled by oil or acetylene, which was especially bright and resistant to being extinguished by wind. Electric headlamps were introduced at the end of the nineteenth century, but they were more delicate than and not as bright as acetylene, which remained a viable option through the 1910s. As filaments became brighter and more durable, and as electrical systems with generators of ever-higher voltages became more sophisticated, reliable, and standard a feature across manufacturers, electric headlamps became the norm. Many drivers put together a composite system with, for instance, electric headlamps supplied by the manufacturer and a custom, side-mounted acetylene "searchlight" that could be aimed wherever the driver chose and, as was often the case, removed to illuminate flat tires or to make other unplanned repairs.</p>
<p>The number of registered automobiles skyrocketed, from some 8,000 nationwide in 1900 to over 450,000 ten years later to more than eight million by 1920.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> The flood of cars and their careless drivers brought with it "a number of evils," including smoke, unpleasant odors, dust, the "needless tooting of the horn," and "flaring acetylene headlights" that were "an actual annoyance and possible source of danger to pedestrians and horse-drawn vehicles." Headlights from dockside cars were even distracting to ferry pilots.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> As early as 1900, the automobile was labeled "the new juggernaut" for its speed, mass, freedom of movement, and its seeming indifference to darkness.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> Regardless, in ever-greater numbers drivers followed their headlights into the night.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Night Driving</h1>
<p>Night driving appealed to all the senses: wind pressing the face, whistling and whooshing sounds as the car flew along the road, a varied somatic awareness of wheels skittering over different road surfaces, the rumble of the motor, and swaying sensations  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that intensified at turns. But the visual aspects of speeding in the dark were the most gratifying. The world wore a new aspect at night and even familiar scenes were changed, refreshed. For all but the most practiced night driver,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>no matter how well he may know the road by daylight, he is often utterly at a loss to recognize familiar objects and will even pass the place to which he desires to go without being aware of it, when traveling over the same road after dark.

</div>
<div class="reEnd"></div>
</div>
<p class="continued">Although "unnatural," such effects were deemed different from, rather than less than the same scene by daylight.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> The power of night vision was exercised, indeed, discovered, in the unique space generated by headlights: a roughly circular scene filled with objects constantly approaching the car but never coming into contact with it, as long as one's luck held. The scene was structured by certain constants, too, including the circumference of night; the road surface, which bisected the scene and was always brightening as it approached; a number of minor lights emanating from the dashboard, sidelights, reflective materials or actual lamps along the road, and reflections off the glass windshield or polished parts of the car; and, most menacingly, headlights, usually  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> glaring, from other automobiles. Although drivers had always to remain alert to potential dangers signified by these elements, they combined with other sensations of motion to create perhaps the most enthralling entertainment of the time.</p>
<p>Harold Whiting Slauson, an automobile enthusiast and author of many articles and books on cars, noted the growing popularity of driving in the dark: "night driving seems to be becoming more and more a popular feature of automobiling, to judge by the number of headlight and searchlight accessories to be found."<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> He went on to articulate "the joys of night driving." The "pleasure of motoring," wrote Slauson, "is doubled when even familiar scenes are traversed after sundown." The reason for the doubled pleasure was itself twofold, headlights and speed. Headlights rendered forms in a novel fashion, even as daytime habits made them all but invisible. The strong sidewise light exaggerated forms and threw long shadows from them that joined up with the surrounding darkness. Speed simultaneously foreshortened objects and condensed observational time: objects appeared vaguely at first, perhaps as just a flash from a polished surface, bloomed gradually into nocturnal form, then sharpened for an instant and, just as swiftly, were gone, giving way to another baffling flash from the darkness ahead. Even trivial roadside elements, said Slauson, "assume an entirely new aspect when touched by the soft moonlight or the flickering, flaring headlights that bring approaching objects into a relief all the more strong because of the contrast with the shadows into which they quickly fade."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>In turn, peering into the headlight sparked a new kind of attention that was simultaneously vigilant and relaxing. Unremitting focus was requisite since even minor lapses in attention could have devastating results. As described in an English periodical, drivers operated in a state of constant emergency: road surfaces changed from one instant to the next; traffic flowed with, against, and at all angles to their own direction of travel; they were alert for curious children, sleeping cattle, deer hypnotized by headlights, stumbling drunkards, and "even for the lovers strolling along and neglecting the road and its occupants, because, forsooth, they tread on air!" Even passengers ought to refrain from "unnecessary talking." Everything on the road had to be quickly identified and assessed for any threat to forward motion. Purposeful, prolonged gazing into the space of the headlight was the visual behavior produced by speed—"when time is much too valuable to spend in thinking"—which, in turn, lifted the driver into an alternate or aesthetic frame of mind: "it is without any doubt this necessity for concentration, this ever-present call for watchfulness, that makes up a great part of the charm of driving a motor" and, along with a mechanical awareness of the car itself, contribute to "the complement of joy to the complete motorist."<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Night driving was taxing but restorative, repetitively scanning a sequence of reflected light displaced the day's distracting, random juxtapositions with a singular focus. As another analysis went, at night "the rapid passage of the car gives rise to a sense of buoyancy and the reaction therefrom causes a feeling of drowsiness which makes the autoist sleep like the proverbial top."<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> In some instances, the driver's attention seemed less the purposeful control of perceptual stimuli than the almost automatic effect of the headlight, which effectively screened out irrelevant information and thereby eased  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the chore of concentration: "the inability to see the minute details of grade, surface, etc., leaves the motorist comparatively free from nervous strain," ran a representative view.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> In similar accounts, drivers could almost surrender themselves to the experience: "the autoist unconsciously follows the beam of light in driving," as if the headlight were a kind of instinct.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>Country roads especially enhanced night driving, in several ways. For one, they were relatively traffic-free, inviting drivers to go faster. Fewer lights in the countryside also meant less competition for the driver's attention. In contrast, the city dissolved the volatile space of the headlight in its wash of street lighting. Many people argued that headlights were, in fact, unneeded in cities. "The big headlights are for unlighted country roads—not for boulevards. They are not allowed in New York. Why are they permitted here?" asked one Chicagoan.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> Some cities fined drivers if their lights were too bright or aimed poorly and many cars carried fabrics or paint to veil their lights when they entered a town from the countryside.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> In this sense, night driving was a palliative for urban seeing, especially suited to "nervous persons or those whose occupation keeps them indoors for the greater part of the day."<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> Cities were also too cramped to allow the mental effects of night driving to fully emerge, which only unfolded over time as the eyes steeped in the headlight. Moreover, city drivers were goal-oriented. Presuming non-instrumental conditions for aesthetic reception, Harold Slauson wrote that city driving was a means rather than an end in itself, "a short run to the opera," for instance, that occluded the trip with the destination. The overall result was that "this man," the city driver, gathered only "half of the value and enjoyment that he otherwise could obtain from his car."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> Once headlights wedged open the night, drivers went to the countryside to rediscover the darkness that urban lighting had stolen.</p>
<p>Whereas cities sharpened their cosmopolitan profile with street and festival lighting, the countryside was recast as an undifferentiated domain of empty darkness waiting to be sliced apart by motorized thrill seekers. During the day, the car might be hindered by a horse-drawn wagon or by cattle being driven down the road, in an emblematic encounter of work and leisure rewritten in terms of transportation progress. The standing trope was that of the driver, leaning on the horn, able to leave behind the city but not his impatience. Night driving upturned the equation: the city dweller's leisure was unimpeded but the farmer's rest was broken by the roar of a motor and the sudden sweep of a headlight inside a rural bedroom. City drivers went to the countryside for "midnight 'tears'," so named because the speeding cars "tear up space."<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> Night-blanketed country roads thus read as the inverse profile of accelerating and diversifying urban life, at a time of tremendous infrastructural growth and soaring immigration. In this context, distinctions between city and country night driving appear more ideological than descriptive.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Moral Blindness of Glare</h1>
<p>In nearly any discussion of the matter, the speed of the automobile at night was dependent on the quality of the headlamps or, to put it another way, speed was <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p class="continued">proportional to the character of the luminous space into which the car continually headed. Powerful beams deepened visual space, which translated directly into more time, which could then be compressed further by pressing on the accelerator. Better headlights and faster driving were reciprocal as, for instance, Mitchell May, then New York's Secretary of State, put it: "As the speed of motor cars has increased, so have the power and efficiency of the lighting system improved." Headlights had grown so bright recently that they blanched roads "for several hundred yards, every object being bathed in a flood of brilliant white light." With good headlights and less traffic at night, "it is often perfectly safe to drive at high speeds … in reality a good deal safer than it would be in daylight."<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> At the same time they made driving safer, brighter lamps also made it more dangerous for those at the headlight's periphery: "higher intensity lighting equipments have, in solving the problem of lighting the road, introduced a  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> new and serious problem in that they temporarily blind the driver or pedestrian who happens to come within their angle of action."<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup></p>

<p>As May was quick to note, the new brightness led to a new visual disorder:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>There are few situations more paralyzing to the traveler of any description than meeting a motor car with powerful headlights. All that is visible to him is a pair of eye-scorching white disks set in the midst of impenetrable darkness. Anything that may be on either side of or behind those lights—man or beast—is absolutely invisible to him.</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In his elected role, May regulated businesses, including the burgeoning automotive trade. But the brighter lights he championed were spawning an epidemic of temporary blindness. Dimmer lights were just as bad, though, since drivers would have less scope in their view and thus less time to resolve oncoming objects. What was most needed,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> he thought, was a technical solution, some sort of "glare-subduer in the construction of the lamp itself."<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Glare is the product of several factors, including brightness of the light source, position of the source in the field of view, total volume of light entering the eye, length of exposure to the source, and degree of contrast with a background. Headlights glaring at night might not be noticed by day, for example. Glare, in short, is subjective, evident in the way lighting engineers described it: "any brightness within the field of vision of such a character as to cause discomfort, annoyance, interference with vision, or eye fatigue."<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> With more drivers following more headlights into the night, glare was becoming a national concern: "'Glare' is the one word most used in referring to the blinding effect of high candle-power units. This question probably commands more widespread interest at the present time than any other problem within the scope of the illuminating engineer."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>The eye-scorching discomfort of bright headlights was readily anthropomorphized to denote the threatening gaze of an assailant. They were often likened to a menacing beast. Cars were said to creep up on bystanders at night to "burst upon the vision" and, in one account, the "white ghosts and red devils" of the car lights frightened a man "out of at least seven years' growth."<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> They recalled "beasts in narratives of apocalyptic visions" such as Daniel's description of a "beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; it had iron teeth" or St. John's similar description of a beast of metal that "left a very disagreeable odor behind them…. If these machines were beasts, why may not the modern road locomotive not be classed as an animal?"<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> The question, in fact, had a legal basis. The automobile's legitimacy on the road was analogized to wagons drawn by horse or oxen teams that already occupied public roadways legally. Early court decisions explicitly weighed whether automobiles were, in effect, animals and should be judged accordingly. Although widely acknowledged as "a dangerous instrumentality," cars were ultimately "not classed with ferocious animals." One collection of cases cites a Georgia appeals court case, Lewis v. Amorous, on the matter: "It is not the ferocity of automobiles that is to be feared, but the ferocity of those who drive them. They are not to be classed with bad dogs, vicious bulls, and evil disposed mules and the like."<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>All-too evident to many observers was that drivers frequently did behave like ferocious animals once they got behind the wheel. Drivers, intoxicated—a frequent analogy—with speed, metamorphosed into "speed maniacs" or "fiends" or "road hogs."<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> Ordinary men by daylight, they became grave hazards in the dark. Newspapers carried countless reports of crazed drivers confusing, frightening, and striking pedestrians and animals.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> The rush of sensations reaped by speeding at night was a solvent that dissolved good judgment and loosened morals. If already so inclined, drivers exploited night driving to further their misdeeds. Formerly fleeing on foot, criminals were newly empowered to speed away in a private car, not only faster but further distanced from observation by the dazzling veil thrown over the car by the street lamps it passed.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup></p>
<p>For law-abiding citizens, too, the streaming space of the headlight could lead to drunken behaviors ranging from reckless to libidinous to illegal. A physician in Chicago identified "the automobile eye," a state of confusion caused by the unnatural strain of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> seeing at high speed. Frequent drivers like chauffeurs were especially vulnerable and "chronically misjudged speed and distances and thus went blindly into collisions. The flickering of the passing road and landscape had much to do with the eye disease." Yet, as a French scientist explained, such drivers continued motoring, seduced into prolonged and unnatural use of their eyes by the exhilaration of driving.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> The overall result was an "urban madness" of "Wild Cars … and Their Wilder Occupants … the new terror of city life":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>the new terror that haunts the city's ways, lurching around a corner to run down the heedless pedestrian, whirling out of the fastnesses of night to a shower of light, a purr of engines, and a wake of fumes; scudding into the lamp glare with a snatch of ribald song and back again into the black from which it emerged with its gay burden; crashing into posts …<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">"Joy riding" was the name given to such behavior, and it was exacerbated at night. Rambling in a realm beyond decent manners, joy riding was night driving gone bad. With men the vast majority of drivers, women were the most vulnerable. As the headlight became an instrument for spotlighting women walking at night and, then, fixing them in its hypnotic grip, so did it re as a beacon of virility and motorized male power, a kind of illuminated phallus that led women to swoon where they stood:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Ladies on bicycles, when fixed by the brilliant gleaming eye approaching them rapidly out of the dark, become confused and embarrassed, and convey their confusion and embarrassment to their iron steeds, which wobble in consequence from one side of the road to the other, to the imminent danger of the lady riders, and the unspeakable terror of the driver of the car.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In some instances, women panicked in the headlight, their ability to reason apparently melted by the glare, often with deadly results: "After passing a powerful light a rider runs into a Stygian darkness, being temporarily blinded," and thus likely to have or cause an accident, reported <span style="font-style:italic;">The Motor</span> in a piece on "Lamps and Ladies." The same article discussed one driver who, dazzled by a passing car, gleaned a woman running across the road but then, "She hesitated, and turned back (when will women give up this reprehensible habit?), and, to avoid her, the driver had to turn the car towards the pavement," striking the woman and throwing the car's passenger to his death. A court found it to be a case of accidental death due to the driver's temporary blindness.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup></p>
<p>Women were seemingly unable to resist "the romance of the night riding auto" and submitted, "clandestinely" and against their clearer daytime judgment, to the car's "nocturnal wanderings."<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> The narrative structure of most joy ride cautionary tales involved, first, "some half-drunken ruffians," then a woman or two who "foolishly assented" to join them and, finally, an accident resulting in injury or death, often accompanied by last words of regret. Further, with women present, the male driver's behavior only worsened as he tried to outdo himself in recklessness. As the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Tribune</span> reported, "It has become 'the regular thing' for a certain class of automobilists to invite almost any girls whom they may see on the street to ride with them and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the fascination of the sport often tempts girls who ought to know better … 'joy riders' never run quite so recklessly as when they have thus picked up some foolish or vicious women as their companions."<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> Men were seduced by the power they controlled and "succumbed to the temptation of speed."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> Consonant with ancient tropes, temptation, in turn, was women's work. Cars were generally gendered female, with the purring engine a siren's song. In springtime, for instance, while the world or, at least in this case, Long Island, blossomed with thoughts of love, "… not a few who ordinarily are to be classed as safe and sane drivers, yield to the temptation of 'stepping on her'."<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> In this way, mastery of a new technology—the car—a new activity—night driving—and a new space—the penetrating cone of the headlight—was a potent demonstration of male power over nature and women, if not always over oneself.</p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">The Speed Mania is on the Wane</h1>
<p>With headlights the focus of a national controversy over visual perception, calls rang out for more regulation and better lamps. "The headlights are a menace," began a typical comment, "they almost blind the pedestrian as the car approaches and make it impossible for the driver of a vehicle of any sort to see where he is going as he nears the dazzling lights."<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> Public clamor was leading to a "campaign against glaring headlights nation wide." Indeed, "war has been declared … on the blinding headlights of automobiles within the city limits… There can be no doubt that the glaring headlight problem is one of the most serious confronting the automobile engineers, the municipal  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and national authorities, and the public at large."<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> Whereas street lighting indicated a city's wealth, headlight regulation was soon seen as a measure of its civility.</p>
<p>Municipalities enjoyed considerable autonomy in setting headlight laws, which varied from one town to the next. Amber lens filters were acceptable in New Jersey, but not in New York, which meant that drivers could be fined crossing the Hudson if they failed to change their lamps. Delaware had no restrictions on headlights but Wilmington did.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> Newspapers frequently reported on "an owner who found his lights were regarded as all right in one place and all wrong in another."<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> Courts heard cases regarding headlights under numerous circumstances: on curves, when the car was not in motion, at dawn and dusk, whether the dashboard was the "front" of the car where the headlight could be mounted, who was at fault when a car struck an unlit vehicle or bicycle, even whether it was legal to drive at night on unfamiliar roads. Failing to pull over when faced with bright oncoming lights could be illegal: "It is negligence to drive on when one's eyes are blinded by the headlight of an approaching vehicle."<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> Glare from the sun and light distorted by fog or rain were likewise reasons to stop the car.</p>
<p>Early laws were notably vague, usually specifying only that headlights be "non-glare," just as speed was often limited to what was "reasonable and proper." But glare was notoriously hard to define. In response to a Massachusetts headlight law, the president of the state's Automobile Club complained: "The police tell me they don't know what the law means, they are uncertain what constitutes glare."<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> In response, drivers painted their headlamps, slipped colored gels over them, wrapped them with layers of cheesecloth, or just bent the mounting bracket so the lamp would point downward. Enforcement was difficult and, in fact, police often ignored headlight laws unless an accident renewed public outcry. "Many amusing stories" were told of police ineptitude in judging glare when, for example, one man was arrested twice one night, "once for too much light and again for not enough." The man, it seems, rectified his first violation by putting some rags over his headlights, whereupon a second officer stopped him. The driver explained what had happened and asked the officer "to tell me just how much light I could use. He tried to explain the matter to me, but without success."<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup></p>
<p>Setting standards for glare meant balancing two opposed needs: more light for those inside the car and less light for those outside the car. As the press characterized the dilemma: "The confusion incident to the problem of regulating glaring headlights … is caused by the attempt to discover a method or means for the absolute elimination of glare without reducing to any appreciable extent the road illumination."<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> In addition to the optical properties of the headlamp, engineers had also to consider the speed of the vehicle and the effect of "distracters," that is, other stimuli that might divert cognitive time away from visual perception. Most important, glare was in the eye of the beholder, "affected by age, darkness adaptation, brightness of background, contrast between that and test object, duration of exposure, brightness of pre-exposure, color of stimulus, portion of retina stimulated, movement of test object, flicker, disease, and fatigue."<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> Individuals recovered their night vision at different rates in relation not only to the light source but also in relation to a particular stage of dark adaptation. The eye recovered quickly from a "relatively blinded state," for instance, but complete adaptation could take an hour.<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>The situation was complicated further by headlamp makers. It was a lucrative market: headlamps were one-quarter of General Electric's lamp sales in 1924, for example, and cars averaged six headlamp replacements per year. Competition for headlight dollars resulted in numerous lamps and lighting arrangements and frequent, often confusing enhancements to filaments, switching circuits, reflector shapes, lens geometry, and so on.<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> Bulbs were screwed, snapped or slid into place, which could throw off the lamp's focus, as might bumps in the road. Makers also tried various dimming schemes such as tilting lamps downward to "dip" the headlight, entailing more moving parts subject to deviations from time, turbulence, and neglect. Still, as General Motors claimed for its Cadillac line, dipping the lamps avoided "derangement of the vision" and assured "safe and pleasurable night driving."<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> Manufacturers laid the burden of care on consumers. "I Have <span style="font-style:italic;">Only Myself</span> to Blame," ran an advertisement for Osgood lenses, with a prismatic lens that threw light downward. The ad highlighted the driver's remorse at having chosen an inferior brand of headlight that "blinded and frightened the other man…. It was an awful nightmare." Although safety was the consumer's responsibility, speed was his reward. The driver voiced remorse in this and similar advertisements while the manufacturer pitched excitement and euphoria: Osgood "lights the road far ahead for greatest speed" but without the distraction of dimming or dipping.<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup></p>
<p>Headlight laws gradually became more uniform. Like other states, New York's headlight laws, for instance, were vague at first, requiring only that lamps be "non-glare." Citizens petitioned for a list of approved lamps that, when finally published, included more than two dozen types. In 1918, the state made national news by consulting with  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> illuminating engineers to determine measurable standards. The resulting law, however, in specifying candlepower at a precise point in space relative to the headlamp, meant police had to carry specialized instruments to determine compliance.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup> The steady march toward standards made night driving less stressful but so, too, did empathy for the effects of glare on other drivers. As the <span style="font-style:italic;">Atlanta Constitution</span> reported, "the speed mania is on the wane," signaling the return to a general sense of civility as well as more consistent enforcement. Even railroads had stopped racing to shave minutes from schedules. The whole country, it appeared, was calming down.<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> A number of years would pass before state and federal lawmakers, illuminating engineers, automobile clubs, headlamp makers, automobile manufacturers, and the driving public would settle on national standards for headlights, most decisively in the late 1930s with the arrival of the sealed beam headlamp, an integrated assembly of lamp, reflector and lens within a sealed enclosure filled with an inert gas. All elements were optimized in the factory and rigidly mounted by the manufacturer. Drivers could stop thinking about their headlights and instead focus on the luminous kaleidoscope ceaselessly unfolding before them.<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Headlights and Visual Culture Studies</h1>
<p>Automobility attracts a good deal of discussion, especially following res such as Paul Virilio and his speculations regarding dromoscopy, the practice and effect of seeing at high speeds. Often, writers straining to describe new aesthetic and subjective formations premised on novel optical conditions swiftly analogize driving, or more precisely, apprehending motion through a windshield, to other forms of visual experience. Virilio himself likens the windshield to film, a screen, an easel, a mirror, and a glass door, all otherwise distinct mediating objects that, based on selected properties, are joined to a trajectory that arcs high above phenomenological specificity, that generalizes episodic, qualified, and contested cultural encounters, and that is usually indifferent to historical development.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> Other accounts likewise mention windshields briefly, but nearly always as a step toward our own present-day screen-mediated visual culture.<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup></p>
<p>To be sure, constituent elements of cinema, for example, and driving—a tension between visual movement and bodily stasis, and an alignment of the eye with projected light as the sole source of illumination that generate a punctual viewing subject—are especially compelling as well as historically coeval.<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup> The parallels are even clearer with night driving, where the viewer sits in the dark, concentrating on the visual apprehension of a flickering world drained of color. This viewing experience is encapsulated by Tom Gunning in his several essays treating the "phantom ride," made by placing a camera on the front of a moving train.<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> But the resulting film and consequent viewer experience were themselves artifacts of seeing from the front of actual trains, described from time to time by clandestine passengers. One man, for example, wrote in 1868 about his "midnight ride on a cow-catcher" where he was able to see world of luminous forms rush toward him but, at stations, with "the strong glare of the headlight directly over me … almost invisible to any one in front."<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> Rare at the time he wrote,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the author's visual experience was later replicated in cinematic phantom rides, as well as multiplied countless times in night-driving cars, complete with projecting beams to impart material form upon the viewer's gaze.</p>

<p>The parallels go only so far, however, and not only in terms of actual rather than virtual movement or in the significant social negotiations over the right to introduce an autospecular space on public roads rather than to sit in a private cinema. The complexity of the night driver's visual field and its somatic foundation are often overlooked, for example. Driving at night, the visual field was susceptible to glare, blind spots, streaks, flashes, an occasional "dancing 'will-o'-the-wisp' effect" caused by the flickering spokes of a bicycle, and other unresolved luminous features—everything constantly coming into form and then passing by. Light from oncoming traffic was "caught and broken on a wind shield" or the driver's goggles. Weather conditions such as snow, fog, and rain could throw "a dazzling veil" over the eyes. Pedestrians, for their part, were warned to "understand how the approaching flood of light makes their footing uncertain by the deepening and dancing of shadows, how the nearing light draws the eye and even checks movement as in a kind of momentary fascination," that is, paralysis.<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup></p>
<p>In other words, night driving was a profoundly embodied experience. In the literature and imagery of headlights, the night driver generated his own field of view rather than received a camera's harvest. Indeed, drivers were, and still are, legally responsible for the integrity of their headlights. Numerous publications offered tips for judging whether a point of light might be an obstacle, well in advance of identifying it as an object, adding to the general sense that the space of the headlight was physiologically active. Further, the source of illumination is even more coincident with the drivers' eyes than the moviegoer's. With the driver continuously following it, the headlight seemed to anticipate the driver's motion, as if light were projected as much by the pressure of the body moving forward as by the headlamp itself. To the extent that the car's propulsive power was internalized as an extension of the body's own motor capacity, so was the headlight experienced as an almost tangible projection of the power to see, a self-produced portrayal of the seeing self.</p>
<p>Also, early drivers were repeatedly reminded that they inhabited a technological and regulated space. They kept abreast of local laws, knew how to change a flat tire, replace headlamp bulbs, add oil, and manage many other frequent repairs. Nighttime car repairs were often mentioned as a reason to always keep tools, spare parts, a flashlight,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and supply of fresh batteries in the car. To drive was not just to buy a car, but to continue buying in order to continue to drive. Troublesome for many, a mechanical awareness brought its own satisfactions, too, and, as mentioned above, contributed to the driver's "complement of joy."<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup> While visual culture theorists are drawn to the drama or, as Gunning would have it, the attractions, played out on the windshield—Virilio's "landscape simulator"—drivers were acutely aware of the limits of their technologically mediated motion, foremost of which was braking distance. Indeed, a central concern of headlight design and regulation was ensuring that the depth of the headlight reasonably exceed braking distances. Rather than imagined as an abstract quantity, speed at night was explicitly registered as the product of vehicle quality, headlamp maintenance, legal codes, road conditions, physiological training, the fluid character of the visual field and the driver's ability to interpret it.</p>
<p>To position oneself at the vertex of a cone of light and propel it across a darkened landscape must count as one of the most startling visual experiences of the twentieth century. Likewise, to stand in the path of an oncoming headlight was certainly one of the most frightening of everyday occurrences. Only after a great deal of debate regarding their creation of a new kind of space, as well as their disruption of prior spaces, were night driving cars granted a rolling easement to serially occupy the night. Incorporating a space that was thrilling, dangerous, and unprecedented in its rapid diffusion—shaping it, navigating it, avoiding it, adjudicating it, learning to live with it—into the social fabric of routine life surely was a remarkable historical episode, however much it has been so naturalized that our routine encounters with it seem as if they could hardly have been otherwise.</p>

<p>Portraits of men and women and children are differently felt in every generation …</p>
<div class="attrib">—Gertrude Stein, "Portraits and Repetition"</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In comparison to most of Gertrude Stein's texts, her early portrait "Men"<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> has been neglected by critics, and the few readings that do exist are insufficient, to say the least. One can easily find possible explanations why "Men" has been overlooked. It is not representative of Stein's early portraits from the period 1908–1911: it is a group portrait and not one of a single person like Picasso, Matisse or Purrmann; it is not static like most of the other portraits but characterized by its narrative form; it is not about "succeeding" or "being living"—in the other early portraits Stein was "obsessed with the various ways in which a person may fail to mature."<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>The one-sided readings referred to above and discussed below are due to a lack of background information both concerning the particular events on which Stein based her portrait and concerning the general social and cultural climate of the turn of the twentieth century. James R. Mellow claimed in 1974 that "Men" "clearly describes a homosexual situation involving three men" who get into a t. He goes on to state that the man knocked down was, as a result of the t, "initiated into homosexuality" and that the end of the portrait was "Gertrude's attempt to describe … what it meant to each of them 'in being such a one'." With the help of Stein's manuscript of "Men" he then identifies these three homosexual men as Hutchins Hapgood,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> David Edstrom, and Maurice Sterne.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> Since then, other critics, such as Wendy Steiner, Bruce Kellner, and Patricia R. Everett, have uncritically repeated Mellow's conviction that "Men" is about the "homosexual trio" of these three.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> As a consequence, "Men" has now become incorporated into the canon of gay literature. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gay and Lesbian Heritage</span> states:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Stein's less well known portrait of homosexual men, simply and tellingly titled "Men," makes the erotic content of such "gay" alliances clear and opens with the statement: "Sometimes men are kissing." The remainder of this evocative portrait explores the interpersonal dynamics of erotic longing and fulfillment, communication and estrangement, and winning and losing among gay men.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The problem with this reading is that not one of the men in question was a homosexual, a fact that Stein was well aware of since she was a close friend of all three. In addition, given the fact that in conversation Stein often impugned male homosexuals,<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> why would she want to identify three of her friends as gay?</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is twofold: first, to clarify the background events that Stein had access to and thereby hopefully lay the foundation for new readings of the portrait; secondly, to suggest, on the basis of the above presentation, that "Men" is not primarily about homosexuality, but, as the title "Men" rather implies, more about masculinity, male friendship, and homosocial bonds at the turn of the twentieth century.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>Let me first address the issues of masculinity and male friendship as they were constructed in the latter part of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. As many scholars have shown, the concept of masculinity in the nineteenth century was not static but shifted rather significantly from the early to the late decades. According to E. Anthony Rotundo, the concept of American manhood went from Communal Manhood at the beginning of the century to Self-Made Manhood which lasted until the 1890s when Passionate Manhood became dominant. It is primarily the last of these concepts that concerns us here. Passionate Manhood meant a focus on the male body; on manly passions such as ambition, competitiveness, and aggression; on primitiveness and martial virtues, but also sexual desire. Building physical strength, it was believed, led to strength of character and moral improvement. Great admiration was expressed for the strong-willed, forceful man, and disdain for the man of little vigor. The "brutish" side of man's nature also expressed his manliness; savage drives and instincts were needed "in order to be men, to struggle, survive and dominate."<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> In this health and athletic craze, American men "compulsively attempted to develop manly physiques as a way of demonstrating that they possessed the interior virtues of manhood." When they did not go to the gym, or watched sports, they read books on wilderness, the jungle, and the Wild West to muster a sense of masculinity. Drinking, brawling, hunting, swearing, and even a revival of dueling "witnessed increasing  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> popularity as a tonic to restore lost manhood." There were primarily three themes of masculinity that characterized the turn of the twentieth century: "American men try to <span style="font-style:italic;">control themselves</span>; they project their fears unto <span style="font-style:italic;">others</span>; when feeling pressured, they attempt an <span style="font-style:italic;">escape</span>." A common fear at the time was that American culture was becoming too feminized, too over-civilized, too intellectual, and too Europeanized. <sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup></p>
<p>When it comes to judging nineteenth-century male friendship, there is a general agreement that we must not view it with today's spectacles. As Karen V. Hansen puts it: "The twentieth-century context alters how we interpret sexual innuendo between friends of the same gender."<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick makes a distinction between homosocial and homosexual desire. Male relations of the nineteenth century existed in a continuum of homosocial and homosexual bonds, "a continuum whose visibility, for men, in our society is radically disrupted."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> In mid-century "American men could express emotions to each other with a fervor and openness that … would have to be consigned to sexual perversion a few generations later."<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> In the late nineteenth century the intensity of intimacy between men was "often indistinguishable from the language and images of love relationships. These friendships could be erotic but not necessarily sexual because a certain degree of affectionate desire was allowed."<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Before the 1890s the line between homosocial and homosexual behavior was elastic, but actual homosexuality was taboo in Victorian America. As Robert K. Martin puts it: "It is obvious that the boundaries between permissible and impermissible forms of expressions of male friendship were drawn very differently in mid-nineteenth-century America than they are now. It is possible that a strict interdiction against full genital sexuality … at the same time allowed for a much fuller expression of male friendship since that in no way threatened to spill over into genitality."<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Even though the new concept of masculinity was gaining ground in the 1890s, men of the time were obviously also affected by the earlier form of more open and tender male friendship that was lingering on. They were harking back to a time when "to a surprising degree, mid-nineteenth-century social attitudes permitted great liberty in personal relations, largely untainted by homophobia."<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> One should also keep in mind, as Martin puts it, "that the patterns of male relationships … do not stand in opposition to heterosexuality."<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>All three men serving as models for Stein's "Men" were Americans,<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> having grown up in the United States in the 1880s and 1890s. Now, that is, in the fall of 1906 when these events took place, they were part of the same art colony in Florence: Hutchins Hapgood was a writer, Maurice Sterne a painter, and David Edstrom a sculptor. As in most European art coteries at this time, Florentine social life was free and easy, mores were tolerant, and friendship was often passionate; explicit expressions of emotion between male friends were more permissible than today. Let me now briefly introduce the protagonists in the order they enter the story. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Hutchins Hapgood (1869–1944) was an upper-middle-class, Chicago-born author and journalist, with an M. A. from Harvard and two years of study at the universities of Berlin and Freiburg. After a period as instructor of English composition at Harvard, he went into journalism, writing for several New York and Chicago newspapers on art, drama, and social issues such as poverty and criminality. He then turned to writing books and had produced, by the time he met Edstrom and Sterne, works like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Spirit of the Ghetto</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of a Thief</span> . Hapgood was also a playwright and an actor and became, later in life, one of the organizers of the Provincetown Players where Eugene O'Neill made his breakthrough. In sum, Hapgood was a free spirit, an adventurer, a cosmopolitan, and a family man, but, as far as one can judge, not a homosexual. Later, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Story of a Lover</span> , he wrote of his open marriage to Neith, and in his autobiography <span style="font-style:italic;">A Victorian in the Modern World</span>  he defined himself thus:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>I confess to having led a dissipated life, with women and drink—waste, waste, self-indulgence. There is only one way in which I have full self-esteem—in <span style="font-style:italic;">liking</span> so much, seeing so much, as beautiful, dignified and good. And that was not achieved by my effort, but given to me by nature. I have been sensual, self-indulgent, and egotistic, but I have <span style="font-style:italic;">seen</span>, and therefore loved—loved in the sense of intense liking, rather than the self-immolating side of love.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">During his time in Florence he belonged to a crowd of intellectuals and aesthetes, the center of which was Bernard Berenson, the American art connoisseur; to the members of this group Art was superior to "life." But Hapgood had started to question their denial of life's creative vitality and found them overcivilized and too Europeanized.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Of Swedish birth, David Edstrom (1873–1938) had emigrated to the U.S. with his family at the age of seven and grown up in the industrial town of Ottumwa, Iowa. He had returned to Europe in 1894 to study art in Stockholm, Sweden, and six years later moved to Florence, where he had now lived for six years. He was a post-impressionist sculptor on his way to success, doing work that showed similarities to that of Rodin, Rosso, and Meunier. He had married in 1901 Anna Levertin, sister of Oscar Levertin, Sweden's at the time most prominent poet and critic; now, in 1906, the marriage had collapsed because of his violence and infidelities, and the divorce was under way.</p>
<p>By first impression the idea of Passionate Manhood seems to well describe David Edstrom. He admired men strong of body and mind and was critical of "womanly" men like Berenson, Ernest Thiel, his Swedish benefactor, and Oscar Levertin. He also admired strong, "cool" women. He put much time and energy into building a strong will and chastised his body to become hard as steel. He wanted to be a man of action, a cowboy, and he longed for physical adventures. At various times of his life, he had been a hobo, a log-driver, and a wildlife hunter. Mary Berenson thought he had an intelligent face but basically looked like a slugger.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> However, he was not very successful in his quest for physical manhood—he was physically weak, was a sentimental romantic and had a tendency to weep in public—and was thus drawn to women and men with whom he could open up and express his emotions. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The meeting between Hapgood and Edstrom, whose relationship would start so lovingly and end in such hatred, is variously described depending on who tells it. Edstrom only says that after their introduction at the Anglo-American Club in Florence he had a "very pleasant" luncheon at Hapgood's villa.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> Hapgood gives two versions, one in his manuscript biography of Edstrom called "David, the Story of a Soul" —stating that he found Edstrom crude but also original and fresh (HH 151)—the other in his own autobiography <span style="font-style:italic;">A Victorian in the Modern World</span>, in which he claims that Edstrom immediately visited him and his wife Neith at their home, Villa Linda. The latter of Hapgood's versions, written in 1939, is much more vitriolic than the one written in 1907. Let me just quote a few lines from the autobiography recording Hapgood's first impressions:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>One day Edstrom appeared at our villa in Settignano, and it was at once apparent that he didn't belong there or anywhere in those lovely hills. He had a fat face and small pig-like eyes that were continuously shedding tears on account of the beauty of his own thoughts and emotions.… He was a neurotic Swede, with a dissipated nervous system and a perverse soul.… On this first visit to the Villa Linda, he wept copiously at the sight of Neith, who was then big with our daughter Miriam; he knelt at her feet and tried to kiss her hands, as those of the eternal goddess, the most important incarnation of life."<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Over the years, and particularly after having read Edstrom's autobiography <span style="font-style:italic;">The Testament of Caliban</span> , published two years prior to Hapgood's own autobiography, Hapgood obviously had adopted a much more black-and-white, perhaps bitter, memory of Edstrom.</p>
<p>On the way home from this first meeting, Edstrom became seriously ill and barely made it home. After a few days of dizziness and periods of unconsciousness he woke up to find his right arm paralyzed. He became frantic: "A sculptor without the use of his right arm! A sentence of death would be as easy to bear." (<span style="font-style:italic;">TOC</span> 225–26). During Edstrom's illness Hapgood came to see him every day—"no one ever could have been a more tender and considerate friend," Edstrom felt. (<span style="font-style:italic;">TOC</span> 226). When Edstrom was a little better, he and Hapgood went to Vallombrosa, where Edstrom started telling Hapgood his life story, and the thought of co-writing Edstrom's autobiography dawned in Hapgood's mind. Walking through the "life-giving beautiful woods, we talked, talked"; Edstrom expatiated on the fact that he was in love with three women simultaneously, on how much he admired a "strong, unscrupulous man," and depicted his "adventures with foxes and dogs in Lapland, with sharks and bad men in Cuba." At this moment, Hapgood observed, "he seemed to be in spirit quite as much the man of action as the artist."(HH 157–59)</p>
<p>Since Edstrom and Anna Levertin had separated and he had not found a new mistress, he had recently been desperately lonely. Now Edstrom finally found in Hapgood the intimate friend he had been searching for, "a new object of passion," as Hapgood put it (HH 154). "At first and for weeks," Hapgood later wrote Gertrude Stein, "I was his Saviour, his mentor, his love—his 'daily dope' as he called it."<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> After their return to Florence they met every day. According to Hapgood, Edstrom claimed he could not  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> work without his new friend, but, more than that, Hapgood supplied him with "the life impulse, the will to live." Hapgood writes: "Consequently he talked to me and about me in almost purely emotional terms, in grossly flattering exaggerations, much as a lover talks to his mistress. 'Take me with you,' Edstrom would say, 'when you leave Italy. Take me to London, take me to America. Stow me away anywhere. I'll make no trouble, and I need you, you give me life, you give me health. I don't know what I could do without you'." (HH 167–68) The Swedish author Hilma Angered-Strandberg reported to Anna Levertin Edström in Stockholm that David had written her that he was "happy" with an American friend, "a scholar and author who love[d] him."<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>Hapgood was more hesitant. He found Edstrom crude and ungainly, but also "a fountain of light" (HH 143), and in many respects he saw him as "a wonderful thing" and he was impressed by "his essential originality, his essential power of re-envisaging experience." (HH 153) Hapgood felt that Edstrom possessed the "greater intellectual vitality": "I … felt at times David's superiority to me, in certain interesting ways, but to me this was exciting and agreeable, especially as, in spite of his uncouthness, David was not aggressive: he had a soft, caressing way with him: it was the caressingness of a nice beast to be sure, but it was not disagreeable." (HH 169) Concerning Hapgood's characterization of Edstrom as a "nice beast," it is interesting to note Edstrom's distinction of Hapgood: "I have never known any one who to the same degree had the natural sensuousness of a wild animal." (<span style="font-style:italic;">TOC</span> 227) Thus, again, both men complicate and nuance through "feminine" characteristics the concept of Passionate Manhood.</p>
<p>Getting to know Edstrom better, Hapgood felt they had much in common:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>He, too, was an American; he had been a newsboy in a Western town; he, too, had brought to the old culture [Europe] a certain instinctive reaction. This was in him heightened by the vital artistic impulse. His extraordinary story, his occasionally remarkable expressiveness, his old-world quality, his feeling for Life, his feeling for Art—all this met many conflicting feelings and ideas in me. I, too, was in love with active life. I, too, had some sympathy with Art, and I, too, had faith that in some way Art was not divorced from the modern manifestations of Life.… He, too, was drawn to me, as I to him. For, though we had had widely different experiences, widely different characters, yet there was something profoundly alike in the way we both instinctively felt about "culture."</p>
<div class="attrib">(HH 151)</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Preparing for Edstrom's autobiography, they exchanged in their talks more and more intimate confidences. Edstrom suggested to Hapgood that they co-operate on the project: "I need another man's personality to draw me out, to direct me, to suggest me. Your personality suggests me in a more healthy and vigorous direction than anybody's I have ever known. I feel more like a man with you than with anybody else. We could do a great book together." (HH 158–60) Hapgood finally agreed; he had a "method" that he had used when writing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of a Thief</span> that he wanted to apply to the Edstrom project. Hapgood gave Edstrom a copy of his book and Edstrom was full of admiration for the "boldness and originality" of his method. (HH 162) Edstrom felt that they together would create a "new literary art"; it would be the "result of men working together … rather than the creation of the solitary artist" (HH 167). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In September 1906 they intensified their conversations, aiming at starting the writing in October. The method of cooperation was one of mutual immersion into Edstrom's life. David would reveal himself to Hapgood "as clearly, as deeply as he could.… All that should appear in the completed work should be of him—his words, his acts, his thoughts and feelings." Hapgood's task was that of the interpreter: "It was my part to put into the material given me a unity, a complete meaning, to get the proportions right, to draw a spiritual portrait." (HH 172) Hapgood was to determine what Edstrom "should be allowed to say … what of these conflicting impulses were characteristic, what were negligeable." So Hapgood "suggested him" in their talks, steered Edstrom to such topics Hapgood had decided would be privileged in the portrait of Edstrom; Hapgood thus saw it as his function to "lead the man interviewed to say what was wanted for a special purpose." Edstrom later felt that he in these sessions had been "hypnotized" by Hapgood. (HH 173)</p>
<p>Eventually, the atmosphere became so intimate that Edstrom started revealing things he later regretted; he feared that he was going too far, that he would ultimately appear in an "unworthy and undignified" light. (HH 176) At other times he felt his frankness would make him appear "more grandiose, more wonderful in the eyes of the world." But Edstrom became increasingly queasy and started withdrawing. He told Hapgood he needed a break from him and the autobiography. (HH 178)</p>
<p>While working on the autobiography shortly before the break Edstrom met and fell in love with Maurice Sterne (1878–1957), the American painter and sculptor. Like some of the other Americans Edstrom met, Sterne had had a similar background to that of himself. As a young boy Sterne had emigrated from the Old World (Moscow) to the United States, lived under poor circumstances, started working at the age of twelve, and had gradually discovered his passion for art. Sterne, however, did not go to Europe for his art education but studied at the National Academy of Design in New York, while working a night job. In 1904 he was appointed a travelling fellow by the National Academy and went to Paris and Florence, where he later got to know Hapgood and Edstrom. Later in life he spent adventurous years travelling to India, Java, and Bali, and returned to the U.S. in 1914. In 1906, he had just had a passionate love affair with the Russian dancer Alla Nazimova and would later enter into a short marriage to Mable Dodge.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> In 1933 he was honored with a retrospective one-man show at the New York MOMA.</p>
<p>Sterne was a very attractive, "magnetic"<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> man. Like both Hapgood and Edstrom he had something of the wild, restless animal about him. Mabel Dodge's first impression of him was that he "was positively enveloped in a cloud of secrecy and caution. The man might have been in a jungle, so watchful he was, so studied every glance and motion."<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> She also wrote of him: "he was not only an eminent man. He was an old blood-hound on a leash—with full, generous lips and melancholy jowls."<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> A photo of him from about 1906 in his memoir <span style="font-style:italic;">Shadow and Light</span> shows him standing in a very manly pose, legs apart, with a short, dark beard and arrogant eyes looking straight into the camera, hands in pockets. As George Biddle writes in the introduction to <span style="font-style:italic;">Shadow and Light</span>, Sterne was "at all times candid—disarmingly so—about his sexual relations."  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> (xxii) And so he is in his memoir. He tells openly not only of his three great loves during his life—Mira, Mabel, and Vera—but also of his innumerable shorter affairs with other women. "I was skillful and ruthless in my pursuit of physical pleasure," he writes, "and not particularly concerned with the feelings of others." (<span style="font-style:italic;">Shadow and Light</span> 56) However, in all his candidness, at no point in the book does Sterne even allude to his having been attracted to or involved with a man.</p>
<p>But he made male friends. His friendship with Hapgood which began in Florence lasted for decades. Hapgood was initially impressed by Sterne's "concentrated mental force combined with a rich and deep temperament."<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> More than thirty years later their friendship was still alive. Hapgood wrote to Sterne: "I have always had an unusual feeling for you, ever since we met so long ago, in Florence. Your mind and your heart go together—you are warm about your ideas, and the perception of form in others arouses your identical passion… But this is not a love letter—… as you well know—"<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup></p>
<p>The pictures of the relationship between Edstrom and Sterne diverge significantly depending on who is telling the story, Edstrom, Sterne, Hapgood (two versions) or Gertrude Stein. Edstrom's version is the least interesting: he merely tells an anecdote about how he and Sterne got "gorgeously" drunk and decided to stop, on their way home, at every street corner to "yell at the top of [their] voices a foul, unprintable word" (<span style="font-style:italic;">TOC</span> 229). One may of course speculate about Edstrom's and Sterne's reasons for purging their memoirs of the rest of the intimate bond between them of which other sources unanimously give evidence. Perhaps the intimacy was experienced as too close, too embarrassing for a later age characterized by homophobia.</p>
<p>There are mainly two events that the other witnesses recorded that involved Hapgood, Edstrom and Sterne which reveal friendships with homoerotic overtones, but not homosexual relations—the unsuccessful courtship of a married Swedish woman and the violent row that also Hapgood was drawn into, both incidents later included in Stein's portrait "Men." But first, let me say something in general on the "love affair" between Sterne and Edstrom. Maurice Sterne<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> was, according to Hapgood, "a Jew and a man of culture in the ordinary sense of the word." As an artist, he was technically skillful, industrious, but rather traditional. He was intelligent, had a balanced mind, but had "little spontaneous gift." He was aware of his own limitations, and "personally passionate, he loved with consuming ardor the very qualities in which he felt himself to be deficient." (HH 179–80) Edstrom, in his art and personality, expressed the passion and spontaneity that Sterne was lacking. Sterne therefore loved Edstrom and tried to acquire the latter's spiritual and natural gifts. "He tried to assume what he was not, in his real nature," as Hapgood put it. (HH 180)</p>
<p>Sterne and Edstrom began, like previously Edstrom and Hapgood, spending all their time together, excluding everybody else. Perhaps in jealousy, Hapgood wrote to Gertrude Stein: "Sterne and Edström fell in love with one another, and the things they said one to another would put school-girls to their trumps."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> Sterne courted Edstrom passionately, who was deeply flattered and called Sterne a "handsome manly fellow." (HH 185). Instead of Hapgood, who had started turning critical, Edstrom had now found a new "complete worshipper." (HH 180) We must remember, however, that this  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> picture of Sterne's and Edstrom's union was drawn by Hapgood who might still have been infatuated with Edstrom.</p>
<p>One night Sterne and Edstrom joined a company of Swedes, presumably at Trattoria Lapi which was where the Swedes used to meet. It had earlier been the watering-hole of Arnold Böcklin and Adolf Hildebrand.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> In his autobiography, Hapgood commented on this group:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>There is probably nothing so unbridled as a certain type of drunken Swedish artist. There were several of these in Florence at the time, married to tall beautiful women, who in their way were quite as extravagant as their husbands. One of the women was also an artist; she was the most beautiful and the most unbridled of the lot. They were all animated by a spirit of tolerance which went beyond all limits; and, although I never saw them after this period in Florence, I feel certain that they must have gone up in flame long ago.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">For a while Sterne had been in love with the woman here described as the "most beautiful and the most unbridled," whom Hapgood then, in a letter to Stein, identified as Carl Palme's wife, Anna Palme, née Uggla.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> Carl Palme (1879–1960) was a Swedish painter who in 1901–04 had studied in Munich under Kandinsky and had spent the summer of 1904 in Florence where he came to know the Berensons. Anna Palme was a "beautiful blond who, anaemic, looked like a sublimated, cool and provoking seachilled mermaid—one of the 'cool' kind that David [Edstrom] admires." (HH 181) In his letter to Stein, mentioned above, Hapgood was a bit less poetic, saying that Sterne loved her "largely because she looked like a fish."</p>
<p>As the evening proceeded, the party at Trattoria Lapi grew wilder and louder. And when Swedish artists talk, Hapgood commented, "they really talk, not for light suggestiveness, but for downright, complete expression of vivid, naked psychological facts, and of wild gusts of emotional and physical passions." (HH 181) Like everybody else Sterne got drunk, but he was also drunk with love for Anna Palme and with "a spiritual adoration and loving envy of David's possible genius." In this state of excitement he wanted to make a good impression on the mermaid lady. But just as Sterne was about to make his contribution to the discussion, Edstrom burst forth in his usual "prophetic vein." He was inspired, talked passionately on Art, Emotion, Temperament, and Love. Anna Palme was fascinated—at least according to Edstrom—and "could not keep her lovely eyes off of David's little ugly ones." Sterne, Edstrom told Hapgood, felt excluded from both Edstrom's "genius" and from Mrs. Palme's admiration. (HH 181–82)</p>
<p>What happened after this is not clear. As one source has it, Sterne suddenly became as one mad. He seized Edstrom by the throat, threw him violently to the floor and tried to choke him. Edstrom told Hapgood: "I felt my life going, but I didn't care. This seemed to me grand." (HH 182) The Swedes stopped Sterne from killing Edstrom, and Sterne threw himself weeping into Edstrom's arms, asked forgiveness, and "brokenly sobbed": "You and I are the only two geniuses I know." Sterne insisted that Edstrom share his room that night<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> and "in drunken watches of the night, he repeated many times: 'Oh, you and I are the only true artists, the only geniuses I know'." (HH 182) In his letter to Stein, Hapgood did not mention this t, only that Sterne proposed to Anna Palme,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> got "the mitten," and left for Greece, and that Edstrom took the credit for saving the lady's virtue. In Hapgood's autobiography nothing whatever is said of the wooing of Mrs. Palme or the ensuing brawl. Perhaps out of embarrassment, neither Sterne nor Carl Palme comment on the happenings of this evening in their respective memoirs.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup></p>
<p>There may, however, be a fusion here with another choking incident in which Edstrom, Sterne, and Hapgood were involved. This time the brawl took place in a café after Sterne's return from Greece; the three friends/lovers got engaged in discussing the nature of Art. Hapgood argued that the artist, in order to produce great art, must "have character as a man also—purpose, will," and steadiness to be able to finish his work. "Little men, with big gifts," he maintained, "do not produce work commensurate with their gifts." (HH 186) To prove his theory he used Edstrom as an illustration, pointing out that his mental instability, his passion and his contradictoriness, were detrimental to his art. "In other words, David," he said, "you have no character. You are a bundle of impulses and abilities, but you have no unity. There is no principle in your nature." (HH 187) Even if Hapgood's analysis of Edstrom was correct, it was maybe not the wisest thing to tell him this to his face. Edstrom, and also Sterne, rejected Hapgood's ideas. Art, they held, was independent of character and was "nourished by an entire freedom from the ordinary ideals of men." And Edstrom was particularly irritated at Hapgood's contention that he had no sustained character; his manhood was threatened.</p>
<p>The above picture of the discussion is taken from Hapgood's MS biography of Edstrom, written in 1907. As we can see, there is not a word about a fistt or choking. In his 1939 autobiography, however, Hapgood relates the same incident differently, downplaying his own part, but making the clash take place between Sterne and Edstrom. These two were "attempting apparently to murder one another. It would have meant nothing to either to have gouged out the eyes of the other, and any handy object in the café, heavy and blunt enough, was used by both in the service of the gigantic cause in which they were ting, which was a dispute about the nature of art."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup></p>
<p>Commenting on Hapgood's 1939 version, Sterne added new details to what happened. The discussion, he claimed, took place between him and Edstrom on the particular issue of artistic form. Edstrom yelled: "The hell with form! Form is death! Only things in the process of formation have life!" Edstrom thus expressed a rather typical post-impressionist view of sculpture, whereas Sterne as a traditionalist and classicist shouted back:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>"You are too damned preoccupied with your innate emotions, and you're obviously blind to intrinsic form."<br>"I shit on your form," he shouted.<br>"I shit on your emotion," I answered.</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">What followed after this, according to Sterne, was the complete opposite of what happened after the Mrs. Palme incident. This time Edstrom grabbed Sterne by the throat and tried to choke him but was saved by Hapgood's intervention. Edstrom rushed off, but the next morning he appeared at Sterne's room on the Lugarno Acciauoli, apologizing profusely, bursting into tears, trying to make everything all right.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>When Edstrom's amenity with Sterne lost its passion, they still remained friends for a while, but Edstrom shifted his main attention back to Hapgood and the writing of the autobiography "with all his former enthusiasm." Edstrom felt that Hapgood really understood him, and a few days later he "cut [Sterne] in a cold, brutal way." (HH 189) In his reunion with Hapgood, the two men became "almost as sympathetic as ever," and, as Hapgood puts it, "the charm of what we saw at first surged back to both of us." But the progress of the autobiography writing slowed down nonetheless. Hapgood was busy since his wife was about to give birth to their daughter Miriam, and Edstrom's interest seemed to wane. They consequently started meeting more rarely.</p>
<p>Finally, they agreed, according to Hapgood, to let Hapgood outline the book on the basis of the copious notes; Edstrom gave him "full freedom to work it out." (HH 191) Hapgood's version here seems corroborated by one of Edstrom's letters to Ernest Thiel where he announced his near departure for Paris: "I'll leave the book in the hands of my friend—and leave the chapters about the last three, four years for the future."<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> For a while, Edstrom had had all the notes in his room, both copies, because he wanted to go over them and correct inaccuracies. As he perused the notes he was deeply shocked: "Even to this day the mere memory of those notes disturbs me and makes me blush with shame and humiliation. Not only had I told things about myself and others which I should never have let pass my lips, but I seemed to have enlarged and exaggerated circumstances and characteristics and even fabricated evil things about myself." (<span style="font-style:italic;">TOC</span> 230) Edstrom claimed he and Hapgood talked over the situation and that he in the end found a compromise impossible. Hapgood commented: "All [Edstrom] needed to do, when he felt he didn't want to go on with our manuscript, was to come to me and frankly tell me so. Then we could either have rearranged the scheme or quit. He says in his book that he did this, that we had several conferences but that I would not compromise. That is a complete lie."<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup></p>
<p>One day in December 1906, Edstrom simply vanished, with all Hapgood's notes. He had run away from Hapgood and from a "flock of very amiable but utterly loquacious, gesticulating duns"<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> whom he had promised repayment in November. Arriving in Paris, he did not know what to do with the 600–700 pages of notes. He consulted Gertrude and Leo Stein, who both expressed their sympathy with him and took sides with him against Hapgood. The latter soon followed Edstrom to Paris to retrieve his notes to be able to finish the autobiography. But Edstrom refused to see him and burnt the notes. Furious, and disappointed in Leo and Gertrude for favoring Edstrom, Hapgood returned to Florence and turned the autobiography into the biography called "David. The Story of a Soul."<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>My claim is thus that the three stories retold above—the writing of Edstrom's autobiography, the courting of Mrs. Palme, and the Edstrom-Sterne t over artistic form—together make up the skeleton of "Men." But how were these events and happenings transmitted to Gertrude Stein? She knew all three men before and after the fall of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> 1906 and could observe their characters and behavior. For instance, Leo and Gertrude spent spring and summer of 1906 at Casa Ricci in Fiesole, as they had done previous summers, and Gertrude then had numerous opportunities to study Edstrom and Hapgood whom she saw regularly. Wineapple suggests that Stein also experienced the events outlined above, but that is not true.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> By the time these took place—October to December—the Steins were since long back in Paris. So, Gertrude must have received second-hand information. Did she hear it from one, or all, of the three protagonists? Or from Leo Stein, who also knew all three of them? Or from Carl Palme who in 1907 was a regular guest at the Saturday salon at 27 Rue de Fleurus? As we have seen, Hapgood informed her in a letter of Sterne's and Edstrom's infatuation with each other and of Sterne's failed courtship of Mrs. Palme. We also know that Edstrom met the Steins in Paris in early 1907 and could then have told Gertrude about these events.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> As I made clear, Hapgood followed Edstrom to Paris and met Gertrude Stein, at which meeting he could have told her of the t/s between Sterne and Edstrom.<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> Sterne also came to Paris in 1907, and Gertrude could have picked up complementary information from him. Carl Palme is a less likely source; he never got to know Gertrude well enough to give her such personal gossip. The fact that so many may have repeated the same story/ies to Stein may also have tied into her style of insistence. She tells in "Portraits and Repetition" of how she realized there is no repetition by listening to the stories on the same subject from a "group of lively little aunts," realizing the stories were never the same.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas</span>, she reported a similar experience: "Gertrude Stein rather liked [Wyndham Lewis]. She particularly liked him one day when he came and told all about his quarrel with Roger Fry. Roger Fry had come in not many days before and had already told all about it. They told exactly the same story only it was different, very different."<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> In a similar way her interest might have been aroused by the alternative versions that formed the basis for "Men."</p>
<p>"Men" has been dated to 1909,<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> but I suspect that earlier versions existed. The events in question took place October–December 1906. Why would she wait three years before she wrote the portrait? Is it not likely, rather, that she wrote a first draft in 1907, or at least took notes and started mulling over these rather dramatic events shortly after she had met the trio in Paris? Gertrude Stein's "A Man," supposedly her first portrait, was written in 1908.<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> It evolves around one of the protagonists of "Men," David Edstrom. The second paragraph of "A Man" reads like an embryo of Edstrom's character as depicted in "Men":</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>He was then interested in working, in talking, in drinking, in marrying, in women, in men, in needing being ting, in exciting any one, in telling everything, in running away again and again, in expanding, in suggesting, in dreaming, in being a bad enough one, in being certainly a good enough one.<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The rest of the paragraph focuses on Edstrom's shifting size from fat to thin to very fat, etcetera. In "Men" this corresponds to his being a "large" one. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>If we now turn to a reading of "Men," based on the above, the portrait becomes more accessible, the "representational traces," to use Perloff's term,<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> become more noticeable. However, in spite of a certain increase in transparency, "Men" still remains obscure and very hard to make sense of. This is due to the fact that Stein was not interested in portraying Sterne, Hapgood, and Edstrom as individuals. Her interests lay elsewhere. To make a comparison, Perloff in her reading of <span style="font-style:italic;">Susie Asado</span> correctly states that this portrait is "not at all 'about' the Flamenco dancer … whose dance … inspired the portrait." It is much more, among other things "an interesting exercise in sound imitation."<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup> Much has been written on the relationship between Stein's early portraits and Analytic Cubism,<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> a discussion I will not enter with the exception of referring to E. H. Gombrich's statement that a cubist painter "drives home the message that this is an exercise in painting, not an illusion."<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup> In the same way, "Men" is not 'about' the three Americans, it is not an illusion, but an exercise, not in sound imitation this time, but in writing. Nevertheless, it is 'about' something, about men, about masculinity and male friendship. But, as Hoffman puts it, our emphasis in reading the portraits "must not be on discovering the conventional 'meaning' of any of her portraits" but to focus on the <span style="font-style:italic;">patterns</span> of events and emotions.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup></p>
<p>As I pointed out at the beginning of this article, "Men" is not representative of Stein's early portraits. For instance, it is anecdotal<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup> whereas most other portraits are non-narrative; it has different "emblematic keywords," "repetitive motifs" or "<span style="font-style:italic;">Leitmotivs</span>"<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup> from the other early portraits, in which "succeeding" to mature is dominant. The presence of a story line in "Men" works counter to Stein's statement that "the making of a portrait of any one is as they are existing and as they are existing has nothing to do with remembering any one or anything."<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> "Men" does not freeze the present moment but is about doing things and invites remembering the past; "remembering" is also a central emblematic keyword in the portrait.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are great similarities between "Men" and the other portraits when it comes to their "austerely mechanistic"<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> style, their use of the continuous present and repetition (or "insistence" as Stein herself called it)<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup>; they are all characterized by the same obscurity and the same need for extra-textual information.<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup> "Men" also has features in common with the other early group portraits. As Bridgman puts it, in these group portraits "[p]eople were squared off against one another according to their dominant qualities. Then [Stein] ran through a variety of minimally changing permutations."<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup> "Men" also shares its anecdotal structure with at least one other portrait, "Miss Furr and Miss Skeene," which Bridgman finds more accessible because it is "dominated by a narrative line,"<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup> but the fact that some sort of story is told in "Men" does not, I think, make it more accessible.</p>
<p>"Men" is made up of three parts, the second of which is subdivided into three sections. Pages 310–12 (incl 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph) form a synopsis of the narrative of the three events depicted above. There is here a progression of time and a shift of the action from Florence to Paris. The second part (pp. 312–15) consists of three portraits of Hapgood (pp. 312, 3<sup>rd</sup> paragraph &gt; 313, 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph), Sterne (pp. 313, 3<sup>rd</sup> paragraph &gt; 314, 1<sup>st</sup> paragraph), and Edstrom (pp. 314, 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph &gt; 315, 4<sup>th</sup> paragraph). "Men" ends  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> with a coda or conclusion (p. 315, last two paragraphs). However, in the three miniportraits of Hapgood, Sterne, and Edstrom the narrative from the first part continues, interfoliated with the characterization of the men.</p>
<p>Let me indicate how the three events outlined above enter into Stein's text. First, the three men can be distinguished by certain repeated emblematic keywords. Hapgood is the man "filling something," "being listening," and "being telling"; he is the "third one." He listens to the other two (p. 310, 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph) and records their words and actions, but he also listens to Edstrom telling his life story and he is also "filling" his notebooks with Edstrom's life story. Sterne is identified as the one "knocked down," that is, in the t over artistic form with Edstrom, but also as the one who "might have knocked down the one who had knocked him down then," that is, in the t that followed the courtship of Mrs. Palme. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Leitmotiv</span>s characterizing Edstrom are "large,"<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup> "having tears," "one knocking down some one." Edstrom was known for weeping in public on all possible occasions.</p>
<p>The plot that can be traced in "Men" is not crystal clear but emerges something like this: The three men in question have all been in love with each other but now the third man, Hapgood, has withdrawn and is listening and recording how the other two are kissing and weeping. (As we have seen, both Edstrom and Sterne had been weeping, but on separate occasions.)<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65">65</a></sup> "The three of them had been loving. Two of them were loving. One of them was not loving and was remembering everything and was filling something." (p. 311, paragraph 2) All three, however, are still enjoying their fraternal friendship of drinking and telling each other everything. But the large one, Edstrom, does not want Hapgood, the third one, too close: "He is large then and the third one then is one he would not then have near him." (p. 310, paragraph 3) This obviously refers to the break between Hapgood and Edstrom over the autobiography revealing too much. He wants Hapgood to stop writing/filling: "The one who is a large one then is one needing then that the third one is not filling anything."<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66">66</a></sup></p>
<p>Then Sterne and Edstrom get into the t over artistic form and Sterne is knocked down. Soon after this Edstrom runs away. The sentence "The large one was a large one and was leaving when no one was knowing this thing was knowing that he was leaving" (pp. 310–11) certainly refers to Edstrom removing himself, with Hapgood's manuscript, to Paris. In the middle of page 311 Stein introduces a prolepsis sketching the events a few months later when the three men meet, or do not meet, in Paris. Edstrom refuses to meet Hapgood who wants the manuscript back, but agrees to meet Sterne. The "large" one "did not meet the one who was filling something. He met the other one and did not meet him again." (p. 311, paragraph 3) Stein here suggests that Sterne in Paris wanted to continue his friendship with Edstrom but not with the same passion (p. 311, paragraph 4). Sterne met Edstrom who no longer needed "to be loving" and preferred to be "one not liking kissing." Sterne also discovers that his own passion is gone: "He had lost that thing he had lost being one liking that one being a large one from kissing and crying." (p. 311, paragraph 4) Edstrom ends up not wanting to have anything to do with either Hapgood or Sterne. (p. 312, paragraph 1)<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67">67</a></sup> Stein then returns to the events in Florence (p. 312, paragraph 2), underlining how meaningful the close  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> friendship had been to all three of them: "Each one of the three of them was such a one, one drinking and talking and loving."</p>
<p>The first mini-portrait is devoted to Hapgood, and the same phrases are repeated to identify him—"filling something" and "drinking and telling and listening"—but, as always in the early portraits, with continuous shifts in meaning. On the one hand, he is here "<span style="font-style:italic;">completely</span> filling" and "<span style="font-style:italic;">entirely</span> filling" (p. 312, paragraphs 4–5; my emphasis), which may point to the dedication he felt for the autobiography project or to the growing volume of notes which, as we have seen, by November 1906 had reached 600-700 pages.<sup><a name="f68-text" href="#f68">68</a></sup> On the other hand, Hapgood is now depicted as "one loving in listening, one loving in telling, one loving in drinking," which may refer to his total infatuation with Edstrom before their break. In the Hapgood section, Stein also complements the narrative by adding incidents not introduced in the plot synopsis. She points to the fact that Edstrom had demanded to see the whole manuscript: "the one then a large one needed to be having everything around him so that he could be one leaving it behind him." (p. 312, paragraph 6) What "it" here refers to is presumably his life in Florence that he left "behind him" when he took the notes and ran off to Paris.</p>
<p>The sketch of Maurice Sterne repeats such emblematic keywords as "kissing" and "had been knocked down" but also extends and expands the portrait by showing that Sterne "was one sometimes knocking some one down," that is, that he was an athlete and a ter, who "might have knocked down the one who had knocked him down then" (p. 313, paragraph 3). As noted above, this points in the direction of the t over Mrs. Palme, and the qualification "might have" may refer to the fact that Stein did not entirely trust Edstrom's version of what had taken place that night. The impression that this part of "Men" deals with the Mrs. Palme incident is strengthened by such phrases as "they were then knowing everything," that is, Edstrom and Sterne sharing the belief that they were the greatest geniuses in the world. Stein also implies that Sterne had greater difficulties forgetting Edstrom than vice versa: "he was then remembering everything and the other one was later a large one in being not remembering anything …" (pp. 313–14).</p>
<p>The portrait of Edstrom follows the same pattern of extension and modification as those of Hapgood and Sterne. What is new here, apart from his "having tears," being "large," and having "knocked down" Sterne, is the <span style="font-style:italic;">Leitmotiv</span> of "remembering" and a shift in the meaning of "large." Edstrom is now depicted as "remembering again and again that he was such a one and he was remembering again and again that he was having meaning." (pp. 314–15) Edstrom was infamous for compulsively and repeatedly telling his life story in public, at parties, in restaurants, while weeping profusely. For instance, while associating with the circle around Giovanni Papini in Florence, he often entered into such confessions. "There is a noble objectivity about his tears," Hapgood commented, "for he weeps before everybody and tells everybody the sad, glad, mad tale of his life" (HH 139) But "remembering" here also refers to the writing of the autobiography: "He could remember something. He did remember something. He would not remember everything." This may be a reference to the fact that Edstrom felt he had "remembered" too much in his talks with Hapgood and now preferred not to remember everything. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>The adjective "large" here no longer relates only to Edstrom's size but also to his personality. Earlier in "Men" (p. 311) we meet the phrase "he was always a large one from something," and in the Edstrom portrait this meaning of "large" as "having an inflated opinion of himself" is confirmed. Edstrom was known for his fickleness, his pride, and his tendency to adopt an aggrandized pose. So, Edstrom is shown to be "a large one from not wanting" to meet Hapgood and an even larger one "from once almost going to meet him" (p. 311). In the section on Edstrom (pp. 314–15) this characterization is repeated with a difference. Here he is a "large one" in having tears, in remembering and not remembering, in having knocked some one down, and in remembering that he had not wanted to meet Hapgood. As we saw above, Hapgood later wrote that Edstrom was "continuously shedding tears on account of the beauty of his own thoughts and emotions."</p>
<p>The coda to "Men" covers only eleven lines and draws the conclusion that whatever brotherly love the three men had experienced, that passionate friendship is now over. They have gone their separate ways, because they were too different: "Each one of the three of them was of a different kind than any other of the three of them."</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>Stein's involvement with Otto Weininger's ideas on maleness and femaleness at the time she was working on "Men" may support my reading of the portrait. His book <span style="font-style:italic;">Sex and Character</span><sup><a name="f69-text" href="#f69">69</a></sup> posited, in Leon Katz' words, "bisexuality in all human beings, whereby the basic sexual nature of a single human being is made up of maleness and femaleness in varying proportions."<sup><a name="f70-text" href="#f70">70</a></sup> Weininger also held that homosexuality, or "sexual inversion" as he called it, was an inherited and not an acquired property. He saw the degree of masculinity as distributed along a continuum (not unlike the homosocial continuum referred to above): "there is an infinity of transitions from the most masculine male, through the feminine man and finally the male sexual invert"; the male homosexual, he argued, has in him "roughly the same quantity of the male element as of the female." And since we are all bisexual, "the predisposition for homosexuality is still present, however faintly, in every human being," which can be seen in "rapturous 'juvenile friendships' that are never entirely devoid of a sensual aspect." Nor is the friendship between adult men completely lacking "an element of sexuality, although … the very thought of sex is <span style="font-style:italic;">embarrassing</span> to friends and <span style="font-style:italic;">opposed</span> to the <span style="font-style:italic;">idea</span> of friendship"<sup><a name="f71-text" href="#f71">71</a></sup> (italics in original).</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that Weininger was an anti-feminist, Stein was in 1908 strongly influenced by his ideas. Perhaps she wanted in "Men" to apply some of his discussions around masculinity, male friendship, and homosexuality<sup><a name="f72-text" href="#f72">72</a></sup> and investigate through observation the transitions of the homosocial continuum. This interest on her part does not, however, make "Men" a piece of gay literature.</p>
<p>The understanding of "Men" as a portrait of three homosexual men, by Mellow and others, may nevertheless be explained by the presence in the portrait of two particular expressions repeated over and over again: "kissing" and "such a one." In the source material, I have found no references to the three men kissing each other, so either Stein  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> made this up or she was informed orally about the kissing. It is not at all impossible that they were kissing, but that does not make them into homosexuals. Male friendship at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century allowed for kissing, particularly when men were drinking. For instance, a psychologist at the turn of that century wrote: "When drinking, men fall on each other's necks and kiss one another; they feel that they are united by peculiarly intimate ties and this moves them to tears and intimate modes of address."<sup><a name="f73-text" href="#f73">73</a></sup> The combination here of drinking, kissing, weeping, and intimacy is also central, as we have seen, to "Men."</p>
<p>Grantedly, the phrase "such a one" may lead the reader's thoughts to homosexuality, as it did Mellow. (Mellow 135) But we have to ask ourselves what, in the text, "such a one" actually stands for. We do not meet the expression until three pages into the text (p. 312, 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph) and then linked to the following modification: "Each one of the three of them was such a one, one drinking and talking and loving." This definition of "such a one" as one drinking, talking, and loving is repeated in several instances later in the text (p. 312, paragraphs 3, 4 and 5; p. 313, paragraphs 2 and 3; p. 314, paragraph 3) but with additions like "telling," "listening," "remembering," "kissing," and "having tears." "Such a one" is thus linked, it seems to me, to fraternizing in the form of drinking, conversation, memories, mutual attraction, and occasional kissing. According to the mores among men, as presented by Kosofsky Sedgwick, Kimmel, Martin and others, such behavior did not spell homosexuality but open and tender friendship and congeniality. In addition, Stein uses "such a one" frequently in other early portraits, where the phrase certainly does not mean "homosexual." In "Four Protégés," for instance, "such a one" stands for one "succeeding in living" (Stein, <span style="font-style:italic;">Two</span>, 308), in "Orta or One Dancing" for one "dancing" or "being living" (Stein, <span style="font-style:italic;">Two</span>, 290), and in "Pach" for several things like a "married" one, an "angry" one, etcetera (Stein, <span style="font-style:italic;">Two</span>, 339). Thus, "such a one" seems to mean different things in different contexts, and there is no indication that it means "homosexual" in "Men." On the contrary, there is much more textual evidence that Stein in "Men" wished to draw attention to men's homosociality, its combination of physical manliness and "feminine" emotionality. In my view, there is consequently little substance in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gay and Lesbian Heritage</span>'s statement that "Men" "explores the interpersonal dynamics of erotic longing and fulfillment, communication and estrangement, and winning and losing among gay men."</p>

<div id="body">
<p>"They were exhausting scenes … walking in the mud, in the slime, the quicksand," decried veteran comic actor Totò with only slight exaggeration while recalling "the most unbelievable places" he had to cross in the making of Pier Paolo Pasolini's film <span style="font-style:italic;">Uccellacci e uccellini</span> (Hawks and Sparrows, 1965).<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> Shot mainly in Rome's extensive urban wastelands, known locally as the "disabitato," the film draws viewers into increasingly liminal states, physically as well as psychologically bewildering. From vacant lots and half-built overpasses, to shantytowns and collapsing farm houses, commonly recognizable monuments almost never enter the screen. Confirmation of location by reference to the city center is consistently and carefully denied.</p>
<p>Out of the maze of underbrush and ruins, however, emerges a document valuable not only for its portrait of an ephemeral Roman periphery (and the rough parallels that exist today), but also for how the disabitato both shaped and was shaped by Pasolini's cinematic artistry. Many postwar Italian films are likewise engaged with the overgrown edges of the city, where the landscape has gone to seed, has been bulldozed, is in the initial stages of being redeveloped, or is being furtively inhabited or otherwise used under the radar of local authorities. Such areas are commonly referred to as terrain vague, a term that has emerged from urban studies and gained currency in recent discussions in a variety of disciplines concerning space, place, and everyday life.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>In examining cinematic engagements—or, perhaps more accurately, interventions—with terrain vague, we are particularly  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> interested in how films represent and misrepresent, reveal and conceal, exaggerate and minimize, and in short, selectively illuminate and seek to transform the urban interstice. Our dual exploration of the disabitato and film thus entails reading cinematic and geographic spaces informed by documentary research and fieldwork. We seek to verify—to locate, traverse, ponder—various "settings" of terrain vague in a number of films shot either partially or entirely within the disabitato, including Federico Fellini's <span style="font-style:italic;">Le notti di Cabiria</span> (The Nights of Cabiria, 1957), Michelangelo Antonioni's <span style="font-style:italic;">L'eclisse</span> (Eclipse, 1962), and Pier Paolo Pasolini's <span style="font-style:italic;">Mamma Roma</span> . Although there are many classic and recent films alike with rich footage of the disabitato to draw upon, from Vittorio De Sica's <span style="font-style:italic;">Ladri di biciclette</span> (Bicycle Thieves, 1948) to Nanni Moretti's <span style="font-style:italic;">Caro diario</span> (Dear Diary, 1993), given our limited space, we chose to focus on a selection of both well-known and relatively obscure work of these three major directors from the late 1950s to the early 1970s.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>This period in the history of Rome, marked by frenetic postwar expansion, is of particular interest to the study of the disabitato, which has spread and shape-shifted as the city has mushroomed. The early stages of this growth in the 1950s and 1960s was marked by a rapid expansion of residential development into the surrounding rural periphery, and by the 1970s, as John Agnew comments, "an integrated Roman metropolis had come into existence," extending well beyond the official metropolitan neighborhood boundaries.<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> Despite this intensive development, today 67%, or 86,000 hectares, of the total area of the Comune of Rome (128,500 hectares), consists of open areas, either with sparse or no presence of buildings.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> This open space is made up of farm land, urban green space (including public parks and private estates), protected natural areas, and fluvial zones (such as the Tiber and Aniene rivers).</p>
<p>Many of these rough categories escape easy definition and can be referred to as terrain vague, what Ignasi de Solà-Morales defines as land in a "potentially exploitable state but already possessing some definition to which we are external," or "strange places" that "exist outside the city's effective circuits and productive structures."<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> Although Solà-Morales here focuses on still photography, moving pictures of terrain vague likewise "are territorial indications of strangeness itself, and the aesthetic and ethical problems that they pose embrace the problematics of contemporary social life."<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> In the case of Rome and postwar Italian cinema, one of the most pressing of such problems is, as Giorgio Bertellini and Saverio Giovacchini put it, the "ideological antagonism," stemming from the years of fascism, which pitted on one hand "a nostalgic attitude for a mythologized, distant past," typified in an idealized if outdated pastoralism, and on the other, "a longing for a brilliant future (modernization, an unknown interclass harmony and material well-being, or new cities and leisure activities) that appears on the horizon but is still largely unrealized."<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>We have chosen in the ensuing discussion to focus on what we consider to be the films of Fellini, Antonioni, and Pasolini that most directly engage with the disabitato. In so doing, we hope to clarify distinguishing characteristics in each director's approach to terrain vague over time, as well as to offer closer readings of particularly representative films. These films all do their part, in one way or another, to explode  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> postwar ideological antagonism and related distortions in psycho-social geographic perception of the oft-scorned disabitato. In the forty to fifty years since these films were made, some areas of the terrain vague that they document have been left to their age-old, almost invisible ferment, others built over or made into official parks, and myriad new ones created. Fellini, Antonioni, and Pasolini, driven by divergent artistic visions and political and aesthetic convictions, were drawn to the disabitato for a wide range of reasons. And yet all were, in one way or another, held in thrall by its strange and compelling admixture of seeming stasis, sudden baffling growth, and sphinx-like resistance to definition. All three treated the urban landscape not merely as background but "as an additional character," which, as Wim Wenders contends, has "a history, a 'personality,' an identity that deserves to be taken seriously."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> And yet the identity of the disabitato in Fellini's, Antonioni's, and Pasolini's work varies greatly. It is hard to imagine, for example, a greater contrast than between Fellini's appropriation of terrain vague as a carnival grounds to stage outrageous, frenetic fantasies, and Antonioni's ruthless, meticulous reassembling of microscopic details of suburban isolation to create disturbing psychological portraits of his main characters—to say nothing of Pasolini's brutally close-up depictions of the disabitato's poorest inhabitants in highly stylized portraits that draw as much from neorealism as surrealism.</p>
<p>In the spirit of what the architect and artist collective Stalker in their manifesto calls "actual territories," our research attempts to cross, and in doing so, temporarily inhabit and illuminate these "spaces of confrontation and contamination between the organic and the inorganic, between nature and artifice" that "constitute the built city's negative, the interstitial and the marginal, spaces abandoned or in the process of transformation."<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> We are interested, in other words, how film is inspired by and also depicts what Gil Doron terms "landscapes of transgression," derelict sites where "nature has started to reconstruct the built or (now) 'ruined' environment.… space[s] that opened in the dichotomy of what we perceive as city and nature."<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> A central concern is thus to study film both as a testament to a particular director's artistic vision of the disabitato, as well as a historical document containing evidence of transformation, of loss, of gain, in short, of "the process in which space comes into being."<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup></p>
<p>Our initial attempts to verify something of this process both within film and on the ground involved walking across areas of the disabitato, seeking to simultaneously better our understanding of terrain vague as concept and as physical site. Rephotographing frames captured from the films with an eye attuned to the interaction of people with their surroundings was a helpful starting point. Much came to light, such as how the staging of a scene betrays or pays homage to a site; how varying amounts of invention and "realism" can be injected by way of camera position and elaborate set design (or seeming lack thereof); and how the choice of locales and the sequencing of shots of travel through the city work to build a simulacrum of space. Some areas proved relatively easy to identify, such as the Don Bosco neighborhood bordering the Via Tuscolana and the nearby Parco degli Acquedotti, featured in the famous opening sequence of Fellini's 1960 <span style="font-style:italic;">La dolce vita</span> in which a helicopter with Marcello Mastroianni on board carries a statue of Christ over the San Felice Aqueduct and then continues high above  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the sprawling hinterlands of the city towards the Vatican (see <a name="1-text" href="#1">. 1</a> and <a name="4-text" href="#4">4</a>). Other areas proved more troublesome, such as the locations of Pasolini's <span style="font-style:italic;">Uccellacci e uccellini</span> or his 1963 <span style="font-style:italic;">La ricotta</span> (a parodic meta-film rich with scathing social criticism that documents a pseudo-film about the Passion of Christ) shot only a half hour away by foot but within relatively uncharted territory in the Valle Caffarella between the Via Appia Nuova and the Via Appia Antica.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> These more complicated searches brought us to blurrier edges of the city where flocks of sheep, sunbathing teenagers, wrecked cars, and abandoned buildings predominate and give a sense of what Gianni Celati calls in <span style="font-style:italic;">Verso la foce</span> (Journey to the Mouth of the Po) "a new variety of countryside where one breathes an air of urban solitude."<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup></p>

<p>Traversing from one location to the other, from (Fellini's) Via Tuscolana to (Pasolini's) Valle Caffarella, revealed much, from how the filmic landscape is packaged and edited into sometimes jarringly discrete, sometimes carefully connected scenes, to how the physical landscape has morphed over time into a related but distinct set of phenomena. And it is through travel that most people vaguely perceive terrain—vague within the confines of liminal areas of passage, what Marc Augé calls "non-places." These, he writes, are "formed in relation to certain ends (transport, transit, commerce, leisure)," and include airport lounges, motorways, and railways.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> Henri Lefebvre would refer to these as examples of "dominated (and dominant) space, which is to say a space transformed—and mediated—by technology, by practice."<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> When traveling through such non-places, a simulated landscape emerges through signs; although the more intimate landscape "keeps its distance[,] … its natural or architectural details give rise to a text sometimes supplemented by a schematic plan."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> Augé here refers to touristic sites, such as medieval villages or planned nature parks. It is rare, however, that a road sign, much less an explanatory brochure, indicates the tenuous existence of terrain vague. And even in the cases when signs hint at terrain vague —"no dumping," "unstable building," "no trespassing"—the reality on the ground often turns out to be  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> something quite different than expected. On the other hand, maps, assemblages of abstract locational signs, typically indicate terrain vague by way of inexplicit symbolic reference: a telltale blank zone.</p>

<p>And what of film? Can film serve as form of map—however fragmentary and potentially misleading—to be read as an aid in the transgressive act of crossing from non-place into terrain vague? We think so, but with a note of caution. Maps of this sort are as helpful to find one's way as to lose it, and may have much or little to do with the everyday reality, currently or in times past, of a particular site. Either way, once on the ground, it often becomes apparent what of the landscape is given most emphasis in a film, as well as what is decidedly left out. At best, treating film as map entangles us in overlapping filmic and physical places where we may interrogate location through wandering, (temporarily) lost, across vacant lots with scenes in our heads. Operating in this way, we passed between cluster after towering cluster of postwar housing and across swaths of urban countryside, weaving our way from the EUR to the Via Appia Antica, or from there to the Via Tuscolana.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> In these first attempts to use films as maps in order to locate terrain vague, we found ourselves practicing the opposite as well—that is, using terrain vague as a map in order to locate the films. In so doing, we often found ourselves trespassing beyond the limits of filmstrip, street, and field alike. In search of centripetal pathways, we often crossed, or when no other route was available, followed centrifugal arteries and small highways.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> These containers of mass movement, examined from their edges, revealed myriad bleed-zones, pores of minor movement: human and animal tracks, dirt side roads, vacant lots with failing fences, and occasionally also the present-day remains of a filmic landscape.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Fellini: The Disabitato as Stage</h1>
<p>Some of the first filmic landscapes of the disabitato that we confronted—often the hardest to "authenticate"—were areas filmed or recreated by Fellini, the director perhaps most famously associated with Rome. It is where almost all of his films were shot, a city he fantasized about, meddled with, and ultimately recreated in bizarre assemblages of the highly personal and hyper-real. <span style="font-style:italic;">Roma</span> , his great homage to the city, begins with his first impressions and memories as a young man newly arrived from Rimini in the late 1940s after World War II. In short order the film suddenly switches to "modern" Rome with its tangled autostrade and chaotic traffic, in which Fellini and his crew find themselves trapped in the pouring rain engulfed by a cacophonous, unending crescendo of horns, shouts, and revving engines. This culminates in a giant traffic jam at night by a fake Coliseum alit with an eerie, red glow. Later in the film, even underground layers of the city are explored, where Fellini "documents" a visit through the Metro's tunnels under construction.</p>
<p>The architecture of the city is something of a co-protagonist, but an architecture that melds into a bewildering, synesthetic urban fabric: the buildings, the piazzas, the streets, the interiors become colors, smells, noises, voices. Fellini's sense of realism is an extravagant interpretation with a touch of magic. He says in an interview for TV called "Fellini, Roma and Cinecittà," that describing Rome from memory is already an alteration of reality and that this justifies his need to escape real space at times.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> Every setting has to be revisited and reinvented in order to transre the reality and to joke around a little—or a lot. Many of his settings are entirely fabricated, from sections of the EUR in <span style="font-style:italic;">Le tentazioni del dottor Antonio</span> (The Temptations of Doctor Antonio, 1962) and the Grande Raccordo Anulare (or GRA, the highway that encircles Rome) in <span style="font-style:italic;">Roma</span>, to the Via Veneto in <span style="font-style:italic;">La dolce vita</span>, but it is not always easy to tell the difference. As he says in the interview, "Rome is Cinecittà … and Cinecittà is Rome."<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>It is common to hear both foreigners and Italians alike comment on how a random, usually somewhat bizarre experience in Rome seemed to be "right out of a Fellini film." What does this mean exactly? Was Fellini simply (or not so simply) adept at capturing a surreal overtone to everyday Roman existence through his inimitable blend of neorealisic documentation and, over time, increasingly absurd, dreamlike reinvention? Or is it that after viewing a film such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Roma</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">Intervista</span> (Interview, 1987), under its influence, we are more susceptible to a certain wishful thinking, to embellishing and elevating a chance encounter from the simply strange to the truly carnivalesque? Perhaps the answer is due, in varying degrees, to some combination of the two. We often found ourselves pondering this conundrum in hindsight, such as after being chased by a prostitute who had burst out of the bushes along the Via Appia Antica crying "Vieni qui amore, vieni qui!"—to say nothing of visiting the Gran Carnevale Romano on the Via Tiburtina with its collection of hokey homemade floats, live mules, a brass band, and diminutive ringleader in tweed and a derby hat shouting into a bull horn. Moments such as these, beyond mere hyperbolic anecdote, seem plucked out of <span style="font-style:italic;">Roma</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">I clowns</span> (The Clowns, 1970), and lend some weight to the idea that Fellini was indeed  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> able to simulate the city, including its physical form, through dissimulation—a sleight of hand by which he displays the everyday as extraordinary.</p>
<p>No doubt Fellini was aided in this regard by Rome's unpredictable mutability, its sprawling disorder, and its inevitable collapse. In another interview, with Costanzo Costantini, he states that "I'm not one of those aesthetes who claim there's no need to act against the decay of Rome, on the other hand, why not speed it up? And then, all the same, I look with affection upon this panorama of wreckage, of ruins and catastrophes. The torn-up roads, scaffolded monuments, archeological ruins and cosmopolitan crowds give it the air of a theater, a set, a half-dismantled stage, of a city in the process of being moved and rebuilt somewhere else. Rome is a mysterious planet."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> Fellini's ability to exaggerate reality to its breaking point—to create an extreme caricature of Rome—in certain cases serves to make the ordinary more recognizable, to breathe life into what normally might seem deadening. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Roma</span>, for example, his transformation of an autostrada into an impossibly hyperactive and chaotic zone of swarming, mechanized humans, complete with a horse-drawn wagon, transvestites and prostitutes camped out on the roadside, dead cattle, and a screaming busload of Napoli soccer fans, actually humanizes the supreme non-place of Rome, the GRA, by turning it into a landscape of transgression, a terrain vague. Rather than a place devoid of a recognizable, intimate sense of humanity, the roadway is bursting with it, inviting us to partake and trespass, to step over the bounds of acceptable spatial behavior. Rather than impersonally utilized, it is inescapably—albeit hellishly—inhabited.</p>
<p>But what of the GRA in "reality"? Can such bizarre and unrestrained behavior be encountered on the roadway today? The GRA is certainly chaotic, and at many times, especially after holidays, jammed with traffic, yet perhaps not particularly worse than many equivalent roads around other major urban cities in the world. However, when there is an evitable detour, especially along the western reaches of the highway where construction of its "final" segment has lagged for years, hints of Fellini's vision can be glimpsed, especially in the roadside shanties, dusty animal pens, ragtag flocks of sheep, and scores of prostitutes. Wide swathes of terrain vague flank much of the GRA along its circumference of the city, giving the roadway a sense of a transgressive landscape. To be sure, in order to reach the GRA from virtually any part of the city involves long, tortuous, and oftentimes painfully slow routes through terrain vague. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Roma</span>, Fellini gathers various commonplace examples of life from both the city and the nearby periphery and concentrates them to the point of madness on the highway. Exit the GRA during rush hour on the Via della Pisana, for example, and drive inland towards the city center, passing by Il Corviale, a gigantic, kilometer-long housing project flanked on one side by the remains of a rough borgata and on the other by scruffy pastureland, and you may find yourself coming to the conclusion that Fellini's vision might not seem to be so far-fetched.</p>
<p>Fellini's urge to include everything is of course doomed to fragmentation and failure, but as Andrea Zanzotto puts it, a poet from the Veneto who collaborated with Fellini on a number of films, including <span style="font-style:italic;">Casanova</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">E la nave va</span> (And the Ship Sails On, 1983), what else can we really do but hope, in the best of circumstances, to  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> "find a place for how much / scattered across the world remains / (head and tails, tails and head) / of sixthsense/thirdeye / adequately rendering it / trembling and wild in the weighing and evaluating—/ but as if it were too sweet and tender game—/ in the extreme of wideangling"?<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Even if at the end of shooting <span style="font-style:italic;">Roma</span> Fellini claimed that he "had the frustrating sensation that [he] hadn't even begun to scratch the surface," as art historian Hubert Damish observes, in this film "Fellini offered us a totally new point of view: the city seen from below, from underground."<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> Damish's comment is in reference to psychoanalysis, but could in certain respects be applied to architecture and geography, especially in regard to terrain vague, which when crossed with an "intensified perception," offers glimpses of an urban unconsciousness, repressed yet inexorable dreams, what Stalker terms "the unconscious becoming of urban systems."<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>Fellini's interest in the disabitato as a staging ground for fantasy is evident in most of his films, including his first solo feature, <span style="font-style:italic;">Lo Sceicco bianco</span> (The White Sheik, 1952), much of which was shot in the scraggly pine woods and on the half-wild, half-humanized littoral near at the edge of Ostia, a small and popular ragtag coastal town by the mouth of the Tiber. It is here that the fantasies are materialized of a honeymooning young wife (Brunella Bovo) infatuated with an absurd yet "dashing" hack actor (Alberto Sordi) of the fumetti (photographic comic books). However false and demeaning these dreams eventually turn out, they are allowed to run their course, carrying the action from the city center to the beach and then back again. Fellini shot portions of many of his films near Ostia, including <span style="font-style:italic;">I vitelloni</span> <span style="font-style:italic;">, La strada</span> (The Road, 1954), <span style="font-style:italic;">Otto e mezzo</span> (8 ½, 1963), and <span style="font-style:italic;">Amarcord</span> . It is also where, along a desolate stretch of road, Pasolini was brutally murdered in 1975.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Le notti di Cabiria</span>, the tale of a happy-go-lucky but hopelessly naïve prostitute (Giulietta Masina), also filmed in part near Ostia, is in many respects is Fellini's most sustained engagement with the disabitato as a site of transgressive inhabitation—in the form of postwar borgate. In this respect it is in ways similar to <span style="font-style:italic;">La strada</span>, a film in which a simpleton waif (Masina again) plays the part of a clown for an itinerant muscleman (Anthony Quinn) who together travel from one drab, ramshackle outpost to another, both along the outskirts of Rome and well beyond the city limits. The emphasis in <span style="font-style:italic;">La strada</span> is as much if not more on non-places (highways, curbs, gutters, side yards) as on terrain vague (often dirt lots used as impromptu carnival grounds). <span style="font-style:italic;">Le notti di Cabiria</span>, on the other hand, is set almost entirely in Rome, and ranges from seemingly anonymous rural slums and the emerging Don Bosco neighborhood near Cinecittà, to the Baths of Caracalla and the Passeggiata Archeologica along the Via Appia Antica. As opposed to later, more experimental work in which entire neighborhoods were fabricated, most of <span style="font-style:italic;">La notti di Cabiria</span> was shot on location.</p>
<p>In order to scout out many of these locations, and then later to help him with dialogue, Fellini enlisted the help of Pasolini after having read his poetry and <span style="font-style:italic;">Ragazzi di vita</span>, a novel written in an improvised Roman dialect about the lives of the street children of the borgate. The encounter proved to be the beginning of a short-lived, rather ill-fated collaboration due in part to major differences in aesthetic and political outlook, as well as Fellini's uneasiness with Pasolini's open homosexuality. Nonetheless,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the two set out in the morning, as Pasolini describes it, "from Piazza del Popolo in his massive and cushy car, drunk and exacting (like him), and road by road we eventually reached the outskirts: was it the Flaminia? the Aurelia? the Cassia? … Dragging me through that countryside lost in the sweetness of a honeyed season, he recounted the plot of <span style="font-style:italic;">Le notti di Cabiria</span>."<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> As Fellini describes it, "I wandered about with him through certain quarters immersed in a disquieting silence, certain infernal borgate with suggestive names, such as Cina medioevale (medieval China), Infernetto (Little Hell), Tiburtino III, Cessati Spiriti (Ceased Spirits)."<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup></p>

<div class="reEnd"></div>
</div>
<p>Whether or not a setting was decided upon during the trip, and this seems rather unlikely, it remains clear that Pasolini's knowledge of local Roman dialects (which Fellini lacked), and his vision of the borgate as expressed in his poetry, essays, and fiction, as well as in person, had a profound effect on Fellini and the making of <span style="font-style:italic;">Le notti di Cabiria</span>. As is evident in their brief descriptions of the trip, each held quite different views of the borgate. Pasolini felt a deep affinity for the working class and poor, and indeed sought them out, even living for periods of time in the borgate (albeit initially out of necessity).<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> Fellini, on the other hand, found the borgate fascinating, fertile ground for his cinematic fantasies, yet kept these areas at arm's length. For him they were material to be refashioned then cast aside for the next reverie. These differences are apparent of course in the filmic interpretations each created of the borgate, Fellini turning them into active subjects capable of the fantastical, albeit always under his strict, puppeteer-like control, and Pasolini referring to them more as quasi-sacred objects, sources of the raw, pure energies of the downtrodden proletariat, that he revered yet mined for evidence in support of his aesthetic and philosophic convictions. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In 1960, three years after the devastatingly sad yet still hopeful <span style="font-style:italic;">Le notti di Cabiria</span>, which ends with Cabiria tearily dancing along with scooter-riding teenagers after having narrowly escaped being murdered by her turncoat, thieving fiancé, Fellini explores the hedonistic and morally vapid world of celebrities, artists, the rich, and reporters in a Rome well into its headlong race towards modernization in the caustic and experimental <span style="font-style:italic;">La dolce vita</span>. Marked by depersonalized and chilly, newly built tenements scattered across dusty, weed-strewn fields, where Marcello, the main character and gossip column journalist lives with his depressed and suicidal wife, Rome's periphery in <span style="font-style:italic;">La dolce vita</span> becomes a grim and foreboding, nearly ahistorical place, testimony to the results of heedless postwar expansion. As Carolyn Springer observes, the film exhibits a city marked by a "loss of continuity, both temporal and spatial, with the traditions and values associated with the past and the provinces."<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> Movement is often dependent on the car with its disorienting speed and power to isolate the main characters from their surroundings and other people.</p>

<p> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>This jarring split between history and the present, underlined throughout the film, is foreshadowed in the opening helicopter sequence, which carries us from the patchwork of the Don Bosco quarter under construction to a playing field studded with ancient Roman ruins, flies high above the sprawling suburbs, suddenly jumps to the Vatican, and then finally, rather than transporting us to the seemingly promised Piazza di San Pietro, instead lands us in a nightclub. The film jumps back and forth between the periphery and the old city center, but never coherently links them spatially for the viewer. Alessia Ricciardi contends that "The architectural settings of the film's scenes appear to alternate between two different styles: that of a benign, dream-like <span style="font-style:italic;">ancienneté</span> associated with the pleasure principle and that of a grim, functionalist modernity associated with the reality principle."<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> And yet, it was in the outlying periphery that Fellini was most able to experiment, to tinker with reality, to more fully bring his fantasies to the screen, whether in the studios of Cinecittà or the nearby fields and surrounding borgate.</p>
<p>The Don Bosco quarter is less than half a mile to the north of (and in a certain sense includes) Cinecittà. At its center is the Piazza di San Giovanni Bosco, next to which the character Steiner in <span style="font-style:italic;">La dolce vita</span> lives in a modern apartment building. Just after Marcello's discovery of Steiner's murder-suicide, Fellini tricks us into believing that the piazza is part of the EUR by superimposing footage of Marcello on the apartment's terrace over an image of Nervi's Palazzo dello Sport and the adjacent mushroom-shaped building (commonly referred to as "il fungo") in Piazza Pakistan located near the heart of the EUR (see <a name="5-text" href="#5"> 5</a>). And yet earlier in the film, Marcello walks from the apartment into the nearby church of San Giovanni Bosco, which while roughly resembling the fascist-era architecture of the EUR, is a give-away to the actual identity of the neighborhood.</p>

<p> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>In addition to nearby ancient aqueducts, the church is one of the quarter's few noticeable monuments, and was what in fact first led us in our searches to the area. Sustained panning shots of the church and nearby tenements occur a number of times in Pasolini's <span style="font-style:italic;">Mamma Roma</span>; also, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Le notti di Cabiria</span>, during her ill-fated courtship with the disingenuous thief, Cabiria makes a brief appearance near the church in the middle of a dusty field with what was to become Steiner's building nearing completion in the background (see <a name="2-text" href="#2">. 2</a> and <a name="3-text" href="#3">3</a>). With printouts of frames from these scenes in hand, we spotted the church for the first time while walking near the catacombs of St. Callixtus on the Via Appia Antica, and then decided to cut over to find it. During our trek through the fields, we then stumbled upon the Valle Caffarella and soon realized that it was the setting of <span style="font-style:italic;">La ricotta</span>. We thus in short order started to understand how overlapping areas of the disabitato could be packaged into diverse, and quite contrasting, cinematic realities—from a crucifixion paired with a feast in <span style="font-style:italic;">La ricotta</span>, to a publicity photo shoot with a mule in <span style="font-style:italic;">La dolce vita</span>—or how the disabitato could simply serve as the inspiration for its own complete refabrication.</p>
<p>A case in point, even when Fellini chose the not faraway EUR as the setting for his first color film, <span style="font-style:italic;">Le tentazioni del dottor Antonio</span>—a bizarre face-off between inhibition and morality, sensuality and puritanism, fear and desire very little of the footage was actually shot on location. Fellini recreated a miniaturized version of the EUR in order to enlarge Anita Ekberg to enormous proportions so that she towers above the quarter, once magisterially bureaucratic, now sheepishly dwarfed. Ekberg, scantily dressed and advertising milk, appears on a billboard erected amidst riotous neighborhood celebration in a vacant lot directly across the street from the outraged moralist Doctor Antonio's apartment on Viale Asia. After the doctor fails to repress his obsessive desires, Ekberg magically steps out of the photograph at night, and then from the Palazzo della Civiltà e del Lavoro (commonly known as the colosseo quadrato, or square coliseum) chases him along the Viale della Civiltà e del Lavoro to the Palazzo dei Congressi. The city in this episode becomes a theater of the grotesque framed by an agonizing series of repeated geometric porticos and arches.</p>
<p>When asked why he chose the EUR for this film, Fellini wryly responded by saying that</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>I love this place so much that in fact I live on Via Margutta, because as you know, things you like must live in your dreams, you must fantasize about them and desire them! The metaphysic atmosphere of the EUR reminds me of De Chirico's paintings. You have the impression of living inside one of these paintings, in a world ruled only by aesthetic connotations and you relate to objects and solitude in a different way. There is a sense of suspension as if you are floating above a flat horizon, a feeling of improbability and temporality, which is psychologically comforting for a fabricator of images like me.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Fellini often commented on how much he admired Rome and its familiar comforts, almost as if the city were an extension of home, with its streets seeming corridors and its piazzas rooms. And yet his love of the air of a stage set, of the disorienting sensation that certain locations could be transformed into any place (as well as "anyplace"), consistently attracted him to the ill-defined edges of the city. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Antonioni: The Absent Presence of Terrain Vague</h1>
<p>In contrast to Fellini's effusive reassembling of reality, in particular of using the disabitato as a staging grounds in order to reinvent, Antonioni's approach instead is a controlled engagement with carefully delimited spaces in order to document. Similar to Fellini, he plays with an architectural model, but a physical one at its actual scale with people moving through its buildings and streets. His interest in terrain vague revolves around ideas of liminality and vacancy, of the edges of consciousness, identity, and place. The sense of transgressive space, almost always conjoined to its converse, repressive space, is often conjured in his work by exploring the confines of a building or an intersection, rather than the expanses of a empty field.</p>
<p>A student of architecture in his youth, Antonioni masterfully uses the interiors of buildings and both urban and rural landscapes in his work, a practice evident at the very beginning of his career in <span style="font-style:italic;">Gente del Po</span> (People of the Po Valley, 1943–'47), a short documentary film on his native cultural landscape. His framings of settings closely correspond to his characters' feelings and states of mind. Dialogue, often strained and faltering in his later films (at times even indicative of near aphasia), is secondary to the sequencing of images of the positions and movements of bodies and objects in space. "Landscape and the elements" in his films, according to Geoffrey Nowell-Smith, "are powerful determinants of the action, but so are smaller spaces, the emptiness or constriction of a room, the closeness of a blank wall. The physical prevails over the social, and landscape cuts characters down to size."<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> Even more emphatically, Michael Schwarzer argues that architecture is so important for Antonioni that it becomes a character in and of itself, a "protagonist and antagonist, nucleus for the slow collapse of perception into a space between the actors' lives, a visual language with a power all its own."<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> The distinction between humans and their surroundings fades to the point that, as Ted Perry points out, "there is no 'background' in the usual sense; all is foreground because, like a Möbius strip, there is no clear demarcation where one stops and the other begins."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup></p>
<p>Evident in many of Antonioni's films, such as <span style="font-style:italic;">L'eclisse, La notte</span> (The Night, 1961), and <span style="font-style:italic;">Il deserto rosso</span> (Red Desert, 1964), is what William Arrowsmith refers to as the director's "familiar polar geography—the comparison and contrast—of city center and countryside, as well as their interim world at the periphery … the neither-nor space where the city gives out, where the paving abruptly stops and the high-rise palazzi of the <span style="font-style:italic;">quartieri nuovi</span> yield to shacks and open fields."<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> In <span style="font-style:italic;">Il deserto rosso</span>, Antonioni's first color film, the focus on desolate landscapes, both urban and rural, is intensified. The action oscillates between a grey, seemingly abandoned Ravenna neighborhood, to nearby industrial wastelands dominated by factory noise, fire, and pollution. The unstable mental state of the main character, Giuliana (Monica Vitti), seems underpinned, if not exacerbated, by her precarious surroundings. In <span style="font-style:italic;">La notte</span>, too, there is an attempt to parallel the decay of the city outskirts with the emotional or psychological states of characters. This is perhaps most evident in the slow, uncertain wandering of Lidia (Jeanne Moreau) from the hospital in Milan's city center to the industrialized periphery and the tree where she and Giovanni (Marcello Mastrioanni) formerly met  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> during a time when the area was still relatively rural and served by a small tramline. An abandoned farmhouse, its overgrown courtyard, the untended tree, and the weedcovered tram tracks are the most evident signs of the former landscape—now a terrain vague temporarily overlooked at the margins of new, large-scale development.</p>
<p>The ominous beginning of <span style="font-style:italic;">L'avventura</span> (The Adventure, 1960), shot in a similarly doomed landscape, this time a liminal area of Rome within view of Saint Peter's Basilica, portends a story beset with loss and the threat of becoming lost. The character Anna (Lea Massari), soon to disappear on the island of Lisca Bianca, is shown passing from a walled garden with her father to a dirt road in view of new buildings under construction. He explains that their family house is to fall prey to the advance of the nearby housing developments and then, distraught, bemoans the distance he feels growing between him and Anna. The scene is carefully framed so that the housing projects appear between Anna and her father, and that the basilica rises to his side. The new construction seems to indicate cultural instability caused by the onslaught of modern consumerism, whereas the basilica, as Schwartzer comments, may indeed serve "as a counterpoint to the present chaos in both architecture and society."<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> However, the glimpse of the Vatican may also indicate the implacability and inescapability of concentrated power, here symbolized in the modern world's most archetypal example of monumental Christian architecture.</p>
<p>This passing reference to the Vatican calls to mind its more forceful yet similarly brief appearance in <span style="font-style:italic;">La dolce vita</span>, as well as the distant and much less distinct glimpse of the Chiesa dei Santi Paolo e Pietro and the colosseo quadrato in <span style="font-style:italic;">Uccellacci e uccellini</span> (see <a name="9-text" href="#9"> 9</a>). All three of these scenes of monumental buildings are framed by shots of the periphery, yet with significantly differing results. Fellini seems to want to mock, or at least underline, the faltering hold of the Vatican on a fast degenerating Italian society. Pasolini, on the other hand, makes his shot of the EUR the only reference in <span style="font-style:italic;">Uccellacci e uccellini</span>, however indistinct and fleeting, to a recognizable "official" quarter of Rome. This is perhaps in part to downplay the relevance of the built city to his main characters, as well as to add a surreal twist to the viewer's already distorted sense of disorientation in the film, which is set almost entirely in either the borgate or in the countryside to the north of Rome near Viterbo. And in <span style="font-style:italic;">L'avventura</span>, all architectural images, whether of condemned rural structures, rising modern housing complexes, or the implacable Vatican, are soon, oddly enough, dominated by a small fisherman's shack in which the mildly distressed characters take refuge during their futile search for Anna amidst the island's bewildering rocky landscape. In all cases, however, these various forms of terrain vague seem to indicate snarls of desire, loss, and change, as well as to act as elusive anchors to the movements of the main characters who wish to escape from their sterile everyday routines, but tend to only ensconce themselves deeper. Terrain vague in each case prophesies instability, yet also renders a certain transgressive, transformative action possible—however misdirected and eventually destructive that action may prove to be.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">L'eclisse</span>, Antonioni's minute examination of a pocket of suburban space in the EUR—and a far cry from Fellini's playful, absurdist fantasy in <span style="font-style:italic;">Le tentazioni</span>—terrain  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> vague and transgression are generally felt, rather than seen. In this story of stale and sterile love and the isolation of modern life, Antonioni painstakingly examines a lesser known pocket of the new "borghesia romana" not far from the Palazzo dello Sport and the artificial lake, between a still peripheral Via dell'Umanesimo and Via della Tecnica in the EUR's southwest corner. <span style="font-style:italic;">L'eclisse</span> certainly offers a more coldly realistic observation of the EUR than <span style="font-style:italic;">Le tentazioni</span>, but one that is similarly almost entirely divorced from the historic center. The one notable exception is the stock exchange scene in Piazza di Pietra where, amidst the chaotic scenes of yelling and wrangling brokers, the ill-fated end to the relationship between Piero (Alain Delon) and Vittoria (Monica Vitti) is foretold in a shot of the couple separated by an ancient Roman stone column. The isolating column, in turn, also acts as a reference to the dominating and bleak landscape of the modernist neoclassical EUR.</p>
<p>Even in the film's final scene, which reveals the result of inaction rather than action—the apparently independently taken yet shared decision of the two tentative lovers not to meet at the corner of an unfinished building—there is an attempt to connect the human psyche and the stark landscape of the EUR. Terrain vague, on the other hand, is only glimpsed in patches along the outskirts—between buildings and at the ends of half-built avenues—but is never given the space of the full screen. Indeed, terrain vague in the film, while always nearby, is most notable for its absence. Even when Vittoria and Piero sit in a grassy vacant lot, their view (and ours) is dominated by the towering fungo building—what a number of critics have read as an allusion to nuclear war (see <a name="6-text" href="#6"> 6</a>). Emphasis instead is placed on containment and immobility, on the desolateness of the neighborhood, what Schwarzer refers to as "a cemetery for the living."<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> It is pictured, as Lefebvre describes a plan by Le Corbusier, as the result of a catastrophic urbanism which prevents us "from thinking about the city as a place where different groups can meet, where they may be in conflict but also form alliances, and where they participate in a collective <span style="font-style:italic;">oeuvre</span>."<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> Lacking a nearby center of diverse human activity and interaction, as well as access to (which includes an accepting knowledge of) untamed open space, the characters have little choice but to wander within the confines of their predetermined and alienating quarter.</p>
<p>Even today the EUR in places gives the impression of an unfinished neighborhood, especially on the weekend when government workers have evacuated the numerous ministries located there. Vittoria's apartment on 307 Viale dell'Umanesimo, however, is now surrounded by an upscale neighborhood notable for its appearance in <span style="font-style:italic;">L'ultimo bacio</span> (The Last Kiss, 2001), in which a group of sociable young friends regularly meet to frolic in the fountain in front of the Palazzo dello Sport. The impression in this more recent film, as well as on the ground, is of an area well past the point where vacant lots dominate, even if at times an air of abandonment can be felt. There is a sense that the developers' original goal has been largely realized of creating a "noble neighborhood," slated for this and other nearby postwar suburbs, such as Casal Palocco a few miles down the Via Cristoforo Colombo, visited in the early 1990s by a characteristically quirky and suspicious Nanni Moretti in <span style="font-style:italic;">Caro diaro</span>. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

</div>
<div class="reEnd"></div>
</div>
<p>With these many changes to the EUR, forecast to a degree by Antonioni, the question arises of whether a film that plays with the isolation of the developing modern city and its inhabitants alike, such as <span style="font-style:italic;">L'eclisse</span> does, be possible today in the EUR? Has the EUR district developed past the framework imposed by <span style="font-style:italic;">L'eclisse</span>? Our impression is that, despite the development and infilling of vacant lots, including the growth of a few bustling commercial streets, there remains an underlying sense of emptiness in the EUR that parallels the isolation depicted in the film. Antonioni's focus is so tight that most of the film's locations in the EUR are within a radius of five minutes by foot from Vittoria's apartment. He so carefully selected buildings and prospects of the cityscape, that we are never given an organic vision of the EUR. If there were the beginnings in the early 1960s of the vibrant shopping area on viale Europa, for example, we wouldn't be able to tell from what Antonioni shows us in <span style="font-style:italic;">L'eclisse</span>. That said, finding rough parallels to locations in <span style="font-style:italic;">L'eclisse</span> isn't particularly difficult—though of course creating a contemporary homage (or god forbid a remake) of the film, is another matter altogether. Oddly enough, a part of the neighborhood that until recently would have still qualified as terrain vague is literally across the street from the couple's ill-fated construction site meeting spot at the intersection of Viale della Tecnica and Viale del Ciclismo—a scruffy park and the abandoned velodromo at its center (built for the 1960 Olympics, closed in 1968, then demolished in 2008 to make way new swimming pool and fitness center). This area for years fell into disuse and decay from the time of the film, in which its pristine yet empty presence is underlined by a large sprinkler and a stack of building materials.</p>
<p>Then again, perhaps the relative lack of rural wasteland matters only so much to Antonioni's vision of terrain vague. As opposed to Fellini's expansive, wide-angled recreation of the EUR in <span style="font-style:italic;">Le tentazione</span> and Pasolini's minimized, telephoto glance of it from distant fields in <span style="font-style:italic;">Uccellacci e uccellini</span>, Antonioni's analysis of the area is  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> decidedly microscopic and enclosed. The only moment that Vittoria and Piero find themselves, seemingly by accident, outside of the built world is when they sit on the strip of unkempt land near the "fungo" building. There is no sense that this provides a source of escape, or that the vast expanses of open (yet unseen) land nearby are a source of comfort. On the contrary, the characters are limited by the confines of tightly delimited urban spaces. Seemingly inhibited by both mental and architectural or urbanistic constraints, Vittoria and Piero appear to exhibit the malaise that results when transgressive space is off limits, when there is no recourse to "empty spaces" or "voids," which, as Careri writes, are a "fundamental part of the urban system, spaces that inhabit the city in a nomadic way, moving on every time the powers that be try to impose a new order."<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> Certainly Vittoria's and Piero's non-appearance at the end of the film at the intersection where they had previously promised to meet seems to confirm their tendency for an isolation reflective of their immediate surroundings. This said, it may be true that the two are simply unsuited for long-lasting attraction to take hold. Piero is thoroughly engrossed in the competitive capitalistic world of finance, while Vittoria seems to yearn for less materialistic goals—but a finer-grained understanding of their inner personalities is hard to determine, given the characters' difficulty in expressing themselves when together.</p>

</div>
<p>Nonetheless, Antonioni's decision to document the abandoned meeting place from which the couple has vanished, instead of portraying the two going their separate ways, reinforces the overwhelming presence of the meticulously sterile suburb as a force which seems to make puppets of the two. At this point the camera ruthlessly interrogates the streetscape and closes in on seemingly insignificant details of the area's everyday existence, such as water leaking out of a barrel, swarming ants, and stiff-lipped passersby. The movie turns into a mini-documentary: all that which at the beginning seemed  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> background now becomes the main subject. Many of the elements, now familiar from earlier scenes—the intersection with its crosswalk, the building under construction, the failing streetlight, the mechanical sprinkler, the pile of construction materials, bus wheels, residents of the EUR walking along the wide streets—are brought to the fore and take on a disturbing significance, that of a widespread, failed urbanism, which indeed "eclipses" the abandoned story of abandoned love. And despite the fact that this final sequence can also be interpreted as a non-judgmental, vaguely appreciative, perhaps even Zen-like aestheticization of this splintered intersection of the EUR, as Antonioni himself says, "All the objects that I show have significance. There are seven minutes in which only the objects remain of the adventure: the town, material life, has devoured the living beings."<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Pasolini: Transgressive, Dangerous Space</h1>
<p>A more explicit devouring of living beings by their peripheral Roman surroundings—in this case the working class, or unemployed and often homeless, rather than the upper-middle class—is at the heart of much of Pasolini's literary and cinematic production, especially films such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Accattone</span> (Beggar, his first full-length feature from 1961), <span style="font-style:italic;">Mamma Roma</span> , <span style="font-style:italic;">La ricotta</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Uccellacci e uccellini</span>. In these films, set progressively further out from the city center, from the Testaccio in <span style="font-style:italic;">Accattone</span> (the first planned working class neighborhood in Rome from the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries), to the Tuscolano II housing complex in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mamma Roma</span> (not far from the Piazza di San Giovanni Bosco and Cinecittà in the Cecafumo sub-quarter), to the Valle Caffarella in <span style="font-style:italic;">La ricotta</span>, to the farthest reaches of the disabitato along half-built autostrade and beyond in <span style="font-style:italic;">Uccellacci e uccellini</span>. These early films expose and interrogate what John David Rhodes terms "the story of the periphery's rapid and reckless growth, legible in countless anonymous apartment buildings and housing projects … the story of Rome's redefinition in the postwar period."<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup></p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Accattone</span>, the tale of a spirited yet impoverished pimp seemingly predestined for an early end, indeed provides a graphic illustration of the urban underbelly of this postwar redefinition. With few exceptions, such as the Ponte di Sant'Angelo's brief appearance at its beginning, the film focuses almost entirely on squalid slums whose hovels appear cobbled together from scraps by their destitute yet resilient inhabitants, who like Accattone, must call upon an indomitable, common human spirit in order to survive. In pointing the lens on Rome's downtrodden, at times tragic, yet also vigorous and vital borgate, Pasolini radically reshaped their depiction in cinema, as Bertellini and Giovacchini argue, representing them "not merely as … site[s] of oppression to be transformed and eliminated, but as the context where new, oppositional values were forged."<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> This catalytic energy stems from what Pasolini envisions, according to Maristella Casciato, as "a certain sacred quality" contained within "the decadence of these places, their degradation of environmental, social, and human values."<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> The power then, of Pasolini's cinema, is that it, as Adelio Ferrero writes, "makes sacred once again a world that from extreme marginality is already sliding into the past and into myth."<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Mamma Roma</span>, a title that certainly suggests mythology, is the story of a prostitute (Anna Magnani) who decides to "retire" in order to open a vegetable stand and bring her illegitimate son Ettore (Ettore Garofolo) from the country (the village of Guidonia, located between the neighborhood of Rebibbia and outlying Tivoli) into the city to live with her. After a brief stint in Mamma Roma's flat in a squalid Liberty-styled tenement near Campo Verano, the two eventually settle in the newer, yet ultimately just as stigmatizing and oppressive, Tuscolano II housing complex near the present-day Parco degli Acquedotti. Initially, Mamma Roma is convinced that the move will be a step-up in the world. Here they are soon discovered, however, by Mamma Roma's ex-pimp, who in threatening to reveal her besotted past, forces her back into the profession in order to pay for his silence. As this drama plays itself out, Ettore starts to make friends, spending most of his time in the nearby open fields peppered with fragments of Roman ruins and aqueducts, as well as rows of wretched shanties. Pasolini frequently contrasts the dense (and in his mind failed) housing development with this nearby terrain vague, contextualizing the overall setting with a number of sustained panoramic shots (see <a name="2-text" href="#2"> 2</a>). Despite all the good intentions of his mother, Ettore is soon drawn into petty crime, and like the much less innocent Accattone, meets a similarly tragic fate—in a prison-bed scene that eerily reconstructs Mantegna's <span style="font-style:italic;">Cristo Morto</span> (Dead Christ).</p>

<p> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>A reversal of the loud and dominant mother re played by Anna Magnani in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mamma Roma</span>, is the deaf and mute one played by Silvana Mangano in the short film <span style="font-style:italic;">La terra vista dalla luna</span> (The Earth Seen from the Moon, 1966), the story of a father and son (Totò and Ninetto Davoli) in an absurd and desperate search for a wife/mother replacement. Shot in color, it is set in a clustered, squalid borgata and includes a short scene of publicly aired desperation atop the coliseum (a plea for money in order to buy a house)—a seeming reference to Alberto Sordi's similar, if less tragic, plea for money in order to go to America in <span style="font-style:italic;">Un Americano a Roma</span> (An American in Rome, 1954). <span style="font-style:italic;">La terra vista dalla luna</span> ends where it begins, back in the borgata in the characters' old shack with the line dividing life and death rendered uncertain through the absurdist yet disturbing twist: Mangano returns from the tomb, zombie-like, frightening Totò and Davoli and raising the question whether the sub-proletariat are in fact forms of the walking dead.</p>
<p>Not quite dead, but certainly not quite human, Totò and Davoli also appear <span style="font-style:italic;">Che cosa sono le nuvole</span> (What are the Clouds, 1967), an absurdist spoof loosely based on <span style="font-style:italic;">Othello</span> in which their puppet-like characters finally find peace while gazing at the clouds after having been cast upon a heap of garbage in a landfill—once again at the margin of the city in what seems a thinly veiled reference to the borgate. The actors' best known work with Pasolini, however, is in the earlier <span style="font-style:italic;">Uccellacci e uccellini</span>, a comic and at times surreal, fable-like journey on side roads and through fields of a buffoonish father and his cheerful yet empty-headed son accompanied by a philosophical, talking raven. It continues Pasolini's break from neorealism not long before amplified in <span style="font-style:italic;">La ricotta</span> and creates a strange yet familiar universe dominated by metaphors. The raven is depicted as an idealistic and moralizing intellectual trying to rationalize the ambiguity and confusion of life (in part Pasolini parodying himself—as he does in <span style="font-style:italic;">La ricotta</span> with Orson Wells playing the part of the director). Evident in the film, too, is a critical grappling with the doctrines of Christianity and Marxism. Partway through, father and son suddenly are transformed into Franciscan monks with the task of learning to speak to birds and then illuminating them—first raptors, then songbirds—to the teachings of Christ. Pasolini even inserts a section of striking documentary footage of Palmiro Togliatti's funeral in 1964, attended by an estimated million people.</p>
<p>In more than any of his other films, Pasolini's focus here turns entirely on the marginal city, which rather than functioning as an empty landscape, rather becomes an at times grating, at times soothing, countermelody for the characters who wander, seemingly without end, across vast stretches of terrain vague, from fields along the Ciampino Airport, to the neighborhood of Torre Angela on the east side of Rome not far from the GRA, a shantytown near Ostia, and the hills surrounding the beautiful Romanesque complex of the church of San Pietro in Tuscania near Viterbo.</p>
<p>Scattered throughout the journey are myriad dwellings of the poor, including various examples of casali Romani.<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> The built space here is spontaneous architecture, vernacular structures with little obvious historical connotation. Most, built by workers from scrap materials, rise in what Pasolini called "boundless places where you think / the city ends, but instead / begins again, inimical, / a thousand times over, with bridges  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> / and mazes, excavations and scaffolds / behind giant waves of tenements / that cover entire horizons."<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> Pasolini "viscerally loved the periphery," as Piero Spila notes, because of its precariousness, of its being "on the point of disappearing, of being swallowed by the new, advancing city."<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> This uncertain existence seemed to him to be somehow outside of history, or as he often put it, "ahistorical," and thus all the more malleable and open to interpretation.</p>
<p>Pasolini's cinematic shaping of the disabitato (and his subjects in general) relies in large part on his peculiar skill at what we might call painterly filmmaking, a practice explicit in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mamma Roma</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">La ricotta</span>, and also present in <span style="font-style:italic;">Uccellacci e uccellini</span> with its richly visual and suggestive metaphysical landscapes. As Ferrero puts it, one of his essential motives in these films is to create in "cinema a mannerist re-composition of realty."<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> Pasolini's framing of shots in <span style="font-style:italic;">Uccellacci e uccellini</span> almost always includes elements of the scattered city, from lone houses and medieval towers, to cheap apartment buildings and worn-out roads—underlining, as many renaissance paintings do, the connections between landscape, its inhabitants, and their spiritual and moral beliefs (or lack thereof). Most shooting is at the level of the human eye. Pasolini's strength in filmmaking comes not so much from technical virtuosity or elaborated movements of the camera, but instead from masterful, pictorial framing of characters combined with their environments. In ways evocative of Piero della Francesca's famous painting of the Duca di Montefeltro in front of his territories, Pasolini films Totò and Davoli next to ramshackle shantytowns and half-built highways—except of course the latter, rather than owners, are the dispossessed.</p>
<p>Relationships of ownership in Pasolini's work are indeed often unclear. Such scenes raise many questions, as troubling today as they were in the 1960s. To whom does the disabitato belong to? Who has the right to use and/or develop the disabitato? Is social and environmental injustice to be endlessly repeated, or are there other solutions? At one point during the film, at a fringe of Rome where the city nearly disappears in its process of grafting onto the countryside, father and son wander along a half-built overpass, an infrastructure that underscores the uncertainty of the sub-proletariat. Here and elsewhere in the film, the recognizable city remains far in the distance, well beyond the edge of the screen. Only once towards the end of the journey, as noted before, does Pasolini frame a small EUR district, catching the bare outlines of the Palazzo della Civiltà e del Lavoro and the Chiesa dei Santi Paolo e Pietro (see <a name="9-text" href="#9"> 9</a>). Throughout the movie the absence of the familiar city makes one think about it more. "Where is the rest of Rome?" viewers are likely to ask themselves. Vast stretches of nowhere land are all that Pasolini offers. And yet by doing exactly this, Pasolini is able to intensify our perception and render ourselves able to listen as "a necessary condition in order that the territories [areas of the disabitato] unveil themselves to those who desire crossing them."<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup></p>
<p>Pasolini's work, like that of Antonioni and Fellini, certainly reminds us of the importance of "the small, the empty, the open" spaces in a city that, as Wenders states, "allow us to recharge, that protect us against the assault of the big."<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> And yet, as important as the disabitato was to all three, each according to his own particular artistic vision  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> produced startlingly different visions, choosing to exaggerate and minimize, magnify and suppress, and ultimately reinvent and reshape the disabitato. Fellini saw the disabitato as a potential circus ground, a place to play out his personal fantasies on the level of the masses. He tried to breach the line between artifice and reality, between his own dreams and those of a greater humanity. In essence, the disabitato was the ultimate stage for him, loosely but decidedly connected a peripheral Roman reality, mysterious and manipulable because just outside of the political and religious power center of Italian society. Even more suspicious of this center, Pasolini instead sought to simultaneously document yet also aesthetize the disabitato, focusing on the sub-proletariat while exploring and enlarging his recurrent interests in power relations, religion, and death. Rather than a stage, the disabitato becomes an ideal background upon which to paint his cinematic visions, thereby allowing him to escape to a degree the linguistic specificity of word and allowing access to a more universal language. And lastly, Antonioni treated the disabitato as a mixed architectural and psychological residue, the tattered edges of the troubled (upper-middle class's) collective consciousness. His meticulously orchestrated shots of interiors and exteriors, both of people and places, communicate something of the suspension of life at the margins of our perception.</p>

<p>Indeed, all three directors have a common interest in exposing all that which we fail to fully perceive, be it terrain vague of the mind or earth, or more likely some combination of the two. Their films draw us out of our comfortable (or uncomfortable) shells of material reality, and invite us to traverse, rethink, and in so doing, perhaps even reconre overlapping cinematic and physical renderings of our everyday world. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f1" href="#f1-text">1. </a>This paper has its origins in a two-week film retrospective presented by Manuela Mariani at the American Academy in Rome from January 23 to February 3, 2006, entitled "Roma: Architettura nel Film/Rome: Architecture in Film." The event featured films set in Rome and explored how architectural aspects of the eternal city such as intersections, piazzas, buildings, and neighborhoods are employed in a variety of cinematic approaches, from Rossellini's neorealism to Fellini's magic realism. In part, the series examined how urban fabric, whether actual or fabricated, is woven into plot and characterization through the manipulation of focal point, perspective, and setting. Included were movies by directors such as Elio Petri, Michelangelo Antonioni, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and Peter Greenaway. Each evening consisted of a short introduction (with the use of clips and stills from films related to the evening's theme) followed by the main feature. The series highlighted the close links between cinema and architecture, specifically how both forms of art recreate temporal and social structures, and how they delineate and explain lived space.</p></div>

<p>In the early 1960s, Sweden witnessed the advent of a new type of poetic writing. It was a writing that deviated from the lyrical protocols of the time, a writing that did not seem to pay proper attention to poetry as a conveyor of metaphoric messages or as an instrument for excavating the depths of the human soul. Thus, in the fall of 1961, the artist and poet Carl Fredrik Reuterswärd, whose earlier work had gravitated towards Nonsense verse, Dada, and the practice of Marcel Duchamp, published a book called <span style="font-style:italic;">På samma gång</span> (At the Same Time), consisting of words dislodged from a dictionary, distributed symmetrically across the page.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup></p>

<p class="continued">Instead of creating semantically significant syntactic structures, Reuterswärd construed linguistic grids. Instead of stitching verbal elements together into a "living" tissue, he engineered a surface of signs, where each word constitutes an atomized and semantically multifunctional unit.</p>
<p>A few months before this book appeared, something similar took place in the new literary magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Rondo</span>. In its second issue, four texts were printed from a series of poems called "Hyllningarna" (The Celebrations) by the young poet and composer Bengt Emil Johnson.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> Johnson had earlier published a few poems situated within an established modernist poetics, while at the same time paying homage to the tradition of nature poetry  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> in Sweden. His new work, however, moved in a somewhat different direction, partly due to his interest in contemporary music, and in particular the music of John Cage. In these poems language was processed beyond the confines of grammar, producing sound play and wild juxtapositions, forcing the reader to acknowledge "the word as such," in line with the credo of Russian futurism.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>youi o-ing youing-you yokingyou ing mouthwet you<br>slumquarters into sings<br>:to-into under front :to-in-to-you to-ing-nt-in<br>gathering lovely to<br>:a mouth–to-park-o-ing drives waltz-o-tô</p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">If Reuterswärd confronted language as something to be collected, sampled, and arranged, Johnson tested the possibility of shaping or molding words as if they were some kind of physical matter. What they had in common, however, was the focus on language as <span style="font-style:italic;">material</span>, as something to construct and combine with, without the restraints of linguistic conventions or any notions of a "natural" language. Such deviations might certainly be considered endemic to poetry, but here they were pursued with an insistence and inclination towards artifice unprecedented in Swedish literature.</p>
<p>While some were bewildered by these experiments, others seemed more attuned to their workings. "A kind of concrete poetry," the critic Bengt Höglund suggested in his perceptive review of Reuterswärd in the leading literary journal in Sweden, <span style="font-style:italic;">Bonniers Litterära Magasin</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">BLM</span>), at the same time reiterating comments issued earlier that year and confirming the arrival of a new genre.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> If the advent of concrete poetry in Sweden was thus announced, it was however an event marked by belatedness. Already in 1954, the poet and artist Öyvind Fahlström had declared the form's potentially prosperous future in his article "Hätila ragulpr på fåtskliaben" ("Hipy papy bthuthdth thuthda bthuthdy," a phrase culled from A. A. Milne's children's book <span style="font-style:italic;">Winnie the Pooh</span>), where it was presented as a challenge to the self-expressivity and symbolism of a post-romantic modernism. With a voice framed by the generic conventions of the avant-garde manifesto, and with a quote from F. T. Marinetti as supporting epigraph, Fahlström thus claimed, "Today, with laboured symbolic cryptograms, silly romantic effusions or desperate grimaces outside the church gate being propounded as the only healthy options, the concrete alternative must also be presented."<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>At that point in time, no one listened. But the times were changing. Seven years later, in an essay called "Bris" (Breeze), published in <span style="font-style:italic;">Rondo</span> 3, 1961, Fahlström returned to his manifesto and to his "bord," as he called his concrete poems, using a portmanteau consisting of "<span style="font-style:italic;">b</span>okstäver" and "<span style="font-style:italic;">ord</span>" (words and letters).<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> Now, against the backdrop of the new poetry and art that had emerged in an international context during the second half of the 1950s—Fahlström explicitly mentions concrete poetry from Brazil, Germany, Switzerland, and other places as well as artists and composers such as Cage and Robert Rauschenberg—he considered it urgent to once again address the possibility of a poetry not anchored in narrative, metaphor, and self-expression; a poetry open to formal  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and medial hybridization, to chance and procedural play, and to the exploration of the materiality of language as sound, visual conration, and, even, an object to touch.</p>
<p>However, Swedish concrete poetry was to deviate not only from the standard formats of poetry in its home environment. It would also, in part, distinguish itself from the dominant forms of concrete poetry that were disseminated globally during the 1950s and early 1960s, and thus challenge some narrower definitions of the genre.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> In this essay I will explore a few of these differences. But the main goal of the text is to map out the emergence of concrete poetry in Sweden, how its poetics of artifice were elaborated, and how it was fueled not only by its adherence to an avant-garde tradition in poetry, music, and art, but also by certain historical conditions that marked the postwar period—in particular its expanding ecology of new media. Concrete poetry's emergence during a threshold in the history of media, marked by the introduction of new technologies such as television, the tape recorder, and the computer, and new and radical theories of communication and information, such as cybernetics, is no coincidence. The postwar years might even be said to inaugurate a new "discourse network" (Friedrich A. Kittler), whose workings are difficult to trace—we are still immersed in it—but whose effects can be observed reverberating within the aesthetic practice that will be addressed here.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">I</h1>
<p>The inception of concrete poetry in Sweden must then be dated to the publication of Öyvind Fahlström's article in the mimeo magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Odyssé</span> in the spring of 1954, where it was accompanied by the poem "MOA " (see excerpt, <a name="1-text" href="#1"><span style="font-style:italic;">re 1</span></a>). This text, which was later to be subtitled "Manifesto for Concrete Poetry," was at the outset a polemic against the conservatism of the contemporary poetry scene, but its main thrust was to be found in the outline of a poetics based on language as "concrete matter." Before publishing his manifesto, Fahlström had been trying for a few years to find a way as a writer. He was sitting on a pile of unpublished manuscripts indebted to the poetics of Surrealism, especially those strands that led to Antonin Artaud and to the erotic machinations of the proto-Surrealist Marquis de Sade.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> Evoking a certain corporeality and an interest in scatology and eroticism, the legacy of these writers was smuggled into his concretist poetics, and thus grafted a bodily materialism onto the linguistic materialism that was the focus of his manifesto—a bodily materialism that in the end would include all forms of physical matter.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Fahlström's key ideas, posited in his manifesto, were to comprise a kind of toolbox for future concrete poets. While starting off with claiming that one can proceed intuitively <span style="font-style:italic;">or</span> according to systematic principles (he mentions, for example, the methods of twelve-tone music), he soon begins to discuss a set of formal devices. These can be organized along three vectors, similar to the tripartition of poetry by Ezra Pound into <span style="font-style:italic;">phanopoeia, melopoeia</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic;">logopoeia</span>, and to the analysis of the linguistic sign as a "verbivocovisual" entity, as suggested by James Joyce, and, later, the Noigandres  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> poets in Brazil (i.e. Augusto and Harold de Campos and Décio Pignatari). Firstly, Fahlström emphasizes the exploration of the visual space of the page, for example through alternative stanza formations and vertical spacing of letters and words, the aim being to liberate the reader's gaze from its linear and lateral programs. Secondly, he draws attention to the dynamics of rhythm and res of sound. And thirdly, most importantly, Fahlström suggests that one should approach language as physical matter, as a tactile object that one can squeeze and manipulate.</p>

<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>KNEAD the linguistic material; this is what justifies the label concrete. Don't just manipulate the whole structure; begin rather with the smallest elements—letters, words. Recast the letters as in anagrams. Repeat letters within words; throw in alien words, <span style="font-style:italic;">plea–vroog–se–do</span>; interpose letters that don't belong, aacatioaanniya for action; explore children's secret code languages and other private languages; vocal glides: <span style="font-style:italic;">gliaouedly</span>. And, of course, newly coined lettristic words. Abbreviation—on a manic scale—to coin new words, as in everyday language [ … ].<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Through cuts and incisions into the very texture of signs, through substitutions, inversions, and interventions into the laws of word formation and syntax, the significance of the poetic text is programmatically displaced and shifted from the hermeneutic logic  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of surface writing and depth meaning, manifest media and latent message towards a play with material signifiers.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>Fahlström was of course aware of a line of predecessors to his "concrete alternative." He mentions writers from "the Greeks" to Rabelais, from Lewis Carroll to Gertrude Stein, Kurt Schwitters, Artaud, and Lettrism.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> One visual artist is also cited, the Italian painter Giuseppe Capogrossi, but symptomatically—it was probably too purist in its outlook—not much credence is given to concrete art. Music, on the other hand, and especially the <span style="font-style:italic;">musique concrète</span> of French composer Pierre Schaeffer, stands out as emblematic for the poetics that Fahlström wants to expound. "If I use the word concrete in this context it is thus more in relation to concrete music than to concrete art in a restricted sense," he declares, and explicates further:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The fundamental principle of concrete poetry is perhaps most beautifully illustrated by Pierre Schaeffer's experience during his search for concrete music: he had on tape a few seconds of railway engine sound, but was not content just to follow that sound with another, even where the juxtaposition was itself unusual. Instead, <span style="font-style:italic;">he cut out a small fragment</span> of the engine sound and <span style="font-style:italic;">repeated</span> this fragment at a slightly different pitch; then went back to the first, then the second, and so on, setting up an alternation. Only then had he actually created; he had <span style="font-style:italic;">operated on the material itself</span> by cutting it up, the elements were not new; <span style="font-style:italic;">but from the new context thereby created emerged new matter</span>.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">In addition to influences from literature and art, the concrete alternative thus finds support in an innovative musical practice. But beyond this cluster of intra-aesthetic impulses something else is disclosed. Schaeffer's <span style="font-style:italic;">musique concrète</span> was historically dependent on technical inventions in the realms of sound recording—without the latter the former would not exist. As Liz Kotz has suggested in a recent study, sound recording, and more specifically the tape recorder, can actually be seen as an important, if not determining instance for a wide range of innovative language based art in the 1960s.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> Kotz's focus is on the American situation, and her main artistic reference is John Cage. In a Swedish context one might substitute Cage with Schaeffer, and considering the latter's prominent position in Fahlström's poetics, it is necessary to stress the role of magnetic recording in relation to Swedish concrete poetry.</p>
<p>Magnetic recording separates sounds and voices from their sources in time and space, and turns them into objects to manipulate—through technical operations such as cut'n'splice, erasure, superimposition, and so on. And, crucially, this is the operative register that Fahlström transposes to the media of language and poetry. Poetry is weaned from its aesthetic roots in the human voice and mind, and the process is relayed through the machinery of a new media technology as well as through an avant-garde aesthetics. While concrete poetry, to a certain extent, repeats forms, methods, and gestures from the early avant-garde of futurism and dada, these are not only theoretically refined through a more sophisticated "analysis" of the linguistic sign, they are also activated in a new historical and technological situation, which widens and differentiates their significance. The materialization of language in concrete poetry could thus be said both to reflect and comment upon a cultural situation in which, for example, voice was not  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the identifying mark of an individual or a human body, but an acoustic effect open for technological manipulation and distribution.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">II</h1>
<p>Around 1960, Öyvind Fahlström's manifesto began to circulate in Xeroxed copies among younger poets in Sweden.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> Together with his poetry, and his essay "Bris", it would play an essential role in the formation of a specifically Swedish tradition of concrete poetry. Even if not constituting a <span style="font-style:italic;">movement</span> in a strict sense, the work of writers and artists such as Mats G. Bengtsson, Torsten Ekbom, Elis Eriksson, Jarl Hammarberg, Åke Hodell, Bengt Emil Johnson, Leif Nylén, and Carl Fredrik Reuterswärd, would at least establish a <span style="font-style:italic;">network</span> of aesthetic (and often social) relations, connected to magazines such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Rondo</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Gorilla</span>, and to venues such as Fylkingen and Moderna Museet in Stockholm.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> The term "concrete poetry" also occupied a central position in the debates about open form and the hybridization of the arts during the first half of the 1960s. In contrast to the situation in most other countries, concrete poetry in Sweden was not only presented and discussed in little magazines and similar contexts, but also in the big media.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> Most collections of concrete poetry were—with some exceptions, such as Åke Hodell's small press Kerberos—published by the country's largest publishing house, Bonniers. This specific infrastructure definitely contributed to the genre's breakthrough, but the lack of <span style="font-style:italic;">alternative</span> institutional structures might also have been one of the causes for its rather quick disappearance from the <span style="font-style:italic;">literary</span> field towards the end of the decade.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup></p>
<p>Tracing the effects of Fahlström's ideas simplifies the task of mapping concrete poetry in Sweden. A key operation was, as indicated above, the "kneading" of language, a process that should begin at the lowest levels of poetry. Here numbers, graphemes, diacritical signs, code, and so on, would infiltrate the alphabet. A paradigmatic example of this mixture of sign systems is Jarl Hammarberg's rendering, in a poem, of "question mark" as "fr?g?tck?n," where three of the vowels in the word have been substituted by the mark in question.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> Such an ironic intervention into the word highlights the artifice of concrete poetry, but it also points out the wider field of signification that it was to investigate, such as the relationship between symbolic, iconic, and indexical signs. In some productions of Swedish concrete, alphabetic signs were even to be excluded completely. In Carl Fredrik Reuterswärd's infamous book <span style="font-style:italic;">Prix Nobel</span> (<a name="2-text" href="#2"><span style="font-style:italic;">re 2</span></a>), a work published in 1966, but initiated in the beginning of the decade, one encounters a web of punctuation marks spread out over the pages, orchestrating an absent text or speech.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup></p>
<p>The poem, which in part anticipates verbal operations in conceptual art, suggests an open work, a <span style="font-style:italic;">score</span>, for which the reader must provide not only voice, but also words. <span style="font-style:italic;">Spacing</span> here comes forward as the primary condition for poetry, and perhaps there is a poetic process at play already in these diagrammatic grids, these fragile framings of a supposedly absent content. When Reuterswärd made a sound recording of his poem in 1963, he subverted the idea of an absent content as well as the well-known hermeneutical expectations of filling the lacunae of a text. All that was heard from the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> grooves in the record was an ironic voice articulating "comma, comma, dash … "<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup></p>

<p>The most conspicuous effects of this manipulative poetics would, however, surface on the level of word formation and syntax. In the same manner as elsewhere on the globe of concrete poetry, different kinds of transformations and displacements of letters were effectuated, and syntactical organization would be substituted with lists, series, grids, permutations, and clusters. A discernible difference in Swedish concrete, particularly if compared with the output of influential work by Eugen Gomringer in Switzerland or the Brazilian Noigandres poets during the "heroic phase" of concrete poetry in the late 1950s, was that these operations were often mixed with other methods, and they were not always used in a consistent manner; they were rather heuristic devices in the field of poetic research than prescriptive models to follow. One should of course be wary of constructing a monolith either of Swedish concrete poetry or its others, but where Gomringer's or the early Noigandres' works strove for brevity, balance, and isomorphism in the "verbivocovisual" complex of the linguistic sign, the poems in Sweden often tended to be longer, formally heterogeneous, and perforated by representational elements as well as semantic excess and graphic and acoustic noise.<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup></p>
<p>One reason for this can be traced to its surrealist legacy, a legacy that was denounced by several other concrete poets, for example Haroldo de Campos.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> This legacy also explains the exploration of scatological, alimentary, sexual, and dreamlike imagery in a lot of Swedish concrete, which contrasts starkly with the formal constraints and mechanical procedures of the poetry, while at the same time establishing a productive tension between human and machine, nature and artifice. The combinatorial play with letters and words would result in unsettling verbal aggregates such as "leatherbrain"  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> or "siphonenvirons" (Bengt Emil Johnson), disclosing a grotesque, if not cybernetic, anatomy of alien bodies, "out of which pencils grow," to employ an image from Jarl Hammarberg, which evokes the influential notion of media as extensions of man in an even more tangible way than in the media anthropology of Marshall McLuhan.</p>
<p>Another reason for the Swedish specificities is to be found in the readiness to <span style="font-style:italic;">combine</span> systematic formal procedures with "intuitive" or "subjective" operations. Contemporary Swedish critics also tried to make a distinction between the homegrown version of concrete and its German namesake, for example, by describing the former as more subjective, romantic, organic, and handwritten.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> If this indicates a difference, it is, however, a difference in degree. Moreover, it might even be misleading when situating Swedish concrete within the larger field of poetic writing. I would rather claim that the binaries evoked here—subjective/objective, natural/artificial, expressive/constructive, organic/mechanic—binaries often used to describe, interpret, and evaluate poetry—are destabilized and challenged in this poetic project.</p>
<p>Some of this can be observed in the work of Bengt Emil Johnson. Johnson's concrete poetry was on the one hand charged by an interest in the procedures of contemporary (e.g. serial) music, on the other hand it was nourished by a verbal imagination indebted to burlesque, surrealist, and even romantic poetic imagery. In his first collection, <span style="font-style:italic;">Hyllningarna</span> (The Celebrations), one finds, for example, the poem "Fyra bluestexter" (Four Blues Lyrics), which, apart from alluding to Blues, employs a compositional method analogous to those in serial music. Here are the first two unrhymed couplets in the first of the poem's four sections (rendered in Swedish):<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup></p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>man har fog för sin gråsot du nu har nog närdröms ventilsystem fel<br>vart hon rör sig går hon mjukrundat mot väggförgrening gnyende svagt</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>och för sitt vågblods skull mutation när höstbensin ryker ner medarna<br>för i år och nu blundar hon självsökande i tystheten sakta tom</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">Johnson's poem is constructed according to a strict rule—every line must employ the same set of eighteen vowels (<span style="font-style:italic;">aaoöiåouuaoäöeiyee</span>), with the adjunct that the first vowel in each line is displaced to the last position in the following line, thus producing a cyclic movement in the poem's sound pattern. Even if not a chance procedure in the manner of Cage, the poem is partly generated by this external constraint, and it is marked by a semantic indeterminacy. Some of the poem's syntactical oddities and coinages—"närdröms" (closedream's), "vågblods" (waveblood's) and "höstbensin" (autumngasoline)—can be attributed to this constraint or rule. But, at the same time, the poem's vocabulary is distinctly Johnsonian, as if the rule was from the beginning in sync with the poet's material and metaphoric imagination. The result is a strange mix of programmatic constraint and poetic license, objective restriction and subjective intervention, also discernible elsewhere in Johnson's work. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">III</h1>
<p>The kneading operations employed in Swedish concrete were certainly not limited to letters, words, and syntax. They were also integral or at least connected to the other two methods in Fahlström's manifesto—the exploration of visuality and sonority. These methods of materializing poetry would also pave the way for a transgression of <span style="font-style:italic;">the book</span> as the privileged media technology of poetry. The significance of sound recording was, as we saw, possible to perceive already in Fahlström's manifesto, and the conceptual proximity between concrete poetry and visual art led to an investigation of new materials and alternative venues for the presentation of poems, such as the gallery space.</p>
<p>One link between concrete poetry and sound was, as we have seen, forged through Fahlström's interest in <span style="font-style:italic;">musique concrète</span>. This relationship was at the core of his poetics, and it resulted in a transposition of methods and models between the two arts and the inclination to apply concepts from music in poetic writing. If this is something of a perennial maneuver in poetry, the tendency to entitle poems <span style="font-style:italic;">sonatas</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">quartets</span> and similar things was here expanded to include, for example, reading instructions. Some poems were also composed explicitly as <span style="font-style:italic;">scores</span> for a performance, such as Fahlström's "Den svåra resan" (The Difficult Journey) from the mid-1950s, which had the significant subtitle "For Mixed Speech Choir," and which was organized as a set of notations for eighteen different voices (<a name="3-text" href="#3"><span style="font-style:italic;">re 3</span></a>).<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup></p>
<p>Such sign/sound amalgamations reach over into the realm of <span style="font-style:italic;">sound poetry</span>, and it is difficult, if not counterproductive, to establish a generic demarcation line here. Swedish concrete poets often used res such as alliteration and assonance in an excessive way, and the kneading of letters and words makes accessible a latent acoustic space within language, either through alphabetic notations of sound, or through actual vocalizations of everything from song to soundscapes on stage, record, and tape. Several publications of concrete poetry were, consequently, supplemented either with a recording or a stage performance, such as Åke Hodell's first book of concrete poetry <span style="font-style:italic;">igevär</span> (Shoulder Arms, 1963), a minimalist satire of the military-industrial complex, consisting of a single utterance ("iiiiiiiiiiii … gev … äääää … r"), graphically extended to fill the pages of a whole book, and vocally rendered in a long and strenuous performance with six readers.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> On the whole, this performative aspect was integral to the practice, and resulted in tumultuous tours of concrete poetry through Sweden and the other Nordic countries during the years 1963–1964.</p>
<p>Even more acoustically elaborated was the development of concretist methods in the sound recording studio. This possibility was acutely present for many Swedish poets, who collaborated with engineers at Sveriges Radio (Swedish Public Radio) to explore the aesthetic potential of sound. The recordings of concrete poems, enhanced and refined through echo, filtering, and backward playback, would further evolve into work with sound collage, and eventually lead to the birth of the genre of <span style="font-style:italic;">text-sound composition</span>.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> Crucial in this process were the radio pieces by Fahlström, not the least his pioneer "radiophonic poem" <span style="font-style:italic;">Fåglar i Sverige</span> (Birds in Sweden, 1962), which combined operations from concrete poetry with narrative and juxtapositions of a variety  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of recorded sounds (opera, pop music, machine guns, elephants).<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> This was certainly poetry based on the presence of sound recording technology. As Bengt Emil Johnson and the composer Lars Gunnar Bodin wrote in 1964: "Tape recorders, contact microphones and sophisticated loud speaker systems, projectors etcetera are instruments that through their sheer existence change the conditions for artistic work."<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> Poetry was on the verge of leaving the Gutenberg Galaxy—a tendency that would also affect the poetic production that was still to be registered in print.</p>

<p>The visually more conspicuous works of concrete poetry, however, mostly emerged in print, between the tarnished covers of the book, even though sometimes transposed to a life between frames, as in the big manifestation and exhibition of concrete poetry <span style="font-style:italic;">Svisch</span> at Moderna Museet in 1964.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> The visual imagination and methodology in Swedish concrete poetry was as vivid and various as its "tactile" and acoustic counterparts. It ranged from typewriter graphics and typographic variations to handwritten poems, drawings, and collage. While poets such as Jarl Hammarberg and Mats G. Bengtsson investigated handwriting in poems that could be related both to comic strips and to the scripts of <span style="font-style:italic;">art brut</span>, Åke Hodell, for example, explored the potential of the collage in a series of books from the period. Most convincing is perhaps his <span style="font-style:italic;">Självbiografi</span> (Autobiography, 1967) (<a name="4-text" href="#4"><span style="font-style:italic;">re 4</span></a>), where the title suggests a specific generic status, and thus a certain form, but where the reader encounters not a chronological narrative of the poet's life, but a montage of texts from Plato, Marx, Nietzsche, and others, juxtaposed with photographs from Eadwaerd Muybridge, military maps, comics, diagrams, and so  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> on. The techniques used to construct this autobiography—and this is an interpretation that finds support in other works by Hodell—suggest that human identity as such is to be considered a montage, or a constantly shifting aggregate of body, mind, and various representations generated from different media machines.<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup></p>

<p>The use of the typewriter as an excavator of verbivisual space—a privileged method in concrete poetry in general—was perhaps most dynamically realized in Bengt Emil Johnson's second book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Essäer om Bror Barsk och andra dikter</span> (Essays on Brother Rough and Other Poems, 1964) (<a name="5-text" href="#5"><span style="font-style:italic;">re 5</span></a>). Generically unstable, just as Hodell's book, this collection also testifies to the mix of organic and mechanic elements that was touched upon before.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> But, first and foremost, Johnson's book exploits the combinatorial possibilities of the verbal and the visual within concrete poetry. In his essay "Bris," Fahlström had discussed the typewriter as an instrument for poetry, and among other things he touched upon its role in constructing "word maps," a designation that fits well with the linguistic landscapes in Johnson's book.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> This is a poetry that urges the reader to wander around on a surface—or in a space, since the layering of words sometimes evokes illusions of depth. Further, to discern the visual res on the pages, or to read the words and sentences in Johnson's book, one has to change the distance  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to the actual object and even turn it around. The physical motor activity of the reader is thus more varied than the one usually accompanying readings of poetry. One might conceive of this book as a proto-<span style="font-style:italic;">cybertext</span> or as an <span style="font-style:italic;">ergodic</span> piece of literature, to use the terminology Espen Aarseth has established in his influential theory of digital texts.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> Even though cybernetics, as <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> new theory of communication during the 1960s—and it would have an obvious impact on avant-garde writing in Sweden—is comically degraded in Johnson's book ("new wanking grammar"), this is a book that embraces and explores the new media conditions of poetry, while at the same time challenging their determining and regulating force on perception, understanding, and conceptualization.</p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">IV</h1>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Essäer om Bror Barsk</span> thus actualizes something that has been of vital concern here—concrete poetry as a poetry "in the age of media". While Swedish concrete poetry explicitly tied onto an avant-garde tradition of writing—most directly addressed, perhaps, by Fahlström in his references to Stein, Artaud, Schwitters, and others in the manifesto—there were also other factors that shaped its forms, methods, and medial materializations. Within the restricted field of aesthetic practice, music perhaps served as a primary model, even more so than literature. But the negotiation with the new media ecology of the postwar period was an equally important aspect. In Fahlström's poetics, the impact of the advent of technical sound recording was integral to the development of linguistic kneading and Schaeffer's manipulated recordings offered a contemporary frame of reference for his poetics. In Åke Hodell's poetry, modern technology was frequently evoked as formative for human identity and experience—and, of course, for reading and writing—while also being criticized for its potentially dehumanizing effects. And in Bengt Emil Johnson's work, new music and its reliance on technical sound recording would give the impulse to an imaginative use of technology, poetic constraints, and media based protocols, which were also to be challenged in radical ways, for example, as we saw, by turning the logic and the expected output of a typewriter inside out—typing a text whose signs don't come forward in a discrete series, but overlaid and blurred, by neglecting the lateral-linear spacing for a more tumultuous graphic space, by approaching illegibility instead of legibility, and so on.</p>
<p>Such features make it easy to juxtapose Swedish concrete poetry with a set of other innovative artistic practices during the 1960s, such as <span style="font-style:italic;">musique concrète</span>, Fluxus, happenings, and conceptual art. The mutual reliance on new media led to similar formal, material, and methodological solutions, which sometimes becomes obvious, for example, in the case of a poet and artist such as Carl Fredrik Reuterswärd, whose work, retrospectively, might just as well be categorized as <span style="font-style:italic;">conceptual</span> art or writing. On the other hand, as several critics have suggested in recent years, concrete poetry (also the Swedish branch) seems to anticipate the digital textuality that has been explored during the last decades. Non-linearity, hypertextuality, multimediality, and post-alphabetic writing are all characteristics that can be used to describe the "concretist" practice. Moreover, the interest in cybernetics and code, and the investigation of rule-based poems, disclose an "algorithmic imagination" at play that underpins such a comparison.</p>
<p>From the horizon of the present, (digital) media conditions might actually help us to re-frame and re-conceptualize some of these avant-garde works from the 1960s.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> But, vice versa, the concretist works can also give us a perspective on some of the historical and material conditions for the contemporary web of digital media, a web whose effects sometimes seem so exhilarating and sublime that its material and historical foundations tend to be erased. Such an observation offers a clue to the renewed interest in recent years in concrete poetry, not the least among contemporary poets. It is perhaps not only that the "multimedium" of the computer opens up a new space for exploring poetry as a verbivocovisual endeavour; concrete poetry might also offer tools  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> (even if re-formatted for a present situation) to question and complicate the features and forms of culture and media today.</p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f3" href="#f3-text">3. </a>See <span style="font-style:italic;">BLM (Bonniers Litterära Magasin)</span> 10 : 835. Thus, for example, Johnson, in a statement attached to his poems in <span style="font-style:italic;">Rondo</span>, declared that "in poetry the phonetic-rhythmic-typographic etc. plays an increasingly important role // i.e. the idea of POETRY AS CONCRETE MATTER." And in <span style="font-style:italic;">BLM</span> 8 : 627–629, the writer Sun Axelsson introduced the poets of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Wiener Gruppe</span> (Friedrich Achleitner, Gerhard Rühm, and others) to Swedish readers.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f4" href="#f4-text">4. </a>Fahlström's manifesto "Hätila ragulpr på fåtskliaben" ("Hipy papy bthuthdth thuthda bthuthdy") was published in the mimeo magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Odyssé</span> 2–3 . It was reprinted in a slightly modified version in the collection of Fahlström's concrete poetry <span style="font-style:italic;">Bord. Dikter 1952–1955</span> (Stockholm: Bonniers, 1966), 57–61. The most obvious change was the addition of a subtitle, "Manifest för konkret poesi" (Manifesto for Concrete Poetry), and the date "1953" (presumably the year of its composition). I will henceforth, to simplify, designate the text as "manifesto," and refer to it as "Hätila." The manifesto was first translated for Mary Ellen Solt's anthology <span style="font-style:italic;">Concrete Poetry: A World View</span> (Bloomington,: Indiana University Press, 1968). In this essay I will quote, however, from a later translation that appeared in the big retrospective catalogue on Fahlström's oeuvre, <span style="font-style:italic;">Öyvind Fahlström. Another Space for Painting</span> (Barcelona: MACBA, 2001), 51–59. The quote above is from page 51.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f6" href="#f6-text">6. </a>For example it would thus be problematic in this context to adhere too closely to definitions of concrete poetry that emphasize "the use of language in a reduced form," Pedro Reis, "Concrete Poetry: A Generic Perspective," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Experimental-Visual-Concrete. Avant-Garde Poetry Since the 1960s</span> (Amsterdam and New York: Rodopi, 1996), 287; cf. also Richard Kostelanetz, <span style="font-style:italic;">Dictionary of the Avant-Gardes</span> (Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 1993), 45.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f7" href="#f7-text">7. </a>This is a central argument in my book on Swedish concrete poetry, <span style="font-style:italic;">Alfabetets användning. Konkret poesi och poetisk artefaktion i svenskt 1960-tal</span> (Göteborg and Stockholm: OEI Editör, 2005). See further, on the issue of a new discourse network and a threshold in media history, Friedrich A. Kittler, <span style="font-style:italic;">Discourse Networks, 1800 / 1900</span>, tr.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f8" href="#f8-text">8. </a>Fragments from these manuscripts have been published in magazines. Otherwise they can be found at the Royal Library in Stockholm and in the Fahlström Archive, curated by Sharon Avery-Fahlström and located at MACBA (Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona). Fahlström's first published text, in 1949, was, symptomatically, an article about the Marquis de Sade, and he would publish translations of Artaud in the magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Odyssé</span>. For a bibliography of Fahlström's writings, see <span style="font-style:italic;">Öyvind Fahlström. Another Space for Painting</span>.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f9" href="#f9-text">9. </a>Fahlström actually considers his "bord" to be objects or bodies on a par with other physical matter in the world. He thus writes, "the concrete reality of my worlets [bord] is in no way opposed to the concrete reality of real life [ … ] they stand as an organic part of the reality I inhabit," "Hätila", 59.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f11" href="#f11-text">11. </a>Fahlström's ideas anticipate some aspects of the cut up-method formulated by William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin in 1959. There is no coincidence that Burroughs shows up several times later in Fahlström's art.</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f12" href="#f12-text">12. </a>"Hätila," 59. One could add to this a poet whose operations seem close to the kneading suggested by Fahlström. I am thinking of the <span style="font-style:italic;">sdvig</span> articulated by Russian Futurist Ilya Zdanevich. For a brief description of his <span style="font-style:italic;">sdvig</span> or shift poetics, see Johanna Drucker, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Visible Word.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f15" href="#f15-text">15. </a>Internationally, as indicated in note 4 above, his manifesto did not become known until the mid-1960s, when Swedish concrete poetry by Fahlström, Johnson, Åke Hodell and others also was represented in the big anthologies of concrete poetry, such as Solt's <span style="font-style:italic;">Concrete Poetry: A World View</span> and Emmett Williams' <span style="font-style:italic;">Anthology of Concrete Poetry</span> (New York: Something Else Press, 1967).</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f17" href="#f17-text">17. </a>Concrete poetry was debated and reviewed in nationwide papers such as Aftonbladet, Dagens Nyheter, Stockholms-Tidningen, and Svenska Dagbladet.

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f18" href="#f18-text">18. </a>In 1968 the Swedish writer and, at that time, editor of <span style="font-style:italic;">BLM</span>, Lars Gustafsson, wrote an obituary of concrete poetry. Whilst at that point the output of concrete poetry was decreasing, its ideas were disseminated to and appropriated by other parts of the aesthetic field – such as text-sound composition. However, it was not until around 2000 that younger Swedish poets returned to and tried to reframe this poetics for contemporary readers.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f22" href="#f22-text">22. </a>An illustrative comparison would be to juxtapose two similarly shaped poems from the 1950s, Fahlström's "Bobbs inhägnad" (see <span style="font-style:italic;">Bord</span>, 38) and Eugen Gomringer's well-known "das schwarze geheimnis." Both are shaped like squares, but where the latter thrives on a meta-linguistic riddle, the former – apart from activating language's potential for both symbolism and iconicism (in C. S. Peirce's sense) – also unfolds a fragmentary narrative about the enigmatic and burlesque character Bobb, addressed in a series of poems by Fahlström, all generated from the same linguistic material.</p></div>

<p>In a 1931 photograph entitled "Meeting in Taxco during Siqueiros's house arrest," the Mexican artist David Alfaro Siqueiros sits between the American architect and silver impresario William Spratling and the Russian avant-garde filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein; the Mexican filmmaker Chano Ureta is seated next to Eisenstein [<a name="1-text" href="#1"><span style="font-weight:bold;">re 1</span></a>]. As the title suggests, at the time of the photo Siqueiros had been recently exiled to Taxco, a small mining town approximately one hundred miles southwest of Mexico City, after spending eight months in a Mexico City prison for "subversive activities." In Taxco, the artist lived in an abandoned church high above the city which also housed his workshop as well as a gallery, an art school for children, and a meeting place for the newly emerging artistic and intellectual community which recently began traveling to Taxco to buy the silver produced in Spratling's workshop.</p>
<p>What does the meeting of three international modernists in a small Mexican town in 1931 tell us about early 20<sup>th</sup>-century global networks—both real and imagined? In the image, all four men wear hats and look directly at the camera. Their choice of headwear is illuminating. Spratling and Siqueiros wear leather sombreros popular among <span style="font-style:italic;">vaqueros</span> (Mexican cowboys) and revolutionaries, Eisenstein and Ureta wear berets, which in 1931 were already a symbol of the Parisian bohemian artist. While their choices may not be intentionally provocative, through objects as benign as hats, the men signify multiple cultural allegiances. Siqueiros' and Spratling's sombreros evoke vernacular Mexican traditions while Eisenstein and Ureta's berets place them within a more cosmopolitan milieu. Thus this image demonstrates how material goods can signify meaning; it also speaks directly to the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> tensions between the local and the universal that frame the history of global modernism. This article explores these tensions by focusing on the real and imagined networks that linked these artists at this particular moment in time.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> By focusing on the multiple networks that brought Siqueiros, Spratling, and Eisenstein to Taxco in 1931—chains of interconnected people, ideas, and things—I hope to bridge the universal and the local, the national and the cosmopolitan, the folk and the modern to reach across oceans, time periods, and mediums to complicate our understanding of global modernism. In particular, I pay attention to the centrality of new forms of technology and material goods to chart the creation and proliferation of a vernacular modernist vocabulary.</p>

<p>I am borrowing the term vernacular modernism from the film scholar Miriam Hansen. While she uses it to discuss the idea of Americanism in classical Hollywood film in the context of Soviet avant-garde cinema, I think the concept is helpful here since it both articulates and mediates the experience of modernity, "such as mass produced and mass consumed phenomenon of fashion, design, advertising, architecture and urban environment, of photography, radio and cinema."<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> The idea of a mass-produced vernacular, as opposed to the popular (which in the Mexican example has a different meaning than it does in the United States; it is more closely aligned with what we call the folk), highlights the place of the quotidian and the local within universalizing discourses of modernism and modernity. Within vernacular modernism, the marketplace  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> becomes a crucial site for the dissemination of what it means to be modern at this moment in time. <sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>By 1931 Mexico was already a hub in the modernist network, both real and imagined. Indeed, American art historians often refer to the late 1920s through the early 1940s as the years of the "Mexican craze" or the "Mexican Invasion."<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> Due in part to the wars in Europe as well as to increased railway travel between the Americas, Mexico became a popular tourist destination. Anthropologist Nestor Garcia Canclini, in his study of Latin American modernism, stresses the importance of tourism in creating internal national as well as international cultural identities. He compellingly argues that one of the enduring effects of the tourist market is to turn the particularities of ethnic cultural expression into a larger category of "type."<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> Indeed, as Alex Saragoza has pointed out, the post-revolutionary Mexican government capitalized on its tourist market to promote an intensely nationalist cultural project as a form of state building.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> Mexican restaurant owners, merchants, and hoteliers developed an essentialized vocabulary of national identity<span style="font-style:italic;">: lo mexicano, mexicanidad, el pueblo mexicano</span>, etc—through which they created stock characters and images of the "typical Mexican garb, souvenirs, music, architecture" <a name="2-text" href="#2"><span style="font-weight:bold;">[re 2]</span></a>.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> The circulation of images was key to the success of this project. Posters such <a name="2-text" href="#2">re 2</a>, depicting a beautiful smiling woman carrying colorful fruit, surrounded by lush vegetation inhabited by exotic birds and flowers, enticed visitors to "Visit Mexico." The features of the woman in the image are not overly exoticized. The details of the landscape, with its palm trees and colorful parrots, but especially the women's long braids and tan skin as well as her dress—which is embellished with a pre-Columbian motif—mark her as different, but not too different.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mexican artists, in particular <span style="font-style:italic;">Los Tres Grandes</span>, the big three muralists Diego Rivera, Jose Clemente Orozco, and David Alfaro Siqueiros, capitalized on their status as art world celebrities and their embrace of <span style="font-style:italic;">mexicanidad</span> to secure lucrative commissions abroad. A number of exhibitions celebrating Mexico's pre-Columbian heritage, its folk arts, and its recent artistic renaissance were assembled and traveled throughout the United States.<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> A number of artists and writers, including Katherine Ann Porter, Hart Crane, Martha Graham, Paul Strand, Marsden Hartley, Edward Weston, and John Dos Passos, to name just a few, traveled extensively or lived in Mexico during this period, and Hollywood producers promoted the exotic and revolutionary flavor of the country through films such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Girl of the Rio, Viva Villa , Bordertown (1935</span>), and <span style="font-style:italic;">Juarez </span>. These artists and exhibitions merged high and low culture, fine and folk art, pre-Columbian, colonial, and contemporary artifacts into a unified visual language of brightly colored images and objects as a means of signifying "Mexico." Through hand-woven serapes, elaborately ornate silver platters and jewelry, brightly painted handcrafted furniture, masks, and retablos, and paintings and photographs of beautiful and exotic natives, lush plant life, active volcanoes and prehistoric ruins, they created a recognizable Mexican iconography in the national and international imagination. Rather than go through a laundry list of events, artists, and visual tropes that constituted the Mexican craze, however, I want to look at the transnational marketplace of goods and ideas—the modernist network—that brought Eisenstein, Spratling, and Siqueiros to Taxco in 1931. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

<p>How did a radical modern painter like Siqueiros, the avant-garde Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein, and William Spratling, known as the "Silver Gringo," end up posing for this photo in the small silver mining town of Taxco? Located in the hills between Acapulco and Mexico City in the state of Guerrero, Taxco was a three-day burro ride from Mexico City until 1930 when the Mexican government built a highway connecting the town to the capital as part of a campaign to physically unify the nation and to allow for increased international tourism in the area. Taxco is one of the oldest mining  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> sites in the Americas. When Hernan Cortez conquered the Aztecs in 1521, he lay stake to the mines and by the end of the century, Taxco was Spain's primary source for silver. During the 19<sup>th</sup>-century War for Independence, however, many Spanish barons destroyed their mines rather than lose them to "revolutionaries." Silver production in Taxco went into decline for over one hundred years. In 1931 William Spratling brokered a mural by Diego Rivera for his friend Dwight Morrow, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico. He used the money he received as a commission to open a silver workshop. Spratling almost single-handedly resuscitated the silver industry in Taxco by teaching the local inhabitants how to produce silver jewelry and decorative objects the way their ancestors did. He imported a master teacher and incorporated pre-Columbian motifs into his work, which he sold in Taxco as well as in high-end U.S. department stores such as Neiman-Marcus, Bonwit Teller, and Saks Fifth Avenue. Yet Spratling's claims to vernacular tradition and native authenticity were mediated by his interest in modern technology—he did use contemporary machinery—and bore the marks of his background in modern architecture and design, particularly the Bauhaus.</p>
<p>Spratling was part of multiple modernist networks before he came to Mexico. Born in upstate New York in 1900, he moved to New Orleans to teach in the architecture program at Tulane after attending Auburn University. In New Orleans, Spratling lived in the French Quarter where he quickly became part of the bohemian circle that centered around the author Sherwood Anderson. According to his landlord Natalie Scott, he gave parties almost every night with "an easy efficiency that puts many hostesses to shame." He served absinthe, which he bought in great jugs from the widow of a bootlegger, and homemade gin, which he aerated in his attic. <sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> In 1925 William Faulkner moved to New Orleans and rented one of the rooms in Spratling's apartment. By Faulkner's own account they were "drinking and carousing partners" and Spratling shows up as a character in a number of Faulkner's early works: in particular <span style="font-style:italic;">Soldier's Pay</span> and the short story "Mosquitoes." The two men traveled together to Europe, where Spratling wrote articles on both classical and modern architecture for <span style="font-style:italic;">Scribner's</span> magazine, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Journal of the American Institute of Architects</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Architecture Record</span>, and many other architecture and travel publications. In 1926, back in New Orleans, they collaborated on the book <span style="font-style:italic;">Sherwood Anderson and Other Famous Creoles</span>.</p>
<p>In 1926 Spratling visited Mexico for the first time. He returned for summers over the next several years, and in 1929, following "an unfortunate incident" with a male undergraduate at Tulane, which may or may not have led to a nervous breakdown, he moved to Mexico permanently.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> Settling first in Mexico City, he worked as a correspondent for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Herald Tribune</span> writing a regular "Letter from Mexico" describing the City's colorful artistic scene for the paper's monthly book review. He was quickly introduced to and became a welcome participant in the artistic circles of Mexico. He became friends with Diego Rivera and his wife Frida Kahlo; the illustrator Miguel Covarrubias; as well as with the U.S. expatriates Francis Toor, the publisher with Diego Rivera of the bilingual journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Mexican Folkways;</span> Dwight Morrow, the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, and his wife, Elizabeth Cutler Morrow; and Frederick Davis, the proprietor of the Sonoma News Company, an emporium of things Mexican. <sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Late in 1929, Spratling moved to the hill town of Taxco. In his book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Little Mexico</span>, Spratling described Taxco as "a place where each house is shining and compact, a study in red and white and green … yet the whole has that same unity of growth which exists in plants. For this reason people like to refer to it as picturesque."<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Ambassador Morrow and his wife Elizabeth were regular guests of Spratling in Taxco. Morrow, a classmate of Calvin Coolidge's at Amherst College, was a successful banker at JP Morgan before he became the US Ambassador to Mexico in 1927. Although he initially questioned his appointment to Mexico, he soon embraced the country and its culture. In an act of what might be called cultural diplomacy, the Morrows filled their house in the suburb of Cuernavaca, which they called <span style="font-style:italic;">Casa Manana</span>, with Mexican art and furniture. Elizabeth Morrow recalled, "We furnished our little house entirely with Mexican things."<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> Spratling assisted them in this endeavor. As a further act of cultural diplomacy, Morrow wished to give something to the people of Cuernavaca. In 1931, Spratling negotiated a deal between the Morrows and Rivera to paint a mural in the Palacio de Cortés, now the Museo Regional de Historia de Cuauhnahuac (Historical Museum of Cuauhnahuac). Spratling was paid a hefty commission for brokering the deal and he used this money as a down payment for a house and silver workshop in Taxco.</p>
<p>According to Spratling's memoir, one day over breakfast, Morrow said to him, "What a pity, Bill, that of all the tons of silver sent back from Taxco to the old world over the centuries, that none of this ever stayed here nor was utilized to create an industry or an economy for Taxco." <sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> Subsequently, Spratling hired an experienced goldsmith from Iguala who moved to Taxco and began creating silver jewelry of Spratling's design. Other craftsmen joined Spratling's shop and began producing tin ware, copper items, textiles, and furniture - all designed by Spratling. These earliest designs were based on pre-Columbian motifs as well as simple themes: rope borders, strap designs and other basic forms. Much of Spratling's early work was influenced by Mexican pottery. He wrote: "The work of these Mexican potters not only satisfies rudimentary human needs; in its expression of the impulse to form beautiful things with the hands it also satisfies an ancient tradition of craftsmanship.… The interesting thing is that it remains with them as a living and fecund art."<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup></p>
<p>The idea that Mexicans had an innate ability to produce beautiful things was widespread at this time. For example, U.S. novelist Susan Smith wrote in her 1930 best-selling book, <span style="font-style:italic;">Made in Mexico</span>, that, "in Mexico art isn't something that is kept in museums and spoken of only by critics. It is part of everyday life … Mexicans make beautiful things as a matter of course. They don't know how to make anything ugly."<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> Spratling shared this romanticized attitude toward his Mexican workers. In a 1934 interview with the New Orleans <span style="font-style:italic;">Times Picayune</span>, he explained his endeavor:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>We can teach [the Indians] nothing in the way of handicraft or artistry. The only thing I have done is to capitalize this gift.… Instead of leaving all this precious metal and graceful workmanship to lie around loose, I persuade them to come into a shop. At least you might call it a shop. It is really just my house. And when I suggested to them that they might work eight hours a day and I would pay them from two to four pesos for their labor they seized on the idea with enthusiasm. Indians aren't so different from the rest of us. The idea of a steady salary looks good to them too.<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></blockquote>
<p>Late in 1931, the Mexican government built a highway between Mexico City and Taxco and the town became a major tourist destination—particularly for wealthy Mexicans and expatriates and tourists from Europe and the United States. Spratling's workshop and gallery became a regular stop on the tour. Other artisans soon set up shop in Taxco as well. For example, Elizabeth Anderson, the former wife of Sherwood Anderson, and a close friend of Spratling—she lived in an apartment in his house—began teaching the women of Taxco to embroider in their "native fashion." Her designs were quite successful and sold in the United States at places like Bloomingdale's. Spratling's pieces also sold in stores and catalogs across the United States as well as in Mexico. To both Mexicans and tourists, he affectionately became known as "the Silver Gringo." Years later, Rene d' Harnoncourt, who became the Director of MoMA and General Manager of the Indian Arts and Crafts Board, said of Spratling: "I know of no other person who has so deeply influenced the artistic orientation of a country that is not his own. Not only did Mr. Spratling's establishment of a studio-workshop in Taxco cause a true renaissance of Mexican traditional folk art in modern context, but his activities on behalf of the arts of Mexico, modern and ancient, created a climate of understanding which contributed greatly to their appreciation and acceptance."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup></p>
<p>The irony of the "Silver Gringo" almost single-handedly reinvigorating the silver industry in Mexico is striking and points to a complex form of transnational modernism, one like a network that goes beyond nationality and citizenship. Spratling's silver designs became emblems of Mexican nationalism both inside and outside of Mexico. Frida Kahlo and other well-known proponents of <span style="font-style:italic;">mexicanidad</span> regularly wore his pieces as emblems of national pride. And while he certainly employed pre-Columbian motifs, many of them were inspired by chinaware brought to Mexico by Spanish colonial settlers. Moreover, Spratling repeatedly integrated current fashions and modernist forms into his work. His work directly evokes the work of European jewelry makers such as George Jensen in its rounded lines and simple embellishments. Spratling was very interested in Bauhaus architecture and you can clearly see this in many of the goods he manufactured throughout the 1930s and 1940s. In a set of his cigarette boxes, for example, you can see the application of pre-Columbian motifs on stylized, modernistinspired consumer products. Moreover, a number of his trays and cocktail shakers are decidedly more Art Deco in their inspiration than pre-Columbian.</p>
<p>Spratling was an active participant in multiple artistic circles. He was friends with Faulkner and Anderson, Siqueiros and Rivera. The international artistic networks in which he moved are crucial for understanding the importance of the international marketplace in the creation of vernacular modernism. These networks and their circulation of goods and ideas did not move in one direction; rather, there was a regular back and forth across national borders, artistic mediums, and political ideologies—as we shall see in the case of both Eisenstein and Siqueiros, who were also part of this Mexican modernist network.</p>
<p>Eisenstein was part of an imagined Mexican network before he ever stepped foot in the country. Long before he came to Mexico, he imagined the country as a brightlycolored abstract tableau punctuated with serapes, saguaro, and sombreros. According  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to Inga Karetnikova, "in the life of Sergei Eisenstein, there was not one, but three Mexicos," the imaginary, the real, and the Mexico of memory.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> Indeed, Eisenstein's first theatrical project as a student at the Petrograd Institute of Civil Engineering was to design the sets and costumes for a play based on Jack London's short story, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Mexican</span>. His set consisted of a spare modernist backdrop dotted with bright patches of color and scattered sombreros to signify "Mexico." But the biggest influence on Eisenstein's imagined Mexico were the epic murals of Diego Rivera, which told the history of Mexican conquest and revolution in visual form. Combining monumental revolutionary vignettes and quotidian practices, Rivera's paintings present Mexican history as a montage of overlapping events, individuals, and symbolic episodes. Eisenstein first met the Mexican muralist in 1927 when Rivera was visiting the Soviet Union to celebrate the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Russian revolution. Rivera gave Eisenstein a book of reproductions of his monumental murals and according to Eisenstein, "the seed of interest in the country … nourished by the stories of Diego Rivera, when he visited the Soviet Union … grew in a burning desire to travel there …" <sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> Despite this burning desire, however, Eisenstein did not go to Mexico until three years later.</p>
<p>In 1928, following the completion of <span style="font-style:italic;">October</span>, Eisenstein left the Soviet Union and travelled and lectured throughout Europe. In 1930 he moved to the United States after Jesse Lasky, on behalf of Paramount Pictures, offered him a short-term contract for $100,000. He arrived in Hollywood in May 1930. Writing in the British journal, <span style="font-style:italic;">Close Up</span>, Clifford Howard asked, "What will Eisenstein do to Hollywood? Or, what will Hollywood do to Eisenstein? That the two should be brought into an attempted confraternity is a circumstance of uncommon moment. An irresistible force meeting an immovable body."<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> Although Eisenstein was scornful of much Hollywood cinema, he considered the studios to be in the forefront of technological innovation and thought he could employ these innovations—particularly in color and sound—in his own works. In an article in the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> announcing his arrival in the United States, he explained that while he considered the "all talkie" films to be "rotten trash … "</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Technique does not stand still. We must be on the job all the time and test every new technical method as to its practibility.… Our new ideology makes us have something to say to the world. And a person with something to say looks for the means to express his thoughts in the most impressive manner. Anything that can be used with the film is welcomed by me, whether it be color or sound. Only a new ideology produces new forms, because it makes you think and forces you to experiment. All the rest is mere 'play.'<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">And in an interview in <span style="font-style:italic;">Close Up</span>, he explained, "the future belongs, in my opinion … to the sound film—that is to say, the film in which sound is not used naturalistically … as indicated by the excellent Mickey Mouse films. In these for example, a graceful movement of the foot is accompanied by appropriate music, which is, as it were the audible expression of the mechanical action …" He concluded that, "What the sound film requires is a man with the vision, initiative and courage of Henry Ford." <sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> While Henry Ford and Walt Disney seem like strange heroes for the maker of <span style="font-style:italic;">Battleship Potemkin</span>, they are all part of the modernist network I'm discussing. With their emphasis  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> on technological innovation and new forms of technology and communication in the service of various—and often competing—political and aesthetic agendas, Eisenstein, Ford, and Disney all consciously embraced new forms of media to become subjects as well as objects of modernization, to enter and become a part of this modernist network.</p>
<p>Despite his enthusiasm for the possibility to experiment with new filmic technologies, Eisenstein's collaboration with Paramount ultimately failed. Regarding Eisenstein's adaptation of Theodore Drieser's <span style="font-style:italic;">American Tragedy</span>, David O. Selznick wrote to Bud Schulberg, "It was for me a memorable experience; the most moving script I have ever read. It was so effective, it was positively torturing. When I had finished reading it, I was so depressed that I wanted to reach for the bourbon bottle. As entertainment, I don't think it has one chance in a hundred."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> Eisenstein's time in Hollywood was not completely futile, however. While in Los Angeles he worked on a series of theoretical treatises exploring what he saw as the dynamic relationship between the film and the screen. In a speech before the Technicians Branch of the Academy of Motion Pictures of Arts and Sciences, he announced that "the arrival of the wide screen with its opportunities for a new screen shape throws us once more headlong into questions of purely spatial composition. And much more—it affords us the possibility of reviewing and reanalyzing the whole aesthetic of pictorial composition in the cinema …" Extolling</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>the possibilities of <span style="font-style:italic;">vertical, upright composition …</span> using the opportunity afforded by the advent of wide film to break that loathsome upper party of the frame … which has bent us and obliged us to a passive horizontalism … it is my purpose to defend the cause of the 50 per cent of compositional possibilities exiled from the light of the screen. It is my desire to intone the myth of the male, the strong, the virile, active, <span style="font-style:italic;">vertical</span> composition …</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Ultimately, Eisenstein was interested in creating "a "<span style="font-style:italic;">dynamic square screen</span>, that is to say one providing in its dimensions the opportunity of impressing, in projection, with absolute grandeur every geometrically conceivable form of the picture limit.…"<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> He was optimistic that given his knowledge of new technological innovations, he could employ this vertical screen approach in his next project, a multi-layered exploration of Mexican history.</p>
<p>Rather than return to the Soviet Union when his Paramount collaboration ended, on the advice of his friend Charlie Chaplin, Eisenstein pitched his Mexican film idea to the socialist author and fellow traveler Upton Sinclair. Sinclair was enthusiastic about the project and between the end of October and Thanksgiving of that year he arranged the necessary permissions for the filmmaker and his crew to travel to Mexico to make a film to be produced by himself, his wife, Mary Craig Kimbrough Sinclair, and three other investors organized as the Mexican Film Trust. On November 24, Eisenstein signed a contract with the Trust which stated that the funding for the project would come from Mary Sinclair in "an amount not less than Twenty-Five Thousand dollars," that the picture be "non-political" but based upon "Eisenstein's desire to be free to direct the making of a picture according to his own ideas of what a Mexican picture should be, and in full faith in Eisenstein's artistic integrity." The agreed-upon shooting schedule was "a period of from three to four months" for a film that would be approximately  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> one hour long, and finally, that "Eisenstein furthermore agrees that all pictures made or directed by him in Mexico, all negative film and positive prints, and all story and ideas embodied in said Mexican picture, will be the property of Mrs. Sinclair.…" A coda to the contract, dated December 1, granted that the "Soviet Government may have the film free for showing inside the U.S.S.R."<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup></p>
<p>One hundred thousand dollars and fourteen months later, the Sinclairs withdrew funding and Stalin, fearing that Eisenstein was about to defect, recalled the filmmaker to the Soviet Union. Eisenstein never made his Mexican film; the rushes went to Los Angeles then to the Museum of Modern Art in New York (although footage from the film was used in a number of other productions).<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> In 1979 Eisenstein's long-time producer and collaborator, Grigory Alexander, put together a film based on Eisenstein's elaborate notes and script for the project.</p>
<p>For a proclaimed communist, Eisenstein's film seems preoccupied with the sumptuousness of material objects—in particular clothing and domestic accessories. The camera repeatedly lingers over young women getting dressed in traditional embroidered tops and skirts, working for gold coins for a dowry, or preparing for a festival; it zooms in on matadors dressing in their majestic ensembles (lush velvet vests, shiny brass buttons, luxurious silk sashes) and on the variety of hats thrown into the ring after the bullt; it catalogues the costumes and decorations of the annual fiestas of the day of the dead and the Virgin of Guadalupe. It registers in detail the earthenware bowls of old women grinding corn, the spurs of a hacienda owner, the jugs of the pulque workers. This is a materialist vision of Mexican history—a history told in images from a number of sources—a montage, a layering of goods and ideas. According to Eisenstein, the film was to be divided into five chapters with a prologue and an epilogue.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> Describing the film to Sinclair, he explained that he conceived of the film as a Mexican serape: "a serape is the striped blanket that every Mexican wears. So striped and violently contrasting are the cultures in Mexico running next to each other and at the same time being centuries away … we took the contrasting adjacency of its violent colors as the motif for constructing our film."<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup></p>
<p>The serape is a key object in the visual iconography of Mexico. Although the Spanish introduced the technology in the mid 1500, serapes and other hand-woven Mexican textiles have become discernable emblems of Mexican national identity. For example, Diego Rivera repeatedly employed serapes as a motif in his abstract paintings from the early twentieth century to concretely signal Mexico. His <span style="font-style:italic;">Zapatista Landscape</span>  painted while he lived a bohemian expatriate life in Montmartre, is a cubist assemblage of Mexican signifiers: a rifle, a sombrero, the grand volcanoes of the Valley of Mexico (Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl), and the ubiquitous serape. Similarly he incorporates the serape into his portrait of his friend the journalist Luis Guzman, who travelled with Pancho Villa before being exiled to Spain. By picturing him in a matador's headdress with a serape draped over his shoulder like a cape, Rivera links Guzman directly to Mexico through overt visual cues. <sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> Given the relationship between Eisenstein and Rivera, it is not surprising that Eisenstein would choose this textile as the unifying motif behind his kaleidoscopic film. But it also exemplifies the imagined network of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> modernist icons such as masks, ruins, textiles, sombreros, cacti, skulls, and volcanoes that came to represent Mexico during this period. For many North American and European artists and intellectuals, Mexico was a site for non-industrial inspiration as embodied in these folk objects. For example, the popular American economist Stuart Chase wrote that "it is impossible for Mexicans to produce the humblest thing without form and design. A donkey wears a load of palm leaves arranged on either flank in green sunbursts. Merchants hang candles by their wicks to make patterns in both line and color.… To the traveler from the North, used to the treatment of cold dead produce as cold dead produce, this is a matter of perpetual wonder and delight."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> Similarly, Katherine Anne Porter gushed that "It would be difficult to explain in a very few words how the Mexicans have enriched their national life through the medium of their native arts. It is in everything they do and are … the passion for individual expression without hypocrisy, which is the true genius of the race."<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup></p>
<p>Mexico was also, however, a site for experimentation, a place to test new forms of media and technology. Like Spratling in his jewelry workshop, the photographers Edward Weston, Paul Strand, and Tina Modotti, played with both modernist conventions and new technologies in the images they produced while in Mexico. Like Eisenstein and <span style="font-style:italic;">Los Tres Grandes</span>, their works often focused on distinctly Mexican things in abstract compositions. Paul Strand's <span style="font-style:italic;">Woman</span> – <span style="font-style:italic;">Patzcuaro</span> (1930s) from his <span style="font-style:italic;">Mexican Portfolio</span>, for example, features a native woman wrapped in a large woven scarf holding a straw basket [<a name="3-text" href="#3"><span style="font-weight:bold;">re 3</span></a>] and in <span style="font-style:italic;">Portrait of Two Men, Mexico</span>, also from the Mexican Portfolio, the epynonymous men peer out from a doorway. Dressed all in white, they both wear traditional leather belts and one wears a distinctive sombrero to mark them as Mexican. The scarf, the basket, the belts, and the sombrero are all part of the vernacular network of Mexican objects yet Strand employs them in a distinctly modernist idiom. Similarly, Tina Modotti's revolutionary still lifes <span style="font-style:italic;">Images for a Mexican Song </span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Bandolier with Hammer and Sickle</span> both reference a modernist vocabulary of distinctly Mexican objects. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Images for a Mexican Song</span> a dried ear of corn, a string of bullets, and the base of a guitar intersect in a bifurcated triad. Through their cropped juxtapositioning the strings of the guitar, the bullets in the belt, and the kernels in the corn create a series of almost abstract repeating patterns; yet they never lose the specificity of their Mexican referents. Similarly in <span style="font-style:italic;">Bandolier with Hammer and Sickle</span>, the c-curve of a well-used sickle artfully embraces a bullet-filled bandolier and an ear of corn. In both images the objects flirt with becoming abstract shapes floating in space while they maintain their specific historical context within Mexican revolutionary history. While the subject matter of these images is distinctly Mexican, both Strand and Modotti intentionally experimented with cropping their picture planes to defy conventional spatial relations; in so doing they created modernist vernacular still lifes and portraits that bridge the local and the universal in both form and content. The Mexican works of Edward Weston further exploit this tension between the universal and the local by reducing key Mexican visual tropes—pre-Columbian ruins, Maguey cacti, earthenware pottery—to abstract compositions. Eisenstein employed a similar visual vocabulary in <span style="font-style:italic;">Que Viva Mexico</span>. The film is filled with epic landscapes, local vignettes, and the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> syncretism of pre-Columbian and Catholic ritual and pageantry. It is like a mural in animated form.</p>

<p>Indeed, much of <span style="font-style:italic;">Que Viva Mexico</span> is influenced by the work of the Mexican muralists. Like Rivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros, whose work he assiduously studied, Eisenstein was a key part of the modernist Mexican network. Through his film he intentionally aimed to create a dynamic, horizontal narrative to be projected on the walls.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> This resonated closely with his idea of the dynamic screen that he was developing while in Hollywood. Indeed, while in Taxco, Eisenstein was revising his lecture to the Academy of Motion Picture Technicians into an essay entitled "The Dynamic Square" for the British journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Close Up</span> in which he spoke of "approximating the cinema to the stage," and called for the creation of a "monster screen—four times the usual size." Eisenstein began directly experimenting with these techniques in <span style="font-style:italic;">Que Viva Mexico</span> and credited the muralists directly with the conceptualization of his new dynamic style. According to Olivier Debroise, "While unable to cut the film's frames as in a photomontage, Eisenstein made an important contribution by inventing vertical editing within a single  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> plane, based on Rivera and Siqueiros' propositions." The murals also had an effect on how he conceived of the narrative and the style of the film. According to Eisenstein, one of the things he liked about murals was that they forced the spectator to physically move through space (and time). With cinema, the film moved and the viewer sat still, with the monumental public murals, the viewer moved.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup></p>
<p>Like the muralists and other modernists at work in Mexico at the time, Eisenstein self-consciously incorporated pre-Columbian motifs, Mexican folk music, and multiple, overlapping story lines into his work. He made direct reference to the influence of muralists throughout the film and planned to dedicate the third chapter of the film, which dealt with the Maguey cactus and the pulque workers to Rivera. <sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> Although he never met Orozco, Eisenstein considered him the Dionysus to Rivera's Apollo and planned to dedicate the final chapter of film to him. But while in Mexico he was perhaps most influenced by Siqueiros, with whom he discussed his dynamic square theory while staying in Taxco and to whom he dedicated the prologue of the film which featured the burial of a young man according to pre-Columbian rituals—a sequence he credited to Siqueiros' <span style="font-style:italic;">Burial of the Martyred Worker</span> for the National Preparatory School which depicted the body of a worker in a casket covered with a hammer and sickle.</p>
<p>Like a network, this energy and inspiration simultaneously flowed both ways. Siqueiros was also influenced by Eisenstein on both a personal and artistic level. In his murals from the 1930s he repeatedly experimented with adapting Eisenstein's frame editing theories to large-scale mural painting and he dedicated his essay on the "Vehicles of Dialectic, Subversive Painting" with "admiration to Sergei Mikhailovitch Eisenstein." Although he was confined to easel painting while exiled in Taxco, Siqueiros was still profoundly interested in the composition and form that murals could take. <sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> When he was forced to leave Mexico a year later for further "subversive" activities, he traveled to Los Angeles where he resumed his mural practice and painted three works: <span style="font-style:italic;">Mitin Obrero</span> ("Workers' Meeting") at the Chouinard School of Art, <span style="font-style:italic;">América Tropical</span> at the Plaza Art Center, and <span style="font-style:italic;">Retrato Actual de México</span> ("Current Portrait of Mexico") in a private residence at Santa Monica, now in the Santa Barbara Museum of Art.</p>
<p>Like Eisenstein, Siqueiros was warmly received in the United States.<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> In Los Angeles he socialized with Hollywood luminaries such as Katharine Hepburn, Charles Laughton, and Marlene Dietrich and was invited to speak at a variety of political and cultural events. He did not, however, tone down his politics. In a 1932 lecture entitled "Rectification About the Plastic Arts in Mexico," he argued that artists could not remain indifferent "to the struggle which will liberate humanity and art," but should "collaborate aesthetically and individually with the class historically predestined to change anew our present society."<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> And in a talk before the Los Angeles John Reed Club (the cultural arm of the Communist Party USA) on the topic of "The Vehicles of Dialectic –Subversive Painting," he announced the arrival of</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>a revolutionary aesthetic … the plastic form of the final proletarian struggle against the capitalistic state; a form that will have nothing in common with the dry forms of the past, nor with the eccentric 'snob' forms of the present. This form will be neither academic  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> nor modernist; it shall be dialectic and subversive, that is to say, logically materialistic, objective, dynamic. <sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Like Eisenstein, Siqueiros was interested taking advantage of the technological possibilities afforded him in the United States, in this case these were industrial materials such as poured cement and building machinery like air guns and compressors. Siqueiros profoundly believed that cement murals had the potential to be a distinctly new media. Unlike the "dry" fresco forms of the past, he aimed to create a performative and dynamic new type of mural painting that would be collective as well as individual, local as well as global in its reach.</p>
<p>Siqueiros described his new technique and its ideological implications in detail in his treatise on "The Vehicles of Dialectic, Subversive Painting" which began with the announcement that "the traditional fresco … is socially dead—the modern fresco, technically adapted to modern conditions, is the only one that has possibilities for development." In manifesto-like language he called for the radical transformation of modern painting using new tools and materials:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>The instruments of music have been revolutionized periodically throughout the history of the world. The elements and instruments of architectural production have likewise undergone radical transformation throughout the ages. On the other hand, the elements and instruments of pictorial production have not been modified in the least. The modern painter who is not commercial or an industrial producer is still using elements and instruments of hundred years ago … The Block of Mural Painters is using to great advantage the modern elements and instruments that science and mechanics give to the men of today.… To the anachronistic elements corresponds an anachronistic aesthetic. An integrally modern and revolutionary plastic aesthetic can only be produced with corresponding instruments.</p></blockquote>
<p>Siqueiros intended to demonstrate these dialectical-subversive practices in his first LA mural, <span style="font-style:italic;">Workers' Meeting</span>, for the Chouinard School of Art, where he had been hired to teach fresco painting.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> His workshop-style classes allowed him to experiment with both his aesthetic ideology and technique, which he saw as organically linked. He explained, "It was the practice of painting, the logic of uninterrupted exercise that made theory possible for me. Theory is discovered in that which is being done and in a certain way the theory anticipates that which the later comes organically."<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> According to his partner at the time, Blanca Luz, who regularly sent dispatches on the progress of the mural back to the Mexico City newspaper <span style="font-style:italic;">El Universal</span>, "In two weeks, with three spray guns and twenty North American painters David Alfaro Siqueiros finished the fresco art at the Chouinard School of Art." Through her articles for the paper, Luz chronicled the evolution of Siqueiros' style and the radical new potential it embodied for the industrial age for an international audience. One of the key points Luz highlighted was Siqueiros' desire to move beyond the idea of a "Mexican" national style in his art and become part of a distinctly modernist network. Although, like Eisenstein, Siqueiros was repulsed by the blatant capitalism of the United States, he was also impressed by  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> its machinations and was dependent on material objects, such as airguns and compressors to communicate with his audience across national boundaries. According to Luz, Siqueiros felt "the Mexican fresco" was "unsuitable" in the United States because:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>it is slow, because it is mystical and because in a vertiginous and violent city of capitalism it is archaic. Where skyscrapers are raised in twenty-four hours it is not possible to install the romantic fresco that takes three, four, and ten years to paint.… The new elements … had opened up a new world, an unsuspected aesthetic: trim, solid, electric, definite, concrete. It was the aesthetic of this epoch, it is the aesthetic of the developing new society.<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>While <span style="font-style:italic;">Workers' Meeting</span> employed the tools of the United States' capitalist infrastructure in its creation, it strongly critiqued the country in its content. According to Siqueiros, its "object was to combat the anti-democratic politics of racial discrimination in the south of the United States."<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> Today images of <span style="font-style:italic;">Workers' Meeting</span> are difficult to find since the mural was destroyed shortly after it was created, but Grace Clemente, speaking to the LA John Reed Club, described it thus:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>two rows of workers, from the roof and scaffold of a building look down with intentness upon a gesticulating street speaker. The Negro on his right and the women on his left, each carrying a child, as well as the workers above, indicate by their earnest attention that the speaker's message is of great importance. The speaker is recognizable as a communist by his red shirt. Though we are agreed that in reality communists do not wear such marks of identification which would inevitably sponsor police brutality, they must be considered permissible in plastic when symbols must be used.</p></blockquote>
<p>The choice of the red shirt to designate the worker as a communist serves as a form of visual shorthand much like those employed by Eisenstein, Rivera, Weston and other artists at the time. Although Clement acknowledges that in reality the worker most likely would have avoided red to prevent notice and perhaps evade police brutality, Siqueiros intentionally played into popular media representations that linked the color red to communist agitation. He deliberately chose to cite a recognizable network of objects, easily identified symbols, and militant tropes such as the red shirt, the black worker, and the mother and child, to visually communicate his politics and forecast his hopes for a racially integrated, idealized future.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">Workers' Meeting</span> Siqueiros began to experiment directly with the techniques he had discussed with Eisenstein in Mexico and developed in his treatise on dialectical subversive painting. Like Eisenstein, he was interested in the dynamic potential of two-dimensional spaces. He literally wanted his works to extend beyond the picture plane into everyday life. Central to this was his embrace of new technologies. He explained, "After making the first sketch we used the camera and the motion picture to aid us in elaboration of our first drawing.… In the preparation of our walls we adopted the pneumatic drill to roughen the wall surface and give greater adhesion to the finished coating of plaster, which was applied with an air gun. The airbrush we considered an essential instrument in the plastic production of our decoration." <sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> Today Siqueiros's  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> enthusiasm for the airbrush and the pneumatic drill as revolutionary tools may seem funny to us, but he sincerely believed that modern industrial equipment would quickly and efficiently make true fresco painting possible and that true fresco painting could be a revolutionary form. Like Eisenstein and Spratling, he embraced new technologies and vernacular traditions in his art practices to bridge the local and the universal to create a complex form of global modernism.</p>
<p>By focusing on the intersection of local and universal forms of modernism as they intersect in the lives of Spratling, Siqueiros, and Eisenstein we can clearly see the existence of a modernist network—one that crosses national borders, artistic mediums, and political ideologies. All three men embraced new technologies to create a visual language of real and imagined Mexican tropes. Spratling and his native workers used contemporary machinery to produce "authentic" pre-Columbian pieces for a primarily expatriate market; Eisenstein employed Hollywood techniques and equipment in his filmic quest for dynamism, and Siqueiros championed the use of the spray gun, the pneumonic drill and poured concrete as new revolutionary media that would help usher in a true proletariat public art form. All three men also used material goods to signify meaning in their works; through serapes, silver bracelets, red shirts, and woven baskets they employed a vocabulary of things to signify "Mexico" to an international audience. From Moscow to Hollywood, from New Orleans to Mexico City, they constituted a modernist network of images, ideas, and artifacts that both questioned and made sense of the modern world. By looking at how they juxtaposed the vernacular with the cosmopolitan, the sombrero with the beret, we can gain a better sense of the real and imagined networks that sustained the political, aesthetic, ideological and market forces that not only brought these three men to Taxco in 1931 but which frame our understandings of the history of global modernism.</p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f1" href="#f1-text">1. </a>A Key metaphor of modernity for Michel Foucault is that of the network. He writes, "We are in the epoch of simultaneity: we are in the epoch of juxtaposition, the epoch of the near and far, of the side-by-side, of the dispersed. We are at a moment, I believe, when our experience of the world is less that of a long life developing through time than that of a <span style="font-style:italic;">network</span> that connects points and intersects with its own skein. "Michel Foucault, "What is Enlightenment," ("Qu'est-ce que les Lumières ?"), in Rabinow (P.), éd., <span style="font-style:italic;">The Foucault Reader</span>, New York, Pantheon Books, 1984, pp. 32–50. Network is a useful metaphor for me as well. In its simplest definition, a network is a "complex, interconnected group or system," or "a chain of interconnected people or operations." In information technology, "a network is a series of points or nodes interconnected by communication paths." Networks can interconnect with other networks and contain sub-networks. <span style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.dom/network" target="_blank">www.thefreedictionary.dom/network</a></span>; <span style="font-style:italic;">Oxford American Dictionary</span> (NY: Avon Books, 1980) 598.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f3" href="#f3-text">3. </a>Modernism remains a slippery concept to define. On the one hand, Marshall Berman's 1988 conception of the term as "any attempt by modern men and women to become subjects as well as objects of modernization, to get a grip on the modern world and make themselves at home in it," remains the best definition. Marshal Berman, <span style="font-style:italic;">All that is Solid Melts into Air</span> (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1982) 5–6. But as Juan Suarez recently has argued, "postmodernism authorized the recasting of modernism as a cultural moment that foreshadowed contemporary interests—and therefore  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> purveyed a more usable past." In the past thirty years, the voices and practices of women, queers, and people of color have challenged the dominant formalist narratives of modernism which located production in a handful of metropolitan centers and applauded detached abstractions and flat picture frames. <span style="font-style:italic;">Pop Modernism: Noise and the Reinvention of the Everyday</span> (Champaign: University of Illinois Press, 2007), 2. Following Michel Foucault, I see modernity as "an attitude [rather] than as a period of history." By attitude Foucault specifies that he "mean[s] a mode of relating to contemporary reality; a voluntary choice made by certain people; in the end a way of thinking and feeling; a way, too, of acting and behaving that at one and the same time marks a relation of belonging and presents itself as a task. Michel Foucault, "What is Enlightenment," ("Qu'est-ce que les Lumières ?"), in Rabinow (P.), éd., <span style="font-style:italic;">The Foucault Reader</span>, New York, Pantheon Books, 1984, pp. 32–50.</p></div>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f28" href="#f28-text">28. </a>According to Eisenstein's notes, published in Karetnikova <span style="font-style:italic;">Mexico According to Eisenstein</span>, the film was to be organized as such:
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Prologue: Dedicated to Siqueiros' Burial of a Mexican Worker, this episode chronicles the funeral rituals of young man. Set amid pre-Colubinan ruins according to Eisenstein's notes, "Time is Eternity. It might be today. It might be twenty years ago … might be a thousand."</p>
<p>Chapter One: Conquest focuses on three Christ-like penitents as they make the stations of the cross. Focusing on the brutality of the Spanish Catholic conquest, it also highlights the syncretisim of Catholicism with indigenous rituals.</p>
<p>Chapter Two: Sandunga. Set in the province of Tehuantepec, this chapter chronicles the coming of age of a young girl named Concepcion, her courtship and marriage to young man named Abundio and her motherhood. Focusing on the relationships between matriarchal society and a love of nature, this is the most lighthearted and optimistic of the sequences.</p>
<p>Chapter Three: Fiesta follows a young matador as he prepares and then participates in a bullt.</p>
<p>Chapter Four: Maguey is set at a pulque-producing hacienda in the province of Hidalgo between fields of the Maguey cactus. Dedicated to Diego Rivera, this segment contains the brutal rape of a young woman and the torture and murder of her fiancé and his brothers.</p>
<p>Chapter Five. Soldadera. This episode was never shot but was inspired by the work José Clemente Orozco which focused on the participation of women in the Mexican Revolution.</p>
<p>Epilogue. The camera captures ecstatic imagery of the celebrations of the Day of the Death and the Calavera. Inspired by the popular prints of the folk artist Jose Guadalupe Posada, the ending is ambivalent.</p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">The emergence of the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span>
</h1>
<p>A month after nineteen men crashed four jet airliners into Manhattan's World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a clod-strewn field in Western Pennsylvania, and only hours after the U.S. military invaded Afghanistan, Al Jazeera television, the most-watched network in the Arab world, broadcast a video recording it had received through secret channels. On it, Osama bin Laden, charismatic leader of the international terrorist network Al Qaeda, condemned the invasion and praised the hijackers, glorifying them as "a blessed group of vanguard Muslims, the forefront of Islam."<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>As someone who had studied the art, history, and theory of the avant-garde for some time, my curiosity was piqued, but I was also deeply skeptical. U.S. news organizations were scrambling to find reliable translators, and cultural misunderstandings were obviously prevalent across U.S. culture. It was hard not to come to the conclusion that the transcript was a murky cocktail of sloppy translation and the uncritical, ahistorical sense of "vanguard" so common in scholarly literature, the popular press, and online marketing. Or, even if I were to presume that the translation was on target, what bin Laden was invoking was that "other" avant-garde, the military/political one of Bolsheviks and hinterland guerrillas, the kind of vanguard that we generally assume has little pertinence to the kinds of questions those in avant-garde studies generally ask. A curiosity, nothing more—a tidbit for the clippings file.</p>
<p>Or so I thought. I have learned since that "vanguard" is a perfectly suitable translation of the Arabic word <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> (sometimes  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> transliterated <span style="font-style:italic;">taliyaah</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">talihah</span>).<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> The term is used in the Arab world today with the same promiscuity as it is elsewhere and scholars study it with the same fervor. Further, as one perceptive reader of this essay noted, there is a common strain of prophetic theology and violent activism that binds East and West for centuries. Add to that the research I've been doing on the role of Saint-Simonian ideology in the colonization of Algeria and the persistent Orientalism that shaped the avant-garde into a cultural (as opposed to merely technocratic) tendency, and it's hard not to come to the conclusion that bin Laden's encomium is only the most recent artifact from a history of material, social, ideological, and cultural exchange that has intertwined vanguards across the U.S., Western Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Fair enough, but what benefits are there to bringing Islamist vanguards such as Al Qaeda into the scholarly fold? First, the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> suggests that the line drawn by most scholars between the "two avant-gardes," as Renato Poggioli puts it,<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> between the artistic and the military/political, is hampering our ability to comprehend the history of the avant-garde more generally. While some scholars enthusiastically embrace a concept of the avant-garde that brings together the military, culinary, religious, and other traditions of cultural resistance and revolt, that number is still surprisingly low. However, as Richard Schechner writes in a recent <span style="font-style:italic;">PMLA</span> article, "Aestheticizing and ritualizing violence, not as representations (as in the visual arts, theater, or other media), but as actual acts performed in the here and now, are widespread."<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> He further notes that "the West and the jihadists occupy very separate spheres from the point of view of values while sharing the same global system from the point of view of techniques."<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> Indeed, the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> reminds us that the distinctions among these varied spheres are always culturally and historically specific.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> presses us to develop a more encompassing definition of the avant-garde, one that subsumes art and aesthetic dissidence under a broader rubric of <span style="font-style:italic;">culture</span>. While many scholars of the avant-garde have moved into a full-on cultural studies mode (Raymond Williams, Barrett Watten, and Richard Schechner coming most quickly to mind<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup>), the field as a whole still privileges aesthetic analysis over historical and ideological analysis, if only by dint of its unwavering, unquestioning commitment to the arts. A broader concept of cultural activism does not mean the end of arts-based analysis, but it does enable us not only to consider a wider range of actions and positions, but, in doing so, adds needed nuance to our understanding of aesthetic politics. Pace Schechner, we should not let values block critical analysis.</p>
<p>Finally, the tale of the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> affirms James Harding's assertion that the avant-garde is not an essentially "European" tendency, but a "fundamentally global cultural phenomenon" that has emerged in diverse forms and places . The <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> is an exemplary "rough edge," to recall Harding's metaphor, evidence that the avant-garde is a mutable, site-specific product of negotiation, struggle, and mutual transformation rather than a monolithic, linear tendency within European modernity. It is across such rough edges that the most astonishing effects of bringing the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> into the story of the avant-garde come into view. Andrea Flores Khalil, one of the few critics who has studied the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> (at least one part of it), suggests exactly how confusing things can get. The <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span>, she writes, possesses "a strange, circular, temporal effect …, always returning and moving  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> ahead at the same time."<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> Richard Schechner considers this one of the more interesting tendencies in avant-garde art over the last few decades, asserting that</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>there is no area, be it Micronesia, the Pacific Rim, West Africa, the Circumpolar Region, or wherever, which does not have artists actively trying to use, appropriate, reconcile, come to terms with, exploit, understand—the words and political tone vary, but the substance doesn't—the relationships between local cultures in their extreme, particular historical development and the increasingly complex and multiple contacts and interactions not only among various cultures locally and regionally, but on a global and interspecific scale.<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">While not all artists and movements who do this are avant-garde, it is certainly true of the avant-garde that Khalil writes about and the one I'll explore in the following pages. Very much in the vein of Schechner's "tradition-seeking avant-garde," the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> paradoxically <span style="font-style:italic;">follows and precedes</span> European modernity, and doing so within a sociocultural "rough edge," it is both an influence on and a creature of European modernity. The <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span>, a rough-edge, tradition-seeking avant-garde, is further evidence that it is time for scholars to abandon conventional, linear history and embrace instead a genealogical approach <span style="font-style:italic;">à la</span> Foucault, one in which the avant-garde is not a substantive, unitary agent that follows a linear, developmental story, but is, instead, deployed as a critical concept, a marker that identifies and links situated domains of knowledge whose relationship to each other is motile and mercurial.<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Fortunately, Khalil is not entirely alone in recognizing the importance of the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span>. The relationship between Surrealism and the Arab world, especially the French Surrealist group's public support for the Rif rebellion in Morocco, has been the subject of fairly extensive scholarship.<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> The impact of the Arab world on the Black Arts Movement has been mapped by Melani McAlister. Of particular importance, she shows how the Nation of Islam, changed feelings about Israel sparked by the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, and Pan-Arab nationalism were touchstones for Black Arts Movement vanguardists Amiri Baraka, Ishmael Reed, Sonia Sanchez, Larry Neal, and others.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Paul Berman's 2003 article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The New York Times Magazine</span> on Egyptian theologian Sayyid Qutb first alerted me to the widespread presence of vanguard models within radical Islam.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> Historians Gilles Kepel and Adnan Musallam provide a textured sense of the avant-garde as both rhetorical trope and socio-political strategy for Islamic vanguards.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> In an essay on avant-garde drama in the Middle East, Marvin Carlson inveighs against "two widespread and erroneous assumptions"; one, that the Middle East lacks a strong tradition of drama and, two, that European drama is the predominant influence on modern Middle Eastern playwrights and theater artists. Carlson cites Peter J. Chelkowski's work on Iranian performance, which shows that avant-garde drama in the Middle East is most prominent in popular forms such as religious celebrations, dramatic narratives, and festival processions. For Chelkowski, what is avant-garde about these things is, in Carlson's words, "its mixing of materials from history, legend, popular culture, and everyday life; its casual use of found material and space; its frank acknowledge of the apparatus of production; and its breaking down of the barrier between performance and audience."<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>But Khalil's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Arab Avant-Garde: Experiments in North African Art and Literature</span> stands apart in its understanding of the historiographical implications of the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span>. Investigating experimental literature in North Africa, mostly written in French, Khalil positions it within "the recent and still partial emergence of minority literatures and marginalized voices into an international, global discourse," especially as it relates to the "tensions between local and global, traditional and modern, authentic and general …"<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> In line with Schechner, she shows poets such as Abdelwahab Meddeb evincing a "desire to draw new relations between their past and their future." Meddeb's writings demonstrate the ways a "minor literature" can upset local conrations of cultural authority without abiding strictly within the contours of European modernism.</p>
<p>This is why chronology gets so tangled; to understand the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> (not a term Khalil uses), we must approach it "through a multiple genealogy and not just … a singular origin."<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> Meddeb understood "cultural modernity" as a "cyclical recommencing: French being inhabited by its colonial relationship with the Maghreb, and Arabic likewise speaking through the vocabularies of European thinkers."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> The implications of this are profound. "This decentering on a worldwide scale," Khalil concludes, "produces a critical transformation, one disturbing the Western canon, the other dismantling the value systems of traditional cultures from which writers and artists originated and have dispersed."<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> Both sides are changed; they are mutual influences.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Al Qaeda, Sayyid Qutb, and the "first" avant-garde</h1>
<p>To recall, when I read Osama bin Laden praising the 9/11 hijackers as "a blessed group of vanguard Muslims, the forefront of Islam," I was both dubious and curious. Post-9/11 paranoia, the revelation of sleeper cells in London and Madrid, the insurgencies in Afghanistan and Iraq, the maneuverings of Hamas in Israel/Palestine, the camps of Peshawar—these pushed me to find out more. But there was another reason for doing research on Al Qaeda and Islamic militancy more generally. I'd been thinking about whether avant-garde theory could be applied to non-art subjects such as the U.S. Christian evangelical movement or counterinsurgency operations. That effort was proving fruitful, but there was a limit to it in that none of the groups and movements I was studying explicitly claimed the title "avant-garde." They were, as Matei Calinescu would put it, "unconscious avant-gardes."<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup></p>
<p>This is definitely not the case with radical Islamism. Many Islamist organizations and intellectuals take the vanguard title consciously, and many of those have a fully developed theory of cultural power and social organization, two pillars of any avant-garde theory. The Egyptian Hassan al Banna, for one, modeled the Muslim Brotherhood after the Russian Bolsheviks and the fascist Phalangists of Spain. That said, Brotherhood chapters are typically reformist, grassroots organizations rather than vanguard parties. It is true that in Egypt a hardcore underground organization was formed in the 1960s when the party found itself under intense repression by the Nasser regime, and accusations of terrorist support and sympathy continue to follow chapters across the Islamic world. Regardless, one would be on slippery ground to call the Brotherhood an "avant-garde."<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>A fuller and more mature conception of the Islamic avant-garde is evident in the writings of Maulana Sayyid Abdul Ala Maududi of Pakistan, founder of <span style="font-style:italic;">Jamaat-e-Islami</span>. For him, vanguardism was both an organizational and ethical model for breaking with a corrupt society. It also perfectly fit the contours of Islamic history. Maududi's vision of the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> was modeled on the <span style="font-style:italic;">hijra</span>, the exile and insurgency of Mohammad and his followers. Gilles Kepel notes that, in a number of texts written in the 1930s and 40s, "Maududi made explicit references to the 'vanguard' of the earliest Muslims, who gathered around the Prophet in 622 during the <span style="font-style:italic;">hijra</span>, broke with the idolatrous people of Mecca, and departed to found the Islamic state of Medina. His own party was intended to follow a similar course."<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> Maududi was not the first to do this; Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (1838–97) and Mohammad 'Abduh (1849–1905) also did so. However, those two viewed it as an example rather than an organizational or strategic model, as Maududi did. However, as close as Maududi came to considering the <span style="font-style:italic;">hijra</span> an indigenous model of vanguard activism, he ultimately proved unfaithful to the concept. Though he called for a break with <span style="font-style:italic;">jahiliyya</span> society (a term I'll discuss in more detail shortly), he never broke with the political establishment in Pakistan and never advocated violence. Keppel writes, "Maududi's holy war to build an Islamic state found expression through full participation in the political system of Pakistan, rather than radical opposition to it."<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>A more literal reading of the <span style="font-style:italic;">hijra</span> as "instruction to be translated into action," is found in the work of Egyptian theologian Sayyid Qutb, rightly considered the most important influence on radical Islamism today. (His brother Mohammad was one of Osama bin Laden's teachers.) In his highly influential 1964 book <span style="font-style:italic;">Milestones</span>, Qutb urges "the callers to Islam in every country and in every period [to] give thought to one particular aspect of the history of Islam and … ponder over it deeply"; specifically, "the generation of the Companions of the Prophet, may God be pleased with them."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> The <span style="font-style:italic;">hijra</span>, Qutb asserts, is more than metaphor and example; it is a model for action, a concept of historical agency, and an ethos. In sum, Qutb viewed the <span style="font-style:italic;">hijra</span> as the most effective means to manifest the differences between the community of true believers and the disbelieving majority culture, known as <span style="font-style:italic;">jahiliyya</span>.</p>
<p>As John Voll notes, "Before Qutb, the word <span style="font-style:italic;">jahiliyya</span> simply refered to the period before the time of the Prophet Mohammad or to those people at the time of Mohammad who did not know about him. However, Qutb used the term inclusively, extending it to all who rebelled willfully against God's rule."<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> Reflecting his abiding (though ambivalent) contempt for European modernity, Qutb calls both for a break between "present and his past" and with the "<span style="font-style:italic;">jahiliyya</span> environment, its customs and traditions, its ideas and concepts." The vanguard, Qutb writes, "which sets out … and then keeps walking on the path … should keep itself somewhat aloof from this all-encompassing <span style="font-style:italic;">jahiliyya</span>…"<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> The vanguard, in Qutb's view, enacts a rupture both within time and community. Though he doesn't deny that some ties with this fallen society should be maintained out of necessity, Qutb proclaims that "we will not change our own values and concepts either more or less to make a bargain with this <span style="font-style:italic;">jahiliyya</span> society. Never! We and it are on different roads, and if we take even one step in its company, we will lose our goal entirely and lose our way as well."<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Two readings, two histories</h1>
<p>What can we make of such language, which is so clearly indebted to Western worldviews, both long-lived and recent? As I've considered this, I've developed two very different readings of this "rough edge." The first would characterize Qutb's <span style="font-style:italic;">hijra</span> rhetoric as a cynical ploy, a hypocritical hanging of Islamic window dressing on an essentially European concept. There's good evidence to support this reading. In addition to not having to admit the European pedigree of his strategy, Qutb can neatly sweep under the rug the influence on his thinking of the liberal-constitutional Wafd Party, which Qutb damned as <span style="font-style:italic;">jahiliya</span> only upon his break with it in the late 1940s.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> This wouldn't be the first time Qutb altered history to fit ideology. In 1952, he proposed that Egyptian history textbooks be revised in order to "to correct the distortions … which failed to give an appropriate place to the Islamic renaissance as represented by the Wahhabiyah and the Mahdiyah movements" of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, which predated the major wave of European colonization and the dissemination of Western thought.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup></p>
<p>In support of such a reading, Voll writes, "It is clear that the Islamic resurgence is not primarily the accomplishment of those with little experience with, or knowledge of, the modern West. Indeed, those who constitute the hard core of the current Islamist wave have had intensive and unprecedented exposure to the technologies, educational systems and philosophies, political processes, cultural values, and lifestyles of the West."<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> That was definitely true of Qutb, who was educated in a modern primary school rather than a traditional Qura'nic school (i.e., a <span style="font-style:italic;">kuttab</span>) and felt perfectly at ease making fun of those educated in such places. He was an accomplished scholar of European romantic poetry and a good poet himself, favoring the romantic mode. Qutb was drawn to other aspects of European modernity, too. According to Voll, Qutb admired the "major rationalist modernists of the 1920s and 1930s."<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup></p>
<p>He wasn't alone in this regard. Western modernists have enjoyed high regard in the Arab world since at least the reign of Mohammad 'Ali (1769–1849), who, inspired by Napoleon, "began a program of rapid modernization of the Egyptian military, government, and economy using Western European advisers and models."<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> And though the modernists could not avoid being challenged by those who "called for a return to the example of the pious ancestors, the companions of the Prophet … Islamic modernism provided fundamentalism with a sophisticated modern vocabulary for the defense of Islam"; specifically, a "focus on secularism and materialism as problems at the core of the modern experience."<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> In sum, rather than viewing Qutb as anti-European and anti-American, as most have, we should follow Musallam's lead and consider him the result of "conflicting forces of tradition and modernity in Egyptian society which were working to shape his personality and world view."<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> The <span style="font-style:italic;">hijra</span> rhetoric is something of a red herring—radical Islamism replicates the worst features of Eurocentrism: violence, intolerance, elitism.</p>
<p>But this is not the only way to interpret the data. A second interpretation of Qutb's use of the <span style="font-style:italic;">hjijra</span> myth puts the sleight of hand to the Europeans, artist and scholar alike.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> There is an extensive body of scholarship that shows Islam to be a deep and significant influence on romanticism.<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> Naji B. Ouejian writes,</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>To the romantics, the East was a model world of exoticism, and what helped popularize such an image of the East was a very old Western tradition which started way before politics and trade had forced the Orient on the attention of the Western peoples; it started with the Westerners' amazement that the East, and not the West, should have been the birthplace of almost all ancient civilizations and of heavenly religions, particularly Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">And, of course, romanticism was a deep and significant influence on the avant-garde. As Renato Poggioli pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Theory of the Avant-Garde</span> (Italian, 1962), the avant-garde is inconceivable without romanticism, and "[m]any historians and critics have affirmed the continuity … between romanticism and avant-gardism." However, he continues, "almost always, this involves rightists, often polemicists, already hostile to romanticism, who attack the avant-garde as an extreme case of what they call the 'disease of romanticism.'"<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> Perhaps this hostility to romanticism is the reason why scholars have mostly ignored the influence of Islam on the avant-garde (or is it the reverse, hostility to Islam amplifying a predisposition against romanticism?). Qutb's affinity with the tendency would only provide one more reason to ignore him.</p>
<p>The metaphor may be part of the problem, too. The military connotations of "avant-garde" obscure other paradigms that are just as useful for imagining small-group cultural radicalism: the cenacle, the rhizome, the think tank, or, of particular interest here, the mystical pilgrimage. The mystical pilgrimage was a common chronotope for romantic poets, as Oueijan points out:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>It is difficult to read extensively in the works of the romantics without coming away with the feeling that there emanates from their writings a sense of determination to explore the mysteries of existing yet obscure realities. Their insistence on a voyage or a pilgrimage away from conventional civilization manifested itself in two forms: a physical (Byron's <span style="font-style:italic;">Childe Harold's Pilgrimage</span>) and/or a mental (Coleridge's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ancient Mariner</span>) quest toward the exotic and mysterious.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Examples of romantic literature in which Islam res prominently are numerous. Shelley, Byron, William Beckford, and Goethe—just to cite the big names—all tried their hands at it. Though it would be incorrect to remove such poets and their work from the broader, demeaning Orientalist treatment of the Arab world that prevailed, some romantics approached Islam with seriousness and respect.</p>
<p>Dan White has drawn my attention to a particularly interesting example of a poem that demonstrates such respect, Robert Southey and Coleridge's "Mohammed."<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> Begun in 1799 by Southey, the poem languished for a few years before being picked up again when Coleridge offered to help out, but the collaboration didn't get too far. In the fragment, Mohammad's brother Ali disguises himself as the Prophet in order to deceive their enemies, enabling Mohammad to escape and hide in a warren of caves.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> That disguise is cloaked in yet another: Ali is "restless and full of fear, yet semblant of one that is sleeping." Upon discovery, the disguise causes further confusion. The substitution of one brother for another befuddles the enemies of Islam and goads them into a panicky, disordered chase across Arabia and North Africa. The scene then shifts to a cave in which Mohammad and one of his Companions hide, passing "expectant hours," their hope giving to "the sound of the wind … its tone" and to the Prophet the promise that "God will confound" the plots of his enemies. The fragment contains a cluster of tried-and-true vanguard themes: self-imposed exile, moralistic interpretation of space and history, sensory and intellectual sensitivity granted by dissidence, the world-historical significance of contrarian attitudes and action, and performance. Incidentally, it also invokes the kinds of ambiguity, performativity, and exotic self-fashioning that are typical of "rough edge" vanguard groupings and that continually baffle scholars commited to linear, Eurocentric models of avant-garde history.</p>
<p>Returning to Qutb, then, I think we find that the issue of influence is more complicated than either interpretation allows on its own. Indeed, there's no way to finally and firmly decide which of the two interpretations of Qutb's <span style="font-style:italic;">hijra</span> rhetoric is more valid. Both Qutb and the historians of the avant-garde have some answering to do. Again, as Musallam puts it, Qutb fashioned himself within "conflicting forces of tradition and modernity in Egyptian society which were working to shape his personality and world view."<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> Thus, I personally find it most suitable to read Qutb's theology as the protean creature of a turbulent rough edge between Europe and the Arab world, a boundary comprised of multiple negotiations, discourses, and performances. Rather than arguing whether Qutb's <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> is authentic or hypocritical, it is more productive and far more interesting to consider it as "both/and."</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Though Al Qaeda is only a small part of its history, I think it suggests the benefits of bringing the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> into the historiographical fold. The kinds of questions scholars who study the avant-garde have begun asking about race, gender, the state and its institutions, colonialism, and other matters come into sharper focus as a consequence—and also different focus. For too long, we've assumed that these issues are distinctively European; they are that, no doubt, but they are also informed by other places, other histories. Avant-garde theory, in turn, provides a remarkably solvent discursive framework for us to comparatively study numerous sites and moments where the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> appears, places like bohemian ballets and novels, the heated debates of Henri de Saint-Simon and his disciples, the polished corridors of the École de Médecine (where doctors debated the best way to aid the colonial project in Algeria), the dusty roads travelled by Frantz Fanon, Gamal Nasser's dungeons, the Islamic sleeper cells of 9/11, and the restive youth of Paris's suburban ghettos. Understood as a complex historical and geopolitical contact zone, the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span>—a term I now view as synonymous with "avant-garde" or "vanguard"—allows us to think about the avant-garde in a more nuanced, global, and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> richly textured way. Understood as an exemplary rough edge, as a place where linear history must give way to the situational analyses of Foucault-style genealogy, the <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> inspires us to understand better the kinds of interventions into hierarchies and power flows that have been and might be carried out by avant-gardes. Most importantly, it restores the issue of terror to rightful prominence within avant-garde studies. The <span style="font-style:italic;">taliah</span> is implicated in the deepest violence: the violence of colonization and its countermovements; the violence of ethnocentrism, both the direct violence of punch and insult and the indirect violence of hopelessness; and the violence of culture shock; and the fires of terrorism. More than towers and airplanes fell on 9/11—with them fell a story about the avant-garde that has long denied its roots, its continuing relevance, and its complex entwinement with racial, sexual, religious, and colonial power.</p>

<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p><span style="font-style:italic;">Once one has acquired the right ear and eye, one becomes restless</span>, Franz Marc </p></blockquote>
<p>Experienced by many artists as the era of private passions, devoid as such of the collective experiences necessary to the creation of "Great Art," modernity found more than once in war and revolution the propitious conditions for a salutary rupture. The majority of artists of the European avant-garde thus succumbed to the euphoria following the declaration of the First World War in 1914, in the hopes of living the powerful common experiences that the gloomy accumulation of days during peace time had seemed to deny them. Although they had previously defended their autonomy, transgressing without respite the limits defined by "tradition" and "common sense," those artists were now ready to recognize in war the "feast" of socialization, advocated once by Hegel as the necessary means for the taming of modern individualism.<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup> In other words, the war offered to the artist the opportunity to protect his self against its own excesses. Expecting to finish with the aporias inherent in the "autonomy of art," he desired to merge in the anonymity of the people.</p>
<p>It is widely acknowledged today that if the Great War accomplished this anonymity, it was in a radically different way than the one hoped for by artists: not simply interdependent, factories and armies became almost interchangeable in their means of production and in their ways of using workers and soldiers' labour power. Just as it was impossible for a worker to have a total vision of the industrial productive process, for individuals  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> participating in battles it had become impossible to perceive the army's plan. The first deception that the war provoked in Max Beckmann was therefore the oppression of his individuality, which he had until then considered to be his most precious capital as an artist.<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup> In a manner similar to George Grosz, Ludwig Meidner, and Ludwig Kirchner, Beckmann would thereafter reject the industrial war for its capacity to multiply horror.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Nevertheless, other artists' reactions to the war do not fall under the purview of such a disillusioned humanism. They were interested in the spirit or method of war rather than in its immediate effects. Despite their crucial differences, the Cubist Fernand Léger, the Expressionist Franz Marc, and the Italian Futurists belong to this general framework. No trace of the horror of war can be detected in their texts or war sketches: instead of focusing on the "inhuman" effects of the war, these artists paid attention to its capacity to abstract the human. Even though all of them recognized in the war's "methodological" abstraction the confirmation and objectification of their previous aesthetic battles, a clear distinction can be made between those who, like Léger, speculated about the war in a rationalist way, analyzing its principles and drawing appropriate conclusions for the future of their art, and those who, like Marc and the Futurists, lived the abstraction of the war in total empathy.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup> This empathy, defined here as the subject's identification with the virtual object of its representation, produced ultimately the transration and, even, sacralization of the war. The war was sometimes sacralized in itself, as the climax of a transcendental experience, and sometimes as the means to accelerate the manifestation of the sacred.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Romantic painter Philipp Otto Runge conceived his landscape painting (<span style="font-style:italic;">Landschafterey</span>) as the anticipation of a new religion, purer and more abstract than Protestantism, which was itself already purer and more abstract than Catholicism; he momentarily imagined a war able to accelerate, by its purifying effects, the irruption of this new religion. Nonetheless, he soon confronted the tenacious inadequacy dividing modern forms of war and religion. In a letter to his brother Daniel written in 1802, the painter explains: "I once imagined a war able to turn the whole world upside down and the way that such a war could come, but since war was becoming a science everywhere in the world and no war was fair any more, I did not see any other means than the advent of the Last Judgment, when the earth will open to swallow up all of us."<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> In Runge's view, the increasing rationalization of war was incompatible with any mystical effect. Secularized history could not assume the eschatological function that the artist still preferred to attribute to a transcendental Last Judgment, striking down human beings from above. One century later, however, it became clear to the sociologist Max Weber that war was the only situation where the bureaucratic State, ordinarily accomplishing its tasks in an impersonal and impassive way, could challenge religious ethics. In giving a meaning to what was strictly arbitrary, death itself, war was able to rouse in nations the spirit of sacrifice that only religious vocations or experiences of communion with God had been able to produce until then.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> This thesis would be confirmed by the Great War, whose mystical character was praised—at least during its first months—by many intellectuals and artists. Roger Caillois analyzes this phenomenon in several essays and, especially, in his book entitled  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Bellone ou la pente de la guerre</span>. In contrast to Runge, Caillois insists on the infallible symmetry between modern war's emancipation of the human, resulting from its radical rationalization, and its increasing sacralization: "Nothing can be felt as sacred", he writes, "that cannot appear to man as completely alien to his own nature."<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>The essential inhumanity of the sacred to which Caillois refers was valid in regard to the avant-gardes, who justified their formal abstractions before the war as the only expressive means appropriate to reveal the divine. The avant-gardes in Germany and Italy were ideologically prepared both to sacralize and aestheticize the First World War<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup>. The fact that the war experience of numerous artists was characterized by an exact equivalence between the aesthetic and the sacred was due to the common apocalyptic structure of these two aspects, so much so that it is impossible to grasp the logic of the mystical war without considering the re of the "Apocalypse." The notion of "Apocalypse" corresponds to a polyvalent metaphor; it is a complex construction, interlocking aesthetics, politics and religiosity, the subjective and voluntarist quest for religion in modern times. Since this notion determined artistic ideologies before the war, the avant-gardes were ready to invest in the idea of an "apocalyptic war," a conceptual conjunction that had seemed so terribly incongruous a century before to the Romantic painter Philipp Otto Runge.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Declining the Metaphor of Nature</h1>
<p>For the avant-gardes, war had started before the war. Despite the crucial differences among the several avant-garde trends, their common target was nature or reality: during the five years prior to the outbreak of the war, their discourse presented nature under several facets, all of which were interdependent. Material and passive, devoid as such of any original productive spirit, nature was above all a "woman."<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup> "Nature" included globally the concept of "accumulation": the accumulation of natural formations—<span style="font-style:italic;">natura naturata</span>—or of fabricated objects, issued from the continuous production of capitalism. Nonetheless, accumulation also referred to the addition of artistic forms of the past. In this case, it denoted tradition and, to a greater extent, its parody: eclecticism. The influential anarchist essayist Ludwig Rubiner, for instance, an ethical and political model for Hans Pfemfert, the editor of the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Die Aktion</span>, asserts that "capitalism is not simply a state; it is an attitude. The exploitation of everything that exists in the world and that does not come from ourselves. In art, this attitude is hidden behind the concepts of 'tradition' and 'style'."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> From a temporal point of view, the avant-gardes rejected the mere accumulation of moments or events, in which they recognized linear, mechanical time. They also abhorred cyclical time, inscribed in daily labour as well as in the implacable repetition of the manifestations of nature. In regard to the past, accumulation as a macro-temporality signified historicism, and in regard to the future it signified blind, automatic evolutionism.</p>
<p>From a political point of view, the avant-gardes, from Kandinsky to the Futurists and the Expressionist Activists, were most often defiant of and even hostile to democratic representation, social democracy, and Marxist materialism. While parliaments had removed  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> from the historical subject its capacity for direct action and produced what was only an apparent democracy, social democracy cancelled out the notion of revolution by transforming it into an evolutionist reformism. For the majority of artists, parliamentary democracy and social democracy corresponded to a kind of "political mimesis": they were limited to the political reproduction of the already existing. A social-democratic adept was thus ultimately the political equivalent of a Naturalist painter. One of the most striking expressions of this equivalence between art and politics was given by the activist <span style="font-style:italic;">Literat</span> Kurt Hiller. Speaking in indistinct terms borrowed from artistic imitation and parliamentary democracy, these "sheer descriptions" as he qualified them,<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup> Hiller affirms: "Description is nothing; the elaboration of norms (<span style="font-style:italic;">Normation</span>) is everything; we want to change, improve, help. We do not think nor feel psychologically; we think and feel politically."<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup></p>
<p>Marxist materialism was rejected for its determinism, disqualified as a product of scientific rationalism simply transferred from the field of natural sciences to the field of history. Moreover, the avant-gardes had a mediocre idea of the proletariat: its materialism seemed to them symmetrical to the materialism of the bourgeoisie. All in all, these facets of the real—spatial and temporal, aesthetic and political—were founded on the naive conviction that nature, reality, or the milieu was capable of engendering its own change. Nevertheless, as Kurt Pinthus claims, they could only achieve their mere reproduction. The editor of the well-known Expressionist anthology <span style="font-style:italic;">Menschendämmerung</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">Twilight of Humanity</span>) , affirms after the end of the war: "Man calls reality (<span style="font-style:italic;">Wirklichkeit</span> everything that exists outside him, around him and before him. He takes as 'real reality' nature and its manifestations [ … ]. He takes as reality the human past, History, whose he considers to be the last link. He takes as reality all the constellations and arrangements that he has created (State, economy, social order) so that he can be relieved of the burden of life."<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> According to Pinthus, however, "Man can only be saved by man, and not by his environment."<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> This is the reason why the avant-gardes had decided to produce a new aesthetic, historical, and political reality by means of what seemed to them to be their exclusive instrument, namely the spirit.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">A Typology of the Apocalyptic Model: Rupture/Interval, Action/Waiting</h1>
<p>In the book he dedicated in 1922 to the Anabaptist Thomas Münzer, the philosopher Ernst Bloch asserts that "the apocalyptic irruption shatters the over-abundance of history."<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> Many artists and writers' investment in the re of the Apocalypse was due to its radical rupture of a time saturated by history, as well as to the dialectics of catastrophe and utopia inherent in the Apocalypse since the days of Jewish messianism.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> The Apocalypse of the artists was one of the res of modernity's secularization process. Its catastrophic and utopian action was supposed to emanate from subjectivity. The radical subjectivism of the avant-gardes was founded on the idea of an"interiority," either individual or collective, capable of applying its law to exterior reality. Despite the fact that the spiritualism and, more generally, the idealism of the avant-gardes blurred the boundaries between the political and the religious, one can hypothesize that their  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> apocalyptic utopias became manifest <span style="font-style:italic;">globally</span> in two major forms and according to two different temporalities: the Apocalypse with a social and political vocation, inspired by revolution and expected, as such, to take the form of a radical rupture; and the Apocalypse which maintained its religious vocation, conceived this time as a progressive revelation of a <span style="font-style:italic;">Geist</span>, whose accomplishment would put an end to the materialist era. Apocalyptic revolution presupposed the voluntarist and activist attitude of the subject, while the "religious" apocalypse was indebted to the concept of "waiting": not for the Messiah, but for the ripening of time, for the realization of history's potential.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Political Ruptures</h1>
<p>The analysis of Futurists and Expressionists' activist works and discourse outlines the type of apocalyptic revolution that they envisioned; mainly of anarchist origin, it is in other words opposed to parliamentarianism, social-democratic reformism, and Marxism. The critic Carl Einstein, for instance, an important member of the Expressionist circle around <span style="font-style:italic;">Die Aktion</span>, did not indulge in the "democratic compromise," which constituted the main target of his text "Politische Anmerkungen" (Political notes) .<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> He qualifies this compromise as "acrobatic," for it mainly consisted in the "neutralization" and the "dialectical resolution" of oppositions. To the re of the "dialectician" Einstein opposes the "univocal man" (<span style="font-style:italic;">eindeutig Mensch</span>), ideally capable of combining "form and violence" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Form und Gewalt</span>) in his "primitive" action. Parliamentary decrees are, according to Einstein, the illusory resolutions of conflicts, while he praises what he calls the "univocal" for its "unparliamentary" (<span style="font-style:italic;">unparlementarisch</span>) character and its capacity to be "always identical to the construction of its Idea."<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> Parliamentarianism's aesthetic corollary was, for the critic, the optical atomization, the indecision and passivity of Impressionist pictures. Einstein opposes the idea of a wilful art, capable of mastering the energy of the spirit by means of a solid form. In another text called simply "Das Gesetz" (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Law)</span> , he describes the ideal process of both artistic and political action: the subject is expected to apply in both matters its own "Law," the "manifestation of transcendental formations" and of "powerful will." Law is autonomous and, as such, determined by a "real arbitrariness" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Willkür</span>)<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup>. This subjective arbitrariness should characterize both political and aesthetic action. Ludwig Rubiner goes to greater lengths to establish this equivalence between the artistic and the political: in praising the efficiency of the representational action of the poet and the painter, he makes them into the paradigmatic res of the activist man. Endowed with "Intensity" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Intensität</span>)—a Bergsonian notion that the writer explains quite vaguely as "the conscious action of spirit"<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> —artists are able to "transform inner images into facts"<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> and to replace the actual forms of reality by "space (created) from within."<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> In other words, there is no mediation, no qualitative transition between art and reality: plastic forms are converted into political actions, and reality is submitted to the formative power of the subject in the same way as the pictorial surface. The link between art and reality is "re-presentation": forms and actions are the exteriorizations or spatializations of subjective representations. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>If Rubiner does not explain the concrete manner in which forms can be converted into actions, Italian Futurists do. Not simply equivalent or analogical, forms and actions have a rationalized and, more precisely, an instrumental relation. Umberto Boccioni, Luigi Russolo, and Carlo Carrà count on the action of the image's motor forces on the spectator: as a perceptive equivalent of the political realm, the suggestive image is at the same time its model and its instrument. The solidification of impressionist "ambivalence" by the "force-lines" and "force-forms" was a model for the organization of the amorphous masses during the Revolution.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup> Russolo's painting <span style="font-style:italic;">Revolt (</span>1911) comes naturally to mind when one reads the following lines from the manifesto "The Exhibitors to the Public" written in 1912: "With the desire to intensify the aesthetic emotions by blending, so to speak, the painted canvas with the soul of the spectator, we have declared that the latter, '<span style="font-style:italic;">must in the future be placed in the center of the picture</span>.' He shall not be present at, but participate in the action. If we paint the phases of a riot, the crowd battling with uplifted fists and the noisy onslaughts of cavalry are translated upon the canvas in sheaves of lines corresponding with all the conflicting forces, following the general law of violence of the picture. The force-lines must encircle and involve the spectator so that he will in a manner be forced to struggle himself with the persons in the picture."<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup></p>
<p>Still, the differences between the politically engaged Expressionists and the Futurists were at least as important as their commonalities. If the latter understood as literal the violence that the artistic form was supposed to tame in order better to propagate it, the Expressionists understood it in its ideal sense. One of the main influences on Futurism was exercised by the ideas of Georges Sorel on violence, while it was Piotr Kropotkin, Gustav Landauer, Erich Mühsam and other pacifist anarchists who determined the political conceptions of <span style="font-style:italic;">Die Aktion</span>.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> In this regard, the nationalist bellicism of the Italian artists was the opposite of the cosmopolitan pacifism of the Germans. The latter, passably Christian in their majority, were also heavily influenced by Tolstoy, who, beyond his anarchistic convictions, also believed very firmly in the contagious character of art. Nevertheless, neither Tolstoy nor his German followers aspired to exploit the contagious capacities of art for the propagation of violence, but aimed at its elimination.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> In short, unlike the Sorelian revolution, the revolution of the Expressionist activists was pacifist, and, unlike the Marxist revolution, it was ideal.<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup></p>
<p>Despite their differences, all these different revolutions—the Sorelian, the Marxist, and the Expressionist—shared an apocalyptic character.<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> The Expressionist revolution of the Idea in particular was supposed to emanate from the subject in an immediate, voluntary, and imperative way. One of the main themes in the political writings of <span style="font-style:italic;">Die Aktion</span> is the rejection of the passive, messianic <span style="font-style:italic;">expectation</span>. Carl Einstein ironically deplores the fact that liberal democracy succeeded in rationalizing even "catastrophes," and Ludwig Rubiner explains that the main element that differentiates "Spirit" from <span style="font-style:italic;">Zivilisation</span> is its imperviousness to any kind of evolutionism. Spirit's ontological regime is exclusively "catastrophic." "Ideas are always there, and they are always new," Rubiner argues: "And every Idea is a catastrophe."<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>As to Futurists, their reaction was similar to that of other anarcho-syndicalists in Italy. Zeev Sternhell has explained more than once the ways in which the anti-materialist and anti-rationalist revision of Marxism in Europe was able to attribute to the war the function they formerly attributed to revolution.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> From 1910 on, Marinetti and Boccioni progressively adopted the revolutionary nationalism of the journal <span style="font-style:italic;">La Lupa</span>.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> Since the revolution was "moral" in its intentions, and certainly not economic, the war turned out to be the ideal baptismal field for the moulding of virtues such as courage, the ascetic renouncement of one's self, and so forth. In his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Guerrapittura</span>, conceived and published during the war, Carlo Carrà writes: "War or revolution, both purifying, both invigorating."<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> Later, when Futurism became one of the main components of fascism, Marinetti evokes very simply the "revolutionary war," guided by "a minority of intellectuals." "They were the best, the least imbued by tradition, the most Futurist. While the whole population was still immersed in the inertia of pacifism, they understood the need for the war."<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Religious Interval: Between the "Already" and the "Not Yet"</h1>
<p>The works and essays of the artists who associated their activity with the destiny of religion put forward the idea of the Apocalypse as a progressive, secular <span style="font-style:italic;">Revelatio</span> of the Spirit. Politics as such was not so important in the case of Vassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc; for them, the dystopias of their time were essentially a matter of religious defectiveness.<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> It was this defectiveness that was about to end: "Today art is moving in a direction toward which our fathers would never even have dreamed. One stands before the new works as in a dream and hears the horsemen of the Apocalypse in the air. An artistic tension is felt all over Europe. Everywhere new artists are greeting each other."<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> In the prospectus of the Almanach of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Blaue Reiter</span>, authored by Marc, geographical universalism becomes a translation of historical determinism. In being an expression of History's will, new painting even draws its legitimizing metaphors from "nature": as Marc argues, new art crosses the borders of nations in the same arbitrary and thus undeniably objective way that grains are spread by the wind.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> His painting's universalism is as strong as the implacable determinism of natural laws: this is the sole positive reference to "blind" nature that Franz Marc allows himself. In any case, the historical identity of the era is one of tension between the materialism that was coming to an end and the progressive revelation of the "Great Spiritual." Artistic tension, of which the <span style="font-style:italic;">Almanach</span> is a testimony in itself, was the anticipatory and condensed manifestation of this more global, but still latent, historical tension. The attitudes of Marc and Kandinsky towards history comprised waiting, interval, and distance: they believed the apocalyptic "revelation" to be progressive and immanent in history, even if they thought that they accelerated its realization by their works. They were living <span style="font-style:italic;">already</span> what was not there <span style="font-style:italic;">yet</span>: the incarnation of the spiritual in art reproduced, in short, the tensions and contradictions of the dogma of the Incarnation of God in Christ. Karl Löwith formulates this tension very subtly: "The times are already accomplished, but they are not completed yet. The time which separates the Resurrection of Christ  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> from his Return is irrevocably the last one; but it is also, as long as it lasts, the last but one time which precedes the accomplishment of the kingdom of Christ, present but still secret, in the form of the manifested kingdom of the Father."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Antilogical Principle: From the Apocalyptic <span style="font-style:italic;">Istoria</span> to the Apocalyptic Form</h1>
<p>The Expressionist logic was grounded in the concept of a more or less radical "dissociation" between external and internal reality, matter and spirit, or the organic and the abstract. Like all the painters who worked on abstraction, Vassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc exhausted the consequences of the idea according to which nature's truth was hidden behind its appearances: the further pictorial forms were from the forms of nature, the better painting revealed the latter's (abstract) essence. Logical contradiction prevailed here: the more two objects seemed dissimilar, the more they were in fact similar. In the first letter he addressed to the composer Arnold Schönberg in January 18, 1911, Kandinsky qualifies his artistic conception as "antilogical." Elsewhere, in a great number of his essays, he raises "dissonance" to the level of the central notion of the pictorial and musical composition.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> Contrast, contradiction, antilogical, dissonance: all these notions are susceptible to being joined in the concept of the "Apocalypse." Expressionist aesthetics can thus be interpreted as an entirely apocalyptic aesthetics, and the conception of abstraction as "Revelation" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Ent-hüllung</span>) of the hidden is not the sole reason for this equation.</p>
<p>It is widely known that in the years during which Kandinsky elaborated on abstraction, he was also obsessed with the themes of the Apocalypse and the Last Judgement. An important change took place in his paintings during those years: Apocalypse passed progressively from the status of <span style="font-style:italic;">istoria</span> to that of <span style="font-style:italic;">form</span>.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup> Kandinsky's apocalyptic "feeling" was progressively interiorized by and assimilated into the "hidden construction" of forms and colors. The historical tension of the times was translated into the contrasting relations among plastic elements and it was spatialized in the tense convexity of space common in Expressionist paintings.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup></p>
<p>The vertical size of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Last Judgment</span>, a painting of 1910, is rather uncommon in the artist's production; the Apocalypse is signified here by a big trumpet, cutting the composition diagonally, but also by the citadel on the top of the "triangle," evoking the celestial Jerusalem and the Merezkovskian Moscow as the Third Rome.<sup><a name="f41-text" href="#f41">41</a></sup> Through their strictly iconological character, these attributes construct the apocalyptic <span style="font-style:italic;">istoria</span>. At the same time, however, they are completed in their action by the signifying function of the formal elements themselves, which are considerably dissociated from their objective referent. More precisely, the dissonant sounds of the trumpet are not only suggested by the kneeling re putting her fingers over her ears, but also by the highly contrasting colours and, above all, by the vibrating, trembling, and shaken space. This tense space, whose center is about to blow up, looks as if it was shaken by the shrill sounds of the apocalyptic trumpet. At the same time, the spots of colour express by their dilated and dissolving character the dematerialization and evaporation of sounds in the air.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Ultimately, the de-objectification of the plastic elements signifies the de-objectification of the world that the Apocalypse is supposed to initiate. Not only does colour overflow the outline of objects, but the pictorial surface is also stretched like skin, or rather like a woman's belly hiding a new life. A double and apparently contradictory, gendered conception of the work of art determines Kandinsky's thought: the feminine function of pregnancy and the masculine function of the spectator's fertilization. In his <span style="font-style:italic;">Spiritual in Art</span>, the artist affirms: "The art which does not enclose in itself any future potential and which is thus a child of its times will never engender the future: it is a castrated art."<sup><a name="f42-text" href="#f42">42</a></sup> In spite of this, the ambivalent gender of Kandinsky's paintings was not contradictory: conceived either as a pregnant woman or as a generating male, its target was in both cases the spiritual fertilization of the spectator. In a similar way to the process of "<span style="font-style:italic;">imitatio Christi</span>," the spectator was expected to interiorize the "apocalyptic" image and operate his own "revelation."</p>

<p>A similar apocalyptic function of form, grounded in "alogism" or "transrationality" (<span style="font-style:italic;">zaum</span>), was inherent in Russian Cubo-Futurism. For those poets and painters the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> non-objective world was a "worldbackwards" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Mirskontsa</span>): this is also the title of a poetic anthology that includes poems by Aleksei Kruchenykh and Velimir Khlebnikov as well as drawings by Nataliya Goncharova, Mikhail Larionov and Vladimir Tatlin.<sup><a name="f43-text" href="#f43">43</a></sup> The "worldbackwards" or the world "turned topsy-turvy," as the poet Helena Guro states in a poem, did not respect the cognitive and perceptive conventions of logocentrism.<sup><a name="f44-text" href="#f44">44</a></sup> It found its expression in z<span style="font-style:italic;">aum</span> poetry, going from the transgression of syntactic rules to the combination of simple phonemes, and in the illogical juxtaposition of objects and forms in paintings and collages. However, "worldbackwards" was also the verbal or pictorial translation of apocalyptic time "counted backwards." The notion of "Zero," extremely important for the Russian avant-gardes, also included the time "Zero," the very moment of apocalyptic irruption and spiritual revelation: this was exactly the story of Malevitch's <span style="font-style:italic;">Black Square</span>, the famous "zero of forms."<sup><a name="f45-text" href="#f45">45</a></sup> Retrospectively, the painter situated the first appearance of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Black Square</span> in a certain eclipse of the sun: in the canvas of the Third act of the Futurist opera <span style="font-style:italic;">Victory over the Sun</span> . The temporal tension of the Apocalypse was spatially translated in the diagonal division of the image, composed by the half of an absence—the disappearance of the naturalist sun—and the half of a presence—the progressive revelation of the spirit emanating from subjectivity.<sup><a name="f46-text" href="#f46">46</a></sup> Subjectivity's victory over nature is celebrated at the end of the opera in the following lines: "The world may fall but we shall have no end."<sup><a name="f47-text" href="#f47">47</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Judgment of Art</h1>
<p>Nonetheless, the intention of all the artists who had chosen to shock the public by the unusual formal identity of their works was ultimately for its greater benefit. Before the First World War painting was healing by hurting, and this was undoubtedly its major apocalyptic quality. There is no battle in the paintings of Kandinsky without peace at its horizon, no tragedy without serenity, and no poison without an antidote. During an ethnographical survey of Siberia, this former jurist understood the meaning of popular oral law: "absolute crime does not exist", he asserted; "it is not action (the real), but its root (the abstract) which does good or harms. And finally: every action is indifferent."<sup><a name="f48-text" href="#f48">48</a></sup> In other words, while the apparent effect of Kandinsky's abstract compositions was to shock the spectator's ordinary perception, their "hidden" intention was destined to reveal the spirit to him. One could go even further and apply the antilogical rule here: the more a composition was aggressive toward perception, the more it was beneficial to ethics. The same presuppositions and intentions, in a deliberately aggressive and provocative version, determine Futurist art.</p>
<p>The transition from the symbolization of the end of the world to what we can call the "final form" was remarkably presented by the Russian philosopher Nicolai Berdjaev, who was very attentive to modern art. In his text <span style="font-style:italic;">The Crisis of Art</span> published in 1918, Berdjaev plays with the semantic ambivalence of the term "crisis," designating at the same time the notion of the (last) Judgement and the uncertain manifold state of tensions and conflicts.<sup><a name="f49-text" href="#f49">49</a></sup> He was convinced that Crisis had stricken the body of art long before it irrupted within History in the form of War. Berdjaev first observed the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> omnipresence of the apocalyptic theme in Russian Symbolism and later in the painting of the avant-gardes. He pointed out an important change in their approach. According to the Symbolist conception, Symbolist artists such as Čiurlionis, Ivanov, or Scriabin adopted an additive approach to the theme of the End of Times: they added "spirit" and symbolic meanings to material forms, at the risk of oppressing and suffocating the latter (something much like the Hegelian "bad infinite"). In opposition to this additive approach, the Cubist, Futurist, and Suprematist painters proceeded by subtracting the "skin" or "envelope" of bodies: new painting was thus a process of disincarnation or disembodiment. It was on this account, moreover, that Berdjaev recognized in the war the historical realization of the new painting. In a manner similar to most of the painters upon whose works he commented, the philosopher also dissociated the exterior from the interior, the organic from the abstract. In this way he was able to identify in the industrial war the envelope of the spiritual one: "In cosmic life indeed a spiritual war is being waged and a struggle made for the greatest values. And only by the spiritual war can mankind and the nations be saved for a new life. The material warfare is but a manifesting forth of the spiritual warfare."<sup><a name="f50-text" href="#f50">50</a></sup> In keeping with what happened before the war in the Cubist paintings of Pablo Picasso or in the Futurist canvases, wherein the human re was submitted to an increasing representational dematerialization, historical man was also losing his cultural envelope during the war and reaching a core that Berdjaev called "barbarity." Berdjaev wondered if this barbarity would turn out to be a new beginning or an end. One could ask: was war inaugurating a post-history or a kind of second prehistory? It was probably this ambivalent post-and pre-historic barbarity that struck the philosopher in the paintings of Picasso located in Moscow such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Women</span>  or the <span style="font-style:italic;">Dryad</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">Nude in the Forest</span>) .</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Mystics of the "Despite" and those of the "Because": The Apocalyptic War</h1>
<p>When the war broke up in August of 1914, it fit like a glove on artists' apocalyptic imaginary. Even if all of them did not celebrate the outbreak of violence, the great majority agreed that the latter represented something similar to the "messianic pains," also called the "pains of giving birth," that ancient rabbis had seen in the torments of the Apocalypse.<sup><a name="f51-text" href="#f51">51</a></sup> For Roger Caillois, the myth of the war as delivery was one of the aspects that contributed to its sacralization in the second half of the nineteenth century. One could add that this generative quality attributed to war was precisely the result of its preliminary conception as an Apocalypse. Transred in the "pains of giving birth," the torments of the war became not only tolerable, but sometimes even desirable.<sup><a name="f52-text" href="#f52">52</a></sup> This graduation from the "tolerable" to the "desirable" may help to distinguish among different mystical reactions to the war. Certain artists such as Kandinsky as well as the politically engaged Expressionist Literati rejected the war in itself, but could not avoid seeing in it a mediation, a kind of crossing point from the critical past to the accomplished future. Others, however, such as Marc and the Futurists, celebrated the war as a welcome moment endowed with a unique, exclusive, and purifying capacity.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> In other words, the mysticism of the war had its moderate and its radical disciples, its disciples of the "despite" and those of the "because."</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Antilogical War</h1>
<p>Kandinsky and Rubiner, who sincerely abhorred violence, rejected the war when they judged it in itself, but hoped that future peace would be superior to the former one. This was a question of perspective. To Franz Marc, who affirmed to Kandinsky that "I live myself <span style="font-style:italic;">in this war</span>. I see in it a salutary, even cruel way which leads us to the goal. This war will not be a regression for humanity, but it will serve to cleanse Europe, to make her ready," Kandinsky answered: "I thought that to construct the future we had to clean the place in another manner. The price of this way of cleansing is horrible."<sup><a name="f53-text" href="#f53">53</a></sup> In other words, despite his own previous arguments about external and internal law, "every action" was not indifferent for Kandinsky. Nonetheless, what counted most for him was the "root" of each action. Of course, the "root" for this modern man was not a stump lying in the past, but the predetermined meaning of History expected to be realized in the future. Even if Kandinsky would certainly have preferred a cleansing of the reality of his times without the shedding of a single drop of blood, he was tempted to cast his gaze away from the horrible present and turn it towards the future. In sum, the antilogical principle remained valid throughout: the more the sacrifice during the war was horrible and inacceptable, the more legitimate seemed the hopes of the artist. "What a happiness it will be," Kandinsky confided to Klee shortly after the beginning of the war, "when this horrible era will have ended. What will come afterwards? A great bursting out, I think, of the purest forces, which will also lead to fraternization. And at the same time, a great blooming of art, which for the time being has to remain hidden in dark corners."<sup><a name="f54-text" href="#f54">54</a></sup></p>
<p>The interpretation of the war by the intellectuals and artists around <span style="font-style:italic;">Die Aktion</span> did not differ substantially from Kandinsky's. They refused to serve their homeland as soldiers, they waged war against war and continually transgressed censure, but they also hoped that the advent of the socialist community would be accelerated by the war, as if this latter became an involuntary accomplice of the expectations of these authors. For these convinced anti-materialists, the war was also a "messianic pain": as an action of the Antichrist (the capital, nationalism, and so forth), the war proclaimed the Kingdom of One Thousand Years. The anti-materialist determination of their political conception led them to find an indirectly positive effect of the war. It is no less true—Eva Kolinski has remarkably shown it in her study on the politics of German Expressionism—that the ambition of these people to play the role of social guides pushed them to anticipate the context propitious for the exercise of this role.<sup><a name="f55-text" href="#f55">55</a></sup> A new world was urgently needed. Henceforth, the conception of a spiritual pacifist avant-garde, opposed to the military ones, haunted the writings of <span style="font-style:italic;">Die Aktion</span> during the war. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Abstraction of the Concrete, Empathy with the Abstract: Marc's War</h1>
<p>As for Franz Marc, he blamed the perspectivist reaction of his ancient accomplice, Vassily Kandinsky, on the war. To the latter's attitude of filtering and mediation, he opposed his own full, immediate participation. Nonetheless, although Franz Marc participated in the war as a soldier and even lost his life to it, the question that needs to be asked is if this Expressionist painter was after all capable of participating in any kind of concrete common experience. The Expressionist war was ultimately incompatible with any participatory attitude.<sup><a name="f56-text" href="#f56">56</a></sup></p>
<p>To be specific, immediate, common war was completely different from Marc's <span style="font-style:italic;">own</span> war, such as it was expressed in both his drawings and writings. The reason is that as a soldier, Marc adopted his previous attitude as an anti-naturalist artist: "From the very first moments of the war," he confessed to his wife, "all my reflections were concentrated on the effort to isolate the spirit of this moment from the unfurling pandemonium. I put my fingers on my ears and I tried to see behind the phantom of the war … The thinker flees the face of things, for the reason that they are never what they appear to be."<sup><a name="f57-text" href="#f57">57</a></sup> If the war did not transform Marc into a naturalist, it was because the artist succeeded in detaching himself from precise events and actions as well as in abstracting himself from war's materialist grounds. He was able to live in empathy with war's "hidden" meaning. Detached from the "impressionist" history of events and from the materialist history of causes, the Expressionist painter was able to live in empathy with his own philosophy of history and his own religion.</p>
<p>War's considerable technical dematerialization favoured Marc's transring crossing of appearances. He elaborates this in his own terms: "In any case, this war does not make of me a naturalist, on the contrary, I feel so strongly the spirit hovering above battles, the spirit omnipresent behind every bullet, that the real, the material totally disappears. The battles, the wounds, all movement produce such an effect of mysticism, of irreality, as if they signified something radically different from the meaning of their names."<sup><a name="f58-text" href="#f58">58</a></sup> The artist could thus recognize retrospectively the anticipation of the war in his painting <span style="font-style:italic;">Fate of Animals</span> , where he expresses, in the middle of nature's destruction, the voluntary sacrifice of the deer.<sup><a name="f59-text" href="#f59">59</a></sup> Similarly, his non-realistic perception of the war was represented in his war sketches: his two drawings called <span style="font-style:italic;">Streit</span> (Conflict) as well as the one called <span style="font-style:italic;">Zaubriger Moment</span> (Magical Moment), all centrifugally composed, transre the material explosion by transforming it into the ecstatic bursting of the world of appearances.<sup><a name="f60-text" href="#f60">60</a></sup></p>
<p>Every mystical reading of the war functions in fact as a Christian parable. It presupposes the dissociation between appearance and essence or between deed and meaning. The Existentialist philosopher Jan Patočka distinguishes between the "diurnal motives" of the war and the sublime experience that it offered to those who were able to attain its metaphysical meaning. Relying on the mystical accounts of Ernst Jünger or Teilhard de Chardin, Patočka affirms: "The diurnal motives that have raised the will of war are wasting away in the furnace of the front, when the war experience turns out to be profound enough for not succumbing once more to the forces of the day  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> … The everyday, as well as every image of life to come, fades away when confronted with this nude summit on which man has now placed himself."<sup><a name="f61-text" href="#f61">61</a></sup> In the same way, Franz Marc does not describe any battle in his letters: his inner world had thoroughly replaced common reality. He was not interested in the feelings that this shared reality provoked in his fellows: he was convinced that men were executing the will of History as if they were automatons. Being the only one "awake" among somnambulists, the Expressionist artist sometimes identified in the war the Judgment of History and sometimes a necessary surgical operation. In both cases, what was at stake was a radical "cut": the cut of time, with all the harmful ideas and deeds it contained. Since Schiller and Hegel, the metaphor of the Judgment of History, secularizing the theme of the Last Judgment, has been well founded in occidental thought.<sup><a name="f62-text" href="#f62">62</a></sup> The judgment of Franz Marc, evaluating according to the "hidden meaning" of the war, considered henceforth that the relentless aesthetical and spiritual battles he had engaged in before the war with his friends were premature, voluntarist, merely subjective. Rejecting all <span style="font-style:italic;">avant</span>—or <span style="font-style:italic;">arrière</span>—garde, he was able to dream that at the end of the war People and artists would be at last synchronous.<sup><a name="f63-text" href="#f63">63</a></sup></p>
<p>As a "surgeon," the war was supposed to excise the "ill members" of Europe. Even if Franz Marc pretended that the latter did not correspond necessarily to geographical frontiers, but to transnational social and cultural groups, he did attribute a special spiritual value to Germany, his own country<sup><a name="f64-text" href="#f64">64</a></sup>. Also, the war was endowed with certain magical qualities. In this case, it was expected to exorcize excess by its own excess. The prodigality of destruction, the sacrificial expense that Marc mentions very often in his war writings, was equal to the historicist accumulation against which he had always fought. Beyond this neutralizing function, however, sacrificial expense was also expected to reach the core of nature: "Nature does not count the pennies", Marc argued<sup><a name="f65-text" href="#f65">65</a></sup>. In other words, the sacrificial generosity was the reversed image of the utilitarian exploitation of nature and the narrow, mean bourgeois spirit. In sum, Franz Marc invested his resources of empathy on abstract war, to the point that his non-contemporaneity with his contemporaries—his temporal interval with his times—shrank more and more, until it was completely absorbed. During the first months of mystical optimism, the future stood in for the present; later though, when Marc came to believe that the war was despite everything a materialist business, he did not come back to History, but continued to cross the spatial and temporal appearances until he reached what he called, echoing Schopenhauer, an "Indian atemporality."<sup><a name="f66-text" href="#f66">66</a></sup></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Futurist Artificial Optimism</h1>
<p>The empathy of the Futurists with the war was entirely different from Marc's, conditioned as it was by their Bergsonian conviction that "<span style="font-style:italic;">la vie déborde l'intelligence</span>, which is to say that it overflows, swamps, and suffocates the infinitesimally small faculty of intelligence."<sup><a name="f67-text" href="#f67">67</a></sup> According to this, Futurists were ideologically predisposed to construct a war experience that united the spiritual and the physiological.<sup><a name="f68-text" href="#f68">68</a></sup> They rejected every kind of intellectualism, of which Boccioni and Marinetti rarely forgot to underline the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> supposed "German origin." In regard to art, they believed that the shaking of the spirit could only be reached through the shaking of the body; in regard to politics, Marinetti and Carrà attacked the intellectualism inherent in internationalist and pacifist socialism, to which they opposed the spontaneous and energetic action of the nationalized masses.<sup><a name="f69-text" href="#f69">69</a></sup> Futurists affirmed in their writings that these two vitalist conceptions of art and revolution converged naturally within war, the aesthetic and political qualities of which they praised. Of course, the question that arises is: how do we come to know the extent to which vitalist spontaneity and energetic courage were compatible with the war's technological means? The reasons for such a contradiction are conceptually productive and the historian has to work on the gap between values and facts.</p>
<p>Futurists went beyond the modernist assertion according to which artists were predisposed, by virtue of their transgressive attitude, to announce wars and revolutions.<sup><a name="f70-text" href="#f70">70</a></sup> Marinetti had elaborated an interesting chiasmus of metaphors: Futurism represented "the militarization of innovative artists" and war was, inversely, "Futurism intensified."<sup><a name="f71-text" href="#f71">71</a></sup> What did this intensification mean, exactly? War proved to hold a force of acceleration more efficient than the one attributed to revolution before the onset of the war. It was expected to destroy the parliamentary parody and tear bourgeois contracts to pieces. Of course, the Futurist intensification of the war meant above all the latter's aestheticization, set forth each time that Marinetti praised the synaesthesic, quasi Wagnerian spectacle of battles. Moreover, the aesthetics of the war rested on its "disinterested" character: if Marinetti insisted on the notions of sacrifice and heroism, it was because their common "disinterested" essence transformed them into eminent aesthetic qualities. It is well known that Walter Benjamin explored this aspect of "disinterested contemplation" of the war in his theorization of the aestheticization of politics in Futurism and Fascism. Before his essay on art (1935–6), it was in his recession of the anthology <span style="font-style:italic;">Krieg und Krieger</span> (War and Warrior), edited by Ernst Jünger in 1930, that he broached this subject. To explain the idealization and sacralization of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fronterlebnis</span> (war experience), he writes: "The most rabidly decadent origins of this new theory of war are emblazoned on their foreheads: it is nothing other than an uninhibited translation of the principles of <span style="font-style:italic;">l'art pour l'art</span> to the war itself."<sup><a name="f72-text" href="#f72">72</a></sup> Nonetheless, writers such as Andrew Hewitt, Jeffrey Schnapp and Mark Antliff have underlined the inadequacy existing between Benjamin's Kantian, contemplative interpretation of the aesthetics of war and the highly energetic and active function assumed by the latter in various anti-democratic ideologies of those years.<sup><a name="f73-text" href="#f73">73</a></sup> Christine Poggi, on the other hand, recently recognized the constituent moment of Futurism in the process of conversion of symbolist pessimism to what Marinetti called "artificial optimism": this conversion is probably the most appropriate thread to grasp in an effort to untangle the complex landscape of the Futurist aesthetics of politics.</p>
<p>If 1914 was a "Futurist Year," it was because, as Marinetti said, "Today, we are seeing an immense Futurist exhibition of aggressive, dynamic canvases, one we wish to engage in so as to reveal our qualities."<sup><a name="f74-text" href="#f74">74</a></sup> A war which unfolds as an "immense Futurist exhibition" is of course an aestheticized war. A war in which we want to engage "so as to reveal our qualities," however, is a realized aesthetics. The difference between Decadentism  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and Futurism is situated exactly in this inversion. While the Wagnerian contemplation of battles is an amplification of Decadentist aestheticism, the moulding of "new men" in the trenches has something resolutely avant-gardist about it. The aesthetic contemplation of the war remained, in principle, considerably passive: it had not broken with the "chronic pessimism" that Marinetti identifies accusingly in his writings. His own concept of "artificial optimism" found a happy outlet in what the poet calls the "cruel and violent realism" of war.<sup><a name="f75-text" href="#f75">75</a></sup> The war would "revive," "accelerate," and "sharpen" the intelligence and nerves of its agents. In other words, the war's agents were expected to be the artists of their own selves. As several historians have argued, this fabrication of a new, invulnerable subjectivity was the most important stake of Futurism.<sup><a name="f76-text" href="#f76">76</a></sup></p>
<p>Art was both the laboratory and the instrument of a new, invulnerable subjectivity, where the effects of the dissolving forces of the milieu—either natural or artificial—had already been tested on the object. After the disintegrating simultaneism and the interpenetration of bodies in painting, Depero and Balla conceived a new, consolidated object named the "plastic complex." This new object was no longer subjected to the laws of nature; it was the product of an "artificial optimism," of the need to deal with and tame the dissolving forces of the milieu. Penned by the two artists in 1915, the manifesto <span style="font-style:italic;">Futurist Reconstruction of the Universe</span> contains an astonishing formulation of this intention: "The inventor of words-in-freedom Marinetti, to whom we showed our first plastic complexes, had told us with a great enthusiasm: art, before us, was a remembrance, the anguished evocation of the lost object (happiness, love, landscape), that is why it was nostalgia, statism, pain, distance. With futurism, on the contrary, art becomes art-action, which means will, optimism, aggression, possession, penetration, joy, brutal reality in art (for instance: onomatopoeia; bruitors = motors), geometric splendour of forces, projection ahead. So art becomes Presence, New Object, new reality created with the abstract elements of the universe. The hands of the passeist artists were suffering for the lost object, our hands were trembling with anxiety for the new object to create."<sup><a name="f77-text" href="#f77">77</a></sup> The plastic complexes of Balla and Depero were assemblages <span style="font-style:italic;">avant la lettre</span>, fabricated with various materials and endowed with movement. The two Futurists were convinced that this sensorial multiplicity and objectness liberated them from the "trap" of representation, doomed to be, through its mediated character, an endless "mourning" of the lost object. Eric Michaud argues that the subjective decision to adopt and furiously extend the destructive work of reality through the conversion of the passive loss of the loved object to its active and perfectly deliberate destruction was fundamental to the avant-gardes in general and to Futurism in particular. Following the analysis of Sigmund Freud, Michaud theorizes the mechanism of melancholy's conversion to mania inherent in several moments of modern art.<sup><a name="f78-text" href="#f78">78</a></sup> For Futurists, the "New Object" was a metaphor of the "New Subject," called to put an end to the narrow, psychological "I" and to the mourning of its lost certainties.

<p>In his luminous critique of the anthology <span style="font-style:italic;">Krieg und Krieger</span>, Benjamin claims that the mystical interpretations of the war in Germany, followed by the mystical interpretations in 1918 of the defeat and of the Revolution, contributed to the formation and consolidation of Fascism. When they had not participated directly in its development, as it was the case with Futurists in Italy and Ernst Jünger in Germany, the several mystical interpretations of history had at least inhibited, through their idealism, material(ist) awareness. According to Benjamin, this awareness was indispensable to the t against Fascism. The philosopher points out an interesting paradox: the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fronterlebnis</span>, although praised for its radical and baptismal character, was always presented in an abstract and hollow manner. The hyperbolic style expressed the ontological nothingness of the sublime experience of the trenches. Being nothing concrete in itself, having no materiality of its own, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fronterlebnis</span> turned out to be nothing and everything. In standing independently from any kind of historicity—for instance, the historicity inherent in the technical modes of the production of war—, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Fronterlebnis</span> of Ernst Jünger could pretend that it had known the war <span style="font-style:italic;">in itself</span>, both primitive and eternal. It is exactly the same mechanism of erasing history in favour of ideology that commanded the Futurist <span style="font-style:italic;">Fronterlebnis</span>. In this regard, the contradiction between the vitalist praise of the body in battle and the real conditions of the industrial war, imposing its demate-rializing effects on this same body, is very telling. The same contradiction can also be detected between Futurist discourse and image, since many synthetic visions of the war, be it Marinetti's or Carrà's, which were influenced by maps and aerophotography and combined abbreviated <span style="font-style:italic;">parole in libertà</span> with abstract forms, translated the condensed, rational spirit of the war that left so little place for personal initiative and engagement.</p>
<p>After the German defeat and the outbreak of social violence, few Expressionists were ready to revisit their previous idealism. Much more receptive to Marxism, Pfemfert and Einstein adopted henceforth a strongly materialist criticism of the political and social situation in Germany. The majority of Expressionists—writers, painters and architects—adopted an attitude that in all probability no one describes better than Walter Benjamin: "To have waged war out of their innermost existence is something that other peoples could claim to have done. But to have lost a war out of their innermost existence, this they cannot claim. What is special about the present and latest stage in the controversy over the war, which has convulsed Germany since 1919, is the novel assertion that it is precisely this loss of the war that is characteristically German."<sup><a name="f79-text" href="#f79">79</a></sup> The "specifically German" characteristic was not a substantial quality but a concrete historical reaction, namely "the effort to pervert the German defeat into an inner victory by means of confessions of guilt which were hysterically elevated to the universally human. This political position, which supplied the manifestoes for the course of the decline of the West, faithfully reflected the German 'revolution' made by the Expressionist avant-garde."<sup><a name="f80-text" href="#f80">80</a></sup> Architectural utopias' message of universal peace, Expressionists' Christian call for love, Bauhaus' criticism of the demonic effects of mechanism: these are only some of the reactions that aimed not only to neutralize but  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> also to reverse the dynamic of German defeat.<sup><a name="f81-text" href="#f81">81</a></sup> The question of knowing whether or not German architects and artists would have adopted the same critical and negative vision of the machine if they had won the war is certainly absurd as an anecdote, but it is meaningful and suggestive in its virtual and open form. Also, instead of looking for the causes of the war in Germany's economical and political structures, idealist artists and architects made of materialism the main—and even the only—event accountable for the war. Materialism was nonetheless universal and not specifically German. In other words, responsibility was not a geographical and thus a national matter, but a temporal and consequently a universal one. Responsibility was a matter of <span style="font-style:italic;">Zeitgeist</span>. Even better, many artists and architects conceived of the noblest projects for the German nation: applying the well known Christian precept according to which "the last will become the first," several Expressionists, such as Walter Gropius and Bruno Taut, formulated the idea according to which the material weakness and humiliation of Germany ultimately endowed it with the reversed vocation to become spiritually rich and proud.<sup><a name="f82-text" href="#f82">82</a></sup> This was the sublime reversal that Germany had to accomplish.<sup><a name="f83-text" href="#f83">83</a></sup></p>
<p>The same idealist attitude was reserved for the Revolution. Once more, the Expressionists were interested neither in the struggle of classes nor in the struggle of political parties. Of course the murder by the extreme right, on behalf of the social-democrats, of left-wing res such as Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, had sensitized a lot of painters and architects. Nonetheless, the latter still considered that all parties were equally responsible for what Gropius called "the German catastrophe" (meaning the national defeat and the social revolution). To the political revolution, which they found fatally anchored in the contradictions and inadequacies of matter, Expressionist artists opposed again and again their own "spiritual" revolution.<sup><a name="f84-text" href="#f84">84</a></sup> Bruno Taut and Walter Gropius could thus imagine mystical cathedrals. The atemporality of their utopias contrasted sharply with the conflicts of their era. Each time they drew a utopian temple, the two Expressionist architects expressed their ambition to realize the sacred union of the German People. This time, it was not by the means of war, but by the means of art.</p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f64" href="#f64-text">64. </a>Most of the predominantly German historians who have worked on Marc emphasize the notion of the Zeitgeist at the expense of that of "soil." Klaus Lankheit, Andreas Hünecke, and others have thus tried to protect Franz Marc from the nationalist accusation that his writings suggest. One should observe, however, that in a manner similar to the majority of avant-garde artists the Zeitgeist and the Volksgeist were equally important for Marc. With regard to the war, Marc of course considered  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that the main rupture to be expected was one between the materialist past and the spiritual future. Still, for him it was Germany—not France and much less England—who was able to lead the whole of Europe through this process. On this tension between nationalism and internationalism in Marc's thought in particular and in Expressionism in general, see Maria Stavrinaki, "Le prédicat selon Marc.

<div id="body">
<p>As a cosmopolitan writer and émigré with personal experience of center-periphery paradigms that unevenly shaped discourses about literary innovation in the late nineteenth century, August Strindberg (1849–1912) wrote several modernist prose works that show how locations that have later seemed marginal to European literary modernism in fact are critical to its inception. Although the full extent of Strindberg's authorial identity as transnational and bilingual was quickly suppressed in turn-of-the-century Swedish culture, and largely has been in Strindberg scholarship since then, several of his most interesting prose works engage explicitly with displacements from nation, mother tongue, and national literary traditions. The French-language narratives <span style="font-style:italic;">A Madman's Defense</span> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Le Plaidoyer d'un Fou</span>] (1888/1895) and <span style="font-style:italic;">Inferno</span>  are a case in point. Written for international audiences and first published in Berlin and Paris, respectively, these works have because of their author's nationality largely been read as "Swedish," and have thereby also been marginalized in a European modernist tradition that emphasizes contributions of continental writers. Strindberg, however, wrote in and about most of the locations he lived in during a hectic decade and a half of vagabondage around Europe. One biographer counts 27 locations of domicile in Europe during the period 1883–94, with about a dozen more during the following four years (Brandell vols. 2 and 3). Upon his permanent return to Stockholm at the end of the nineteenth-century, Strindberg turns exclusively to  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> writing in Swedish (and largely about locations in Sweden). At the same time, though, his constructions of setting turn more experimental.</p>
<p>In one of Strindberg's last fictional prose pieces, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Taklagsöl</span>] , a modern, standardized, middle-class Stockholm apartment provides the exclusive setting. The novel operates on the premise that it is the private, stationary, and (relatively) permanent location of a domestic apartment that allows for narrative experimentation—extended monologues, jumbled chronology, flashbacks, and emulation of morphine-induced, semi-conscious, first-person speech. These strategies are meant to be understood as experimental, as seeking to investigate how drugs and dying affect consciousness and the retelling of events and experiences. Attempting to portray this experience as unmediated, the narrative posits rations of direct and transparent access to the protagonist's interior. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> thus operates within a paradigm aligned with literary modernism's interiority conceit—the pretense at direct and unmediated thought transfer in novelistic form. Scholars have recognized that <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> offers a break with the more conventional approaches of Strindberg's narrative techniques and argue that the novel "can be counted among the precursors to newer novelistic techniques" (Brandell cited in Ståhle Sjönell, "Kommentarer" 168, my transl.). Others argue that it foreshadows the method "Joyce used in the triumphant ending of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>" (Lagercrantz 330; see also <a name="b27-text" href="#b27">Perelli 143</a>).<sup><a name="f1-text" href="#f1">1</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> is not an interior monologue, however. Although the vast majority of text is construed in the protagonist's first-person speech as monologues, these are inserted within a frame. This frame also contains dialogue and third-person narrative commentary.</p>
<p>What makes this novel modernist, I argue in this article, is instead the interplay between an attempt at first-person unmediated narration, modernism's interiority conceit, and the setting that allows for the experiment. The apartment setting is not an empty container waiting to be filled with narrative meaning in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>. In the novel, this setting is already mediated by specific aspects of period architectural discourse, audio and recording technology (like the graphophone and phonograph conceived as recorders and playback devices of the human voice), and transnational travel, including a rhetoric of ethnographic collecting and colonial imagination (particularly in relation to Joseph Conrad's <span style="font-style:italic;">Heart of Darkness</span>, 1902). We cannot in fact understand <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony's</span> interest in conceiving a strategy, and formulating a range of tropes (like those of audio recording and play-back technology) to relay the disordered and irrational thoughts of a dying and drugged person, without realizing that the premise for this attempt is conventional, prosaic, domestic space: a middle-class Stockholm apartment.</p>
<p>Domesticity, and by implication domestic space, has been shunned in a tradition of aesthetic modernism that emphasizes speed and movement (Thacker; Kern) or the <span style="font-style:italic;">avant-garde</span> (a military term), in which "being undomestic came to serve as a guarantee of being art" (<a name="b29-text" href="#b29">Reed 7</a>). In <span style="font-style:italic;">Modernism and the Architecture of Private Life</span>, Victoria Rosner argues instead that in English high modernism, "spaces of private life are a generative site for literary modernism," since, in fact, the "modernist novel draws a conceptual vocabulary from the lexicons of domestic architecture and interior design,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> elaborating a notion of psychic interiority, to take one example, that rests on specific ideas about architectural interiors" . In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>, the apartment is such a generative site, since the narrative shifts the framework away from a presumed marginality of certain settings, such as a standardized middle-class apartment in turn of the century Stockholm, into a specific condition for experiments with interiority conceits. The work offers an expanded notion of interiority along the lines of what Rosner argues, namely that modernism's conventional understanding of interiority is too limited in its emphasis on "the mind's ability to craft an individual reality, to live in a world exclusively populated by personal associations and memories" . The retelling of memories and associations is in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> predicated exactly on the functions, discourses of, and implications of domestic architecture and of objects contained within that space.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Interior</h1>
<p>Like in Franz Kafka's later <span style="font-style:italic;">Metamorphosis</span>  or Marcel Proust's <span style="font-style:italic;">Swann's Way</span> (begun in 1909, first published 1913), a bedroom is introduced as the point of origin for novelistic narration in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>. The main character, called the Curator, lies immobile in "sin sängkammare" ("his own bedroom") and later awakens for a moment to search "efter ett visst mönster på tapeten" (9, 14) ("after a certain pattern in the wallpaper" [<span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>, transl. Paul and Paul 3, 9]). Resembling the head of his friend the museum director, the wallpaper shape becomes an imagined interlocutor, a backdrop to the extended flashback monologues. This construction remains stable in the numerous recollections that follow, by which extended descriptions of the curator's wife's and his own apartments, for example, link the moment of narration with the interiority conceit of the flashbacks. Over several pages, the curator's first person realistic descriptions of furniture and decorations, of light falling through the windows, the garden outside, the view toward his "enemy" in the building opposite, the charting and measurements taken in preparation for the new apartment building, contrast with the notion of supposedly disordered, unmediated thought representation (17–19 [13–16]). The mediation inherent in domestic architecture and interior design emerges in full—it appears impossible, even for a drugged, feverish, and partly hallucinating protagonist, <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> to describe domestic architecture in ways that are recognizably realist. The power of spatial determination is, however, countered by linguistic markers that juxtapose the present with the past tense to locate two temporal realms in one space, the apartment: "<span style="font-style:italic;">Nu gick</span> jag ensam i våningen" (16, emphasis added) / "<span style="font-style:italic;">Now</span> I <span style="font-style:italic;">was</span> alone in that apartment" (13, emphasis added). Linguistic markers that indicate hallucinatory confusion are also spatial: The speaker interjects "<span style="font-style:italic;">Var</span> var jag?"  / "<span style="font-style:italic;">Where</span> was I? " to indicate that he has lost his narrative thread. In its first section, devoted to descriptions of apartments in seemingly unmediated first-person form, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> confirms architecture's ordering function. Spaces must be described in order for narrative function to emerge, but also departs from this model  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> by imagining a parallel universe, in which events repeat themselves and the modern apartment building creates stories as a given aspect of its location.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony's</span> many descriptions of apartments, of the architecture of private life, indicate fascination with the most common urban form of dwelling—the modern, standardized, reproducible apartment—and how the text begins close to home, in the very familiarity of a bedroom. Self-reflexively, the text ties literary representation to architecture's legibility, by which the two forms of representations become explicitly related. Events in the curator's apartment and those in the identically laid-out apartment below resemble one another, so that the parallel unraveling of the speaker's and his downstairs' neighbors' marriages propel the narration. One day, the curator recalls in a monologue, he had ample time to observe for the first time the downstairs apartment, waiting there alone for hours to place an outgoing telephone call. The apartment belongs to an architect. The curator's experiences there shape his understanding of both literary and architectural registers of meaning:</p>

<div class="attrib"></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">The curator's and the architect's rooms are identical but could not be coded more differently—both the space and the practices of the architect are coded negatively in double registers of meaning. His room is naked, cold, and empty, just as "byggnadsritningar" ("house drawings") are empty representations, not real "houses." Filled with light, the room is simultaneously unsheltered and lacking in original creativity. The architect's room is like a distorted mirror image of his own study. This image ties in with several other references to visual distortion—the curator can see the growing apartment building only through a mirror on the wall of his bedroom, while the nurse's sign of a red cross on a white background confuses him and makes him think of the Swiss flag (white cross on a red background). The cold rationality implied in the architect's space and practice contrasts with the curator's study, filled with oxymoronic "levande föremål" ("living objects"). For the curator, representations of architecture appear so abstract that they are emptied out of meaning, while he himself refers to the production  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of emotions and experiences generated by built environments, and particularly of residential buildings.</p>
<p>The experience with the architect's apartment is in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> specifically tied to literary representation, which turns the tables on a reflection theory in which experiences with certain forms of locations have an impact on the person who has experienced them. Though the architect's portrait is "vardagligt" ([characterized by] "ordinariness") and his wife's is anonymous, "en grisaille-varelse"  ("a study in grey" [22]), the curator asks whether his experience of their apartment has changed not himself, but <span style="font-style:italic;">them</span>: "Motsvarade dessa människor mina föreställningar, eller hade jag diktat om dem till oigenkännlighet? Man gör ju homunkler av de människor man icke känner, och de man känner bli spöken"  ("Did these people match my images of them, or had my imagination [had I literarily recreated them] made them unrecognizable? One makes homunculi of the people one doesn't know, and those one knows become ghosts" [26]). The confrontation with the process and site where buildings are first conceived, which comprise the work of an architect, transforms the curator's image of his own site of literary creativity; the experience turns characters from anonymous grey visages to ones with stories. Compared with what he perceives to be the architect's lonely and dreaded place, his own apartment—inhabited only by himself and decorated with inanimate objects—turns around paradoxically to become a place of organic growth—"fyllt av levande växter" ("filled with living plants"). Yet his study also serves as the site of reversal of this organic process by which exteriority becomes incorporated into interiority, exemplified by the cherished "uppstoppade djur" ("stuffed animals").</p>
<p>The location of narration—the curator's bedroom—and the domestic setting of the number of flashback stories he tells in extended first-person monologues are intrinsically connected in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>. These connections also tie the architecture of domestic life to novelistic forms of narration. In a related argument about genre expectations and Henry James' novelistic techniques, Elizabeth Boyle Machlan argues that James creates "a literary phenomenology that reveals the centrality of architectural metaphors to human understanding, and the ways in which genre not merely categorizes, but helps interpret, experiences" . <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> similarly posits that the conceit of first-person unmediated thought narration depends on architecture and functions as an attempt, extrapolating on Boyle's argument, also to take seriously "genre's taxonomic purposes as inseparable from, instead of at odds with, its hermeneutic functions" . <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> seeks to relay the function of particular locations—in this case standardized, seemingly identical, apartment dwelling—as a way to produce an unmediated interior monologue that is inseparable from its setting.</p>
<p>The curator's recollection of his architect neighbor's apartment is also coded in other ways, which indicate how architecture mediates between literary representation and its own cultural function. The natural light and naked, geometrical, and abstract features of the neighbor's apartment seem to indicate that the curator's neighbor is an architect of the modern continental European school, whose new directions—anti-ornamental, functional, ordered, pragmatic—had been clearly delineated by Otto Wagner in his  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> treatise <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Architecture</span> , published shortly after his inauguration lecture as a professor in Vienna. For Wagner and his followers around Europe, new architecture was meant to "represent our modernity, our capabilities, and our actions through forms created by ourselves," particularly in metropolitan aggregates (cited in <a name="b10-text" href="#b10">Frisby 3</a>). The curator's apartment on the other hand reflects mid-nineteenth-century bourgeois decorative ideals of domestic design, in which nature is domesticated and interiorized in the form of potted plants and stuffed wild animals, and a harsh reality blocked by heavy dark curtains. He interprets both the architect neighbor and his drawings as generic and old-fashioned, however: "Ser på hans tidningar, vars andas barn han är, att han lever omkring 1840, icke haft kraft att växa; ser på hans ritningar att han stannat vid 1860"  ("I see now by his magazines with whose spirit he is kindred, that he is living around 1840, not having had the strength to grow; see by his drawings that he has stopped at 1860" [22]). The curator ascribes plenty of importance to dwelling spaces, and <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> depends on the apartment for its narrative conration, but the ideals of modernist architecture are neither recognized nor appreciated.</p>
<p>For Wagner, new architecture should not be nostalgically historicist, but had a social role to fill that was pragmatic and which could let the practical function of the metropolis be visible to its inhabitants, for whom architecture was to be "intelligble, and by implication legible" (<a name="b10-text" href="#b10">Frisby 18</a>). His Viennese apartment buildings shun stucco decorations for flat facades; his <span style="font-style:italic;">Postsparkasse</span> building uses the required aluminium bolting as ornaments. Structure and form conjoin in Wagner's buildings, as narrative structure and setting conjoin in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>. Assumptions that underscored metaphorical connections between architecture and legibility, and between architecture and narrative, were part of the conception of residential architecture for modernist architects at the time.</p>
<p>Wagner's designs contrast with the contemporary Arts and Crafts-related, neoromantic (<span style="font-style:italic;">nationalromantisk</span>) building design in Stockholm. Gradually continental architectural ideals began to take hold also in Stockholm, especially as the Swedish capital faced a residential construction boom during the rapid expansion of the Östermalm borough—where Strindberg lived and wrote <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>—during the first decade of the twentieth century. During the period 1890 to 1915, Stockholm's population grew by 60%, from 245,000 to 392,400, and housing shortages were severe (Eriksson 426; cf. 172, 308, 426–430). This puts into relief the class-marked, if not elitist, aspects of the curator's extended descriptions of the pleasure of dwelling in spacious, light-filled, and clean apartments. His reclusive solitude, as he lies dying alone without visits from friends, his son, or former wife, stands in contrast to the crowded and dismal living arrangements of the urban poor, but forms a necessary backdrop to the text's interiority conceit. The conceit of unmediated thought transfer in an extended monologue, directed to a re in the wall paper, is also part of the ideology of modernist narration—by which supreme, exclusive, even elitist subjectivity can be conveyed through narration.</p>
<p>That critics have continued to overlook the intriguing aspect of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony's</span> interest in domestic architecture seems aligned with a predominant drive in  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> scholarship about Strindberg's prose that emphasizes identity formation and constructions of selfhood and subjectivity, along the lines of biographically influenced scholarship. The novel, however, demonstrates conceptions about the function of architecture that ties it to later European literary modernism. The most obvious way in which it does so is by refusing any other diegetic setting than the modern apartment itself. The minute section in which the plot leaves the apartment deserves closer scrutiny in this respect: "Den sjuke fördes till lasarettet i en vagn, öppnades och undersöktes, syddes igen och fördes tillbaka"  ("The patient was brought to the hospital in a wagon, was opened and examined, sewn up again, and brought home" [55]). The passage indicates that once outside the apartment, there is no access to the curator's thoughts. As a literary construction, he does not exist outside his setting. After the operation, the speed of retelling and the disparate content of the curator's recollections increase, moving from coherent reminiscing about a summertime stay at a house in the archipelago, to disassociated fragmented speech covering topics from disease, bacteria, chemical compounds, literature, personal relationships, and musical composition. The curator's operation and impending death triggers an exteriorization process that not only marginalizes spatial description, but also bars pretense at psychological coherence. Screaming in pain, propped up in bed not to drown from the fluid collected in his chest, the body's materiality takes over to the extent that "hans eget jag upplöstes"  ("his own personality was dissolved" [72]; ref Olsson 277). At the moment of death, the building opposite the curator's is completed, while the curator's imagination, unfettered by a body in pain, leaves the constraints of the apartment for dreams of pristine green meadows, sunshine, and blue water. At the moment of death, setting has come full circle—from enclosure in the bedroom in the narrative's fist sentence to a fantasy of freedom outside the modern urban environment in the last; from realistic spatial descriptions that contain a fear of losing control, to hallucinations of a pastoral disassociated from the modern apartment.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Graphophone</h1>
<p>Dying necessitates storytelling in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>. While memories spill out in the monologue sections, the third-person frame draws on the trope of audio-recording technology to contain the stories. Although domestic architecture may appear to house the mind as represented by the novel's first-person narration, the graphophone, a popular turn-of-the-century mechanical recording and playback device, is explicitly evoked as a construction used to instrumentalize the text's interiority conceit. Featuring a cylinder container, the graphophone is both a playback "talking machine" and a device whose inscription stylus "writes the voice" of the recorded. As the dying curator seeks to speak his mind in an attempted re(p)lay of unmediated interiority, he becomes coded (by the third-person frame) as such a mechanical playback device. He is presented in the first paragraph as "talande ut varje uppkommen föreställning"  ("speaking aloud every image that arose" [3]), while metaphors of recording, repetition, and transmission of memories attach to the curator's speech, as if he were a graphophone incapable  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of stopping the cylinder from rolling and words from emerging. Later "började den sjuke att spela opp igen likt grafofonen utan spärrhake"  ("the patient began again to play, like a graphophone that lacked a stop" [15]). Toward the end, the curator is completely mechanized: "När han vaknade började åter rullen i hjärnfonografen att gå; gav ifrån sig alla sista minnen och intryck, men i sträng ordning alldeles så som de blivit 'inspelade'"  ("When he awoke, the cylinder in his brain-phonograph began again to turn; it gave out all the latest memories and impressions, but in exact order, just as they had been 'recorded'" [55]), while the monologues seem to be produced by the technological device itself: "Nu släppte hakarne [ … ] så att monologen återtog sin fart"  ("Now the hooks loosened [ … ] so that the monologue picked up speed again" [70]). The curator's stories are produced by the graphofone, while contained in an apartment.</p>
<p>The actual recording device invoked in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> is most likely a cylinder-shaped device. This kind of recording and replaying device, increasingly called a graphophone, was the most popular in Europe until around 1908. Several different versions were invented and manufactured in Europe and the United States and the name, brand, and technology distinctions are almost impossible to trace completely (see Read and Welch; Gelett).<sup><a name="f2-text" href="#f2">2</a></sup><span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony's</span> terminology reflects this confusion—most often called "graphophone," it is nevertheless referred to once as a "phonograph" (48 [55]). Numerous examples of early reports on the graphophone assign agency to the device, rather than to the human voice it recorded. An 1878 article in <span style="font-style:italic;">Harper's Bazaar</span> posits that the "phonograph never speaks until it has first been spoken to. [ … ] It has no original ideas to advance [ … ]. The phonograph only consents to astonish the world at the instance of some dominant and controlling mind" (Read and Welch 22; Jewell 8–9). At the end of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>, the curator remains in his bed, and having gone without food or drink for 48 hours, approaches the stage of an automaton with words streaming out of him.</p>
<p>In the novel, seemingly unrelated metaphors increasingly take on either the shape of a cylinder or disc-shaped recording device, so that the trope of the graphophone influences the rative language in multiple registers. "Hjärnan gick som tomma kvarnstenar, kastade gnistor som ville den ta eld"  ("his brain spun around like empty millstones, throwing off sparks as though it was going to catch fire" [63]); this trope remains at the end, when the curator is described as suffering from an uncontrollable need to play back his memories: "han yrar ju; det är som att ta ur en propp ur sodaflaskan"  (he "is babbling; it's like taking the cork out of a soda bottle" [61]). In one of the last descriptions, just before dying, the third-person narrator frames the curator as interiorized, as if all content, just like the content contained in a cylinder-shaped phonograph, with its outside blankly reflecting metal and its inside containing the recording tracks: "Han uttalade [ … ] millioner, millioner ord, hela hans liv flöt ut i ord [ … ] minnet svek aldrig. De inre sinnena skärptes otroligt, allteftersom de yttre släcktes"  ("He uttered [ … ] millions upon millions of words, his whole life streamed out in words [ … ] his memory never failed him. His inner senses were unbelievably sharpened as his outer senses were extinguished" [71]). The first-person  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> monologue, increasingly disorganized, corresponds to an increasing mechanization of the speaker as he approaches death. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>'s third-person narrative frame establishes tight connections between the graphophone as a playback device and the curator's first-person monologues. It is as if this popular recording device makes the attempt at unmediated narration of interiority understandable, as if it makes it possible formally to capture.</p>
<p>The technological mediation of narration, and implicitly of human speech, is a well-known ration of high-modernist literature, and Samuel Beckett's <span style="font-style:italic;">Krapp's Last Tape</span>  provides a suggestive point of comparison with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>. Sara Danius argues in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Senses of Modernism</span> that this mediation includes the ways in which "the image of technology attaches itself to the image of death" . The curator's speech accelerates death in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>: this narrative offers no talkingcure. Mechanization drains life out of the character, whose last words come to illustrate Thomas Edison's conjecture that recording "the last words of dying persons" would be a priority application for his invention (cited in Kittler 12). <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>'s first person interiority conceit is construed along these lines as well, as the incessant talking hastens the curator's death. As a structural device, the graphophone's ration combines utterance and narrative, recording and playback, with a setting that it also domesticates: the modern, standardized, and easily reproducible apartment building.</p>
<p>At the time, the graphophone was anthropomorphized as a means to reproduce memories and thereby construe consciousness as a dynamic process. Strindberg wrote in an unpublished fragment that "Minnet reproducerar genom en Grafofon" (cited in Ståhle Sjönell, Diss. 48) ("Memory reproduces through a Graphophone" [my transl.]). This formulation echoes French philosopher Jean Marie Guyau's proposition in an essay from 1880 "to define the brain as an infinitely perfected phonograph—a conscious phonograph" ("Memory and Phonograph," quoted in Kittler 30–33; cf. Hockenjos; Ståhle Sjönell, Diss., 52). Graphophones in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> strikingly seem to produce certain experiences of space, and of creating memories seemingly of their own accord. Simple inexpensive portable graphophones were common when Strindberg wrote <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> and the very reproducibility of the device is important, as it functions both as topic and formal ration for the curator's first extended monologue: "Jo, jag hade köpt en liten grafofon för tio kronor åt min gosse till hans födelsedag"  ("Yes, I had bought a little graphophone for ten crowns, for my boy's fourth birthday" [3]). The explicit reference to spoken language, "Jo" ("Yes"), marks a linguistic connection between a spoken word and its subsequent recording. The device is first introduced as a triviality in the text, as a toy for a young child, but when the curator listens to it, the recording appears distorted. The intrusion of a loud recorded voice into his "ensamma vånining" ("lonely apartment") creates a "fasans intryck [ … ] infernaliskt" (9, 10) ("a dreadful [ghastly] impression [ … ] devilish" [10]). The voice in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony's</span> first graphophone scene is coded as haunted, as a decorporealized aural specter that both preres and eventually <span style="font-style:italic;">produces</span> the curator as a babbling, dying, mechanized shell of a human being. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Connections between the phonograph and childhood (as indicative of a temporal regression or of retraction to a naïve or authentic state) are an important part of its history and indicate the sense of spatio-temporal annihilation associated with the device. The first words ever recorded and reproduced on Edison's phonograph was the nursery rhyme "Mary had a Little Lamb" (Schwartzman 10). Strindberg also associated Edison's invention with children—he described it in a prose fragment as a toy: "Edison ej gjort guld, endast en dålig leksak: fonografen" (cited in <a name="b13-text" href="#b13">Hockenjos 127</a>) ("Edison has not made gold, only a bad toy: the phonograph" [my transl.]). Strindberg's objection to the fonograph/graphophone as a "bad toy" indicate its function in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>; it is a device that threatens to deconstruct boundaries not only between humans and machines, but also between literary innovation and convention, and between a world an individual imagines as private and one that threatens to impose itself on it.</p>
<p>In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>, the graphophone and the apartment setting are red as permeable containers that make the problems of modernism's interiority conceit tangible. <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> uses the graphophone as both metaphor and as a device intrinsic to its apartment setting, which helps contextualize modernism's interest in recording technology. In a Swedish brochure from 1901, published by a distributor of Edison's phonographs and Columbia's graphophones, the device is described as having four primary uses. These correlate thematically and structurally with the device's function and role in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>. The brochure describes the phonograph first as an entertainment device for home or domestic use, as a way to listen both to pre-recorded songs and to record the beloved voices of family and close friends for eternal preservation. The second description presents it as a concert device for a public performance, the third as an office stenographer that copies accurately and tirelessly, and the fourth as an early form of jukebox for use in a public setting, promising an excellent "return on investment" (Numa Petersons Handels &amp; Fabriks-Aktiebolag).</p>
<p>In a pragmatic sense, graphophones helped mediate domestic space by bringing into a supposed private sphere the recorded voices of others, so that a public form of entertainment became interiorized within the architecture of private life. Recorded songs and novelty acts popular in Sweden at the time were often imported and recorded in other languages, particularly English and German, which related this particular form of entertainment to popular culture trends outside the borders both of a domestic space and of Sweden. Simultaneously, the graphophone is a spectacularly delocalized invention. Competing near-identical versions were developed simultaneously in the US and in Europe, with recordings not sold according to national origin or national language. Discourse about the device is remarkably similar whether conceived in America, France, Germany, or Sweden. These facets are thematically incorporated in the <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>, since the first flash back monologue explicitly connects apartment living with rations of disembodiment and displacements, as in the curator's impending death and the rations of danger and ghostly presences that haunt his wife's dwelling locations.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> introduces this mechanical device as a mediator of the traumas of domestic space—such as divorce or the discontinuation of parental-child  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> relationships. These traumas spill over to the text's metaphorical registers. Not only does the curator's wife's apartment seem inhabited by the specter of divorce, but the descriptions of their interactions echo the form and function of a graphophone repetitiously playing the same tune. A scene of marital discord seems to have "upprepats sextio gånger"  been ("repeated sixty times" [5]). Similarly, "måste tystnaden brytas, och frun i huset tog upp sina klagovisor, på välkända melodier och med text som icke var ny"  ("the silence had to be broken and the lady of the house took up her lament, to familiar tunes and with lyrics not new" [6]). Later, the protagonist describes how he rented a small summerhouse for his family in the archipelago, but it is a "spökhus"  ("a haunted house" [33]). The curator describes that the ghost appears to have an uncanny relationship to a brother he has not maintained any contact with, but upon whose yacht a "kolossal grafofon spelade upp"  ("colossal graphophone started playing" [38]). An image of a graphophone on the deck of a small sailing vessel is featured in the Numa Peterson's catalogue of grapfophones, which signals the device's portability also between different registers of textual production—from an advertising catalogue to this novel's attempts to bridge the haunting of the past with a technological device.</p>
<p>Through the ration of the graphophone, sound waves appear to transcend boundaries between different dwelling spaces—the apartment and the summerhouse—in a way that signals its close connection to functions of setting. Ghosts (a black lady and her companion) appear at the summerhouse, while scenes, marriages, and relationships (including finding anew a long-lost brother) repeat as if they were prerecorded according to a script. Similarly, the curator hears "grafofonens repertoar"  ("the graphophone's repertoire" [18]) in the apartment below, as if it were replaying a recording of his own failed marriage. The architect's wife is like a graphophone with only a limited number of tunes; her playing has stagnated into a set number of prerecorded performances: she "sitter då ensam och spelar sin begränsade repertoar"  ("is sitting alone and playing her limited repertoire" [21]). Critics have remarked on <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony's</span> interest in the graphophone, but tend to relate it to the psychology of the main character (Johannesson 247–251; Olsson 274–77). Its connections to the architecture of private life, or the ways its specific transnational qualities bridge the customary divide between public and private, have been overlooked.</p>
<p>The graphophone and the architecture of private life are thus intimately connected in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>, since both are red as premises for experiments in narration. Both include aspects of repetition as well—the curator's recollections and reminiscing repeat, as he returns again and again to retell stories only with slight variations, just as his apartment building is replicated by the construction of another one. The apartment and the graphophone thus re both as inanimate containers and mediated settings, which allow for the narrative experimentation in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>. This narrative experimentation is also an aspect of transnational modernism—like the nearly identical apartments constructed in European urban centers and the languages, discourses, and practices associated with the graphophone audio transmittal. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Colonial Ethnography</h1>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony's</span> third-person frame allows for an eerie "play-back" of the dying curator's first-person monologues contained within it. While introspective in its emphasis on dwelling spaces and recording devices (as containers and mediators of consciousness), <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> also gestures outward from its own conceits, particularly toward a late nineteenth-century culture of colonial exploration. These aspects relate to modernist literary representation of world travel, and specifically to contemporary constructions of a white European man's Congo. In this section, I discuss how <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> reflects the prominent Swedish presence in the Belgian Congo Free State around 1900, which aligns the narrative closely with contemporary Scandinavian colonial and ethnographic discourse, as well as with Joseph Conrad's short novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Heart of Darkness</span> (1899, first published in book form in 1902). Transnational travel, Africa, and Congo are immediately juxtaposed with the stationary apartment setting of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>. The curator's first monologue includes references to his "Kongovistelse"  ("stay in Congo" [7]), which is reffirmed in the third-person frame. When the nurse studies his face, for example, she sees "spår av Afrika"  ("trace[s] of Africa" [9]) and perceives his strong jaws to illustrate, in typical colonial rhetoric, "den starke mannens okänslighet för egna och således också för andras lidanden"  ("the strong man's indifference to his own, and thus to others', suffering" [9]). Further described as a hunter, fisherman, sportsman, Africa-traveler, and seaman (13 [9]), the third person narrator affirms that the curator's reputation as a trophy hunter of humans in Africa, where he used to "samla hjärnor"  ("collect [ … ] brains" [28]), has followed him back to Stockholm. The source of his enmity with the man in the apartment building opposite his own, called "gröna ögat"  ("Green-Eye" [28]), is a business venture gone sour during their stay in "Kongostaten"  ("the Congo State" [28]). Perhaps, the curator speculates, the Green Eye, whose Congo flag he sees from his bedroom, orchestrated the accident that caused a horse to kick him unconscious (28 [30]). The Congo is present in the apartment, as the curator's speech brings up the location and the third-person frame affirms its importance.</p>
<p>The connections between the curator and Congo are manifest as connected explicitly with apartment dwelling in Stockholm; this is where the curator and his fellow Congo traveler are ending their days. The curator in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> has decorated his apartment with ethnographic objects, collected from his world travels. One striking passage intertwines his apartment and Africa explicitly. A lion's skin is placed as a centerpiece of the protagonist's parlor, right in the center of the apartment's big room. "På salsgolvet låg min lejonhud, jag hade själv skjutit djuret; denna begagnade vi förr som gräsmatta"  ("On the floor of the room lay my lion pelt, an animal I had shot myself; this, we had formerly used as our lawn" [14]). Described as a "trofé"  / "trophy" , the lion's skin complements the curator's prized stuffed animals. The remnants of a wild feline are domesticated and incorporated into the bourgeois apartment's interior, just as Africa becomes a manicured front lawn outside a generic Stockholm apartment in a reversal of colonialism's geography. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Drifting into drugged semi-consciousness, the curator's monologues address more and more directly the transgressions involved in his presence there. Having at first accepted as complimentary Stockholm rumors about his being a human trophy hunter as "snobbigt, urstyvt"  ("chic and very clever" [62]), his remarks indicate that colonial exploration and exploitation in turn-of-the-century Swedish scientific and academic culture still held quite a bit of cachet—the curator is, after all, imagining himself as speaking to a museum director. After a new shot of morphine, however, traumatic memories emerge from "det där med Kongo! Jag har aldrig jagat mänskor, fastän jag samlat hjärnor"  ("that Congo business. I have never hunted men, though I have collected brains" [62]). But the curator is dying alone, likened to an automaton-mannequin, and functioning like a recording device that repeats the discourse of colonial rhetoric but lacks any agency, as he remains immobile in his bedroom.</p>
<p>The multiple references to Africa relate <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> to Sweden's longstanding involvement in Congo from the early 1880s onward, including representations in Swedish publications and ethnographic exhibitions. "Congo" was a term widely used in Sweden at the time, but as a geographical delimitation it referred primarily to parts of what became in 1885 L'État Indépendant du Congo, the personal property of King Leopold II of Belgium. Roughly translated as the Congo Free State, the region remained under King Leopold's supreme and tyrannical rule until 1908. The establishment of this state in Bismarck's international conference in 1884 was not a national colonial project, but was framed officially in Sweden and elsewhere in Europe as an international civilization project, through which it was "alla civiliserade staters' plikt och möjlighet att motarbeta arabernsa slavhandel, sprida kristendom och höja utvecklingsnivån" (cited in Reinius Gustafsson 11; cf. Hochschild) ("the duty and possibility of all civilized nations to t the Arab slave trade, evangelicize, and increase progress" [my transl.]). The atrocities committed in the Congo Free State have been well documented. Swedes and Scandinavians began playing significant roles in Congo in the early 1880s, when Sweden, still governing Norway in a union until 1905, had no other colonies, nor any official involvement in Congo. Nevertheless, at the end of the nineteenth century, Scandinavians were the third largest group present in Congo after Belgians and Italians (Reinius Gustafsson 11).</p>
<p>Swedes in Congo generally belonged to one of four groups. The first comprised seamen, skippers, or administrators on the Congo river or in settlements; the second evangelical or Baptist missionaries; the third officers in King Leopold of Belgium's army; and the fourth, explorers in service of the 'scientific' expeditions that charted the last blank spots on the map of Africa. The two first groups were the largest. Skippers and seamen from the Scandinavian countries were so prominent on the river, sought after for dependability and expertise, that they were described in 1905 as the group of people that had made the Belgian conquest of Congo possible (Jenssen-Tusch 184). The captain on board the first ship that takes Marlowe up the Congo river in <span style="font-style:italic;">Heart of Darkness</span> is indeed only called "a Swede" , which represents his anonymity; he is one of many working the river, a witness of and complicit in the colonial exploitation. This Swede is one of the first to voice a critical opinion in Conrad's novel. With  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> "considerable bitterness," the Swede complains about the "[f]ine lot, these government chaps" . That Conrad describes this Swedish skipper as critical of the Belgian rule probably has less to do with any particular Swedish individual in the river business on the Congo, and more to do with the Swedish evangelical missionary E.V. Sjöblom, who in 1896–97 had written in English several highly critical eye-witness reports about the atrocities committed in Congo in the name of "civilization." In the essay "Startling News from the Dark Congo," published in the US and in Britain, as well as in letters, reports, and memoirs, Sjöblom referred extensively to the inhuman conditions of the rubber extraction industry and the violations committed by Belgian forces in the Congolese-Arab war in 1891–94. Sjöblom spoke at the Aborigines' Protection Society in London in May of 1897, an event covered in British press and followed by an editorial in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Times</span> (Axelsson 224–227; cf. Lindqvist 18, 27). Although Conrad had personal experience of Congo from his tour in 1890, his descriptions of violence, butchering, and cannibalism were most likely influenced by subsequent reports, like those of Sjöblom, which claimed in the British press that the atrocities were less indicative of native Congolese practices than those of their oppressors who meant to intimidate them (<a name="b8-text" href="#b8">Brantlinger 280–81</a>). That Kurtz-res—renegade European warlords—were a prominent ration of the Western presence in Congo is supported by <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony's</span> casual description of the curator as a grim-faced hunter of brains. It is unlikely that Strindberg by the time he wrote <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> in early 1906 had read Conrad's <span style="font-style:italic;">Heart of Darkness</span>, published in book form in 1902 and only translated into Swedish in 1949. Instead, the novella's explicit ration of a Swedish presence in Congo most likely had other roots.</p>
<p>Swedish seamen and missionaries were not the only prominent foreign group in the Congo state. Swedish officers participated either directly or indirectly in King Leopold's project, often invited to do so by the Belgian consul von Schwerin in Stockholm, a member of the Swedish nobility. In 1883–1886, four officers traveled through Congo in close association with the Belgian army, as described in the two-volume extensive collection of notes called <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Years in Congo</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">Tre år i Kongo</span>) (Möller et al), published in 1887. At the height of the Congolese-Arab war, during which many of the accusations of cannibalism, violence, butchering, and inhuman conditions began to spread more widely in Europe, the Swedish officer Axel Svinhuvud signed up to serve a three-year <span style="font-style:italic;">terme</span> in king Leopold's official army "La Force Publique." In his memoirs, Svinhuvud describes how he led battles against villagers in Congo's southeastern jungles, but denies any allegations that the Belgian army behaved in any way cruelly toward the Congolese population. Yet one evening several of his own troops bring him a sack "ur vilket rullade inte mindre än sju avhuggna huvuden. Även många andra sådana exempel skulle jag kunna berätta, men jag avstår härifrån."  ("out of which rolled no less than seven decapitated heads. I could tell stories about many other related examples, but I refrain from doing so here" [my transl.]). Not objecting to practices like these, Svinhuvud receives in 1897 L'ordre Royal du Lion, the Congo State's highest medal, as well official recognition by the Swedish king (Svinhuvud 254).</p>
<p>Sweden's and Scandinavia's connections to Congo ran along multiple social, cultural,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and geographical lines—from the royal family and nobility, to military officers, maritime working classes, and the mostly rural missionaries who had been sent from provincial congregations to Congo. Like in Conrad's <span style="font-style:italic;">Heart of Darkness</span>, fantasizes of domination, as well as actual mercenary exploitation and violent subjugation become near synonymous with Congo exploration in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>. The transnational literary modernism that is part of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>'s conceptions of literary setting, its tension between domestic architecture and Congo, for example, also relate to the specific literary forms we have come to associate with the modernist representation of the colonial experience in <span style="font-style:italic;">Heart of Darkness</span>. The two narratives share structural similarities that relate explicitly to the first-person conceit of unmediated interiority. In <span style="font-style:italic;">Heart of Darkness</span>, the frame is a first-person account rather than <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony's</span> third person. Marlowe is presented as cogently addressing a group of four listeners, whereas the curator in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> ostensibly tells his story under the influence of morphine to an imaginary interlocutor. Performative metaphors are embedded in the respective texts, in the sense that the curator describes how he reacts to accusations that he had been a cannibal in Congo and that this became a part he felt obligated to play, a role he had to perform, just as Kurtz appears to be performing with some self-reflection the part of a white explorer gone mad, in which his final words "the horror," are uttered as much to himself as to Marlowe. Similarly, the curator, like Kurtz, is a writer—he describes how he might have "diktat om" (26 [26]) "literarily reconstructed" (my literal transl.) his downstairs's neighbors; Kurtz has written an account of his experiences that seem to have transformed the image of himself into a mouth-piece for a ruthless colonial project that legitimizes the exploitation. The main character of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> is, moreover, ambiguous also in terms of identification, which is exactly how <span style="font-style:italic;">Heart of Darkness</span> has been perceived (ref Brantlinger). As a re, the curator is both Kurtz (collector of brains) and Marlowe (a witness who retells his innocence), while his selfimage is ultimately deconstructed at the end of the novella.</p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony's</span> deliberate juxtaposition of the apartment in Stockholm and the curator's Congo experiences illustrates transnational European phenomena that also associate Congo with a highly specific form of exoticization. That form involves the ethnographic collections brought back to Scandinavia from Congo. The officer Svinhuvud describes in his memoirs with pride how his "stora vackra samling etnografiska föremål"  ("large beautiful collection of ethnographic objects" [my transl.]) has survived intact the five month ocean passage; the curator of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> cherishes his lion skin and his reputation as a trophy hunter. Bringing back ethnographic collections from Congo to Scandinavia was a well-established and legitimate practice at the time. Since 1880, 400 individual collections and nearly 40,000 objects have been received or accepted by Scandinavian ethnographic museums; in total probably around 50–60,000 objects have come from Congo to the North (Tygesen and Waehle 8). <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> is in fact closely aligned with this practice. The main character's title is curator, and he speaks at length to his friend the museum director, whom he imagines present in the room. These terms relate to a specific scientific culture in Stockholm at the end of the nineteenth-century, during a period when geographical  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> exploration and the ethnographic preservation of objects collected around the world gained increasing public presence (cf. Ljungström).</p>
<p>The long-standing Scandinavian engagement in Congo came into widespread public awareness for the first time in the summer of 1907, during the four-month exhibit called "Etnografiska missionsutställningen" ("The Ethnographic Missionary Exhbit") held at the Royal Academy of Science in Stockholm and sponsored by the National Museum of Natural History. The exhibit included more than ten thousand (10,000) objects from around the world, but the primary emphasis was on objects collected by Swedish missionaries in Congo (Reinius Gustafsson 10). The young explorer and scientist Erland Nordenskiöld, head of the ethnographic division of the Natural History Museum, had begun encouraging the two largest Swedish missionary groups in 1905 to think actively about ethnographic representation of foreign cultures in Sweden and to bring back objects that could form the basis of an independent ethnographic museum in Sweden (Reinius Gustafsson 7). The exhibit coincided with the first publication in Swedish of Sjöblom's memoirs from his experiences during the Congolese-Arab war, the missionary K.A. Laman's extensive description of the Congolese language and life, and a collection of descriptions of Congolese stories, tales and, linguistic features edited by Nordenskiöld. Nordenskiöld explains in the preface to this collection that missionaries, in fact, were uniquely qualified to understand and describe foreign cultures, since they in most cases had a better understanding than the temporarily visiting scientific explorer.</p>
<p>With these projects, Nordenskiöld attempted to bridge the wide gap in Swedish culture regarding Congo, in which official Sweden (including the King as the primary sponsor of the Royal Academy of Science), academics, explorers, and military officers, were often critical of missionary activities and regarded the popular culture of the missions with a great deal of suspicion (Axelsson 215). In the Swedish establishement, there were strong proponents of the white colonial masculinity project of mercenary exploitation, whether in the form of scientific exploration or military careers. Encouraging active participation of missionary culture in a national exhibit was thus controversial, not least because official Sweden for so long had neglected to acknowledge the transgressions of the Belgian regime. The curator of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> must be understood as part of, or at least desiring to be part of, this official conservative movement. He self-identifies with the legacy of the "courageous" explorer who takes pride in accusations of being a trophy hunter of human brains, and for whom a stay in Congo was to be understood as a means to both monetary compensation and an academic career. This career does not materialize for the curator in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>, which he explains as caused by his violation of decorum in the academic hierarchy, rather than as a result of questionable practices in Congo.</p>
<p>Strindberg wrote <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> during the period January to March 1906 and the novella was first published in installments in the popular weekly magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Hvar 8:e dag</span> during the summer of 1906; in book form, the work was published at the end of 1907. Any direct influence from the Ethnographic exhibit in 1907 is thus ahistorical. As contemporary events, the exhibit and the novella—aimed in its installment version for a broad and popular audience—align to show the conflicted status of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> colonial representation in Sweden, however. Reports about the Belgian violations were prominent in the European press by then, and international public opinion against King Leopold's venture had become so strong in 1908 that he was forced to relinquish his personal control of Congo to the Belgian government. As the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">Heart of Darkness</span> in book form in 1902 shows, Congo had a strong transnational presence as the source of both fantasizes and fears of white colonial rule in Africa. That same year, Harald Jenssen-Tusch, the brother of a Danish military officer killed in Congo, began publishing his periodical <span style="font-style:italic;">Scandinavians in Congo</span> [<span style="font-style:italic;">Skandinaver i Kongo</span>] at the prestigious Gyldendals press in Copenhagen. Thirty-three issues were published in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark until 1904, when they were collected in two large volumes and published in book form in January 1905. The publication, Jenssen-Tusch writes, is dedicated to the 922 Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish men and women who since 1880 have served in Congo, and is intended to commemorate their contributions to the civilization process of Congo, as well as providing an overview of the history, practices, languages, and customs of Congo. Jensen had not himself visited Congo but draws on a number of primary sources that include interviews with former visitors, such as Svinhuvud and Ebonne Sjöblom, the missionary's wife, as well as the standard international sources on Congo, such as Stanley's <span style="font-style:italic;">In Darkest Africa</span>  and the official publications of the Belgian government in Brussels. In the addendum to the collected volume, Jenssen-Tusch affirms that any allegations that the Belgians have mistreated any Africans "mangle fodfaeste" (ii) ("are without source"[my transl.]).</p>
<p>In December of 1904, <span style="font-style:italic;">Scandinavians in Congo</span> is reviewed in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ymer</span>, the official journal of "The Swedish Association of Anthropology and Geography." Both Nordenskiöld and von Schwerin, the Belgian consul in Stockholm, were members of the board of this association; this is also exactly the kind of Stockholm-based academic association that a re like the curator of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> would have desired to be a member of. The review of <span style="font-style:italic;">Scandinavians in Congo</span> in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ymer</span> is overwhelmingly positive. Described as objective and impartial, the reviewer lauds the work for three main reasons. First, the work fills an important public information gap, since, with the exception of small notices in the papers about individuals who have signed up to serve a <span style="font-style:italic;">terme</span>, died of fever, been devored by a crocodile or "en segerdrucken kannibal" (<a name="b35-text" href="#b35">Stenfelt 412</a>) ("a victorious cannibal" [my transl.]), little information about recent developments in the Congo state has previously been available. Second, the work introduces for the first time the number of people who have served in Congo without any previous official recognition, who, unlike well-known Scandinavian explorers like Sven Hedin, Fridtiof Nansen, or Axel Nordenskiöld, have only been known "i en trängre krets av vänner"  ("among a smaller group of friends"). Third, the work allows the reader to immerse himself in the Congo experience, as if he himself were making the journey from Belgium to Central Africa: "så spirituellt och naturtroget skildrad, att man omöjligt kan föreställa sig, att den berättas i andra hand"  ("so imaginatively and realistically told, that one can hardly imagine that it is told in second hand"). A story of this kind is what Marlowe tells his audience in <span style="font-style:italic;">Heart of Darkness</span>; the connections to a culture of exploration and of scientific missions around the world tie the review to Strindberg's  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> geographical location at the time of writing <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>. Nordenskiöld's interest in the ethnographic exhibition of 1907 signals an increasing awareness of the transnational as political, offering academic circles different perspectives than the exoticized colonial fantasy of Congo that also permeates the representation of the curator's experiences in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>.</p>
<p>The apartment setting in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> is part of an aggregate of transnational locations that tie the novella's modernist experiments in narrative technique with emergent ethnographic recording practices. In the first issue of Jenssen-Tusch's <span style="font-style:italic;">Scandinavians in Congo</span>, two particular explorers are mentioned—Dr. Falkenstein and Dr. Nachtigal (5, 7, 8). Both were German explorers in Congo in the late 1870s, around the time of Stanley's expeditions there. Falkenstein and Nachtigal are also the names of the graphophone recordings the curator plays, although no such actual titles of recordings have been found (Ståhle Sjönell, "Kommentarer" 185). The two names, Falkenstein and Nachtigal, reappear in the narrative, however. Then they function explicitly as memory triggers. Like the stuffed animals and the lion's skin, these two names connect the curator's immobility in his apartment with Congo. The names also serve as historical references that transcend the fictional universe of the novella—Strindberg had likely come across them in the first issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Scandinavians in Congo</span>. Reinscribed in Strindberg's narrative as titles of graphophone recordings, the names correlate ethnographic preservation and recording techniques with modernist literary strategies. In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> the graphophone, as discussed above, serves as a rative container of consciousness, memory, and a first-person narrative interiority conceit. As a technological device, the graphophone mediates the literary form with other forms of ethnographic representations that are both modernist and transnational. Around this time, the graphophone began to be used extensively for ethnographic music recordings all over the world, as Brady shows in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Spiral Way</span>. Reliable and dependable, the mechanical graphophone became a standard feature also in Swedish ethnographic expeditions in the first decades of the 20<sup>th</sup> century (Boström). Although it is not entirely clear whether audio recordings were part of the exhibit in 1907, the <span style="font-style:italic;">desire</span> to expand the ethnographic representation of foreign cultures beyond written reports or two-dimensional visuality (drawings and photographs) was clearly manifest in the exhibits use of objects and a large model of a Congolese village for example. That desire is also an important aspect of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span>.</p>
<p>The transnational gestures of <span style="font-style:italic;">Roofing Ceremony</span> thus extend far beyond Strindberg's legacy as a "Swedish" writer, or the setting as a generic apartment in "Stockholm," to include a wider narrative paradigm that tie Strindberg's prose composition to European prose modernism. Incorporating to some extent the author's experiences as a transnational writer who has returned to settle permanently in the capital of his native country, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> becomes an important contemporary counterpart to Conrad's <span style="font-style:italic;">Heart of Darkness</span>. Conrad's native language was Polish, his second language French, and through his world travels and a literary career in English, Conrad self-identified as a transnational writer. Strindberg's experimental prose is important not only in a Swedish context, but also for situating his modernist prose experiment in a European context  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that also included the narratives, sometimes lauded to a near-mythological level of the Scandinavian explorers who were Strindberg's contemporaries. The most prominent include Sven Hedin, Frithiof Nansen, S.A. Andrée, and Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld. The main character of <span style="font-style:italic;">Roofing Ceremony</span> was once a (failed) explorer and is now a museum curator, and thereby engaged in the collecting, preserving, and classifying of artifacts, rather than in the active exploration of new locations. As such, the character conjures up the strong ethnographic and anthropological interest of late nineteenth-century Scandinavia, a movement in which Strindberg participated very extensively during the 1880s. The tension in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> between stasis and movement, between containers and actions, between recording devices and memories, thus also resonates on the level of near-suppressed references to world-travels, explorations, and transnational movement in the narrative. While Scandinavian explorers like Hedin and Nansen became world famous during their lifetime, and Hedin, in particular, very rich, Strindberg did not. The main character of lies immobile in his apartment, "imprisoned," it would seem, and soon to be buried. <span style="font-style:italic;">Roofing Ceremony</span>'s narrative constructions, however, gesture toward an expansive, transnational, intertextual, and meta-critical complexity. Not only does this narrative give an alternate perspective to Strindberg's experience of a static life in Stockholm upon his return there from many years of vagabondage around Europe, but arguably also offers a model for understanding anew the importance of the domestic as a critical location for European modernism.</p>
<p>We would be mistaken in thinking that the apartment setting of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> is a stable, passive container waiting to be filled with formal experimentation, however. Reifying the notion that it is architecture that contains the attempted firstperson representation of a dying consciousness would cement the opposition between public and private that Strindberg and European modernism seek to deconstruct. Indeed, the novella offers multiple ways of understanding how the construction of setting is <span style="font-style:italic;">also</span> mediated. Architectural discourses, technologies of audio recording and playback, and colonialism and ethnographic presentation transcend in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Roofing Ceremony</span> constructions of architectural stability in the "suppressed" domestic setting and of national demarcation, construing modernism's narrative interiority conceit as always located within and constructing the setting which it seeks to transcend. Without an understanding of setting, we cannot understand European modernism. Neither can we begin to grasp the contributions of Strindberg as a transnational writer.</p>

<h1 class="sec-headA">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados:</span> from Joyce to Herbert Ashbury</h1>
<p>In 1935, Jorge Luis Borges published his <span style="font-style:italic;">Historia universal de la infamia</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">A Universal History of Infamy</span>) with Tor, the popular Buenos Aires publishing house. With its cheap editions and graphic, color-saturated covers, Tor was a natural choice for this motley collection of capsule biographies of tricksters, assassins, and thugs from different parts of the globe. Here, Mark Twain's <span style="font-style:italic;">Life on the Mississippi</span> was juxtaposed with Sir Percy Skye's <span style="font-style:italic;">A History of Persia</span>; Argentine and New York gangsters volleyed for attention within a single, slender story. On one hand, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Universal History of Infamy</span> stages what will become Borgesean signatures; in the lack of hierarchy and sense of accumulation that organizes the stories, for example, it anticipates his beloved encyclopedia. On the other hand, this minor work represents not only his first attempt at fiction, but also his most sustained engagement with mass media, both popular journalism and Hollywood films.<sup><a name="f3-text" href="#f3">3</a></sup> If, that is, the collection anticipates the globally-renowned writer of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> erudite essays and speculative <span style="font-style:italic;">ficciones</span>, it also represents a unique moment in his own relationship to writing, the market, and the materials of a burgeoning culture industry.<sup><a name="f4-text" href="#f4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Before being gathered together and published in 1935 by Tor, the majority of these stories had been published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados</span> ("Multicolor Saturday Magazine"), a cultural supplement of <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span>, a newspaper that proudly proclaimed on its masthead "Largest South American circulation." A singular force in modern Argentine culture, <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span> was responsible for publishing many of the interwar period's most famous writers, as well as incorporating into its elastic form a wide swath of genres, modalities, and geographic and historical referents. Borges not only published frequently in the newspaper's Saturday supplement from 1933–1934, he also co-directed it during those same years, and it is this dual role—as author and as producer, as it were—that I wish to explore here.</p>
<p>In his Prologue to the first edition, Borges diagnoses the formal strategies of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History of Infamy</span>: "Certain techniques are abused: mismatched lists, abrupt transitions, the reduction of a person's entire life to two or three scenes."<sup><a name="f5-text" href="#f5">5</a></sup> This list describes not only specific elements of the stories, it also gestures at the context of their initial publication. <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span>, their mass culture incubator, is characterized by just these elements: the composition of visual images saturated with colors; the "reductive" mode of its layout, privileging brevity over a sense of profundity; "mismatched" juxtapositions of spaces and times which lack, per modern journalism, connection to each other. Further cut up by subsections that bear the material trace of their presence in the Saturday supplement, the stories, like the publication in which they emerged, also borrowed from the emergent aesthetic of the cartoon, an effect further heightened by the color illustrations that initially framed them. As though to acknowledge and exploit this material position within the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span>, in them Borges draws extravagantly from popular culture, including Eduardo Gutiérrez's pulpish <span style="font-style:italic;">gaucho</span> tales, Herbert Asbury's <span style="font-style:italic;">Gangs of New York</span>, and the films of Josef Von Sternberg.</p>
<p>Such strategies echo the project of <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span> to both tap into and shape emergent publics through the modalities and velocities of modern print culture.<sup><a name="f6-text" href="#f6">6</a></sup> In fact, Borges' writings from the 1930s represent a moment in which he wrote for radically different publications and publics: from Victoria Ocampo's <span style="font-style:italic;">Sur</span>, which introduced Latin American readers to Faulkner and Woolf, with its vision of an international community of elite intellectuals; to the pages of <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica;</span> passing through the women's magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">El hogar</span> and even a publication sponsored by the Buenos Aires subway system. In short, this is a moment in which Borges directly and frequently experiences the contingency integral to modern print journalism.<sup><a name="f7-text" href="#f7">7</a></sup> His experimentation with different approaches, styles, and media, was profoundly linked to broader changes occurring in the rapidly expanding cultural milieu of early-twentieth-century Buenos Aires. Throughout the decade, he would test out different versions of his author-re, merging high and low, transporting materials from one context to the next. He successfully lobbied a reluctant Ocampo to let him write review of popular Hollywood films, for example, which began to appear in the third issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sur</span>. In this role, he reviewed, among others, Von Sternberg's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Docks of New York</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Morocco</span> .<sup><a name="f8-text" href="#f8">8</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Within Borges studies, this also represents a relatively undertheorized moment in his oeuvre. While he produced no "major work" during his lifetime—indeed, his writings critique this concept—this is doubly true for his 1930s texts. These are not readily understood vis-a-vis his earlier works of avant-garde poetry (especially <span style="font-style:italic;">Fervor de Buenos Aires</span>, 1923), nor his later, consecrated <span style="font-style:italic;">El jardin de senderos que se bifuran</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">The Garden of Forking Paths)</span>, later subsumed into <span style="font-style:italic;">Ficciones</span> (1941, 1944). Certainly, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History of Infamy</span> has not received the attention of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ficciones</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">El Aleph</span>, the collections that show Borges at his most confident, with stories polished to generate both narrative and speculative interest. In general, the text has tended to be read in terms of transition—as a gateway or threshold to the fully realized Borges. To read the work retrospectively, writes one critic, "is 'to recognize his voice' when this voice was still a sketch."<sup><a name="f9-text" href="#f9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Indeed, the idea of practice, of the <span style="font-style:italic;">essay</span>, is central to my reading of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History of Infamy</span>, as well as to Borges' 1930s production more broadly. Yet, rather than think of the text teleologically, as a way station to the more compelling stories and essays that he will write in the 1940s and 1950s, I want to pause on the conditions of production, the text's engagement with its own "inevitable" historicity through the materials of mass culture, as well as its insistence that any writing and reading practice is indelibly bound up with the thick and messy particulars of context. As I hope to show, moreover, this text represents not only a point of inflection in Borges' oeuvre—itself shifting and highly experimental, in the most material sense of the word, during this period—but also an opportunity to theorize late modernism in Argentina, the strategies and practices forged in the wake of the earlier avant-gardes.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>As Julio Ramos has shown in his reading of José Martí, the emergence of modern, autonomous literature in Latin America is indelibly connected to the new language of journalism. For Ramos, Martí's journalistic writing speaks to the fragmentation of modern, urban life and, simultaneously, to the desire to shore up against these changes through an assertion of the autonomy of the literary: "The newspaper not only erects <span style="font-style:italic;">the new</span> (the <span style="font-style:italic;">other</span> of traditional temporality) as a principle for organizing its themes … it also <span style="font-style:italic;">delocalizes</span>—even in its graphic layout of material—the communicative process," Ramos writes; "the newspaper achieved with its layout and ordering of language what the city was doing with its traditional public spaces."<sup><a name="f10-text" href="#f10">10</a></sup> By the time Borges began to work as an editor for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados</span>, the language of journalism and the newspaper's motley and non-hierarchal arrangement of information had long since been consolidated. Indeed, <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span> finds a key precedent in the magazine <span style="font-style:italic;">Caras y caretas</span> (1898–1941), which up to that point had been the most modern, and colorful, periodical in Argentina. The scope of its distribution, however, coupled with its striking page layouts and graphics, marks <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span> as unique; as its Saturday supplement, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span> was to be folded into this larger effort, with Borges at its helm. Deeply involved in the process of selecting, editing, writing, and laying out the pieces that comprise this strange admixture of high and low, avant-garde and mass culture, he implicitly credits the Saturday supplement as a kind of education—a <span style="font-style:italic;">taller</span>, or workshop, for literature in the wake of the earlier avant-gardes. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>His contemporary and friend Ulyses Petit de Murat has described in detail their collaboration on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span>. According to Petit de Murat, <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span>'s charismatic owner, Natalio Botana—"the William Randolph Hearst" of 1920s and 1930s Argentina<sup><a name="f11-text" href="#f11">11</a></sup>—had hired him to direct the supplement and to search for a collaborator. Apparently, Botana was initially hesitant to approve Petit de Murat's nomination of Borges for this role; although an admirer of his work, he thought him too erudite and removed from the "sense of the popular pulse" that <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span> was supposed to simultaneously embody and shape.<sup><a name="f12-text" href="#f12">12</a></sup> Linked to poetry, an anachronistic Buenos Aires that had little to do with the heterogeneous crowds of the city's main streets, and questions of erudition, Borges represented the antithesis of Botana's vision for the supplement, which located itself under the sign of the pleasure, brevity and velocity which characterizes modern journalism. Moreover, his collaboration with Victoria Ocampo's <span style="font-style:italic;">Sur</span> (which debuted in 1931) seemed to suggest that Borges had found his place within literary journalism in Argentina, and it was far removed from the burgeoning reading publics which Botana had in mind.</p>
<p>The first issue of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados</span>, with Borges and Petit de Murat as co-directors, debuted on September 12, 1933; over the next two years, the two writers would collaborate intensively on its production as editors, soliciting and selecting what would appear in the supplement, as well as penning various sketches and articles, correcting those of others, and working closely with those responsible for its page layout, graphic design, typography—or what has been labeled the "bibliographic code" of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span>'s first publication.<sup><a name="f13-text" href="#f13">13</a></sup> The texts they solicited, edited, and wrote are deeply inflected by the processes that produced the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span>.</p>
<p>Before detailing the practices that produced the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span>, Petit de Murat's memoir of these years takes a detour through a failed project: he describes Natalio Botana's plan to commission and publish a translation of Joyce's <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>. Botana, as Petit de Murat recounts it, had read Borges' early and partial translation of Joyce's novel in 1923.<sup><a name="f14-text" href="#f14">14</a></sup> He subsequently encouraged Botana to choose Borges for the project, facilitating the connection between newspaper magnate and modernist writer. As luck would have it, this would-be translation was not to be; by telegram they learned that the Spanish translation rights had already been granted to another writer . This description of the failure to translate Joyce resonates with a number of other Argentine modernists who, anecdotally, recall a similar invocation and then swerving away from what had become a monument of high modernism, suggesting not only the presence and influence of Joyce within a certain history of experimental Argentine literature, but also the way in which his re was employed as a means of grappling with the failure in the high modernist project to <span style="font-style:italic;">take</span>—at least in its "pure" form, amongst late modernist writers in Argentina. If Botana, Borges, and Petit de Murat had dreamed collectively of a pocket edition of Joyce in Spanish—a dream the contemporaneous novelist Roberto Arlt had proclaimed would immediately devalue Joyce's symbolic stock within intellectual circles—they would content themselves with something quite different in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span>.<sup><a name="f15-text" href="#f15">15</a></sup> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>Natalio Botana's plan for the Saturday supplement was a marriage of literary "quality" and the ability to attract a grand public. Modeling it after the works of Horacio Quiroga—a professional writer whose chronicles and horror stories during the 'teens drew upon the new media of silent film—Botana proposed a journal that would be passionately modern, connected to the latest technologies and rapidly expanding reading publics, but also shot through with literature that would not immediately be conceived as popular: "agile, sensationalist, dynamic, informed, and enjoyable" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Borges, Buenos Aires</span> 142). The <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span> mixed notices of local literary prizes with brief sketches reminiscent of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ripley's Believe it or Not</span>, stories of garish crimes, erudite theatrical reviews, and reports of unrest among railroad workers. In the pages that Borges and Petit de Murat will edit together, excerpts from dense essays of national interpretation (for example, the Brazilian Euclides da Cunha's seminal 1901 work <span style="font-style:italic;">Os sertões</span>) comingle with articles emphasizing the exotic, the grotesque, the excessive, and the eerie: "The Gypsies: a Wandering Race," or "Seven Generations of Bastards." It would seem that any description of the periodical necessarily invokes the catalog or the collage. In fact, the collection or "this-and-that" enumeration contained in such descriptions belies the sense of absolute leveling sustained by the Saturday supplement. The syntax of writing itself works against the effect of aggressive simultaneity in its pages; nothing in its lay-out or structure would indicate the differences among different types of text.</p>
<p>To examine the stories of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> in their original context is to be struck by the seamlessness with which Borges entered into—and, as editor, helped to produce—a low-brow and highly consumable collection of stories, sketches, and curiosities. In his memoir, Petit de Murat describes the malleability with which Borges adapted to a context that could not have seemed more alien. "Botana encouraged a special kind of editor: one who would go to the workspace, who knew by heart the catalog of type facing, the possibilities for titles supplied by the Ludlow [typesetting machine]. Borges had only spent time at presses where books were published, but he quickly adapted himself [<span style="font-style:italic;">se asimiló</span>] to the gigantic Hoe machines" . As editors of the supplement, the two writers spent hours at the printing press on Salta Street that specialized in color editions, forming friendships with the multiple workers involved in the various processes of type-setting, layout, and graphics that led to the journal's striking colors (140–1). Indeed, the issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">color</span> is crucial to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados</span>; it proudly invokes its saturated tones, the result of the latest technological innovations, in its very title. The graphic mixtures of mustard-yellow, cobalt blue, and smears of red of the graphics—for example, in the striking covers, some designed by the Mexican muralist David Siqueiros during his controversial stint in Buenos Aires—suggests as well a negotiation between modern art and the modern public, between the simultaneous desire to strike the reader as new and modern, while not estranging him or her.<sup><a name="f16-text" href="#f16">16</a></sup> Rather than shock or defamiliarization, a marveling at the latest technologies that could make all the news, sketches, and chronicles that appeared within its pages punchy and fascinating, "the evening habit of thousands who lived in Buenos Aires" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Borges, Buenos Aires</span> 137). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>His dual role in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span> inaugurated a shift in Borges' corpus. Out of his experiences with the Saturday supplement, the twin problems of time and labor emerge and press upon his writings. If the Borges of the 1920s had been one "who would ask for ten days to finalize a 15-line response to any survey" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Borges, Buenos Aires</span> 140), the latter would be characterized by a need to publish quickly and without nuance. The pain-staking labor of the earlier Borges, connected with the issue of free time to spend upon careful, even auratic editions of his first poems and essays, morphs into another form: that of the rapid-fire execution of mechanical reproduction. This new value of time and labor also implicates the materials of Borges' production, as well as its form: "We never dreamt that we would move from the modest, almost familial edition of our books and the small circulation of our little magazines, to a circulation like that of <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span>" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Borges, Buenos Aires</span> 144). On this reading, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span> moment constitutes a point of inflexion, in which the earlier avant-gardes' sense of a private and intimate circle, abstracted from the world, is exposed to the logic of capitalist life.</p>
<p>Yet what starts out as an imperative—a very real need to work and therefore publish in a variety of contexts and registers—becomes, for Borges, a strangely fecund moment of production. As editor, he had to think quickly, finish a page, edit in an instant an epigraph or reference to an author. If this was true for his role as an editor, it also seeped into his crafting of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History of Infamy</span>: "with a velocity he never before attained, without out the possibility of concentrating on elaborate changes (<span style="font-style:italic;">largas modificaciones</span>), Borges reads lives and then—as he himself has confessed—he modified (<span style="font-style:italic;">modificaba)</span> and distorted them according to his own fantasy, spurred on by the imperative to hand in originals."<sup><a name="f17-text" href="#f17">17</a></sup> In this description, the repeated verb <span style="font-style:italic;">modificar</span> allows us to trace this shift in Borges' writing. Unable to engage in substantial editing of his own writing, he is "consigned" to retooling the works of others, but this in itself produces a new relationship to writing, one indexed in Petit de Murat's reflection by the shift in the two uses of <span style="font-style:italic;">modificar</span>. If at first the verb described the careful labor of the <span style="font-style:italic;">vanguardista</span>, with his emphasis on the singular aesthetic experience, it now describes the engagement with the work of others, the editor contaminating the writer, all of this mediated by the increasing tempo of a burgeoning culture industry.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Late Modernism, Argentina c. 1930</h1>
<p>Petit de Murat's emphasis on mechanical reproduction, and its attendant problems of labor and the use of heterogeneous materials, allows us to further interpret the shift that Borges' writings undergo during the 1930s, and their relationship to a broader problem facing his contemporaries. This decade is not a neutral one (if such a thing exists) in Argentine history. Retrospectively, it has been framed by a group of epithets that emphasize an acute crisis and ensuing melancholy: "the decade of the suicides," "<span style="font-style:italic;">los tristes treinta</span>" ("the sad Thirties") "the years of the great funerals," and, most famously, "the infamous decade." In addition to the global economic crisis, the beginning of the decade was tinged by political violence; in what was to be a pattern throughout the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> century, a military dictatorship overthrew a democratically-elected president. Scholars have subsequently interpreted the decade as marking the end of an era defined, at least partially, by the promise of progress and, concomitantly, liberal democracy in Argentina. Not limited to the economic or political, moreover, the crisis seemed to contaminate, or perhaps dovetail with, a series of epistemological and aesthetic crises.<sup><a name="f18-text" href="#f18">18</a></sup> To a much greater extent than the First World War (which occurred, after all, "off-stage"), the 1930s mark a watershed in Argentina's modernism, and in its history more broadly: a state of emergency in which the literary and political, the social and the aesthetic, blur together under the overarching frame of crisis.</p>
<p>The end of avant-garde movements proper—and with it, the end of their particular, rupturist account of modernity—is part of this broader context, shaping the late modernism specific to Argentina. During the 1930s, the metaphors of birth, freshness, and the break with the past that had been so important to the earlier avant-gardes not only disappear but also seem to age: the mere idea of the new becomes old. In the 1921 "Ultraist Manifesto," for example, Borges had written that the aesthetics of Ultra demand the clearing away of older views and a gaze that saw the world as utterly new. The sense of an unformed world—"the poet is a small god," his Chilean contemporary Vicente Huidobro had written in his 1916 poem/manifesto "Arte poética"—is what will seem to be radically foreclosed during the 1930s. When, in the second Prologue to the 1954 edition of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span>, Borges links his strategies to the Baroque—"the final stage in all art, when art flaunts and squanders its resources" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A Universal History of Iniquity</span> 4)—he seems to invoke the melancholy exhaustion of the 1930s text, the sense that the new itself has become old, or spent, by the beginning of the decade.</p>
<p>Yet in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> we also find an interest in probing the limitations of novelty, a paradoxically productive resignation to this ceaseless recycling. In the wake of what seemed to be the failure of the earlier avant-gardes—the space-clearing gesture, a movement's production of the conditions for its own legibility, the entire logic of rupture that fueled the first wave of modernism—the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> implies a new relationship between the writer and the materials that circulate around him.<sup><a name="f19-text" href="#f19">19</a></sup> The intensity of the avant-garde self is recast as part of a larger, collaborative effort to produce and sustain the new reading publics, and consumers, identified with the interwar period in Buenos Aires. And, as Petit de Murat suggests with his emphasis on the machines and labor that made the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span> possible, the artist gives way to the <span style="font-style:italic;">artisan</span>, in a trope that circulates in 1930s discourse in Argentina and beyond.<sup><a name="f20-text" href="#f20">20</a></sup> Rather than the demiurge or inventor which characterizes the earlier modernists, during this period Borges began to forge a definition of literature that will become his signature: not novelty but an endlessly renewable circuit of repetition and difference. My interest is to trace how this theory is made possible by his practice with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados</span>.</p>
<p>Order and creativity, original and copy, rules and riffing, are tensions that will remain, from this point on, a constant in Borges' corpus, and we find them most acutely represented in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> through the language of mass culture.<sup><a name="f21-text" href="#f21">21</a></sup> In this sense, we can locate the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> within the late or otherwise mixed or hybrid  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> modernisms that characterize the 1930s, where the role of mass culture becomes increasingly prominent, entering into the literary form in simultaneously more explicit and vexed ways than in their high modernist precursors. In the words of Tyrus Miller, in his analysis of Anglo-American late modernism, Borges' experience with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span> represents a moment of the "slackening of the critical tension between modernist art forms and modern society."<sup><a name="f22-text" href="#f22">22</a></sup> Late modernism, in Miller's analysis, increasingly traverses the high-low divide at a moment in which mass culture has become difficult to suppress, as authors increasingly "sought to bind the restless, disturbing collective energies of recorded music, fashion, advertising, radio, and film," in this way "expos[ing] to critical view the stigmata where mass politics and urban life left their forceful signatures" . While the increasing role of modern journalism throughout the nineteenth century already inaugurated the breach between art and the market in Latin America as well as in the U.S. and Europe, this anxiety becomes more acute during the interwar period, where the consolidation of mass culture—a term itself coined during the 1930s—becomes an increasingly explicit part of creative literature.<sup><a name="f23-text" href="#f23">23</a></sup></p>
<p>If the "modernist myth" from which, Miller argues, late modernist authors are forced to divest, must indeed be rethought in light of the particularities that shape Latin American modernism—for example, in its engagement less with Anglo-American modernism than with the Continental avant-gardes, and in its limited access to autonomous cultural structures—his taxonomy nevertheless offers us a compelling frame to consider the Borges of the 1930s, also engaged with different permutations of modernism in the wake of its initial, euphoric stage. In Argentina, a country whose peripheral status is not a hypostatized given during the first decades of the twentieth century, radio, film, and popular journalism contributed to the creation of new publics, even as the earlier avant-garde ethos of rupture was diminishing. This is not to make light of the differences between Buenos Aires and New York or London, but to suggest that Borges and Petit de Murat's experiences at the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados</span> suggest a similar struggle with the increasing presence of mass culture, both global and local, associated with the 1930s in the Euro-American context.</p>
<p>The Buenos Aires that Borges returned to in the early '20s, shot through with the products—aesthetic as well as technological—of a globalized identity, suggested an increasing <span style="font-style:italic;">simultaneity</span> at work, a simultaneity that would only continue in the decades to come. As in the case of silent film, radio was introduced in Argentina at nearly the same moment as in the U.S. and Western Europe; shortly thereafter, national film emerged as an industry, and the city featured a large number of movie houses. <span style="font-style:italic;">Crítica</span> itself was part of this modernity, "peripheral" as it might have been.</p>
<p>As such, I would argue that Borges' 1930s writings demonstrate a strategic incorporation, one which does not see emergent mass culture within Argentina as a threat to either high culture or <span style="font-style:italic;">cultura popular</span> ("folk culture"), but rather as an opportunity to reflect upon the avant-garde obsession with the new. As his reviews of popular films suggest, for example, the medium has the simultaneous potential to be radically innovative and utterly predictable. Writing in the wake of experimental cinema's impact on the literary avant-garde of Argentina, he encounters the newly consolidated studio  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> system of Hollywood, and a more general shift away from the cultural centers of Europe to an ascendant United States. In his film sketches, for example, he is interested in the ability of both classic Greek and "classic" Hollywood conventions to produce infinitely compelling variations from within a rather limited formal structure.<sup><a name="f24-text" href="#f24">24</a></sup> The <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History of Infamy</span> is the text where Borges most explicitly opts for a strategic use of certain metonymies of the Hollywood aesthetic. Rather than critique it as iron-clad structure, he adopts fragments of commercial film as one mode in a bag of tricks, one possible procedure among many.<sup><a name="f25-text" href="#f25">25</a></sup> A particularly effective image can rescue a film from utter failure, as in his review of King Vidor's <span style="font-style:italic;">Billy the Kid</span> , which features an assassination whose indirection he finds powerful. The power of this indirection is not a metonymy of the film as a whole, which is, in his opinion, unsuccessful.<sup><a name="f26-text" href="#f26">26</a></sup> Rather, it is a strategic use that postulates the creation of something new through the otherwise impoverished materials of mass culture. In the process of borrowing from the novel techniques afforded by mass culture, Borges simultaneously deviates slightly from these, failing to fulfill the rules of genre or convention.</p>
<p>"The Disinterested Killer Bill Harrigan," Borges' version of Billy the Kid, is perhaps the most cinematographic episode in the collection. In his review of the King Vidor's film version of the same character, Borges had criticized the film's pseudo-epic sweep, deeming it the "that shameful chronicling of the twenty murders (not counting Mexicans) committed by the famous ter of Arizona, a film made with no other distinction than the accumulation of panoramic takes and the methodical elimination of close-ups in order to suggest the desert."<sup><a name="f27-text" href="#f27">27</a></sup> On his view, Vidor's film works with a series of spatial clichés that suggest repetition without variation. His critique of the director, however, does not preclude him from initially borrowing his strategies. Indeed, his "Disinterested Killer Bill Harrigan" also proceeds by takes, beginning with the following "shot": "The image of the lands of Arizona, before any other image."<sup><a name="f28-text" href="#f28">28</a></sup> Rather than offering us a detailed realist description, the stage is set with the utmost brevity and efficiency, as though merely showing us what we can already see. Of course, given that the images are crafted on paper and not celluloid, we <span style="font-style:italic;">cannot</span> see, and this inability presents one of many difficulties that interrupt the potential seamlessness of the story.</p>
<p>This "shot" is also crucial for the particular sense of narrative interest that would appear to be building in the story. After this setting of the stage, a re emerges: "Within this landscape, another image—the image of Billy the Kid, the rider sitting firm upon his horse, the young man of loud shots that stun the desert, the shooter of invisible bullets that kill at a distance, like a magic spell" . Later in the story, the narrator describes this method explicitly: "History (which, like a certain motion picture director, moves through discontinuous images), now proposes a sketchy saloon" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Historia universal de la infamia</span> 67). Manifesting a paradox central to film, history operates through discontinuous images, through interruption rather than flow. With this image, Borges suggests that it must borrow from its own historical moment—in this case, the moment of popular film, its transmutation of literary epic into visual spectacle—to make itself legible. Like the translators of <span style="font-style:italic;">The 1001 Nights</span>, in his oft-cited essay also first published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados</span> , who "betray" their own  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> historicity in each rewriting of the tenth-century classic, historical form itself is nothing if not mutable, susceptible to historical change.</p>
<p>If, as Beatriz Sarlo has argued, film implies a more mythologizing and ultimately passive role for the subject in 1920s–1930s Argentina—as opposed to the more accessible and active subject formation of the radio—Borges suggests that tinkering with its materials offers another possibility.<sup><a name="f29-text" href="#f29">29</a></sup> Transporting them into an unlikely medium, the compilation of other writers' stories, he inflects his developing fictional voice with the new language of film. In the wake of a perceived failure to be new, he exercises his anti-novelties through sly appropriation. Moreover, as Borges presents him in his capsule biography, Billy the Kid is part of larger phenomenon taking place in Argentina and elsewhere: he represents a moment of the hero of <span style="font-style:italic;">cultura popular</span> or folk culture becoming an icon of mass culture. In the Latin American context, as Jesús Martín-Barbero has analyzed, this process has been located precisely within the 1930s. According to Martín-Barbero, it is in this decade when cinema and radio enact a bridge between popular and mass culture, through films and radio plays that resuscitate older forms—and here we might think of Billy as a re for the <span style="font-style:italic;">gaucho/</span> cowboy/outlaw—giving them new venues and modes of circulation.<sup><a name="f30-text" href="#f30">30</a></sup> Other stories in the collection—for example, in the gangster tale "Monk Eastman, Purveyor of Iniquities"—are also interested in marking this shift, the moment in which outsider res become consolidated into new technologies of circulation, distribution, and reception.</p>
<p>At the end of "Bill Harrigan," the wide angle shots that were supposed to signify <span style="font-style:italic;">desert</span> in King Vidor's <span style="font-style:italic;">Billy</span> are replaced here with literary close-ups of the protagonist. As though to seal the sense of performativity and borrowing from popular culture that marked Billy's entire life—"he felt no scorn for theatrical fictions: he liked to go to the theater (perhaps with no presentiment that they were the symbols and letters of his own destiny")—this hero ends up exhibited in a shop window, surrounded by spectators: "On the third day, they had to put makeup on him" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A Universal History of Iniquity</span>, 38, 41). As during other moments in the collection, the mise-en-scène moment of mass culture here refers us back to the history of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span>, its origin in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados</span>.<sup><a name="f31-text" href="#f31">31</a></sup> Billy's garish ending implicates the reader of these stories of infamy; reader and spectator mirror one another.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the story "The Improbable Impostor Tom Castro," Borges makes explicit reference to the reader in the opening sentence, which establishes the "return" of the title character to South America, "even if only as a ghost, or a Saturday pastime." In a footnote added after the stories were compiled as a book, the narrator states, "This metaphor allowed me to remind the reader that these infamous biographies appeared in the Saturday supplement of an evening newspaper" . The reference not only reminds us of the work's initial context of production in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span>, but also situates the itinerary of the trickster Tom Castro as part of a larger traffic between North and South. There is no reading without a location, Borges says; likewise, there is no writing of "history" that remains uninflected by the historicity of one's given moment. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">A Universal Pulp History</h1>
<p>Writing in the Argentine journal <span style="font-style:italic;">Nosotros</span> in 1926, Alberto Fournier proclaimed what would become a commonplace for Latin American intellectuals throughout the following decade. Film, he wrote, "is not national, does not possess its own borders or languages that would form barriers"; it is "essentially international, penetrating all countries, all towns … from America to Oceania."<sup><a name="f32-text" href="#f32">32</a></sup> A decade later, contemporary anti-kitsch and high modernist arguments put forth with the U.S. context in mind, most famously Adorno and Horkheimer's chapter on the culture industry in <span style="font-style:italic;">Dialectic of Enlightenment</span> and Clement Greenberg's "Avant-garde and Kitsch," critiqued the seemingly endless reproducibility of mass culture. Severed from any origin of labor, infinitely identical, the products of mass culture, they argued, were sheered of any historical density. They represented the nefarious side of novelty, linked to impermanence and surface (opposed to psychological depth, or historical rootedness).</p>
<p>For many Latin American writers during the period, the emergent phenomenon of mass culture was particularly threatening because of its potential to engulf both the national and the historical, to turn all times and spaces into its pernicious play of surfaces, under the logic of the U.S. model of production. Mass culture, in other words, was increasingly becoming a problem of globalization—a problem of the unequal distribution and reception of cultural goods, and of the increasing homogenization of daily life. As I have suggested above, in the context of an affirmative national culture in the face of an increasing Americanism, Borges opts for a strategic adoption of metonymies of mass culture, particularly in its globalized, U.S. centered forms, as in Hollywood film. Indeed, despite their invocation of a variety of spaces and times, the stories in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> are disproportionately weighted towards the U.S., as though to suggest the inevitable particularity that emerges in any claim to the universal. He therefore essays a "universal history" for the 1930s, as particular as any claims for universality, will necessarily be written with and through the materials of the culture industry, indebted to—or burdened by—an increasing U.S. presence.</p>
<p>In perusing the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados</span> we are struck by a lack a sense of historical or geographical difference; all subject matter is reduced to the same plane, with similar images and prominence. Even revered res of national history constitute just one of many possible narrative intrigues, written in the present tense and sheared of any historical density. A cover article published on December 23, 1933 by José P. Barreiro titled "Sarmiento, el ambicioso," for example, tells the story of Domingo F. Sarmiento, the nineteenth-century national hero, opening with the line, "He hid from no one the enormous ambition that consumed him": an ambition that the readers will presumably eagerly consume themselves, along with the protagonist, who here emerges as a kind of pulp protagonist. The pleasure that such narratives elicit also appears to aim, extra-textually, at starting the process of consumption over again, of purchasing another Saturday supplement.</p>
<p>The "history" that Borges lays out in the supplement's pages borrows the leveling effect of modern journalism, noted above, in this way submitting the collection's pompous  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> title to a parodic critique. The Schopenhauerian strain that had marked his writings since his early years had liquidated any faith in the grandiose claims for universal history described, for example, in Hegel's <span style="font-style:italic;">Lectures on the Philosophy of World History</span>.<sup><a name="f33-text" href="#f33">33</a></sup> In his critique of Hegel in <span style="font-style:italic;">The World as Will and Representation</span>, Schopenhauer had posited that such overarching claims for history were based on a fundamental illusion, proposing an organic whole—"with beginning, middle, and end, together with a significant connection" (<span style="font-style:italic;">The World as Will and Representation</span> 444–5)—where none existed. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> participates in his larger suspicion of any overarching narrative with designs to subsume the world, with all its particulars. Instead, as in Schopenhauer, the text suggests that history is no longer capable of being didactic, pedagogical or, more generally, of having a transcendental meaning. In his recent critique of Hegel's persistence in contemporary historiography, Ranajit Guha writes that Hegel's was "a short story with epical pretensions."<sup><a name="f34-text" href="#f34">34</a></sup> In turn, we could call Borges' <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> the parodic inversion of the same: an epic of fragmented or truncated proportions.</p>
<p>In a text contemporary to Hegel's, also with pretentions to universality, Carlyle's <span style="font-style:italic;">On Heroes, the Heroic, and Hero Worship</span> , the author had created a typology of heroes chosen "out of widely-distant countries and epochs" .<sup><a name="f35-text" href="#f35">35</a></sup> Carlyle explicitly chooses examples that will correspond to the seemingly vast scope of world history: a Norse semi-god, Mohammad, and Napoleon all share the stage, as though to illustrate the possibility of creating a universal through exempla. Borges was well aware of Carlyle's work; he would later write a Prologue to the first Spanish edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sartor Resartus</span> , and a parodic version of the Scottish thinker's method is apparent in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span>. In his rouges' gallery, Borges too chooses protagonists from a variety of historical and geographical contexts: early twentieth-century New York, medieval Arabia, dynastic Japan. Yet their utter lack of world-historical importance critiques the sense of plenitude that we find in both Hegel and Carlyle's conceptions of history. Instead, it is <span style="font-style:italic;">infamy</span>—etymologically, both "without fame," as well as "evil"—that lends the collection its only connective tissue.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> is not only without chronological order; it also lacks, in contrast to Carlyle's text, a sense of meaning that can emerge through the accrual of different stories. Moreover, in miniature, the collection's individual stories reflect its overall structure, in which elements are not linked together through either coordination or subordination. Eschewing causality, they counter the explanatory thrust of narrative that traditional historiography exploits: the slippage between <span style="font-style:italic;">this happens after this</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">this happens because of this</span>. That is, they reject narrative as explanation, as the "grasping together" that Paul Ricoeur has ascribed to it.<sup><a name="f36-text" href="#f36">36</a></sup> As we have seen in the case of "Bill Harrigan," they are incomplete, somehow truncated, failing the promise of the <span style="font-style:italic;">terminus ad quem</span>.</p>
<p>In "The Terrifying Redeemer Lazarus Morell," for example, the title character's end lacks both poetic justice and poetic symmetry. An illegal slave trader with sadistic methods, Lazarus "liberates" slaves by killing them. In the section "The Catastrophe," the narrator has described in details the last days of this infamous character, as though they were leading up to a meaningful culmination. Lazarus "planned a response of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> continental proportions—a response in which criminality would become redemptive, and historic."<sup><a name="f37-text" href="#f37">37</a></sup> The phrase "continental response" should give us pause, resonating as it does with the collection's grandiose title. And, like it, Lazarus' project is doomed to failure. "The Interruption," the story's last section, undermines the crescendo that would seem to be building. First, in a counterfactual, the narrator lists possibilities that would have given this ending meaning and closure—"Morell leading uprisings of blacks who dreamt of hanging him; Morell hung by armies of blacks whom he dreamt of leading"—teasingly handing out possibilities for narrative closure. Next, he informs the reader that these contradict the story's proper ending: "It pains me to confess that the history of Mississippi did not take advantage of these splendid opportunities" . Morell dies of a pulmonary infection; slavery does not end in a desired inversion of roles.<sup><a name="f38-text" href="#f38">38</a></sup> As I have noted above in the case of "Bill Harrigan," Borges here borrows intensity and condensation from Hollywood, subtly distorting its epic panning. Offering his readers consumable stories, he then fails to fulfill completely his promise, ending the story with a grotesque, specular, or emphatically banal image.<sup><a name="f39-text" href="#f39">39</a></sup></p>
<p>"The endeavor to explain and interpret [historical events] directly is accordingly like the endeavor to see in the forms of the clouds groups of men and animals," Schopenhauer wrote. "What history narrates is in fact only the long, heavy, and confused dream of humanity" (<span style="font-style:italic;">The World as Will and Representation</span> 443). In the Prologue to the 1954 edition of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span>, Borges describes his own book in similar terms: "Gallows and pirates fill its pages, and that word "iniquity" (<span style="font-style:italic;">infamia</span>) strikes awe in its title, but under all the storm and lighting, there is nothing" (<span style="font-style:italic;">A Universal History of Iniquity</span> 5). Lacking an overarching architecture, the collection evacuates claims not only to universal history, but to any history as narrative fullness. Patchy and incomplete, it flaunts its large gaps. The miniature nature of the capsule biographies seems to cause the frame—that hefty and pretentious title—to collapse. While we in vain search for the "inside" of this universal history, we find only a piling up of colorful stories.</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>The vision of history running through the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> is both indebted to and subtly distanced from the Saturday supplement in which the work took shape. Despite the commonplace of both his contemporaries in interwar Argentina and by subsequent critics, Borges is not an author who flees from the history, but rather draws it into his work, which shows a preoccupation with how the shape and meaning of texts, and where and when they appear, are mutually constitutive.<sup><a name="f40-text" href="#f40">40</a></sup> As in the epigraph that begins this paper, he understood works to be inevitably, if obliquely and often unintentionally, bound up with the problem of history.</p>
<p>We find this preoccupation, for example, in the difference between the Prefaces to the first and second editions of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span>, both included in subsequent editions. In the first, which accompanied the 1935 Tor edition, Borges represents himself as a re-reader and retooler of texts, noting the particular procedures—the mismatched lists, abrupt transitions, reduction of a person's entire life to two or three scenes—which, I have shown, echo the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor de los sábados</span> in which they were published. In contrast, the second Preface, published in 1954 as part of his  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Obras completas</span>, emphasizes the philosophical stance that he will increasingly mine beginning with the essays in <span style="font-style:italic;">Otras inquisiciones</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">Other Inquisitions</span>, 1952). While the first Prologue suggests a Borges who is grappling with a shifting definition of the author during a particular instance of late modernism in Argentina, the latter is the result of a writer increasingly interested in creating a body of work whose pieces fit together under a larger umbrella of speculative fictions and essays.</p>
<p>Yet, if we trace the work back to its first publication in the motley pages of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Revista multicolor</span>, we must recognize that even the very idea of Preface, as in the unit of the book itself, presupposes a unity belied by its initial context of production. Here, disconnected stories rub up against other sketches in different issues of the supplement, yoked together only by the absurd and pompous banner of the title, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Universal History of Infamy</span>. In fact, we could say that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Universal History</span> submits history itself to the processes of history, employing the languages of mass culture to allude to its attendant problems of new reading publics, globalization, and the increasing leveling effect of cultural goods in late modernism. Rather than position Borges as prophetically prering the language of contemporary theory then, we might take a cue from his own approach to reading, returning to the different contexts that shaped his texts, tracing their different itineraries, continually exploring how their meaning is generated with and through the shifting contexts in which they appeared.</p>

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f3" href="#f3-text">3. </a>There is some debate as to what constitutes Borges' first work of prose fiction. Throughout the 1920s, his identity was primarily as a poet and later as an essayist. Beginning in 1941 with the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Garden of Forking Paths</span>, he will be considered a writer of fiction; the text features "Pierre Menard, author of Don Quijote" , a text that he has called his first short story. <span style="font-style:italic;">A Universal History of Infamy</span> contains the story "Man on Pink Corner," considered by several critics to be his first work of fiction.</p></div>

On the day in which James Joyce is at the reach of everyone's pocketbook, the society columns will invent themselves a new idol, whom no more than a dozen initiated people will read." <span style="font-style:italic;">Los lanzallamas</span> (Centro Editor de Cultura: Buenos Aires, 2005), 8. Years later, Manuel Puig—known for his marriage of high and low, his simultaneously modernist and pulp strategies—stated in a published interview, "Many have said that [my work shows] the influence of Joyce. What I consciously took from Joyce was this: I flipped through <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> a bit and saw that it was a book comprised of different techniques. <span style="font-style:italic;">Basta</span>. That part I liked." In Saúl Sosnowski, "Manuel Puig. Entrevista" (Hispamérica 3 , 74. Here, Puig echoes the Borgesean personae of the writer-as-compiler, essaying different techniques irreverently in a marriage of citation and pragmatism which slyly reworks the national literary tradition.</p></div>

José Eduardo González has argued that the Borges who emerges in the 1930s and 1940s must be understood as a direct result of the author's grappling with the problem of modernism in the Third World. On Gonzalez's view, Borges' struggle with the two cultural realms which shaped him, the European avant-gardes and the Latin American turn towards regionalism during the interwar period, led him to seek out a "third way": a playful, fantastic literature that mined strategies of the former while not investing in its notion of difficulty, infinitely more playful and consumable. See <span style="font-style:italic;">Borges and the Politics of Form</span> (New York: Garland Publishers, 1998), 35, 72. I would argue, however, that González leaps too quickly between <span style="font-style:italic;">modernism</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">modernity</span>—which leads his to the assertion that Argentina, or Latin American writing more generally, represented for Borges a conservative, traditional, or nativist mode, to be juxtaposed to an always "make it new" logic, ostensibly European. In fact, like many avant-gardists, both European and Latin American, Borges played with the idea of the "New World" as itself a source of the new, of rupture with the past.</p></div>

Borges' return to the scene of writing nineteenth-century modernity in South America—a scene that cannot but be written, he suggests, through and with Europe—has a double thrust: on the one hand, it revisits the violence that has made possible modern Argentina, but it also recasts this violence as story, narrative  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> intrigue. As Sonia Mattalia notes, "Each of the seven stories that make up the book are divided into extremely short chapters that undress, make evident, the arbitrariness of nineteenth-century causality … exhausting its logic" .</p></div>

See the way the same fragment is repeatedly recast in the essays "Sentirse en la muerte" , <span style="font-style:italic;">Historia de la eternidad</span> , and "Nueva refutación del tiempo" . The use of self-citation suggests, in this sense, a theory of literature that asks us to consider its constant shifts with and through history.

      In 2009, Simon &amp; Schuster published <span style="font-style:italic;">Gertrude is Gertrude is Gertrude is Gertrude</span> through their Atheneum Books for Young Readers imprint. The book, written by Jonah Winter and illustrated by Calef Brown, introduces children to the life of Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas through a canny pastiche of Stein’s distinctive style. Gertrude writes, Alice cooks, they drive in their car Auntie, they take their poodle Basket for walks, and they entertain writers and painters. One day, Picasso stops by. Winter writes:
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	And look who’s here, in time for tea. It’s Pablo Picasso the Spanish artist. Pablo Picasso looks so angry but no. Pablo Picasso is Pablo Picasso. He just invented Modern art which is not the same thing as being angry but then again maybe it is. Maybe it is and maybe it isn’t. Then again maybe it is. It’s so hard to invent Modern art. Maybe it is and maybe it isn’t. Maybe.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      Winter gets a lot right about Stein’s style here and throughout the book. He lovingly mimics her repetitions, her syntax, her rhymes and rhythms, her puns, her lack of punctuation, her simplistic vocabulary, and especially her playfulness. For decades, critics have commented on the seeming childishness of Stein’s writing, and Juliana Spahr has even argued that Stein demands that we “abandon our fluency” when we read her—that we effectively put ourselves in the position of the not-quite-yet-literate child when reading her works.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> Winter’s pastiche, though it clearly lacks the sophistication of Stein’s writings, shows just how suited  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> some of Stein’s stylistic trademarks—especially her repetitions, rhymes, vocabulary, and playfulness—are for an audience of children. And as Winter writes, “You can write whatever you want to too, if you’re Gertrude. A sentence can be whatever, if you’re Gertrude. You don’t have to make sense (if you’re Gertrude).”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Unfortunately for Stein, this turned out not to be the case. In 1938, Margaret Wise Brown<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> and John McCullough, editors at the William R. Scott publishing house, approached Stein about writing children’s picture books.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> Stein responded that she was already at work on a manuscript,<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> and went on to publish <span style="font-style:italic;">The World Is Round</span>, illustrated by Clement Hurd, with William R. Scott during the next year. The publication process was not easy; the editors were dismayed by the fact that the manuscript could not be “age-graded”—it was “accepted” by children ranging from three to thirteen years old.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Furthermore, the editors were very concerned about Stein’s characteristic lack of punctuation, and Brown took on the task of adding commas into the book.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> While <span style="font-style:italic;">The World Is Round</span> garnered a number of good reviews upon its publication in the fall of 1939, it was not a financial success,<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> and William R. Scott (along with several other publishing houses) rejected the children’s books that Stein wrote during the early 1940s.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> None of these texts—<span style="font-style:italic;">To Do: A Book of Alphabets and Birthdays</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gertrude Stein First Reader</span>, or <span style="font-style:italic;">Three Plays</span>—were published until after Stein’s death in 1946. Though Winter jokingly writes that “you can write whatever you want to too, if you’re Gertrude,” he forgets to add the caveat: as long as you’re not writing for children.
    </p>
<p>
      While <span style="font-style:italic;">The World Is Round</span> has received a small amount of critical attention in recent years, Stein’s other children’s books have been largely ignored by scholars.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Critical interest in <span style="font-style:italic;">The World Is Round</span> is likely due to the book’s (comparatively) successful publication history, its prominent intertextual references, and its straightforward narrative, which easily lends itself to feminist readings. The book tells the story of Rose, a young girl who goes on a long journey up a mountain to find herself; in the chapter “Rose Does Something,” she carves “Rose is a Rose is a Rose is a Rose is a Rose” into a tree, thereby elongating and playing on Stein’s famous dictum. The book is easy to assimilate into Stein’s oeuvre and is fairly easy to read. The editor of a 1993 Barefoot Books edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The World Is Round</span> even makes this point by aligning a paragraph of Stein’s with the text of a “tale” told by a not-quite-three-year-old boy.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> Stein’s other works for children, however, are much thornier reads and have been overlooked by the reading public and scholars alike. The book <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do: A Book of Alphabets and Birthdays</span>, which was first published in 1957 as part of the eight-volume <span style="font-style:italic;">Yale Edition of the Unpublished Works of Gertrude Stein,</span> is, I submit, the most challenging of Stein’s children’s books, even as it takes on one of the simplest of children’s forms—the alphabet book, also referred to as the abecedarian, abecedarium, or abecediary.
    </p>
<p>
      In this article, I focus my attention on <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do: A Book of Alphabets and Birthdays</span> and consider it across several literary genres.<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> Stein herself categorized <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>, along with her three other children’s books, as poetry; in a 1946 interview with Robert Bartlett Haas, she said that “what poetry I have done has been in the children’s books. . . . My poetry was children’s poetry, and most of it is very good, and some of it as good as anything I have ever done.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> As Joseph T. Thomas Jr. notes in his book <span style="font-style:italic;">Poetry’s</span> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">Playground: The Culture of Contemporary American Children’s Poetry</span>, there has long been a divide in scholarship between literature written for adult and child audiences, especially when it comes to poetry. In his words:
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	Most critical treatments of children’s poetry, particularly U.S. children’s poetry, divorce the object of their study from its larger, poetic context. That is, children’s poetry is usually treated in isolation, as something wholly apart from the poetic traditions of adult poetry. .. . [T]hese studies, though they are of high quality, are somewhat insular, referring largely to other studies of children’s poetry or, more broadly, to other studies of children’s literature, drawing only infrequently on the critical and historical conversations surrounding adult poetic texts. . . . When it comes to poetry criticism, stark lines are drawn between the child world and its adult counterpart.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      The scholarly ignorance of Stein’s work for children, is, then, a systemic one. The fact that these works straddle two genres—avant-garde literature and children’s literature—has led not to a proliferation of work on them by both brands of critics, as we might imagine, but instead to a dearth of criticism; a group of children’s literature critics recently referred to <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> as “Gertrude Stein’s unforgivably neglected children’s book.”<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> This article, seeking to redress this neglect, traces the publication history of <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>, outlines its elaborate structure, and places it in the context of Stein’s other works and of recent criticism on the genre. I argue that <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>’s problems are not only due to its difficult categorization but also to its formal inconsistencies; the book, though structured by the alphabet, deviates from the long history of the abecedarian form and seems to have very little interest in teaching the alphabet at all. <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> is didactic, but Stein’s quiet investment in the text is in teaching (and justifying) a particular brand of Steinian writing, not in aiding the acquisition of language or letters. The structure of the alphabet becomes, for Stein, a means to her (un-elaborated) end.
    </p>
<p>
      Stein wrote <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do: A Book of Alphabets and Birthdays</span> rather quickly in May of 1940.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> She sent the manuscript off to McCullough at William R. Scott; his copy never arrived and he would later borrow the copy that Stein sent to Carl Van Vechten. Mc-Cullough thought that the book “lack[ed] episode” and that its “characters [did] not recur with sufficient frequency to hold children’s interest.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Stein, however, was determined to see <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> in print, and, with the help of Van Vechten, sent the manuscript to a number of other publishers over a two-year period. The feedback was largely negative. Editors at Random House were “cold as a slab of alabaster” about the book,<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> while Alfred Harcourt himself wrote that “[n]ot only is it somewhat in her difficult style, but it seems to me the idea isn’t sufficient to carry a book.”<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Though Stein insisted to Van Vechten again and again in letters that <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> was a “child’s story,”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> the main problem that publishers seemed to have with it was its very classification <span style="font-style:italic;">as</span> a children’s book. McCullough had tested the manuscript on children and found that it was “far too adult for a first reader.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Margaret Wise Brown, a Stein enthusiast, was intrigued by it, but suggested to Stein that the book was appropriate only “for adults and an occasional child.”<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Even the members of Stein’s inner circle agreed. After months of difficulty finding a publisher, Van Vechten wrote to Stein “I Love this book, but I have never  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> thought it was a children’s book.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> And early on, Stein reported that Toklas said that “it is too old for children and too young for grown-ups.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> In December of 1940, frustrated with McCullough, Stein wrote the following to Van Vechten:
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	About To Do I think you are perfectly right, but then you know I am not at all stuck on its being a child’s book, I called it a child’s book, because it was about alphabets and birthdays but children says Alice have not [sic] monopoly of these things so Mama Woojums has always believed that Papa Woojums was right, and that people will love it but not as a child’s book so when you pass it on to Mr. Gilman Low III of Scribners we won’t tell him that it is a child’s book since Papa Woojums who knows says it is not, and Mama Woojums who knows that Papa Woojums knows says it is not, and Baby Woojums wants everybody to like it, and is not at all keen on children’s wanting it not at all not at all.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      But Scribner’s wasn’t interested in publishing the book either. All in all, <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> was turned down by eight publishers of both adult and children’s literature before it was accepted for publication by Harrison Smith in 1941.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> But the book never made it into print. World War II cut off communications between France (where Stein and Toklas were living) and the United States, and Harrison Smith had problems with the illustrations and manufacturing of the book. These problems effectively killed the project.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Stein and Van Vechten, however, continued to correspond about <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> through and after the war; she was still inquiring about it in March of 1946,<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> even as she and Van Vechten focused their attention on bringing Stein’s other projects into print, including the more recent <span style="font-style:italic;">The Gertrude Stein First Reader</span>, which would eventually be published posthumously.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> Despite her tireless efforts, <span style="font-style:italic;">The World Is Round</span> is the only of Stein’s children’s books that she would ever see in print.
    </p>
<p>
      As we can see from her correspondence, one of the greatest problems with <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> was that it did not fall neatly into the category of children’s literature. While <span style="font-style:italic;">The World Is Round</span> may have been written in Stein’s characteristic “difficult style,” it had, at least, a familiar structure and narrative that featured a happy ending—“and they lived happily ever after and the world just went on being round”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a>—to bolster its children’s-literature credentials. But Stein’s <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>, which stands rightly accused of “lack[ing] episode” and of having too many characters, takes too many liberties to be easily palatable as a children’s book. Likewise, <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>’s patent abecedarian form foreclosed the possibility of an exclusively adult readership. Most publishers were not concerned, then, with the quality of the book’s content but with the ambiguity of its potential audience. Toklas’s observation about <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>—that it was “too old for children and too young for grownups”—aptly summarizes this problem.
    </p>
<p>
      The genres that Stein traverses in <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>—those of children’s and avant-garde literature—are not natural bedfellows and usually call for distinct audiences. And the audience for children’s literature is always complicated by the fact that children, by and large, are not the buyers of children’s books. Jacqueline Rose argues that children’s literature “sets up a world in which the adult comes first (author, maker, giver) and the child comes after (reader, product, receiver).”<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> One of the ongoing problems of children’s literature, she suggests, is that the young child has little to no say in what  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> she reads; this, after all, is usually decided by her parent, who selects and often reads the book aloud to her. Books for children, Rose argues, are not about “what the child wants, but what . . . the adult desires.”<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Those writing, publishing, and buying children’s books are not the intended consumers of children’s books; the ultimate consumer of children’s literature does not have buying power. The marketing of children’s books is thus directed less at children and more at their parents. The fact that Stein’s works for children could not be “age-graded” was a drawback for her editors at William R. Scott; that her work was “accepted” by children ranging in age from three to thirteen was considered a liability.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Part of the problem of <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>, as I see it, is one of marketing. How is it possible to sell a book when it’s unclear to whom you should be selling it? The fact that <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> never made it into print during Stein’s lifetime suggests that there is no easy answer to this question.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Though it has yet to be matched by critical scholarship, there has been an upsurge of interest in <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> in the publishing world in recent years. In 2001, Green Integer Press (known for publishing avant-garde and overlooked texts) released the first single-volume edition of the book.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> In 2011, Yale University Press published the first illustrated edition.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> Timothy Young, editor of Yale’s edition, echoes the sentiment of many of Stein’s contemporaries, writing in his introduction that “one can easily appreciate the view of Stein’s friends and potential publishers: children are not the core audience for this book.”<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> And in a recent review of the Yale edition, NPR reviewer Heller McAlpin slyly suggests that “one quickly understands why the long-winded <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> had difficulty finding a publisher” and that “<span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> is more intriguing literary artifact than delightful read.”<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> The critical ambivalence about the text still persists, even when it comes to the child-friendly Yale edition, which has been beautifully illustrated by Giselle Potter. <a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>
      There is, then, a constellation of issues surrounding both the publication and the critical reception of Stein’s work for children. We are faced with the divided market between books for children and books for adults, and, within that, the divided market for children’s books—books for three-year-olds and books for teenagers are supposed to be different species. That Stein managed to collapse all of these categories in <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> has not been a cause for celebration. This text has always been categorized as the purview of the other—it’s for the editor who publishes children’s books, the editor who publishes books for adults, the younger child, the older child, the scholar of children’s literature, the scholar of American literature, and so on. No one wants responsibility for this strange book. Stein’s exasperation with the reception of <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>, in which she told Van Vechten that he might as well offer it to Scribner’s as a book for adults, is telling. It seems she just wanted <span style="font-style:italic;">someone</span> to read, and to like, <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>. As she wrote to Van Vechten, “please like the book, and think of all those funny stories in it, you do like them, please do.”<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Yet liking <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> is a difficult task. Even though it falls into what may be the ur-children’s genre, the alphabet book, the book’s disruptions and additions to the genre complicate it considerably. In <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>, Stein assigns each letter of the alphabet four names and writes a short narrative about a character with those names. In some cases, she writes four distinct narratives about four different characters. In other cases, she  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> writes one narrative about four of the characters. And in other cases, she writes about some characters and ignores the others. There is no pattern of who gets a story and who doesn’t, nor are the narratives the same length. Sometimes they are the length of a paragraph; at other times they take up ten pages. And there are aberrations in even this loose form; the section on the letter C, for example, only has one character. Moreover, the narratives in <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> are often, but not exclusively, about her characters’ birthdays. Birthdays in <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> are not like birthdays outside of <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>: birthdays can be exchanged, stolen, multiplied, and lost. They can be taken away from children as punishment for bad behavior, and they can be split into pieces by sets of triplets who dislike sharing. Stein’s book is thus both inconsistent in its own form and fantastical in its content.
    </p>
<p>
      Stein begins <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> by setting out the terms of the book:
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	Alphabets and names make games and everybody has a name and all the same they have in a way to have a birthday.
      </p>
<p>
	The thing to do is to think of names.
      </p>
<p>
	Names will do.
      </p>
<p>
	Mildew.
      </p>
<p>
	And you have to think of alphabets too, without an alphabet well without names where are you, and birthdays are very favorable too, otherwise who are you.
      </p>
<p>

      </p>
<p>

<p>
	Everything begins with A.
      </p>

	Annie is a girl Arthur is a boy Active is a horse. Albert is a man with a glass.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      Stein thus introduces her book within the framework of a game; alphabets and birthdays provide her with an opportunity for play. “The thing to do” here is to be imaginative. Stein’s idea of the “continuous present,”<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> first introduced in her lecture “Composition as Explanation,” seems at work in these opening paragraphs, as <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> begins at a scene of writing. It feels spontaneous and unedited, and as if Stein is speaking to herself and telling herself how to write the book that she is writing. Patricia Meyerowitz suggests that the “continuous present” that characterizes Stein’s writing is “a realization of the thinking that goes on at the moment of writing,” and not “a description of thinking that was done <span style="font-style:italic;">before</span> the writing was written.”<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> Stein thus manufactures a continuous present tense in which we imagine that we are reading her book as she writes it. She goes on to give herself directions for writing and suggests that “[t]he thing to do is to think of names,” and then answers herself with “[n]ames will do.” Then, instead of producing names, Stein produces a lighthearted rhyme of “Mildew” (with “will do”), thus taking her own advice poorly. She sees an opportunity for play and grabs it, even if this means deviating from her stated intention. The whole book, then, is framed by this “Mildew”—this disavowal of “the thing to do” by the person who ordered that we do it in the first place. This moment is, then, a rejection of instruction, and, more specifically, of self-instruction. Stein is as quick to abandon her rules as she as to make them in this text.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
      The rhyme on “mildew” continues into the next paragraph, as Stein introduces a “you” who must “think of alphabets too.” With this statement, Stein interpellates her reader into the text, and anticipates a certain resistance from him. When she declares “Everything begins with A,” this imaginary reader interjects a skeptical “What did you say” that appears without quotation marks; there are, in fact, no quotation marks in the entire book. Stein’s response begins aggressively (“I said everything begins with A and I was right”) but ends on a playful note (“and hold me tight and be all right”). The end of the sentence can seem superfluous, as if the rhymes exist just for the fun in rhyming. But we can also read it as a warning of what is to come; <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> anticipates its difficulty in these imagined exchanges between author and reader and asks us to “hold on tight” to Stein for the journey ahead.
    </p>
<p>
      In these first short paragraphs, Stein sets out a schema for the book that she will break again and again. While the section on A begins “A. Annie, Arthur, Active, Albert,” the section for B begins with a slight variation on this structure, with “B is for Bertha and Bertie and Ben and Brave and a birthday for each one” . The section for C begins “Then there is C for Charlie” , and the section for D begins “D is for Dora David Dove and Darling” . Instead of setting up a structure and keeping to it, as most alphabet books do (and I will discuss this in more detail later), <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> changes its form with each letter. The names for the A section are presented in list form with commas to separate them; the names for B are separated by the word “and.” There is only one name for the letter C, and the names for D are presented in a list, without commas. Stein is similarly inconsistent throughout <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>, and she becomes as interested in sounds (and in variations of sounds) as she is in letters as the book progresses; thus, “G is George Jelly Gus and Gertrude” , and “K is Kiki, Katy, Cake and Kisses” . “Jelly” and “Cake” do not begin with “G” or “K,” of course. In these moments Stein privileges sound over letter and disrupts the linearity of the alphabet, just as the rhyme of “mildew” with “will do” overrides all of the things that there are “to do.” This is no way to teach the alphabet.
    </p>
<p>
      Between these lists of characters and their narratives, Stein sometimes embeds additional narratives of the letters of the alphabet themselves. For example:
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	So D comes after C. Just after. C does not care whether D comes after C or not he just does not care. C is C. What difference does it make to C that D comes after C.
      </p>
<p>
	But D does care he cares very much that it is such that E comes after D. It makes all the difference to D that E comes after D. Sometimes D says bad words to E says don’t come tagging after me, I have had enough of E, let me be. But there it is there is no use in making a fuss E is always there, it is better to be like C and not to care
      </p>
<div class="attrib">
	(14–15).
      </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Stein thus personifies her letters and gives them thoughts and desires. Sometimes she comments on their value; she writes, “[A]nd after T well there are a lot of useless letters, just think of them all U V W X Y Z, just think of them all there they are pushed up at the end just like a ball” . We are particularly conscious of her role as writer in these moments, as she critiques the value of these letters as tools. She has particular trouble with X—“X is difficult, and X is not much use and it is kind of foolish that X  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> should have been put into the alphabet, it almost makes it an elephant” . And the X characters certainly feel the same way that Stein’s narrative voice does; Xantippe, Xenophon, Xylophone, and Xmas spend their narratives trying unsuccessfully to rid themselves of their Xs.
      </p>
<p>
	Stein’s letter-centric narratives are not hermetic; they bleed into one another. The dogs Never Sleep and Was Asleep, which first appear in the F section, reappear throughout the text. We find out that Active, the horse of the A section, was once named Kiki, and sure enough, a Kiki shows up in the K section. Stein also includes a Rose in the R section. This Rose has a dog named Chilly ; the Rose of <span style="font-style:italic;">The World Is Round</span> has a cousin named Willie (and, for that matter, a dog named Pépé).<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> Stein’s focus in <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> is on singular letters in and of themselves; they do not, for example, ever join together and form words. But these inter- and intratextual references create a wide-ranging web that extends outside the covers of the text.
      </p>
<p>
	The birthdays in <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> are even more strange than the letters in it. They are similarly unstable, and many of the birthday narratives involve exchanges, thefts, multiplications, and loss. There is Brave, who “was a funny boy because he was not born on his birthday. Any day could be his birthday because he was not born on his birthday” . Then there is Charlie, “and January was his birthday, the whole month of January every day in it was his birthday” . There is Edith, who “was born late, she was born a month too late. She should have been born the fifth of June and she thought that was too soon so she was born the fifth of July oh my” . For the Js—“James, Jonas, Jewel and Jenny,”—“there were only two birthdays for the four of them and they quarreled more than before and pretty soon they tore the two birthdays in pieces and now there were six without birthdays” (36–37). In what is perhaps the most striking narrative in the book, a Mr. and Mrs. Quiet decide to take the birthday away from their big pet rabbit, because he eats another smaller rabbit every year on his birthday. When he no longer knows when his birthday is, he begins eating rabbits on every day of the year, “just as if every day was his birthday” . Mr. and Mrs. Quiet are understandably upset and then give away all of their other rabbits. Then:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	  [A]ll of a sudden the big rabbit’s red eyes burst out into flame, the big rabbit was on fire inside him and he and the cabbages and carrots he had not eaten were all flaming and the smoke and fire were coming out of him and the little house he lived in was burning and Mr. and Mrs. Quiet who were looking at him found it all terrifying, they were so frightened they could not do anything, they could not get any water to put the fire out they were so frightened they could not move about and so they just sat there watching and pretty soon it was over the burning there was nothing left of the big rabbit but a red cinder and that Mr. and Mrs. Quiet put out by dropping tears on him. And after that Mr. and Mrs. Quiet lived very quietly with their goats and everything but they never after had another rabbit.

<p class="continued">
	  Birthdays in <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> are not just malleable; as the book progresses, they become more and more dangerous. Stein begins the book with “Alphabets and names make games and everybody has a name and all the same they have in a way to have a birthday” .  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> The operative phrase, here, is “in a way,” and Stein exploits its ambiguity to the utmost degree. By destabilizing the youth-oriented markers of language and time—the alphabet and the birthday—Stein creates a frankly horrifying world of indeterminacy and unexplained metamorphoses. As Richard Bridgman has briefly noted, the book is “dominated by acts of aggression and disaster.” Though he suggests that “the over-all effect is not morbid” because “the fantasy distances the violence and cruelty,”<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> critic Barbara Will thinks otherwise. Will writes of <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> that “acts of inexplicable violence occur without warning and without meaning, ‘all of a sudden’; things happen, ominously, causing multiple deaths and sparing only a random few. This unpredictable violence turns everyone, even adults, into frightened and submissive children.”<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> While I agree with Will, both she and Bridgman overlook the most interesting thing about <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>—that its most serious violence does not take place in its narrative content, but in its narrative framework. In other words, the violence that Stein does to the alphabet and to time (via her representation of birthdays, which normally function, as Bridgman describes them, as “one’s particular anchor in the world of time” <a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a>) is much more interesting than the violence of her cannibalistic rabbit. Stein begins by designating the alphabet as deterministic—“without an alphabet well without names where are you, and birthdays are very favorable too, otherwise who are you” —but spends her entire text dismantling any sort of stable self that would come with a name and a birthday.
	</p>
<p>
	  While the tale of Mr. and Mrs. Quiet is probably the most horrifying in <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>, the story of Active, with its metamorphosing names and birthdays, is more representative of the rest of the narratives in the text. Stein begins by introducing Active with a fairly straightforward series of sentence-length paragraphs:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	    Active.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Active is the name of a horse.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Everybody has forgotten what horses are.
	  </p>
<p>
	    What horses are.
	  </p>
<p>
	    What are horses.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Horses are animals were animals with a mane and a tail ears hoofs a head and teeth and shoes if they are put upon them.
	  </p>
<div class="attrib">
	    (5–6)
	  </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    In this introduction, “Active,” usually an adjective, is an unlikely name, and stands out among Annie, Arthur, and Albert in the earlier list of A characters. All we hear of these characters is that “Annie is a girl Arthur is a boy Active is a horse. Albert is a man with a glass” . Active the horse gets a three-page narrative; our human characters, delineated by the most basic of markers (“girl,” “boy,” “man”), don’t get any. Stein thus privileges here the unusual and the unexpected. And when she introduces Active, she does so with a hint of nostalgia, anticipating that her young audience is unfamiliar with horses, and goes on to describe them in a blazon-like list of physical attributes. Her verbal slippage from “horses are animals” to “horses were animals” confirms her belief that horses no longer matter in her world; this is, in fact, what the story of Active will confirm.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	    After Stein explains about “what horse-shoes are”  she continues:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	      He had a birthday he was born on that day so everybody knew just how old he was, he was born on the thirty-first of May on that day, and then he began to say he was not born on that day he was he began to say he was born on the thirty-first of June, and that was none too soon. He liked to be born later every day. Well anyway, there he was and Active was his name, it was his name now but it had not always been, it had once been Kiki, not that he ever kicked not he and he used then to pull a milk-wagon. Then the war came, Kiki was twenty, twenty is awful old for a horse but Kiki had always had plenty, so even at twenty he was young and tender and pretty slender.
	    </p>
<div class="attrib">
	      
	    </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      Here Stein does several interesting things. We have the first instance in the text of a malleable birthday, changeable at will; Active decides “to be born later every day.” But then we find out that Active has a stable age of twenty, which is “awful old for a horse,” but then again that he was “young and tender and pretty slender.” Stein thus continually undermines herself. Does Active change his birthday, or does he just wish that he could? How is he old for a horse but young and tender at the same time? Stein’s characters throughout <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> dwell in uncertainties such as these. In the world of the book, a character can be both “awful old” and “young and strong”  at the same time, and, as often as not, making a wish about a birthday is a performative gesture. Active wants to be younger; thus, he <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> younger. And when the J characters, for example, threaten to take away each other’s birthdays, their birthdays disappear, and unfortunately for them, “later on when they all wanted their birthdays back again they went out to find them but they were gone perhaps a duck or a lobster had eaten them anyway all four birthdays were gone not one of them had one” . Birthdays in the text lose their capacity to mark personal time, and, at the same time, morph into objecthood.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Names are just as troublesome as the pliant birthdays in <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>. We find out that Active used to be Kiki. He did not get this name, Stein tells us, in a moment of linguistic play. She explains the name change later:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		So the soldiers came along and they thought he was young and strong and they took him along. . . . Then nobody knew where he was, and he was no he was not gone away nor did he stay but he was at the front where there was shooting and he was pulling a little cannon along, and they did not know his name but he was so young and strong they called him Active and he always came right along he and his little cannon.
	      </p>
<div class="attrib">
		(6–7)
	      </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		Active’s name change is thus not his decision, as was his (possible) change of birth date. Active’s new name is an aptonym (unlike the earlier “Kiki,” which was ill-fitting because he “was never kicking”). And Active likes his new name; Stein writes, “I like being Active better than being Kiki who was never kicking” . The ideal names for Stein, in <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>, are adjectival; she insists that names are not arbitrary, but meaningful.<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> But Active’s name change comes at a moment of violence, in the middle of a war. Stein here sees violence as an opportunity for changing the self. And the male horse’s name change—from the feminine Kiki to the gender-neutral Active—is also at play. War de-feminizes the horse, and gives him the opportunity to reach his full potential.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
		When the war ends, Active is sent home, but he is no longer needed there because of the rise of the automobile. “They” return to calling him by his original name:
	      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		  [A]nd they called him Kiki again but Active was his name and he said he would lose his mane if they took away his new name. Well they all cried like anything, they just all cried and cried and then Active forgot everything. . . . So he said he thought an automobile, just one day he said he thought he would be an automobile not a new one an old one and he was one, he was an automobile and an automobile never has a name and it never has a mane and it has rubber shoes not an iron one and finding rubber shoes does not mean anything like finding iron horse-shoes did and that was the end of everything.
		</p>
<div class="attrib">
		  
		</div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		  With the end of war, then, comes the end of Active and the return to Kiki. But in the world of <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>, characters can change at will, and thus Kiki/Active turns into an automobile because he’d rather be one than a horse, whose pre-war labor has been rendered obsolete. Stein provides no description of the metamorphosis whatsoever; it just happens. But this turn is not a happy one, and it ushers in “the end of everything,” including the end of Active’s narrative. The automobile, presumably the product of Fordist labor, “never has a name,” and thus loses its signifying ability; Active no longer signifies in the postwar economy. And while finding iron horse-shoes used to bring luck , finding rubber shoes, or tires, now means nothing. In his transformation, Active loses what made himself himself, and he becomes a soulless product. While not all of Stein’s narratives have similar endings, this unmooring of personhood (or, in the case of Active, of horsehood) is a common thread throughout <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>. The violence of this narrative is not in Active’s experience at war; it’s in his experience back home <span style="font-style:italic;">after</span> the war. He is rendered useless, and, to combat this, he becomes a machine and thereby dissolves his identity.
		</p>
<p>
		  The violence of <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>, as I’ve previously suggested, works at both the level of form and content. Stein destabilizes the personal markers of names and birthdays throughout her text, and in the case of Active and many of her other characters, erases all possibility for establishing a sense of self. In this sense, the characters of <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> could not be more different than the Rose of the more conventional <span style="font-style:italic;">The World Is Round</span>. But even more interesting is what Stein does to the generic forms of the alphabet book, which Karen Coats suggests is “primarily didactic,”<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> and which George R. Bodmer suggests is “didactic almost by definition.”<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> Stein’s violence to the genre is more subtle than the violence in her narratives, and her refusal to conform to one of the many established forms within the genre undermines the potential didacticism of her text. Put simply, it’s hard to imagine any child learning the alphabet by reading <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>. Why then did Stein choose one of, if not <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> most didactic of genres, to structure her book?
		</p>
<p>
		  In her excellent book <span style="font-style:italic;">The Story of A: The Alphabetization of America from</span> The New England Primer <span style="font-style:italic;">to</span> The Scarlet Letter, Patricia Crain traces the long history of the alphabet book. She maps out the changes in the genre over time—the shifts from the image-less hornbooks of pre-Renaissance Europe to Comenius’s phonologically focused <span style="font-style:italic;">Orbis Sensualium Pictus</span> (the first alphabet book with images) to <span style="font-style:italic;">The New England Primer</span>’s “image-rhyme combination” that marks “a purposeful turn away  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> from the alphabet’s inherent meaninglessness.”<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> In tracing this history, she delineates three types of alphabetical forms. The first are “swallow alphabets” , in which letters “display tropes of consumption—letters eating other letters, letters being eaten by children, letters in the mouths of animals, letters pictured with, or as, food” . The second are “body alphabets” , in which images of letters are anthropomorphized into human shapes, and imitate human bodily actions. This type of alphabet, for Crain, places emphasis “not on the act of the consumption of the alphabet, but on the <span style="font-style:italic;">result</span> of this internalization” . The third type of alphabetical form, the “alphabet array” or “the worldly alphabet”  which takes the familiar “A is for . . . B is for . . .” form, “emphasizes the alphabet’s function of ordering and arbitrary arrangement” . Crain continues:
		</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		    With its apparent encyclopedism or scientism, its impulse towards organization and categorization, this is the alphabet most obviously a product of the Enlightenment. Whether objects, animals, or body parts, this alphabet represents, in words or images, the world at large, arrayed through the arbitrary but powerful order of the ABCs, forcefully producing a world that is knowable, graspable, and most strikingly, obtainable. . . . The alphabet array alerts you to the vast quantity of things in the world up for consumption.<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		  For Crain, alphabet books become over time a way of representing the capitalist world; through consumption, internalization, and accretion, “the alphabet book posits the world of imperial and capitalist enterprise as one that is already inside the language-learning child.”<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a> Learning the alphabet is not just a step in learning to read, for Crain; it is a way of submitting to the capitalist system.
		</p>
<p>
		  Karen Coats, writing contemporaneously to Crain, offers up an alternative schema for categorizing alphabet books. Borrowing terminology from the philosopher J. L. Austin, Coats argues that alphabet books are either constative or performative. In constative alphabets, she claims, “language is not material, it has no body; rather it is an epistemological tool, an abstract way of ‘knowing’ the concrete world.”<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> In performative alphabets, on the other hand, “the letter itself . . . become[s] an <span style="font-style:italic;">object</span> for representation rather than a transparent <span style="font-style:italic;">instrument</span> for representing. Letters become performers in and of reality rather than simply pointers to something outside themselves.”<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> She argues that in the twentieth century, “the view of language as presented in alphabet books [changes] from a traditional, linear, epistemological, masculine model, in which language is a way of knowing an existing reality, to a more performative, ontological, integrated model, in which language is recognized as a vehicle for actively constructing that reality.”<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> Michael Heyman suggests that the shift that Coats charts is not so much an innovation in the twentieth century, but is more accurately a “rebirth” of performative forms, the likes of which Crain traces in swallow and body alphabets of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and which he traces even further back into medieval illuminated manuscripts.<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a></p>
<p>
		  Despite their difference in terminologies and methodologies (Crain takes an historical approach, Coats a theoretical one) both critics point towards a fairly rigid division between types of alphabet books. In some, letters are referents or “epistemological  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> tools” for knowing the world outside the text (in this category we can include Coats’s constative alphabets and Crain’s alphabet arrays); in others, letters are material agents or material objects that either act of their own volition or are acted upon (in this category we can include Coats’ performative alphabets and Crain’s swallow and body alphabets). This divide is fairly clean; in the works that both critics study, there seems to be no overlap. The letters of alphabet arrays don’t suddenly jump out of their referential roles and take action, nor do the letters of body alphabets suddenly start referring to anything outside of themselves. Letters are either a means of learning the world or an end in and of themselves.<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>
		  One of the most generically transgressive things about <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>, then, is that Stein’s letters are both referential <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> material. The book is organized by an alphabet array of names—“D is for Dora David Dove and Darling” —but also includes letters acting, feeling, and speaking on their own volition. Stein writes that “[s]ometimes D says bad words to E says don’t come tagging after me, I have had enough of E, let me be” .<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> Her alphabet is both constative, or referential, and performative, or material, and she will often draw on both possibilities within the same narrative. In her section on Y, Stein introduces, in referential mode, “Yvonne and You, Yes and Young. These are the Y’s why not” . Like Comenius before her, she plays on the aural aspects of the letter, and perfectly rhymes “Y” and “why.” This moment of play, soon to be repeated, accrues more meaning as the narrative progresses. Stein then begins the story of Yvonne Yet and Yes Young, a married couple, who are moderately happy until they hear a man singing “imagine if you can how much it would cost to get back a letter if it could be lost” . This reminds them that “they had put the letter Y in an envelope and now where was it” (129–130).<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a> Yvonne and Yes get very nervous, and exclaim “Y Y Y Y oh why are we only Y oh why oh why” . In an oral reading of the text, the differences between “Y” and “why” are collapsed, and the letter and word become substitutable; the lament for “Y” can be heard at the end of the sentence as well as at the beginning, or we can hear a repetition of “why” at the beginning.<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>
		  Stein further complicates the “Y” when we find out what has actually happened to the letter. She writes:
		</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
		    The letter Y you see the letter Y is in an envelope and when it falls into the fire it burns. Now if a letter burns then it is not there. Believe it or not it is true.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Now the letter Y was put into an envelope they remembered that and the envelope was put into the fire, that is what happened to the letter Y. Of course that is what happened to the letter Y and that is because it is in cry and in Oh my, that is the reason why the letter Y was put into an envelope, and into the fire and the envelope was all burned up and in the ashes there were no sashes there was nothing at all, the letter Y was gone.
		  </p>
<div class="attrib">
		    
		  </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		    There are several issues at work here. First, Yvonne and Yes, the referents of Y’s alphabet array, are suddenly faced with the materiality of the letter, and they learn that the material object may be lost, or, more specifically, burned up. Second, Stein plays with homonyms once again and introduces the possibility of an epistolary letter along with the alphabetical letter. The “letter Y” in an envelope becomes a synecdoche for  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> an epistolary letter, which can be burned, and thus the material Y becomes a referential Y. But this synecdoche is doubly complicated, because both sides of the equation are operating with the same term; the (alphabetic) letter stands in for an (epistolary) letter. This synecdochic logic is also at work when we hear why the letter has been burned—it’s been burned because Y is “in cry and Oh my.” The Y letter/letter must be burned because it is synecdochic of sadness.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Crain notes that the alphabet array form always works on the logic of synecdoche. She explains that “the synecdoche ‘A is for apple’ gives the alphabet a mouth and a voice, binding the names of the letters to the names of things in the world . . . [In alphabet arrays,] synecdoche is the re of non-mimetic representation: A stands for apple because A is <span style="font-style:italic;">in</span> apple.”<a name="f63-text" href="#f63"><sup>63</sup></a> In the letter-burning narrative in <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>, the Y acts not just as a tropological reference to an epistolary letter or as a synecdoche for “cry,” but also as a material letter and as a phonological substitute for “why.” The letter is both referential and material, but it is interestingly non-performative. Stein uses the passive voice to describe the letter-burning incident; she avoids attributing the event to an agent in such passive phrases as “the envelope was put into the fire.” Yvonne and Yes didn’t do it; the only agent that we can implicate is Stein’s authorial voice, which has the power to make letters of the alphabet, and thus her characters’ identities, disappear. Indeed, after the letter is burned, Stein writes that “those are sad days when a letter the only letter that can make you know that you are you is burned away” , and Yvonne and Yes spend the rest of their narrative stealing signage and stealing names from newborns in an effort to get their Ys back. Though they succeed, and Stein tells us that “they lived happily ever after,” they learned to be “very careful . . . of the Y’s they never said Oh my and they never said cry and they never said try” . We also find out that they “had a great many children but they never gave them any name that began with Y not one” . Stein effectively cuts off the Y lineage, and thus ends any generative prospects of the letter, both in terms of the proliferation of children and the proliferation of language.
		  </p>
<p>
		    However, the loss of letters doesn’t extend to Stein’s narrative. Even though Yvonne and Yes lose their Ys, Stein is still able to refer to them by their names, which, of course, include the Ys. We could imagine, for example, that the loss of letters would turn her characters into “vonne” and “es”—at least until they regained their Ys in their narrative. But Stein does not write by the rules that she sets out for her characters. We see this most clearly in moments when Yvonne and Yes lament their losses; Stein writes, “Yvonne could not say to Yes what do you think Yes because there was no letter Y and Yes Young could not say to Yvonne I will take care of you Yvonne because the letter Y was burned away, away away away” . Stein, however, still has access to Y, and she can write “Yes” and “Yvonne” and “away away away.” There is thus a major discrepancy in <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> between content and form. Stein tells us that Y has been burned away, but if that were true, wouldn’t it be unavailable to Stein as well? How can it be burned away for the characters, but not for the authorial voice? While it may seem dogmatic to expect absolute consistency between narrative and form from most texts, the very fact that <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> falls into the category of didactic meta-discourse (as do all books of its genre) demands such consistency. If Y is a material object that can be lost, why can  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Stein still use it for its referential qualities? Why is Stein’s personal alphabet different from <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> alphabet? What is Stein, writing in the most didactic of genres, trying to teach us in <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>?
		  </p>
<p>
		    In her aptly named “P is for Patriarchy,” Coats argues that alphabet books take on the task of inscribing us into the patriarchal symbolic order. Following Lacan, she suggests that:
		  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		      To learn to read, to enter into a relationship with a written text, is to enter into a relationship of unequal power. The text is mute, unresponsive, and often resistant. That children embrace this relationship so willingly and exuberantly is largely because they are used to relationships of unequal power. Their job is to re out what the Other wants of them, how they can make themselves desirous to those in power over them. Learning to read is an acceptance of the arbitrary power structure of the dominant culture.<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		    For Coats, then, a child’s reading of an alphabet book is an unknowing acquiescence to the symbolic order, to the “arbitrary power structure[s]” of language and social authority that are implicit in the alphabet. But Joseph T. Thomas Jr. argues that Coats leaves something out in her analysis. He writes that “the very purpose of an alphabet is to be rearranged; if it suggests linearity—if it, as Coats maintains, writes us into the symbolic order of the patriarchy, it simultaneously suggests this order’s opposite.”<a name="f65-text" href="#f65"><sup>65</sup></a> In other words, learning the alphabet is not an end in and of itself. We learn the alphabet so that we can <span style="font-style:italic;">use</span> the alphabet to build words, sentences, paragraphs, novels out of it. And it is the rare alphabet book that features only letters and images; most alphabet books, from Comenius’s on to the present, supplement singular letters with words. In Kate Greenaway’s influential <span style="font-style:italic;">A Apple Pie</span>, A and “apple pie” aren’t equated only pictorially; they are equated, by the author, through the words “A apple pie.”<a name="f66-text" href="#f66"><sup>66</sup></a> This may seem obvious, but previous studies of the genre, including Thomas’s, have glossed over the fact that alphabet books are as engaged in using words as they are in presenting letters (whether referential or material). This is not to say that Coats, Crain, and other critics ignore the words, phrases, sentences, or even the poetry of alphabet books. They pay them ample attention. What these critics do is sidestep the simple fact that reading the text of an alphabet book requires knowledge that the book presupposes doesn’t exist. If a child can already read the text of an alphabet book, it’s unlikely that she <span style="font-style:italic;">needs</span> the alphabet book for any didactic purpose. There is thus an inherent temporal problem in the genre; the alphabet book constitutes its audience retroactively. This problem is solved, however, by spatial reading practice. Many alphabet books, like many children’s books in general, are read out loud to children by adults. This aural audience of “readers” is the actual intended audience of alphabet books; this is the audience that has something to learn from the text. The genre requires a community of readers/speakers to fulfill its didactic purpose, and the child who learns from it is not so much a reader as she is a listener. The child who reads an alphabet book on her own does not read to learn the letters of the alphabet; she reads for the sake of reading or for the sake of learning something other than the alphabet.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
		    Toklas’s response to <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>—that it was “too old for children and too young for grown-ups”—resonates, then, not just with Stein’s work, but with alphabet books in general. And <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> makes an interesting intervention in the genre, as it privileges the process of reading and writing over the process of learning the alphabet. Stein assumes that the learning of the alphabet has already happened for her readers: from the early lines “[t]he thing to do is to think of names” and “you have to think of alphabets too, without an alphabet well without names where are you and birthdays are very favorable too, otherwise who are you” onward, she focuses not on the learning of letters, but on the process of writing. The book opens prescriptively, and Stein announces that her alphabet is meant to be rearranged, and that the rearrangement of letters leads to names and characters, and then to birthdays, as she builds a narrative around individual identity, and often around the loss of identity. I contend that Stein’s strange turns in these arenas, which I’ve focused in on in my analyses of Active/Kiki and the Y family, are ultimately about the power of the writer. Stein does not make Kiki’s transformation into an automobile realistic in any way; it occurs purely because of Stein’s fancy and without explanation. The narrative of the letter Y in the fire is similarly disconcerting; the only way we know that the Y got placed in the fire is that Stein tells us. To Will’s suggestion that “acts of inexplicable violence occur without warning and without meaning,” I want to counter that in <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>, Stein is particularly conscious of the fact that <span style="font-style:italic;">she</span> is the one who makes things happen and that she is the only one who can provide meaning—through rhetoric and linguistic play—in the metamorphosing world that she creates.
		  </p>
<p>
		    The book thus couples its instructive beginning with an acute awareness on Stein’s (and her readers’) part that there is no logic, coherence, or causality in the world of <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> other than that of the author. Consequently, there is an extreme tension between the overarching linear (and should-be) didactic form of the text and its violent and chaotic content. Indeed, Stein’s interest in didacticism was long coupled with disdain. In 1931, Stein published <span style="font-style:italic;">How to Write</span>, quite possibly the least useful writing manual ever written. Even in this text, writes Marianne DeKoven in a detailed study of Stein’s most experimental works, “Stein violates the sanction of all literature that the reader have some way to move from one word to the next. The prevention of reading is, of necessity, the denial of literature.”<a name="f67-text" href="#f67"><sup>67</sup></a> Even though Stein embeds <span style="font-style:italic;">How to Write</span> with appealing dictums (such as “a sentence is not emotional a paragraph is”<a name="f68-text" href="#f68"><sup>68</sup></a>), it often reads like a list of playful non sequiturs: “Now all this is still sentences. Paragraphs are still why you were selfish. // Shellfish are what they eat. This is neither a paragraph nor a sentence.”<a name="f69-text" href="#f69"><sup>69</sup></a><span style="font-style:italic;">How to Write</span> also prominently features inscrutable, agrammatical passages that pose as instruction, such as, “Grammar is made whether there has been a better whether it is alike are to be hand in hand which is stitches a polite that is a dollar ball carried a mainly for only timely bother in only begs legacy.”<a name="f70-text" href="#f70"><sup>70</sup></a> In the book’s introduction, Patricia Meyerowitz states the obvious: <span style="font-style:italic;">How to Write</span> “certainly does not tell you how to write.”<a name="f71-text" href="#f71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>
		    Several years later, in 1936, Stein gave a lecture titled “What Are Master-pieces and Why Are There so Few of Them,” which was later published in 1940. In the lecture, Stein tells us:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		      The thing one gradually comes to find out is that one has no identity that is when one is in the act of doing anything. Identity is recognition, you know who you are because you and others remember anything about yourself but essentially you are not that when you are doing anything. I am I because my little dog knows me but, creatively speaking the little dog knowing that you are you and your recognizing that he knows, that is what destroys creation. That is what makes school.<a name="f72-text" href="#f72"><sup>72</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
		    Stein’s thoughts about identity here are interesting; she privileges action over identity and recognition, and insists any creative act is indeed an act—it consumes the individual and temporarily erases identity. She emphasizes the process of creating, not the product, and suggests that this is the only way to make a masterpiece. The masterpiece may in the end be about identity, but for the writer to achieve master status, she must empty herself. Later, when Stein writes that recognition “destroys creation” and that “this is what makes school,” she links school, and thus learning, to the death of creativity. To learn is to recognize and to be recognized; it is to be conscious of the self, and this consciousness is exactly what Stein wants to erase in the writing process so that a masterpiece can be achieved. It is an ironically prescriptive moment; Stein instructs her audience to disavow instruction as a means to artistic production.
		  </p>
<p>
		    Stein revisits her uncomfortable relationship with instruction with the aptly titled and commanding <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>, written nearly a decade after <span style="font-style:italic;">How to Write</span> and four years after her “What Are Master-pieces” lecture was first given. The sequence of these works helps reveal <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>, as I suggested earlier, as an instruction manual for writing rather than a primer on the alphabet. The letters of the alphabet are the building blocks of Stein’s writing; instead of an arbitrary structure, the alphabet becomes a meaningful way for her to teach a (supposedly) youthful audience about the power of words. From her preference for aptonyms, to her numerous and resonating puns on homonyms, Stein insists in <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> that words are meaningful. In this text, she is wholly invested in the power of creation, and despite her insistence in “What Are Masterpieces” that identity must be erased in the writing process, Stein conjures a world in which her distinctive narrative voice is omnipresent, and in which things happen only at her will. Indeed, the entire book is framed by the command for imaginative play. The introduction of “Mildew,” which both adheres to this instruction for play while undermining the command to begin a book by creating names and birthdays out of the alphabet, creates a push-and-pull in the text between authoritative power and an undermining of this power.
		  </p>
<p>
		    For Juliana Spahr, Stein’s work “is as much one of building as of subverting,”<a name="f73-text" href="#f73"><sup>73</sup></a> and it “does not deny authority but instead advocates its dispersal.”<a name="f74-text" href="#f74"><sup>74</sup></a> While Spahr suggests that Stein’s slippery language puts interpretation on the side of her readers and encourages them “to be their own authors”<a name="f75-text" href="#f75"><sup>75</sup></a> in the interpreting of her work, I want to suggest something different. When it comes to <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>, Stein instructs readers to be their own authors, not of her works (in an almost reader-response manner, as Spahr suggests), but of their own. <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> does not teach alphabet acquisition; it is instead a guide to <span style="font-style:italic;">using</span> the alphabet. In the opening lines, Stein implores us to see how much can come out of just twenty-six letters—from the alphabet comes names, from names come  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> birthdays, from names and birthdays come identities, from identities come hundreds of narratives. And Stein’s consistent dismantling of these identities (and the narratives that contain them) is an acknowledgment that the author’s power lies as much in her ability to destroy—a character, a form, even the alphabet itself—as it does in her power to create. <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>, which masquerades as a children’s book, is then both a guide to and justification for her creative work. When Stein begged Van Vechten, “please like the book, and think of all those funny stories in it, you do like them, please do,” she wasn’t just asking for his approval on <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>; she was asking for wholesale recognition and affirmation of her creative process.<a name="f76-text" href="#f76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>

			While there are admittedly a number of possible frameworks for considering <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>, I choose to examine the book within the context of children’s literature and the history of the abecedarian form. Stein’s interest in the alphabet was not unique, of course; various modern art groups, including the Futurists, Constructivists, and Lettristes, shared Stein’s interest in the letter as form.

		      Gallup, introduction to <span style="font-style:italic;">Alphabets and Birthdays</span>, vii–viii. Stein’s <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> was not her first foray into the topic of birthdays; in 1924, she wrote <span style="font-style:italic;">A Birthday Book</span> for Pablo Picasso’s son Paulo. Picasso agreed to do the illustrations but eventually backed out, and despite Stein’s efforts, the book was never published. Stein’s <span style="font-style:italic;">A Birthday Book</span> follows the form of other popular birthday books by Longfellow and Whittier (xiv–xv). Gallup explains the form thusly: “[E]ach day of the year appeared on a separate page, with a blank space for the insertion of the name of a baby born on that day under an appropriate quotation chosen from the writings of the particular poet” (xv). Stein’s birthday book provides, not surprisingly, a strange twist on the form. She writes, for example, in the January section: “January the twenty-eighth and August. // January the twenty-ninth as loudly. // January the thirtieth to agree, to agree to January the thirtieth. // January the thirty-first usually. Used. Usually. Usually. Used” . Clearly, Stein’s is not an ordinary birthday book filled with inspirational quotations; Gallup deems it characteristically “hermetic” (xv).

		      Stein to Van Vechten, 10 December 1940, in <span style="font-style:italic;">Letters</span>, 691. In his introduction to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Letters of Gertrude Stein and Carl Van Vechten 1913–1946</span>, Edward Burns elaborates on the term “Woojums,” which populates so many of the letters between Stein and Van Vechten: “It was often used by Van Vechten as a term of endearment for Stein and Toklas and other friends. Its origin may be a mixed drink described in his novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Parties</span>. ‘Woojums,’ however, took on more meaning at the time of Stein’s American lecture tour in 1934–35: it describes their sense of a family unit. . . . The family that emerged in 1934–35 is an organic outgrowth of the role each had assumed in the other’s life. Gertrude became Baby Woojums (sometimes referred to by the pronoun <span style="font-style:italic;">he</span>), Alice Toklas became Mama Woojums, and Carl Van Vechten became Papa Woojums. Part of Toklas’ and Van Vechten’s role as parents was to look after Baby Woojums—Gertrude. They established among themselves a family model that reflected the emotional importance each had come to assume for the other” (3–4). These pet names turn up in Stein’s <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> in the section on the letter “V,” and their appearance in the book speaks to the importance of this alternative family to Stein. Also interesting is Stein’s positioning of herself as a child in the Woojums clan.

		    Michael Heyman, “The Performative Letter, from Medieval to Modern,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Children’s Literature Association Quarterly</span> 30 vol.1 (Spring 2005): 100. It should also be noted that unlike the alphabet  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> books that Crain and Coats discuss, indeed, unlike most alphabet books, the first edition of Stein’s <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span> was <span style="font-style:italic;">not</span> illustrated. As discussed earlier, problems with its would-be illustrations were part of the reason it wasn’t published even after it was accepted by Harrison Smith in manuscript form.
		  </p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f59" href="#f59-text">59. </a>
		    This divide between types of alphabet books (letters as material vs. letters as referential) gestures towards a long thread of atomistic philosophy concerned with the units of knowledge and representation that can be traced as far back as Plato and Lucretius. For more, see Plato, <span style="font-style:italic;">Theaetetus</span>, trans. Robin A. H. Waterfield (London: Penguin Books, 1987); and Lucretius, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Nature of Things</span>, trans. A. E. Stallings (London: Penguin Books, 2007).
		  </p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f60" href="#f60-text">60. </a>
		  Unlike her predecessors, Stein does not directly engage in the capitalistic enterprise that Crain argues is key to the form of the alphabetic array. Stein’s letters correspond to names, and not to objects in the world that are available for consumption. Her focus, then, is not on knowing an exterior world, but on knowing an interior world that is shaped by its exterior. As we see in the narrative of Kiki/Active’s metamorphosis into an automobile (surely a comment on capitalism), Stein is interested not in capitalism-qua-capitalism, but on the effects of the system on individual bodies and identities.
		</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f61" href="#f61-text">61. </a>
		  In this moment, as in many others in <span style="font-style:italic;">To Do</span>, Stein shifts into free indirect discourse and conflates the authorial voice with that of her characters. Since there are no quotation marks in the text (nor are there, for example, Joycean em-dashes), Stein’s narrative is particularly fluid, and distinguishing the voices within it becomes particularly difficult.
		</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f62" href="#f62-text">62. </a>
		  Stein plays with both the aurality and images of other letters in the same manner; in a transition section between the letters V and W, she writes, “V is V and W is W. . . . Double you. Double you is two for you. Very was V and double you is a double of you. You and You. But really not, what what, no really not, it is a trouble to think double and when double you makes double V and when double v makes double you it is better to be v than u and yet u could be v if it was a trouble to you” . Stein’s exchanges of “you” for “u” make the passage almost nonsensical, but an aural reading of it unwinds some of her play. The passage thus works on an aural, but not visual, level of reading.

		  Crain, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Story of A</span>, 98. We might also look at this differently. While Crain suggests that “A” stands for “apple” because it is in the word “apple,” we could instead see “apple” as a metonymic representation of the letter “A.”

<div class="attrib">
	--Oscar Wilde, <span style="font-style:italic;">A Woman of No Importance</span>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
	  Reminiscing on his friendship with Oscar Wilde, the artist W. Graham Robertson recalls his ill-judged amusement on first hearing the playwright read aloud to him in French from the unfinished composition <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>: "[Wilde] had been reading his magnum opus," Robertson recollects, "and I had found it funny." Robertson, allowing that he quickly grasped his error, goes on to observe of the play this incongruity:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    Salome, the schoolgirl, just home for the holidays, showing off her accomplishment at her mother's bidding, all unwitting of what "that one dancing of her feet" would bring forth, is an arresting little re; Salome, the wanton, dancing away the life of the man who scorned her and gloating over his severed head, is a theatrical commonplace.<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  Even for the inimitable Sarah Bernhardt, who, at the height of her celebrity, agreed to premiere Wilde's <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> at the Royal English Opera House in June 1892, the role of guileless-princesscum-wily-harlot presented a challenge. To Robertson's query on whether the French actress would have a <span style="font-style:italic;">rante</span> dance in her place, Bernhardt countered, "I'm going to dance myself."<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> That spectacle, as we know, never took place, as the Examiner of Plays Edward Pigott refused to license the drama then in rehearsals  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> on the grounds of its profane biblical portrayals.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> By the 1930s, however, the play, with its disparate re "Salome the schoolgirl" and "Salome the wanton," Robertson observed at the time, had "taken hold upon the public imagination [and was] widely accepted as Holy Writ."<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> The irony of this volte-face shouldn't be overlooked. In the course of some four decades, Wilde's drama, with its seductive princess that the young Robertson thought amusingly discordant and the examiner of plays judged patently blasphemous, had moved from sacrilege to sacred "high art" text.
	</p>
<p>
	  The story of Wilde's provocative grain of sand twirled, as it were, into cultured pearl has, of course, never wanted for critical or scholarly attention. From the 1890s onward, the play has served as a lightning rod for divisive cultural issues: in its own time, over whether it should be performed as art or banned as sacrilege, and then and since, over its aberrant and unrestrained sexual exhibitionism. Yet Robertson's initial difficulty in reconciling royal schoolgirl and feral seductress, the one arresting, the other commonplace, gestures to a turn in sexual modernity whose cultural impact has still not been fully plumbed, either by scholars' work on art's secular trespass of the sacred or by their work on the play's arguable destabilizing of gender and sexual hierarchies. There is still more to the dissonance of schoolgirl turned voluptuary, especially considering the doyenne Bernhardt's resolve to dance the part compared with the censor Pigott's alarm over the biblical princess's sexual precocity. Indeed, I would go further to say that Wilde's two most outrageous and iconic res of the 1890s, the literary siblings Dorian Gray and Salome, point in tandem to a turn in sexual modernity that undercuts both religious and sexual orthodoxies foundational to the dominant ideology of a firmly ascendant bourgeoisie at the close of the nineteenth century. Wilde's pair of rebellious youths sensationalize the cultural disarrangement arising in the 1890s that would profoundly affect what it means to be a subject in post-industrial, post-consumerist late modernity.<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Nor were the sensational antics of this literary pair alone in publicizing a modern sexual turn. The new subject formation that Wilde's novella and drama exposed to public scrutiny was being propounded as objective knowledge in the social sciences emergent in Wilde's time. Though attracting far less uproar, they too were instrumental in instigating this sexual modernization. On Wilde's behalf, we might say, to extend one of his better-known maxims, that when life imitates art, art is at least alert to the transaction. As Wilde expressed it near the end of the decade of his catastrophic downfall, "I had taken the Drama, the most objective form known to art, and made it as personal a mode of expression as the Lyric or the Sonnet, while enriching the characterisation of the stage, and enlarging--at any rate in the case of <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>--its artistic horizon."<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Whether the same sensibility pertains to knowledge producers when life goes about imitating their ruminations remains to be seen.
	</p>
<p>
	  In this essay, I concern myself only with the eponymous Salome's role in the cultural revamping of the modern subject, specifically, the modern female subject. The scandalous re Wilde imagined in 1892 is exemplary of a modernization that some sixty years later Billy Wilder's film <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> would mock as pernicious dogma. To trace this arc of performance history, I first consider the antecedents of the Salome re  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> in order to foreground Wilde's own distinctive innovations. I then read these against one prominent and contemporaneous corollary coalescing in the social sciences that portends the cultural transformation of sexual modernity under way by the end of the nineteenth century. Thereafter I consider <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome's</span> wider cultural impact, evidenced by the actresses, real and fictional, from Sarah Bernhardt to Norma Desmond, who sought to play the lustful princess. I suggest that as Wilde's <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> transits from culturally transgressive to culturally prestigious art, it spawns an entire industry that, under the banner of Salomania, attracts and produces willing converts on and off stage and screen, and that results in a new, generalizable model of woman to whom we are now all beholden. Salome, the schoolgirl and wanton, becomes not just a theatrical but a cultural commonplace, prized by avant-garde and lowbrow alike, yet bearing within the tragic consequences Norma Desmond makes all too visible.
	</p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>
	    The naif and libertine that Wilde's script had so baldly fused into a single character to captivate London theatergoers in 1892 was, as is well documented, centuries in the making. The longevity of the Salome legend extends to biblical accounts of John the Baptist's beheading in the gospels of Mark and Matthew, which significantly refer only to the daughter of Herodias who dances. The distinction of naming Salome belongs to the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus, writing in the first century who cites the princess by name yet curiously makes no mention of her grisly collusion in Herod Antipas's execution of John the Baptist, despite the historian's otherwise meticulous recitation of Herodian violence.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Noteworthy of the legend, however, is that even with its many ambiguities, "the re of the vengeful temptress," as Helen G. Zagona's study of the legend has pointedly observed, "[is divided] into two distinct personages, the provoked woman and the appealing girl who becomes the instrument of her revenge."<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> So accepted was this division that "Herodias-Salome" acted as the legend's traditional moniker. This longstanding division makes the dissonance arising from the modern merger of the pair into a single innocent <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> culpable princess, which so struck Robertson, all the more telling.
	  </p>
<p>
	    It is with representations of the 1840s, however, that the legendary pair began to coalesce into a single sensuous and passionate re, richly signified in Heinrich Heine's long narrative poem <span style="font-style:italic;">Atta Troll</span> . Heine portentously joins angel and virago together in one character, albeit that of Herodias, who arises not from scripture and history but from folklore, and who is driven by an unrequited love of John the Baptist, manifest in her galloping about the midsummer countryside with the prophet's head in tow.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> More decisive in focusing on the Salome re herself are the paintings done over the next three decades. Among such works is Henri Regnault's sensuous portrait entitled simply "Salome" , which displays a very earthy princess whose coy smile belies the charger and dagger casually held in her lap as if they were mere culinary tools. Still more definitive are Gustave Moreau's two depictions, which shortly followed, that  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> clearly denote a departure from the passive, Opheliaesque likenesses that depicted, in Bram Dijkstra's words, "the love-crazed self-sacrificial woman who most perfectly demonstrated her devotion to her man by descending into madness," once the rage at mid-century.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> Moreau's depictions of a gauzily clad daughter of Judea in the oil painting "Salome Dancing before Herod" (c. 1876) and in the subsequent watercolor "The Apparition" (c. 1876) leave behind the legend's scriptural and Victorian bindings to embrace a new secular awareness of a youthful Salome as a licentious and blameworthy re in her own right. Their decadence is outrageously extended in Edouard Toudouze's realistic "Salome Triumphant" (ca. 1886).<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> His scarcely pubescent Salome, languorously recumbent on an ornate throne, impishly licking her fingers as she looks directly at the spectator, and seemingly untouched by the great calamity at her feet, offers the self-absorbed debauchery of nymphet harlotry, an unequivocal sign of the legend's modernization at the fin de siecle.
	  </p>
<p>
	    These artists' preoccupation with the spectacle of the Salome re is matched literarily by Gustave Flaubert's tale "Herodias"  and Joris-Karl Huysmans' decadent novel <span style="font-style:italic;">Against Nature</span> , which Wilde would later use to corrupt Dorian Gray. While Flaubert ostensibly refocuses his story on an eponymous Herodias, recapitulating Zagona's observation of a "vengeful temptress [divided] into two distinct personages," he nonetheless portrays the daughter Salome as a tempting sight from the outset of the story.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> The one striking moment of mother/daughter identification comes as Salome removes her veil in prelude to her dance: "It was Herodias," the narrator observes, "as she used to look in her youth."<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> In this moment of resemblance, the youthful princess assumes precedence over her mother, and, in the thrall of her mesmerizing dance, delivered with half-closed eyes, rippling belly, and quivering breasts, Salome unconsciously beguiles an overly aroused tetrarch to deliver the prophet's head as a vengeful Herodias had schemed.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> Joris-Karl Huysmans' <span style="font-style:italic;">Against Nature</span> takes Flaubert's near insensible dancing princess and renders her wholly spectacle, first as depraved erotic royalty and then outcast harlot. Under the dissipated connoisseurship of the reclusive protagonist Des Esseintes, who spends his evenings rapturously gazing at Moreau's two paintings, Salome moves from supreme object of ecstasy "that superhuman, strange Salome of whom he had dreamt" to "truly a whore, obedient to her temperament of a cruel and passionate woman."<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Nowhere does the princess resemble the guileless, obedient daughter of Herodias, but appears rather as her own willing and wanton agent.
	  </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>
	    It is this discursive and spectacular promiscuity that Wilde stages as performative and tragic. In the process, his interpretation becomes distinctly more radical. His Salome is not merely a tempting spectacle to be exploited, ogled, and denigrated. In stepping from print and canvas onto stage, Wilde's Salome now both looks and acts on her own, and thereby concentrates the legend's time-honored twin reference of "Herodias-Salome" to a single youthful temptress,<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> transforming the princess into  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the iconic re we recognize today. The play <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> becomes in time not just "Holy Writ," as Robertson observed, but its heroine becomes a re of near public worship as the princess makes the transit from culturally transgressive to culturally prestigious ornament post-Wilde.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The key innovation in Wilde's drama is that royal mother and daughter become patent rivals. While Herodias remains the depraved queen, the calculating and sterile wife of the former tetrarch's brother, she now protests rather than instigates her second husband's leering attention to her daughter and her dancing--and not because of maternal concern, but out of obvious envy. Mother and daughter's desires only converge with the beheading of the prophet, an act of cruelty Herodias can urge on Salome only from the periphery of the dramatic action. Wilde's upstaging of even a menacing Herodias points to an acute shift in cultural power that would have registered with a fin de siecle English audience by then keenly alert to the alarms raised over degeneracy and still subject to a long-reigning queen. At one extreme, Wilde's demotion of Herodias symbolically renders passe domestic ideology's sanctification of motherhood, already insinuated by her barrenness. At another, her evident lust, as a divorced woman married to her husband's brother, devalues that prized Victorian jewel, "the angel in the house." Wilde's dramatic rebuff serves not only to highlight Herodias's wickedness. It also brazenly transfers the prestige and power a woman enjoyed in marriage and motherhood to a mere youth, in this case an impulsive teenage princess, Graham Robertson's arresting schoolgirl. Wilde, I suggest, seizes from the strong-willed queen mother the lead role and emotional center of the drama, which had prevailed from the Evangelists to Flaubert, and confers them on her pubescent daughter, cast as sexually precocious and volatile. This was as radical a transposition as there could be in the 1890s, given the grave importance that high-minded bourgeoisie assigned to all matters sexual. Putting aside the play's prescience and prohibition for a moment, consider the hard time Wilde would serve for having his own amorous liaisons become public far too soon.
	  </p>
<p>
	    To make my point about Wilde's provocation of the fairer sex, however, allow me a brief excursus on similar literary works captivating the public imagination at the turn of the century. Like Wilde's drama <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>, the popular thrillers <span style="font-style:italic;">Dracula</span> by Bram Stoker  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Trilby</span> by Georges Du Maurier  shocked and excited audiences with their sensational representations of decollete ingenues who revealingly undergo a sexual awakening by paradoxically falling into a trancelike state. Stoker's Lucy Westenra and Mina Murray and Du Maurier's eponymous Irish <span style="font-style:italic;">grisette</span> Trilby O'Ferrall all experience a depraved seduction during somnambulistic episodes. In these accounts, Stoker and Du Maurier blur the boundaries separating their heroines' states of consciousness and unconsciousness, of knowledge and ignorance, of self-restraint and self-indulgence, in order to trigger other states, ones of restlessness and over-stimulation that seemingly incite these vulnerable protagonists, pubescent adolescents all, to act on carnal impulses loitering mutely below the threshold of their conscious selves, ready to burst forth when provoked. Female desires, in other words, too dangerous to countenance privately, were publicly exposed in print as lurking just beneath the surface of conscious volition--and all the more so when it came to youthful heroines. The cravings of these  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> ingenues are shown to move from the inside out. Unconscious and irresistible, their inner stirrings are acted on and out in public, scandalizing and thrilling readers in turn, and so too with Wilde's aestheticized Salome.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Not only does Wilde turn the spotlight on the lissome princess in the foremost role of his dramatis personae, but he also makes unambiguous her libidinous transformation with his invention of the "dance of the seven veils." No single stage direction has likely been more provocative or had a greater impact on a play's interpretation than the simple coinage Wilde inserts in his script.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Salome's act of spellbound unveiling unleashes her latent, innermost desires, signaling her abandonment of girlhood, and her enthrallment links her to the sensational ingenues Lucy, Mina, and Trilby. The act makes visible her sexual latency first exhibited by her unbridled looking and arrogant commands, in keeping with a royal family steeped in profligacy against which a strident Baptist loudly rails. In such a milieu the surfeit of desires she arouses permeates the action of the play that the censor Pigott disparaged as "half-Biblical, half-pornographic."<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> From the outset, Salome's nascent sexuality excites her illicit attraction to the prophet, provokes the captain of the guard to suicide, and tantalizes her uncle/stepfather the tetrarch, who offers to exchange anything in his possession for what amounts to a lap dance. For this one prurient diversion, he asks, commands, and implores his stepdaughter, despite her unequivocal and repeated refusal, "I have no desire to dance, Tetrarch," until she finally yields.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Once within the entranced state of her dance, in the thrall of her body's movement, so sensationally described by Flaubert and Huysmans, latency becomes reality. She undergoes a sexual initiation even more scandalous, with its whiff of incestuous royal congress, than Stoker's or Du Maurier's vulnerable heroines. Thereafter, a debauched princess cruelly demands Jokanaan's head, announcing in effect her own sexual emancipation: "I do not heed my mother. It is for mine own pleasure that I ask the head of Jokanaan in a silver charger."<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> This she then confirms by ecstatically kissing the prophet's bloody mouth.
	  </p>
<p>
	    In Wilde's <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>, excessive and perverse desires lead a self-absorbed princess into transgressions that stun even a dissolute tetrarch. Nevertheless, it is the adolescent Salome, as subject and object of manifold desires, who is the trigger for the chaos that descends upon the royal household. When the tetrarch commands, "Kill that woman!" the great incongruity of schoolgirl turned wanton that troubled Robertson is played out.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> And yet, Herod's denunciation of his stepdaughter as "that woman," which conceals his own culpability, stamps the youthful Salome less as murderous woman and more as a "<span style="font-style:italic;">petite fille fatale</span>."<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    Qualms over Salome's transformation from spoiled princess to predatory courtesan expressed by censor, critic, and public would erupt over its staging in Britain for more than four decades. The drama's treatment of promiscuity, incest, and revenge, which hinge on a preternaturally aroused teenage princess, caused public controversy despite the ban on its public performance.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> Yet Wilde's portrayal of a nubile princess's sexual initiation and of the transgressions that transpire at Herod's court marked a disarrangement of power relations around sexual latency that had even more determinant representations in the social sciences, with far less public outcry, a decisive instance of which I now take up.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>
	    Among the many counterparts to Salome's transformation that we might identify in the social sciences contemporaneous with Wilde's sensational fin de siecle drama, Sigmund Freud's fragment on Dora famously stands out. It works expressly through a similar use of trancelike states under the rubric of dreamwork to arrive at a depraved seduction that marks Dora, like Salome, as both source and sorcerer. And in step with Wilde's princess and with Stoker's and du Maurier's susceptible youths, Dora's motivation coheres with the modern formulation of depth psychology, arising as it does from innermost desires of which she is unaware--a formula with which Freud notably attempts and fails to make his female protagonist complicit.<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Yet as demonstrative as is Freud's analysis of a schoolgirl's alleged secret lust, a broader and more useful model for the categorical shift under way, one that also accounts for Dora's predicament, is the accession of a new subject on the modern scene, the re of the adolescent. In hindsight, the works of Wilde, Stoker, Du Maurier, as well as Freud, appear not merely to coincide with but more accurately to correspond with the theorization in the social sciences in the 1890s of this highly sexualized and unstable category. Indeed, a licentious Salome meets all the criteria--highly impressionable, sensation-driven, self-indulgent, extremely excitable--judged characteristics of adolescence according to its principal theorist and popularizer, G. Stanley Hall.<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> In his monumental two-volume study <span style="font-style:italic;">Adolescence</span>, written in the 1890s, Hall declares adolescence to be <span style="font-style:italic;">the</span> decisive phase of human, not just female, maturation, one therefore in urgent need of objective investigation that the social sciences were best suited to furnish. Calling adolescence a second birth, as critical an event as biological birth, Hall effectively grants "the period of sexual maturity" its own privileged social and cultural space, and demarcates it as an object of knowledge to be studied (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adolescence</span>, 1:xiii, 2:40).
	  </p>
<p>
	    We may gather what is at stake during this precarious state of disequilibrium from Hall description that adolescence "is preeminently the age of sense, and hence prone to sensuousness not only in taste and sex, where the danger is greatest, but in the domain of each of the sense species." And, he continues, "whatever our philosophy, it is never so nearly true as at this age, that there is nothing in the intellect that does not get there through the senses, for now the chief activity of the mind is working over the sense capital thus acquired" (2:38-39). The dangers of adolescence, Hall states, "are part of the price modern man must pay for the prolonged prenubile apprenticeship to life" (2:108n1).<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> As in the works of his contemporaries in the arts, including Wilde's version of Salome, Hall's exploration of adolescence marks it as a dangerous and sensation-driven condition, a universal period of great instability and of de facto licensed hedonism, and a state requiring the most vigilant supervision--supervision that is not to be found in Salome's permissive royal family.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Hall, a committed Darwinist, attributes this economic apprenticeship of the senses to sexual evolution and to what he views as humankind's increasing advancement. Yet in a curious turn he ascribes both the evolution and advancement not to nature per se, but to modernization. As he puts it, the "progressive increase of this interval is,"  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> in his judgment, "another index of the degree of civilization" (2:232). In other words, human sexual evolution is fundamentally progressive and dependent on civilization's advance. Correspondingly, the more civilized and the more modern humans become, the more acute, prolonged, and unstable becomes "the period of sexual maturity."<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> The price of modernity, then, is protracted adolescence--with, however, two notable qualifications. "Primitives" and women, according to Hall, lacking the same evolutionary aptitude as men, are not advantaged by modernization to the same degree, but persist in a near perpetual state of adolescence.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Their virtually irremediable circumstance, while it necessitates greater disciplinary oversight on their behalf, does not, however, trouble his larger argument. Nor, instructively, does the logic that advanced civilization only lengthens rather than reduces the duration of adolescence for those most favored with evolutionary potential. For the privileged among the male sex, the more modern a society, the longer the apprenticeship of adolescence. Strikingly, and for those who are evolutionarily advantaged and those less advantaged, adolescence moves from being understood as an acute final stage of human maturation to a chronic condition of modernity. The brevity of youth is suddenly conceived as lasting progressively longer, conditional on sustained modernization. In a sense, Hall's treatment of adolescence entwines the time of adolescence and modernity itself, making them mutually constitutive. In so doing, Hall and his successors in the social sciences turn what is at first conceived as a passing stage of hedonistic experimentation into a distinct and recognizable subject, a full-blown re, the adolescent, while at the same time tacitly indicating that the duration of the developmental stage is open-ended.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Such teleology implies lifelong adolescence, or, put another way, youthfulness becomes teleological. Rather than a prerequisite of adulthood, adolescence emerges as a dynamic and distinct condition, an engine of intense vitality enticing all ages.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Granting its attraction, we might more productively view adolescence from Hall forward as a modern cultural phenomenon and apparatus, instead of the recognizable ahistorical and universal re delineated in the social sciences. Though the re of the adolescent did aggregate new forms of capital, consciousness, and identity in youthfulness across gender, class, race, and national lines, it eventually exceeded, as Hall anticipated, the temporal and taxonomic limits once accorded it as the period of adolescence lengthened. But when viewed instead as a cultural apparatus, adolescence can also be seen putting in motion new expressions of subjectivity concurrent with metropolitan populations ever more prone to excitement, novelty, and innovation, and ever more obsessed with their own sensual gratification. This is the precise dilemma that Wilde's most iconic heroine Salome presciently throws into relief. Though the subjectively disorienting effects of modernizing, consumption-oriented, urban life may not have exact equivalents in an opulent and licentious royal household of ancient Judea, Wilde's drama does bespeak the modern anxieties of an era branded as "decadent" on one side of the Atlantic and "gilded" on the other, both distinguished by their conspicuous consumption. In consequence, it is no great leap to suggest that the representative of Hall's state of unleashed hedonism may be found in a spoiled Salome's enraptured dance of the seven veils, her enthrallment signifying, like her  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> entranced fin de siecle counterparts, her awakened adolescence. Let me further suggest that such enthrallment would come to attract more than one princess aspirant and, given its cultural enticements, even those disqualified by age. All of the foregoing speaks to the disarrangement of power relations lodged in the social science category of adolescence and in the self-identified subjects who would come to imitate and then practice it--changes that the performance of Wilde's play provocatively stages.
	  </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>
	    The early decades of the twentieth century saw the Salome craze precipitated by Wilde's transgressive play effervesce on more than one continent. To suggest the play's reach, consider its performance in Japanese theaters from 1914 to 1926 that Ayako Kano documents as being truly transformative of women. Besides Wilde's <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>, Kano credits such plays as Henrik Ibsen's <span style="font-style:italic;">A Doll House</span>  and George Bernard Shaw's <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Warren's Profession</span> (1893-94) with introducing the "New Woman" to modern Japanese theater and its audiences.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> These dramas gave actresses, who had only just regained the stage after a hiatus of four centuries, roles that were at once emotionally and physically demanding. With <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> in particular, Kano contends, "the alignment between gender, sex, sexuality, and performance" underwent a profound and sudden shift "from gender defined as theatrical achievement [i.e., gender as artifice, that which male actors had for centuries performed], to gender defined as grounded in the visible body and as basis for theatrical expression."<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> With estimates of the number of different productions of Wilde's play performed in a twelve-year period ranging from 27 to more than 120, most of these concentrated in Tokyo, little wonder that young women would take to styling their hair in a fashion they dubbed "<span style="font-style:italic;">Salome-Maki</span>" in imitation of the hedonistic re.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> Salomania had taken hold.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Yet when Kano avers that Salome "epitomized the new definition of womanhood as rooted in the physical body and of woman's body as the basis for acting," what perhaps went unasked is exactly which model of the modern woman was being performed on stage and copied off.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> To answer, I suggest two related innovations: under the avatar of <span style="font-style:italic;">liberating modernity</span> we observe none other than the <span style="font-style:italic;">sexualized adolescent</span> body. In other words, the new generalized category of "woman" arising from the outre re of Salome relies on an adolescent model that is constitutive of modernity, as Hall's theory implied, and is emancipatory to boot, at least according to Kano. The performance of this "new definition of womanhood" begins to resemble not a little our fin de siecle ingenues' enthralled emancipation from girlhood, but with this complication: actresses in the footlights and their imitators in the audience had not only to perform Salome's adolescent body but significantly look the part too. And from the outset, whether in Tokyo, Moscow, Berlin, Paris, London, or New York, there was no shortage of actresses and dancers--and sopranos, in the case of Richard Strauss's operatic adaptation--on several continents vying to perform the role. Nor was there an end to the Salomania their performances excited, as has been shown by William Tydeman, Stephen Price,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Robert Tanitch, and, more recently, by Peter Wollen, Susan Glenn, and Ayako Kano.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> Along with the Japanese actresses drawn early to the role, such as Kawakami Sadayakko, Matsui Sumako, and Shokyokusai Tenkatsu, we can add those in the West--among them, Sarah Bernhardt, Loie Fuller, Maud Allan, Alla Nazimova, Tilla Durieux, Ada Overton Walker, Theda Bara, Ida Rubenstein, and Gloria Swanson. By 1930, a transgressive <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> prestigious Salome had become a thriving industry.
	  </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>
	    The paradox from the start was that the leading actresses who could rightly command the role of Salome scarcely resembled a nubile princess, as was obvious in Wilde's first choice for the role, Sarah Bernhardt. Although Wilde would claim in 1900 that age had nothing to do with acting and that Bernhardt, alone, was best suited to carry off the part of the licentious princess, a role he was never to see performed, the "Divine Sarah" was already a generous forty-eight years when she agreed in 1892 to perform Salome, and to include the notorious dance of the seven veils.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> It is certainly true that the celebrated Bernhardt's stage stamina was unmatched, that her slender re well into middle-age made possible a classical and popular repertoire of dramatic roles as virgins, saints, harlots, peasants, princesses, and queens, and that Bernhardt's grand style and Wilde's symbolist drama hardly invited a realistic presentation in any event. Yet despite its symbolist ambitions, there is still no getting around the outre spectacle the play made of the pubescent body of the youthful Salome. Nor is there getting around how Bernhardt's body was to be veiled and unveiled during her seductive caper--a robing/disrobing that was set to rely, in an ironic twist, on stage costumes from her role as Cleopatra. Bernhardt's suitability for the role led Vincent O'Sullivan, the American writer and sometime confederate of Wilde, to remark: "It is a hard strain on plausibility," he remarked, "to see Wilde's 'Salome' played by even a young actress."<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> And Bernhardt, at forty-eight, was to his mind an inappropriate choice. Marguerite Coe suggests that audiences may have agreed, because the sensuous roles Bernhardt did perform between 1890 and 1902 were not well received, leading the stage doyenne to adopt more <span style="font-style:italic;">travesti</span> parts during the last two decades of her career in addition to her tried and true revivals.<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> Still, there remained talk on the circuit that Bernhardt would one day take the role of Salome.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> While age may not have deterred middle-age actresses like Bernhardt from the role of a lascivious princess, the opposite did not obtain. Take the reaction of another of Wilde's actress-heartthrobs when asked by the dramatist to play the mature Mrs. Erlynne, who has an adult illegitimate daughter, for <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Windermere's Fan</span> . Affronted, Lillie Langtry asked Wilde: "[A]m I old enough to have a grown-up daughter of any description?"<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    Ironically, the honor of debuting the role of Salome did fall to a mother of an adult daughter, the forty-six-year-old French actress Lina Munte. Munte's early theater credits included roles in such sensational dramas as Alexandre Dumas' <span style="font-style:italic;">La Dame aux Camelias</span>, Emile Zola's <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Assommoir</span>, Catule Mendes's <span style="font-style:italic;">Justice</span> before a decade spent  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> in Moscow and a return to Paris in 1893 led to a connection with theater director and actor Aurelien Lugne-Poe and the leading role of Salome.<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> It was Lugne-Poe's experimental and private Theatre de l'Oeuvre, founded in Paris in 1893, that staged the world premiere of Wilde's play in 1896, albeit "world premiere" is slightly misleading. To circumvent possible legal interdiction, the play was not announced until the last minute and, as further insurance, the part of the page was assigned the actress Suzanne Despres in order to accentuate the surfeit of female passion on display and minimize the drama's homoeroticism, a modification that Strauss's opera would maintain on similar grounds.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> And apparently, the exhibition of female desire succeeded. Jean de Tinan, writing in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercure de France</span>, fairly effused of Munte's performance that no other actress "would have allowed me to feel the shiver of feverish sensation that Mlle Lina Munte provided me in <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>."<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> That critics singled out her voice and beauty over any mesmerism of her dance may be explained by the challenge of twirling about with a patched-up orb serving as the unfortunate prophet's head, which had been shattered to pieces in the final rehearsal.<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a></p>

	    Although a second production was not mounted until the start of the new century, Wilde's <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> would enjoy a remarkable run in its many guises, ranging from high to low culture, generating Salomania wherever it appeared--on stage, in print, in design, in fashion, in opera, in photography, in film, and worldwide in theaters, concert halls, runways, tent shows, and vaudeville houses--and earning its mantle as a veritable industry, several examples of which indicate the great pull the re of Salome exercised on the public imagination.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>
	    That Wilde's entire drama could be reduced to the single performance of "the dance of the seven veils," on which whole careers were spun, indicates just how tantalizing and wide-ranging was <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome's</span> appeal. Among the most successful interpreters of the dance was the Canadian-born Maud Allan who, in 1905, used Salome to launch her  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> career as performer. Her dance <span style="font-style:italic;">The Vision of Salome,</span> which sheared off all of the play but the biblical princess's erotic whirling, not to mention everything else but a few jewels, two breastplates, and some diaphanous fabric, captivated audiences. Exhibiting female sexual latency unleashed through dance, Allan encapsulated the princess's transformation from naive to concupiscent ingenue, and her performance made her the toast of London and beyond for almost a decade with her lithe body, girlish re, and "kittenish immaturity"--fame that lasted into her late thirties.

	    Her decision to stage a comeback in 1918 is instructive of the profound impact that adolescent hedonism was having on the public imagination by the second decade of the century. As well, her decision to do so in her mid-forties shows how irresistible Salomania was for a middle-age actress attempting to regain the limelight. In 1918 Allan agreed to perform Salome's dance as part of her dramatic lead in a full-scale London production of Wilde's play. Yet, her Salome set in motion a legal wrangle and national scandal more reactionary than the censor Pigott's some twenty-five years earlier. Allan's celebrated case was precipitated by the virulently jingoistic M.P. Noel Pemberton-Billing,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> who blatantly engineered a public provocation by accusing the performer in print of a "cult of the clitoris." Allan's predatory sexuality was alleged to be so alluring and pervasive that she and her devotees were jeopardizing Britain's war effort. Allan and producer J. T. Grein accordingly sued Billing for libel, occasioning the trial that surpassed <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> in sheer sensationalism, with unfounded fantasies about Allan's sexual proclivities passed off as expert medical testimony by the physician Serrell Cooke.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> Allowed into the record, Cooke's allegations proved decisive in Billing's favor. At forty-five, Allan stood condemned, for all intents and purposes, of a convincing performance of a depraved pubescent teenager. Acting and looking the part, the mature Allan had become the depraved adolescent Salome. The actress <span style="font-style:italic;">was</span> the sordid princess, an out-f-control teenager threatening the safety of the British realm in wartime--a contorted and ludicrous instance of life imitating art that might have amused Wilde had not the consequences for Allan and company proved so damaging, as were those that followed Wilde's own trials. Yet while Billing, like Herod, had succeeded in condemning "that woman," the scandal hardly grazed Salome's popularity. In fact, outrageous as were Billing's accusations against Allan, what he ultimately feared was very close to what that modern Babylon, Hollywood, was fast concocting.
	  </p>
<p>
	    An ocean and continent away, in the very same year of Allan's courtroom scandal, silver-screen siren Theda Bara had been performing her own shocking rendition of a decadent Salome on a Fox studio set in the California desert. The notable shift from the promiscuous Salome dramatized by Wilde to the promiscuous Salome the actress, so scandalous in the Billing libel suit, was in fact the raison d'etre of the costly feature-length film <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>, starring the vampish actress. Bara, considered Hollywood's first manufactured celebrity of a studio system bent in 1918 on turning the new medium of film into a commercial "dream factory," was a bit player when discovered by William Fox in 1914. Fox chose Bara on the advice of theater producer Robert Hilliard for the starring role in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fool There Was</span>, an adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's 1897 poem "The Vampire." Hilliard had counseled Fox that it was far more lucrative to "put the girl you choose under contract, and the part will make her" than to negotiate contracts with well-known, pricey, and temperamental actresses.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> The vampire role of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Fool There Was</span> turned Bara into a star overnight, helped by an entirely fictionalized background fabricated on her behalf by studio publicists. In advance of the film's 1915 release, they provided Bara with an exotic orientalized past that, for a time, the press and public swallowed whole. Conceived in the shadow of the Sphinx, she was alleged to be the progeny of an Italian painter father and a French actress mother. In reality, she was Theodosia Goodman, born to an unexceptional Jewish family in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1885.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> But that was not the only hoax. Significantly, Fox's publicists shaved five years from Bara's age, giving her birth year as 1890. The five-year subtraction was insurance that Bara would appear in 1915 as an irresistible vamp just at the limits of adolescence, and not be mistaken for the mature woman she already was at age thirty.<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> Maturity, in short, had become a liability in an industry rapidly becoming dependent on celebrities and close-ups.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The lengths taken to identify Bara with the vamped ingenues whose awakened sexuality rocked readers at the fin de siecle highlight the flagrant staginess film studios  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> deliberately exploited as the studio system took hold. The trancelike states late Victorian thrillers had imposed on vulnerable heroines were now cast on performers and public alike. Film made Bara that creature commodity, a star, and one that studios could reproduce continuously as the industry grew, to satisfy a mass audience's whetted appetite for vampish roguery. Between 1915 and 1920, the actress starred in forty feature-length motion pictures, ten alone in 1915, driven by a mania for her tantalizing seductiveness.<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> The upshot was, as Kevin Starr points out in his study of progressive-era Hollywood, that Bara made overt female sexuality, however outre, compelling and imitable in the late 1910s, similar to the effect of the stage performances of Japanese actresses above.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> The difference, however, was the scale of reproduction. We might say in today's patois that Bara's forty films helped ensure that the adolescent model of female sexuality went viral. A case study in mechanical <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> vampiric--that is, proliferative--reproduction, wholly ungrounded in any material reality, Bara became that modern creature, a mass commodity, albeit an extremely valuable one as Robert Hilliard had anticipated. In tandem with that commodification came a generalizable woman based on the inflated transgressions of late adolescence. We might say that the thirty-three-year-old Bara's starring performance as Salome negated the incongruity Robertson observed in 1892, making the teenage temptress a "theatrical commonplace."

	    The actress's manufactured stardom, beholden to roles that trace back to the depraved young heroines of Stoker's <span style="font-style:italic;">Dracula</span>, made the part of a transgressive Salome  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> ideally suited to Bara's notoriety as a vamp, thus signifying that it was the princess Salome who fit the celebrity Bara and not the other way around, the reversal that had caused Allan such distress before a London magistrate. Yet while the part may have been a perfect fit, the thirty-something Bara's mature body was apparently not. Two years earlier, when Fox cast Bara to play the youthful Juliet for his 1916 production of <span style="font-style:italic;">Romeo and Juliet</span>, there was worry over "large, bosomy, and rather heavily thighed Theda with Romeo's poetic outpourings of his love, which would be flashed on the screen in subtitles."<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> Such talk followed her onto the set of her 1917 film <span style="font-style:italic;">Cleopatra</span>, with one press member calling her Cleopatra "plump."<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> Whether because of this comment or the prospect of more costumes of breastplates, pearls, and chiffon, Bara undertook stringent dieting to reduce her weight in 1918 for <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>, the thinnest she would be in any film.<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> Notwithstanding her countless fans or great celebrity, Bara's struggle to look <span style="font-style:italic;">la petite fille fatale</span> clearly demonstrates the prestige of the idealized adolescent body: it was not enough to <span style="font-style:italic;">be</span> Salome or Salome to <span style="font-style:italic;">be</span> her, the actress had to <span style="font-style:italic;">look</span> the adolescent part as well, no matter the health cost to an adult woman. More to the point, Bara's crash-dieting materially and symbolically captures the reverse of the excited enthrallment that swirled our fin de siecle ingenues into adolescence. Instead of hypnotic dance moves launching adolescence, Bara gives us the lengths a mature woman would take to return to its hedonic state--no less a performance, a point elaborated below.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The finished eight-reel film <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>, with a cast of two thousand and a set constructed by eight hundred artisans, was promoted by the studio as based on the historian Josephus to skirt censorship. Bearing little resemblance to the historian's account, the film was also a significant departure from Wilde's. Gone is Herodias the mother, and all who appear in her wake seem mere servings to slake Salome's thirst for mayhem. Over the course of the film, the princess, now the cousin of the tetrarch Herod, has David the High Priest drowned; attempts first to poison Herod's wife, Miriam, and then has Herod execute her; and, on the heels of her signature dance, demands and kisses the prophet's head; thereafter, with her execution looming, an immense desert storm swirls; roll credits.<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a> Noting that the film had "few equals," the reviewer for the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> singled out Bara, who was "every minute the vampire, in manner and movement and expression."<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> In a word, the film <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> spectacularized adolescent sexuality. Despite its popularity and though Bara fiercely defended her artistic rendering of Salome, the film would be her last major motion-picture credit.<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> By 1919, the box office made clear that the now thirty-four-year-old vamp wasn't the must-see siren she had been. Revealingly, both Allan and Bara, who each enjoyed a near meteoric rise in popularity, had no real public platform once their performance of transgressive sexual exhibitionism had played out. Their careers indicate that on twentieth-century film sets as well as, increasingly, on the stage, age and acting, life and art, intermingled--as they had not in the era when the Divine Sarah first commanded the boards. Suggestive of modernity's infatuation and entwinement with adolescence, an actress lacking a youthful appearance was at risk of losing her stardom and her profession.
	  </p>
<p>
	    One additional instance, the exceptional 1923 film by Alla Nazimova, <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome, An Historical Phantasy by Oscar Wilde</span>, exemplifies the great attraction of Salome's sexual  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> hedonism and actresses' attempt to achieve the youthful looks that kept them relevant and marketable. Nazimova's <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> would be the first full-scale production of Wilde's play by a woman, and not just any woman but a highly regarded actress. In contrast to Allan and Bara, Nazimova, a Russian Jewish emigre who had studied with Stanislavsky, was a serious actress with impressive stage and film credentials. Having arrived in the United States in 1905 with virtually no English, she quickly mastered the language and the New York stage with performances in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Doll's House</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Hedda Gabler</span>, and took that success onto the silent screen, acting in eleven films by 1918 for Metro Pictures before venturing to produce and star in motion pictures based on the avant-garde dramas of her stage career. A celebrity but no studio makeover, Nazimova singularly fashioned her own stardom. At the height of her career she personified Hollywood's glitzy notoriety with her palatial Sunset Boulevard estate, wild parties, and stormy liaisons with both sexes. As much a diva as Bernhardt, her flair for the avant-garde, her extravagance, her flamboyant and uninhibited lifestyle marked her a 1920s liberated and very modern woman.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Nowhere are these attributes more vibrantly exhibited than in Nazimova's highbrow experimental interpretation of Wilde's play, a far remove from Fox's commercial epic. Lavish in its Aubrey Beardsley-inspired costumes, art deco tableaux, and stylized camera work, hers is a stunning amalgamation of fin de siecle and 1920s aesthetics. There is, moreover, a striking resemblance in pose and affect between Nazimova's pouty, self-absorbed Salome and Toudouze's 1886 nymphet in "Salome Triumphant." Their similarity suggests that Nazimova's rendition aimed precisely at representing Salome as a youthful, self-absorbed, pampered, and impetuous adolescent in order to dramatize both the young princess's sexual awakening and her hedonic excess once aroused and spurned within a decadent palace. That her film remains an exceptional instance of female modernism, as Patricia White maintains, is unquestioned.<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> But the film also operates in the broader cultural context where adulthood was being overtaken by an adolescent model in which all expressions of embodied female sexuality, no matter how polymorphously transgressive, were implicated.
	  </p>
<p>
	    In taking the role of Salome, the actress emphatically insisted on representing the princess as a fourteen-year-old adolescent, something of a challenge for the forty-two-year-old actress despite her very slender, gamine-like re.<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a> The film's opening credits even make a show of the princess's innocent youthfulness, identifying her as "an uncontaminated blossom in a wilderness of evil."<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a> Nor was the princess Salome the first role in which Nazimova would actively try to conceal her middle age, according to her biographer, Gavin Lambert. For the role of Nora in her production of <span style="font-style:italic;">A Doll's House</span> , film photographer Charles Van Enger "made Nazimova look ten years younger, not by obvious soft focus but by subtle control of lighting."<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> Van Enger applied this same lighting technique to <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> with great effect. In addition, art director Natacha Rambova (nee Winifred Shaughnessy) designed special costumes to slenderize the actress's re to pubescent thinness, particularly for her provocative dance of the seven veils, by using "a sheathlike tunic of white satin, with a rubber lining (specially made by a manufacturer of automobile tires) that clung to her body."<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a> Innovative lighting  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to mask her age and costumes to compress her re were effective in medium- and long-range shots of the actress. Yet it was one thing for a forty-two-year-old Nazimova to look the part of the fully clothed, young mother Nora and quite another to seem a teenager en deshabille in <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>. Lighting and costume were little help in close-ups of the actress, and for close-ups no mere <span style="font-style:italic;">rante</span> could be substituted. These shots made all too apparent the incongruity of Nazimova's performance as a royal nymphet.

	    As with Bara's strict dieting, Nazimova's squeezing into a rubberized white tunic to effect a fourteen-year-old body makes clear the reverse transformation expected of a mature actress to embody the role of the nubile princess. Indeed, Nazimova's contortion may be different in kind, but it is hardy different in effect from the constrictive binding of that Victorian relic, the corset. The symbolic valence of this <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>, notwithstanding its aesthetic bravura and present-day cult following, cannot be overstressed, especially given that the actress Nazimova and the designer Rambova were both self-identified, ultra-modern female artists. As a film of its time, Nazimova's performance in an avant-garde production, as was Bara's in a commercial production and Allan's in a courtroom, actively promoted the adolescent Salome as the embodiment of a modern woman's liberated sexuality--that this performance was also a marked liability for her mature body was rapidly becoming an open secret.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p>
	    The radical performances of these mature actresses highlight the extraordinary change occurring to the definition of woman that the director Billy Wilder makes the tragic focal point of the 1950 film <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span>, featuring in the marquee role the fifty-one-year-old former Hollywood silent-screen star Gloria Swanson.<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a> In addition to the critiques of the film as a <span style="font-style:italic;">noir</span> indictment of the studio system, of celebrity culture, of a decadent Hollywood, and of a corrupt postwar America, let me also propose that the fifty-year-old silent-screen diva Norma Desmond played by Swanson is Wilde's Salome <span style="font-style:italic;">in extremis</span>, and, for Wilder, the abandoned love child of the silent-screen era--the modern woman. The once glamorous Desmond, casualty of the talkies, lives on in the occluded interior of a crumbling Hollywood mansion where time has ceased. The celluloid realm of film and a phantom one of fans substitute for the outside world. The one physic needed to restore the aging film star to her lost grandeur of the 1920s and to her adoring fans, whose fan mail her butler Max, former husband and onetime director, sedulously forges, is a major starring role. That role, the one that she has been adapting in seclusion for years and that ensnares the down-on-his-heels screenwriter Joe Gillis, who scrambles onto her driveway on the lam from repo-agents, is, of course, none other than Salome. From the opening sequence that closes in on a shot of a dead Joe Gillis, the audience knows that the head of this hapless Hollywood-diviner-cum-diffident-gigolo floating faced down in a cistern will land on a platter. And thus it comes as no surprise at the film's end that the last close-up of the once incomparable Norma Desmond will likely be a mug shot. Though the film relies on the cynical Gillis's posthumous voiceover, and thus we see Desmond's pent-up desires only through his jaded perspective, it is Desmond's tragic downfall in tandem with and in thrall to the role of Salome that the film chronicles.<a name="f63-text" href="#f63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    Everywhere insinuated is the decadence of this modern Babylon and its royalty. The cutthroat and philistine studio system that the disillusioned Gillis, played by William Holden, quips can turn a script about Okies in the dust bowl into a movie shot on a torpedo boat is one with the extravagant spectacle of Cecil B. DeMille's set of <span style="font-style:italic;">Samson and Delilah</span>, itself an ironic jab at commercial screen epics still being cranked out at midcentury. Compared with the money-hungry and heady make-believe world of the studio, Desmond's setting offers up a fantastic, if desiccated, dominion. The vaulted and ornate interior of her "grim Sunset castle" evokes an overwrought and oppressive mausoleum, with its obsessed denizen a pale descendant of the entranced ingenues who once stalked the pages of fin de siecle thrillers.<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> Gillis notably calls Desmond "a sleepwalker," adding, "still sleepwalking along the giddy heights of a lost career, plain crazy," an aimless enthrallment compared to her youthful forerunners.<a name="f65-text" href="#f65"><sup>65</sup></a> As well, he mordantly dubs Desmond's bridge partners, a trio of faded silent-film stars, the "Waxworks." Decay and decrepitude abound, which the brash Gillis misses no opportunity to disparage, even down to Desmond's tuberose fragrance, a funereal blossom in its Victorian heyday.<a name="f66-text" href="#f66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    The elixir that will rejuvenate the actress, however, is the role of Salome, and the unexpected appearance of the writer Gillis provides the opportunity. "What a woman!"  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> she exclaims to Gillis, waving reams of pages for the script. "What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy Man. She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils. He rejects her, so she demands his head on golden tray, kissing his cold dead lips."<a name="f67-text" href="#f67"><sup>67</sup></a> Her excitement makes clear that Desmond's florid Salome is no fledgling teenage temptress but first and foremost "that woman," who loves, is scorned, and murders. Enlisting Gillis in her fantasy, the self-absorbed Desmond seems unaware of the incongruity of a fifty-year-old playing an alluring temptress, much less a teenage nymphet on screen. In her self-delusion, the actress imagines that here at last with Gillis's help is her chance to stage, not "a comeback," as that would admit an all-too-depressed reality, but a "return," a nostalgic homecoming to the make-believe of the cinema, a realm more palpable and meaningful than her buried life. Agreeing to edit the script to earn some quick cash, Joe exploits her delusion as he belittles her draft as a "silly hodge-podge of melodramatic plots" written in a "childish scrawl."<a name="f68-text" href="#f68"><sup>68</sup></a> From the charged exchange in which the actress, thrusting the pages of her adaptation at Gillis, insists, "Read the scene just before she has him killed!" forward to the film's denouement, it is possible to see Wilde's play unfolding inside <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span>.<a name="f69-text" href="#f69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    If life imitates art, as Wilde had glibly put it, then by 1950 it is also clear that the art of film had made imitation all the more arduous, if not outright dangerous, especially for mature actresses like Desmond. In contrast to Wilde's symbolist evocation of Salome's desires, Wilder's film offers a bleaker representation of Norma's. His <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> notably employs the same documentary style he experimented with as a young journalist in his collaboration on the 1929 film <span style="font-style:italic;">Menschen am Sonntag</span> and later employed on his 1948 film <span style="font-style:italic;">A Foreign Affair</span>, which spliced shots of Berlin's ruins into the narrative. To expose the destructive effects of a corrosive film industry on the people it employed, the director interweaves the fictional scenario with a pseudo-documentary reality. Wilder conspicuously filmed scenes of local Hollywood haunts, solicited such industry personalities as DeMille and Hedda Hopper to play themselves, and engaged former silent-film actors as Norma's bridge partners, among whom, had Charles Brackett's invitation been accepted, Theda Bara herself would have counted.<a name="f70-text" href="#f70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    Yet Wilder's determination to make a documentary-style film led him to reproduce some of the very excesses his industry expose was meant to unmask. As biographer Maurice Zolotow indicates, Wilder insisted on casting an actress who had once been a silent-screen star in the 1920s for Desmond's role.<a name="f71-text" href="#f71"><sup>71</sup></a> Wilder reasoned, "it's very difficult to find a woman in her sixties, let us say, who is undiscovered--where was she until sixty? It would be hard to believe she was ever a big star. So we went after one who had been big."<a name="f72-text" href="#f72"><sup>72</sup></a> In this tautology, Wilder acknowledges the importance that a youthful appearance had come to exercise in film <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> equally the ruin its loss meant by casting about for an actress who had apparently lived that very calamity. And according to Zolotow, although there was no shortage of fading stars that fit the bill, finding one to agree to play a true-to-life Norma was something else. Not unlike Freud's Dora, more than a few actresses refused to go along with Wilder's make-believe, among them Mae West, Greta Garbo, Pola Negri, and Mary Pickford.<a name="f73-text" href="#f73"><sup>73</sup></a> At last, Swanson, still a working actress as well as businesswoman living in New York, reluctantly accepted the part  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that at fifty-one would ironically ensure her lasting stardom, not to mention countless picture offers to reprise the role of a forgotten movie star.<a name="f74-text" href="#f74"><sup>74</sup></a> However, had he determined to exploit it, Wilder might have made Swanson's selection as a former darling of the silent screen even more believable. The director could have shown the actress at the height of her celebrity in her 1925 Paramount film <span style="font-style:italic;">Stage Struck</span> as small-town waitress Jennie Hagen who, in a dream montage, imagines herself playing an alluring Salome shamelessly brandishing the prophet's head. This dream sequence, notably filmed in color, indicates just how accepted the adolescent model of a prurient princess had become as 1890s nocturnal seduction gave way to 1920s colorful daydream. Yet, instead of inserting this apt remnant of the actress's film credits in <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> for Desmond and Gillis to watch, Wilder chose to show close-ups of a chastened but unrepentant Swanson in her eponymous role for <span style="font-style:italic;">Queen Kelly</span> .<a name="f75-text" href="#f75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>

<p>
	    Regardless of the reasons for bypassing Swanson's youthful Salome, Wilder's own montage in filming <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> accomplishes something far more revealing. His sequence of Desmond undergoing her invasive beautifying renovation, scenes he had to t Brackett to include, puts in stark relief Norma's own wishful and willful transformation--that of restoring her youthful looks, the capital that formed the basis  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of her career and stardom.<a name="f76-text" href="#f76"><sup>76</sup></a> Instead of the enthrallment of her pubescent predecessors, the film shows "a merciless series of treatments" as Desmond gets "ready," Gillis jeers, "for those cameras that would never turn."<a name="f77-text" href="#f77"><sup>77</sup></a> More than the bodily constrictions Bara and Nazimova withstood, Norma's renovative regimen, shot as a sequence, acts as the perverse mechanical reversal of a youthful Salome's enthralled dance of the seven veils. This mature "princess aspirant" endures a suffocating veiling of face and body rather than an unveiling of desire in the throes of a hypnotic dance.<a name="f78-text" href="#f78"><sup>78</sup></a> Wilder's montage of this self-inflicted ordeal recalls fashion photographer Horst P. Horst's nightmarish photograph "Electric Dreams"  that displays a woman with her body also swathed and her face similarly hidden under a claustrophobic mask. Seated under an electric hairdryer surrounded by the all-too-recognizable instruments of modern beautification, Horst's model sinisterly references that other cutting-edge technology, the electric chair, an evocation that renders Desmond's modern enthrallment a barbarous and lethal entrapment in contrast to the second birth that Stanley Hall had christened the arrival of adolescence. Wilder's sequence dramatizes, in effect, Norma's obsession with the cult of adolescence and her willing submission to the torment, potentially fatal, of cosmetic defacement, to restore her former youthful allure. Such defacement, it is hardly necessary to add, has since become standard medical and cosmetological therapies practiced on old and young alike. Thus, in contrast to the aesthetics of looking with which Wilde so radicalized <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>, we have its opposite in <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span>.

"I don't want you to see me," she gravely tells him.<a name="f79-text" href="#f79"><sup>79</sup></a> In capsule, Wilder's montage proposes that which in late modernity had become the destructive correlative of the enthralled sexual initiation of our fin de siecle ingenues. Instead of tempting and thrilling object, Desmond is made a freak, though one of culture, not of nature.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Although exulting early on over the silent-film era of her youthful success--"We didn't need dialogue. We had <span style="font-style:italic;">faces</span>"--Desmond nonetheless recognizes the exigencies of her commodification, the pound of flesh that the film industry exacts from its celebrities when she tells Gillis flatly, "I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me."<a name="f80-text" href="#f80"><sup>80</sup></a> Even so, she completely misjudges her ability to sell herself as she also misinterprets DeMille's greeting her on set. What Desmond assumes is his interest in shooting her screenplay turns out to be a prop manager's interest in leasing her antique automobile for a Bing Crosby comedy. In this modern Babylon, Desmond's Isotta-Fraschini is the coveted object. Refurbished to its original mint condition, her Italian-made luxury car is the precious article, not the actress. Desmond's insufficiency as a star commodity lies in her inability to reconstitute the capital that was her youth. If fin de siecle Salome relied on a dynamic and hedonistic vibrancy, diagnosed by the social sciences as adolescence, then <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> exposes its embodied and material opposite, senescence (aged subjects) on one hand, and obsolescence (outmoded objects) on the other. And Norma Desmond at fifty is both senescent <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> obsolete: overage actress and has-been film star. Wilder's film reverses Wilde's play in the extreme. Whereas the prophet Jokanaan is put off because the precocious Salome's desires are deemed outre for a naive princess, the desired lover Gillis (the Jokanaan proxy) as well as the patronizing DeMille (the Herod proxy) are put off by Desmond's advances because she is too old and too dated for such adolescent fantasies.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Gillis, the film's truth-telling prophet, makes her mania clear as he packs to leave the mansion in their final scene: "Norma, grow up," he scolds. "You're a woman of fifty. There's nothing tragic about being fifty--not unless you try to be twenty-five."<a name="f81-text" href="#f81"><sup>81</sup></a> This wisdom imparted by a twenty-five-year-old hireling would be ironic enough on its own, but it also happens to invoke the same incongruity that the young Graham Robertson first observed of Wilde's Salome in 1892, with a now rather glaring difference--for all intents and purposes the incongruity had become a theatrical <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> cultural commonplace. For trying to be a twenty-five or fourteen-year-old princess is precisely what mature actresses had been attempting in the almost sixty years since <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome's</span> fin de siecle premiere. Desmond's desire to play the pubescent Salome is in actuality no different from Bernhardt's, Munte's, Allan's, Bara's, or Nazimova's--and no less incongruous. In fact, when these actresses sought the role of Wilde's over-excited naif, they were closer in age to a fifty-year-old Norma Desmond than they were to a fourteen-year-old princess. And as these celebrities went, so went the women off-stage and off-camera who imitated them, signifying the extent to which generalized woman had come to rely on the adolescent model promoted by the Salome industry and passed off as Salomania. The one-act drama Wilde had envisioned in merging schoolgirl and seductress had become by the mid-twentieth century a modern woman's reality and,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> in Wilder's film, her tragedy. With a culture enamored with adolescence, the only curative, as Desmond attempts, is in hazardous beauty regimens that tout a return to the adolescent state of the alluring Salome. Outside the limits of adolescence, Wilder's film implies, woman has little value; only within its limits can she participate in the dream world that is film's signature haunt.

<p>
	    At the conclusion of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span>, a deranged Norma Desmond, in what she believes is her cue for Salome's seductive dance, descends the mansion's stairway, with the cameras rolling to capture her apprehension for murder rather than her starring role. The fantasy of stardom persists, but as the madness of a middle-age actress. "And I promise you I'll never desert you again," she ecstatically gushes to the reporters and news cameramen recording her descent, "because after <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>, we'll make another picture, and another and another. You see, this is my life. It always will be. There's nothing else."<a name="f82-text" href="#f82"><sup>82</sup></a> But even as we recognize the poverty of her self-delusion, we can also recognize its truth. For what is also singular in Wilder's stark vision is that Norma Desmond does not die. Unlike Wilde's drama, Wilder's Salome is not put to death before the cameras. In lieu of execution, Wilder gives us something more darkly redolent, the spectacle of her arrest. Desmond exemplifies Andre Bazin's notion of "embalmed time," as she consigns her reality as living person--"There's nothing else"--over to her  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> celluloid image.<a name="f83-text" href="#f83"><sup>83</sup></a> Under Wilder's direction, <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> reveals the sinister side of the apparatus of adolescence and, therein, the film's and the director's own complicity in mechanically and prolifically reproducing one beautiful young Salome and her aspiring lookalikes after another, all the while holding in their thrall the trumped-up adulation, the mania if you will, of the entranced generation on either side.<a name="f84-text" href="#f84"><sup>84</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    Granting that I am being selective in the evidence assembled here, let me nonetheless propose that Wilde's incongruous melding of schoolgirl and seductress in 1892, thought comical by Robertson, and Wilder's dramatization of that fatal merger in 1950, now conceived as tragic, indicate that adolescence had not only become prolonged over the course of the preceding century as it became naturalized. But also, given the perks that adolescence ostensibly confers--vitality, sexual potency, beauty, independence, heightened consciousness, pleasure, and attention--it had come to attract the likes of middle-age actresses from the <span style="font-style:italic;">tragedienne</span> Bernhardt to a tragic Norma Desmond. If all are fated to enter adolescence, as Hall had theorized, then it seems equally the case that increasingly no one wanted to leave it. Adolescence comes to be valued for its own sake. Modern culture bears this out: the young can't wait to enter it and the old contrive never to quit it. Adolescence is not just chronic as Hall's work implied, but has become the default subject position of late modernity--a social construct and cultural space that progressively enlists more and more conscripts, presented in this essay as a generalizable woman, to its effervescent and hedonic fold.

		Though Pigott imposed the ban based on a proscription against dramatizing biblical events in force for three centuries, he seems most offended by Salome's overt sexuality, as he confided in a private letter to Spencer Ponsonby-Fane, Comptroller of Lord Chamberlain's Office: "[L]ove turns to fury because John will not let [Salome] kiss him <span style="font-style:italic;">in the mouth</span>--and in the last scene, where she brings in his head--if you please--on a 'charger'--she <span style="font-style:italic;">does</span> kiss his mouth, in a paroxysm of sexual despair.

		It remains unclear when and how Wilde imagined a performance of Salome's dance of the seven veils, but it is undeniable that the addition of "seven veils" made his earlier inscription of a generic "dance" more vivid and exotic. Wilde apparently made the alteration sometime in the summer of 1892, just after rehearsals were shut down and while he was preparing <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> for publication. His handwritten changes in French appear penciled in proofs of the first edition. <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome Drame En Un Acte</span>, July[?] 1892, Oscar Wilde and his Literary Circle Collection, W6721M2 S171, The William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, UCLA. See also Rodney Shewan, "The Artist and Dancer in Three Symbolist <span style="font-style:italic;">Salomes</span>," <span style="font-style:italic;">Bucknell Review</span> 30 : 124. Wilde's additions have led to much speculation over their impetus, whether arising from the staging of the play and his collaborations with Bernhardt and Robertson or whether from its publication and the help he received with his French from Marcel Schwob, Pierre Louyes, Adolphe Rette, and Stuart Merrill. Moreover, considerable debate remains over the cultural source of the seven veils, whether owing to the myth of Isis or of Ishtar. See, respectively, Jess Sully, "Narcissistic Princess, Rejected Lover, Veiled Priestess, Virtuous Virgin: How Oscar Wilde Imagined Salome," <span style="font-style:italic;">The Wildean: A Journal of Oscar Wilde Studies</span> 25 (July 2004): 16-33; and Megan Becker-Leckrone, "Salome(c): The Fetishization of a Textual Corpus," <span style="font-style:italic;">New Literary History</span> 26, no. 2 (Spring 1995): 242-47.

		Sigmund Freud, <span style="font-style:italic;">Dora: An Analysis of a Case of Hysteria</span> [1905] (New York: Collier, 1963). Richard A. Kaye observes a similar correlation between Salome and Dora, though his larger point importantly connects Salome to Benjamin's unease over the potency of the youth ethos informing Jugendstil aesthetics. Still, I take his implicit point that Wilde's Salome necessarily arises from the Victorian conception of childhood, a point central to Philippe Aries' <span style="font-style:italic;">Centuries of Childhood</span> as quoted in <a name="f29-text" href="#f29">note 29</a> below.

		To grasp the categorical shift adolescence presented in the late nineteenth century, we have only to contrast it with its precursor, "youth," which as the historian John Gillis has usefully noted lacked the differentiation in the pre-industrial age later accorded adolescence. According to Gillis, the modernization of youth resulted from the changes in class and education brought on by the political experiments of the late eighteenth century and manifested in urbanization and industrialization. See John Gillis, <span style="font-style:italic;">Youth and History: Tradition and Change in European Age Relations, 1770-Present</span> (New York: Academic Press, 1974), 5, 37.

	      According to Hall, "for those prophetic souls interested in the future of our race and desirous of advancing it, the field of adolescence is the quarry in which they must seek to find both goal and means. If such a higher stage is ever added to our race, it will not be by increments at any later plateau of adult life, but it will come by increased development of the adolescent stage, which is the bud of promise for the race" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adolescence</span>, 1:50).

<div class="fn"><p><a name="f28" href="#f28-text">28. </a>
	      Hall's bias toward women and the people he terms primitives is illustrated in the very structure of the study, with the topics of "adolescent girls" and "adolescent races" occupying the final two chapters of the two-volume study--in all, 187 of 1,337 pages. There is no corresponding chapter on "adolescent boys" or "advanced races." Of the "adolescent races," he observes that "[m]ost savages in most respects are children, or, because of sexual maturity, more properly, adolescents of adult size," with adult-sized adolescents offering a fitting terminus for his work overall (<span style="font-style:italic;">Adolescence</span>, 2:649).

		Daniel Brown and more recently Petra Dierkes-Thrun have importantly concerned themselves with showing the modernist implications of Wilde's transgressive aesthetics, Brown astutely connecting them to Billy Wilder's film. <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> functions as signpost and conduit of an aesthetic renovation that facilitates what Dierkes-Thrun calls "an ecstatic new realm for modern individualism and transformed secular humanism." See Daniel Brown, "Wilde and Wilder," <span style="font-style:italic;">PMLA</span> 119, no. 5 (October 2004): 1216-30; and Petra Dierkes-Thrun, <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome's Modernity: Oscar Wilde and the Aesthetics of Transgression</span> (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2011), 2. My study is more interested in tracing Wilde's radical Salome within the broader cultural phenomenon of adolescence, which crucially redefines modern womanhood.

	      As Brown points out, the preliminary draft of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> has Desmond writing memoirs that some pages later become, without explanation, a story about <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span> ("Wilde and Wilder," 1217). See File copy of the script of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span>, 21 December 1948 Typescript, <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> file, Margaret Herrick Library, Beverly Hills, CA. Charles Brackett records in his diary only that he, Wilder, and Marshman were at work in January 1949 on what Desmond was writing, See Brackett, "Diary," 10 January 1949, 1949 Typescript, Margaret Herrick Library. By the 19 March 1949 script, Desmond is plainly writing the story of <span style="font-style:italic;">Salome</span>. See Draft script of <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span>, 21 March 1949, Typescript. <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> file, Margaret Herrick Library. While it is unclear who had the idea of Salome, there is evidence that it was Wilder. Gene D. Phillips points out that Wilder knew Richard Strauss having scored a coup as a young journalist with his interview of the composer in 1925. Gene D. Phillips, <span style="font-style:italic;">Some Like It Wilder: The Life and Controversial Films of Billy Wilder</span> (Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, c. 2010), 4. According to Charlotte Chandler, Wilder, in writing the script, "played Richard Strauss's 'Dance of the Seven Veils' as inspiration." See Charlotte Chandler, <span style="font-style:italic;">Nobody's Perfect: A Personal Biography</span> (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2002), 159. And in rehearsal of Swanson's final scene descending the staircase, the director insisted on having Strauss's "Dance of the Seven Veils" playing for effect. See Ed Sikov, <span style="font-style:italic;">On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder</span> (New York: Hyperion, 1998), 300.

	      Lucy Fischer, in her perceptive treatment of age in the film, notes that the actress, "in her cinematic incarnation" stands in for "both the archetypal woman and the exemplary woman in film," thus making more jarring Swanson's "perverse portrayal" of an aging star in contrast to her merely eccentric former director Max (98, 102, 104). I differ, however, with Fischer's use of female vampirism, relying instead on its relation to rebellious young women and vamping. Fischer also connects Desmond's predicament to the prostitute or <span style="font-style:italic;">hetaira</span> class in which, citing Simone de Beauvoir, the body and personality represent the star's capital that is then exploited . While there is no denying the age-old connection between acting and prostitution, with Kirsten Pullen's recent <span style="font-style:italic;">Actresses and Whores</span> offering excellent case studies on the subject, my aim is rather to show how and with what consequences the conception of modern sexuality relates to the recent formation of the category of adolescence, with a focus in this essay on women. See Lucy Fischer, "<span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span>: Fading Stars," in <span style="font-style:italic;">Women and Film</span>, ed. Janet Todd (New York: Holmes &amp; Meier, 1988), 97-113; and Kirsten Pullen, <span style="font-style:italic;">Actresses and Whores: On Stage and in Society</span> (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005).

	    Wilder and Brackett did not insist on the same verisimilitude in casting the twenty-five-year-old Gillis role. When Hollywood sensation Montgomery Cliff, then thirty, turned down the part, they considered such actors as Alan Ladd, John Garfield, Burt Lancaster, and Richard Widmark, none of whom was in his twenties (Brackett, "Diary," March 10, 1949). Under contract to Paramount, Holden, then thirty-one, was eventually ordered to take the role (Zolotow, <span style="font-style:italic;">Billy Wilder</span>, 161-64). Concerns that he looked too old to play a mid-twenties Gillis led Wilder and Brackett to propose adding make-up to age Swanson, a corrective the actress hotly resisted (Staggs, <span style="font-style:italic;">Close-up</span>, 62).
	  </p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f75" href="#f75-text">75. </a>
	    That Wilder, so meticulous otherwise in his documentation, overlooked the obvious connection between the real Swanson's silent-film credits and the make-believe Desmond's credits is truly odd. One can only surmise that he considered a clip of Queen Kelly a far more glamorous fantasy of the silent screen era than a clip from <span style="font-style:italic;">Stage Struck</span>, a film that reduced the tragic Salome to every home-town girl's daydream: that of a wholesome naif waiting tables at a blue-collar diner in the boondocks.
	  </p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f76" href="#f76-text">76. </a>
	    In order to include the montage, Wilder had to overrule the conservative Brackett who complained of its grotesquerie, one of the quarrels that likely precipitated Wilder's ending their partnership on completing the film (Phillips, <span style="font-style:italic;">Some Like It Wilder</span>, 119).

	      While Grayson Cooke notices "a conflict between the temporality of life as it is lived and experienced, and the atemporality of the commodity image," there is more to the conflict than can be captured by Desmond's face alone via Deleuze and Guattari's concept of "faciality." It involves what it means to be a modern woman. See Cooke, "'We Had Faces Then': <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> and the Sense of the Spectral," <span style="font-style:italic;">Quarterly Review of Film and Video</span> 26, no. 2 (March 2009): 94-99.

See Bazin, "The Ontology of the Photographic Image," in <span style="font-style:italic;">What Is Cinema</span>, trans. Hugh Gray, 2 vols. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1967), 1:14.

	    That Wilder's <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunset Boulevard</span> represents this reproduction as both mechanical and generational makes its vision even more prophetic than Joseph L. Mankiewicz's film of generational rivalry, <span style="font-style:italic;">All About Eve</span>, released the same year and starring Bette Davis, who, as an aging stage actress, must face the loss of career and celebrity when challenged by a cunning ingenue impersonating her.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>

<h1 class="sec-headA">Modernist Dialectics</h1>
<p>
	Few would dispute the assessment of A. M. Klein as a second-generation, late-modernist Canadian author and critic who took an obsessive interest in Joyce’s modernism in particular and who more broadly adapted to an Anglo-Jewish context the densely allusive and elliptical style of the first-generation European and American modernists to his later poetry and prose fiction of the mid-1930s to the early 1950s. Even so, that critical portrait largely overlooks two interlocked phases in Klein’s modernism that deserve particular notice: his work from 1938 to 1955 as editor of and contributor to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canadian Jewish Chronicle</span> (1914–66) and his contributions from March 1944 to 1947 as an editor or poet to the little magazines <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> (1942–45), <span style="font-style:italic;">First Statement</span> (1942–45), and <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Review</span> (1945–54). These phases coincide with his shift away from traditional prosodies and literary forms toward the innovative aesthetic modes of modernism. The first phase was initiated by his employment by Hirsh Wolofsky’s Eagle Publishing Company as editor of its Montreal-based English-language weekly paper; the second by his editorial collaborations—first with members of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group (Patrick and Peggy Anderson, F. R. Scott, P. K. Page, Neufville and Kit Shaw, and Bruce Ruddick) and those of the <span style="font-style:italic;">First Statement</span> group (John Sutherland, Irving Layton, and Louis Dudek), and later with both groups when the two magazines merged in 1945 to form <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Review</span>.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	These phases I correlate with two intersected dispositions in Klein’s authorial and editorial practice, namely the Jewish-Canadian diasporic modernism of his <span style="font-style:italic;">Canadian Jewish Chronicle</span> period and, as an Anglo-Canadian variant on the modernist poetics of diaspora, the postcolonial modernism of his <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> period. The dialectical interrelation of his diasporic and postcolonial modernisms is, I think, key to understanding the ways in which Klein’s editorial consciousness of specific social and political contexts in periodical cultures shaped the dissemination of his modernist aesthetic practices. While the Anglo-Montreal context of <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> leant toward the localized national and socialist politics of an incipient postcolonial modernism in Canada, the Anglo-Jewish Montreal context of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canadian Jewish Chronicle</span> was tied to the globalized politics of an emergent diasporic modernism that addressed the transnational histories of Zionism, the Holocaust, and the state of Israel. For Klein, the politics of postcoloniality was but a local concern subsumed under the global politics of the Jewish diaspora. These social and political orientations thus direct my investigation of the periodical cultures in which Klein formed his modernist practices as an editor and author.
      </p>
<p>
	To situate Klein within the dialectics of postcoloniality and diaspora is to return to the scene of Anglo-Montreal modernism in the 1940s and its incitement of the so-called native-cosmopolitan debate. According to the original terms of the debate, as articulated by A. J. M. Smith in the introduction to his 1943 anthology, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Book of Canadian Poetry</span>, the nativist poets “attempted to describe and interpret whatever is essentially and distinctively Canadian,” and the cosmopolitan poets attempted “to transcend colonialism by entering into the universal, civilizing culture of ideas.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> Conjoining two keywords of the period, the native-cosmopolitan dialectic has frequently offered a ready-made theoretical nomenclature, but one that has been mobilized too often and uncritically in the interests of one or the other side of the debate. Because the significations of this dialectic oscillate throughout the 1940s, I want to insist that that these keywords—native and cosmopolitan—denote <span style="font-style:italic;">both</span> colonial and postcolonial orientations. In other words, the terms of the native-cosmopolitan debate represent a kind of shorthand for an interrelated set of colonial-postcolonial cultural formations. In my reading the native-cosmopolitan debate is a sign of Canadian literary culture in transition from colonial to postcolonial positionings. There is no unilateral linkage between nativism and postcolonialism or between cosmopolitanism and colonialism, or vice versa. This terminological indeterminacy is a marker of the transitional movement within Canadian modernism of the 1940s from a colonial to a postcolonial literary culture. By dismantling the binaries of the native-cosmopolitan dialectic, it may be seen that postcolonial modernism incorporates overlapping definitions of the native and the cosmopolitan, and that this overlap corresponds to a contested site within Canadian modernist literary culture, where the narrative of a residual colonialism is interrupted by an emergent postcolonialism.
      </p>
<p>
	At the same time that Klein participated in an incipient postcolonial modernism in Montreal, he articulated a globalized poetics as a Jewish writer who saw himself in the context of a diasporic modernism.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> James Clifford’s notion of diaspora as a “traveling term”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> is apposite to Klein’s modernism, especially as it functions in his 1951 novel,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>. This is a traveling text not just because of its hybridized form and itinerant narrator’s transnational narrative but also because of the textual migrations involved in its transmission history. According to Clifford, the process of “displacement and transplantation” in “diaspora cultures” represents “specific, often violent, histories of economic, political, and cultural interaction—histories that generate what might be called <span style="font-style:italic;">discrepant</span> cosmopolitanisms.”<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> If, as Charles W. Pollard argues, the correlation of diaspora cultures and discrepant cosmopolitanism “essentially restates and reorients the modernist ideal, an ideal that recognizes the fragmentation and diversity of any contemporary culture but also seeks to bring those fragments together to form new, provisional, and transnational cultural wholes,”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> it follows that the discrepancies and contradictions that emerge at points of intercultural contact and exchange correspond to expressions of “cultural collage and incongruity” that Clifford makes explicit comparisons to when referencing “<span style="font-style:italic;">modernist</span> art and poetry.”<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Klein’s diasporic modernism manifests itself in what Rebecca L. Walkowitz would call his “cosmopolitan style,” his signature bricolage of multiple and divergent genres, modes, and languages.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> Because his cosmopolitanism is always dialectical, his modernism articulates the discrepant and contradictory conjuncture of Israeli and diasporic cultures. Although it would be overreaching to assert precise homologies between Klein’s conceptions of diasporic and Israeli cultures and of cosmopolitanism and nativism in Canadian modernism, there is no doubt that these defining literary and cultural narratives of the period are contiguous in his mind and, more concretely, his columns for the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canadian Jewish Chronicle</span>. As with the indeterminacies of a postcolonial modernism, there are no absolute alignments of nativism with Israel or cosmopolitanism with diaspora, or vice versa. Just as Klein sought to articulate a dialectical relationship between diaspora and Israel, so he expressed a vision of modernist literature in Canada that correlated both native and cosmopolitan orientations.
      </p>
<p>
	Against universalist conceptions of cosmopolitanism, “counter-cosmopolitanisms”—theorized in recent years by an interdisciplinary cast of thinkers such as Kwame Anthony Appiah, Homi Bhabha, James Clifford, David Harvey, David Held, Bruce Robbins, Boaventura de Sousa Santos, and many others—have been “variously described as ‘rooted,’ ‘situated,’ ‘actually existing,’ ‘discrepant,’ ‘vernacular,’ ‘Christian,’ ‘bourgeois,’ ‘liberal,’ ‘postcolonial,’ ‘feminist,’ ‘proletarian,’ ‘subaltern,’ ‘ecological,’ ‘socialist,’ and so forth.”<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> From a critique of these “adjectival cosmopolitanisms” or “hyphenated versions of cosmopolitanism,” the Marxist geographer David Harvey mounts his own “cosmopolitan project,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">Cosmopolitanism and the Geographies of Freedom</span>, of a “historical geographical materialism” that is “dialectical, process-based, and interactive” . Among the new cosmopolitan theorists who adopt a dialectical method is the sociologist Ulrich Beck, who contends that cosmopolitanism is not opposed to nationalism or ethnicism but rather engaged in “a non-linear, dialectical process in which the universal and the particular, the similar and the dissimilar, the global and the local are to be conceived, not as cultural polarities, but as interconnected and reciprocally interpenetrating principles.”<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> These processive conceptualizations of the dialectic bear theoretical affinities to Klein’s correlation of native-cosmopolitan and Israel-diaspora dialectics.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	The philosophical sources of Klein’s dialectics are multiple. As Zailig Pollock has demonstrated, dialectical thinking for Klein is as much—if not more—Talmudic as it is Hegelian or Marxist. Although he was well aware of Hegel and Marx, neither historical nor materialist dialectics proved sufficient to Klein’s predilection for the dialectical structures of the Talmud and the unresolved contradictions of Talmudic thought. His ambivalence toward the Hegelian formula of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis and his skepticism toward the laws of dialectical materialism (transformation of quantity into quality, unity of opposites, and negation of the negation) find accommodation instead in “the lack of an ultimate synthesis of opposing views in the Talmudic version of the dialectic.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> While Pollock also aligns Klein with a general “modernist ambivalence towards the dialectic” posited by James McFarlane,<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Michael Greenstein suggests more specific similarities between Klein’s dialectics and the Frankfurt School’s critical theory, particularly Adorno’s negative dialectics, which refuses “to reconcile antitheses into a conclusive synthesis,” performs a critique of “totalizing authoritarian philosophies” that could lead toward political extremisms, and “seeks to prevent final doctrinaire positions in favour of a more open-ended and open-minded fluidity.”<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> As Klein aptly concludes in his poem “Sestina on the Dialectic”—his meditation on the “change that changes” but never reaches “the final synthesis”—“no thing’s still.”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>
	When Fredric Jameson considers the possibility that, “from a formal perspective, modernism itself is dialectical to the degree to which it is obliged to posit its own formal oppositions and to navigate them by way of invention and differentiation,” he only begins to explore the potentiality of a “properly dialectical aesthetic program.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> With Klein’s dialectical modernism, he pushes beyond its formal properties to interrogate the ideological mediations of its postcolonial and diasporic formations.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Postcolonial Modernism</h1>
<p>
	The conceptualization of a postcolonial modernism in anglophone Canadian literature is a relatively recent phenomenon, but one only tentatively extended to the modernist poets of the mid-twentieth century. In his 1987 essay “Canadian T(w)ink: Surviving the Whiteouts,” Gary Boire singles out F. R. Scott as an exemplary re in “a recurrent post-colonial modernist dilemma,”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> only to charge him with complicity in “historical and ideological erasures,” principally the “exclusion of Canada’s indigenous populations” from his 1945 poem “Laurentian Shield.”<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> With terminological slippage indicative of his depiction of Scott and other Canadian modernists as anticolonial nationalists rather than postcolonialists, Boire proceeds to expose the motives behind their “declarations of a decolonized aesthetic”  and to posit a series of leading questions about “the political dimensions involved in the writing and reading of many modernist nationalistic texts”:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
	  In what ways did the Canadian modernists define their own relationship with Canada’s imperialistic past (and present)? In their heroic attempts to evolve a decolonized poetic, did they in fact construct the basis for a decolonized society? Or did they, in both simple and complex ways, help to perpetuate an already existing state of historical amnesia?

	    Rather than leading towards Boire’s negative conclusion—that Canadian modernists including Scott and, by extension, other members of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group were amnesiac nationalists—we may redirect his identification of the “post-colonial modernist dilemma” toward a critical approach to Canadian modernism that is no longer incommensurate with postcoloniality. In his 2002 study <span style="font-style:italic;">Unreal Country: Modernity in the Canadian Novel in English</span>, Glenn Willmott calls for just this kind of literary-critical reorientation:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      We must undo any assumptions which, drawing on a later conration of global history, oppose modernism to postcoloniality. For only then can we bring a description of literary modernism that is postcolonial, and a description of historical modernity, into relationship. This task has barely been approached, even in general terms, so powerful has been the postcolonialist alignment with a postmodern period transcending and all but severed from the modern. . . . Hence the simple need for a theoretical discourse concerning modernity which aligns rather than opposes modernist expression with postcolonial experience.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    Scholars familiar with studies of colonialism, imperialism, and modernism in landmark essays by Said and Jameson may find the situation of Canadian modernist studies baffling.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    Why have critics resisted considerations of Canadian modernism’s postcoloniality? According to Larry McDonald, the origins of resistance may reside in Canadian post-modernist critics’ characterizations of modernism.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Beginning with Robert Kroetsch’s infamous pronouncement in 1974—“Canadian literature evolved directly from Victorian into Postmodern”<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a>—which posits Canadian modernism’s absence, we may begin to perceive the strategies of postmodernist self-fashioning that positions itself against a nonexistent Canadian modernism. As Lorraine Weir writes in her 1991 critique of Linda Hutcheon’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Canadian Postmodern: A Study of Contemporary English-Canadian Fiction</span> , “One result is that Canadian modernism, like the dissenting tradition in Canadian social and political thought with which it is strongly aligned, has still not been considered in Canadian theory.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> In other words, the absence of any sustained consideration of Canadian modernism in Hutcheon’s study merely replicates and validates Kroetsch’s dictum. Furthermore, Weir’s alignment of Canadian modernism with a tradition of social and political dissent calls into question Hutcheon’s assertion that “gone now is the modernist belief that art can really be autonomous or separate from the world.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> Among the dissenting traditions to which Weir alludes is the social and political thought of the Montreal modernists of the 1940s, notably that of leftist res such as Scott, Klein, and Patrick Anderson of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group. McDonald, as well, takes issue with Hutcheon’s depiction of the Canadian modernists, calling it “an ahistorical travesty of modernism in Canada”;<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> like other commentators on the Montreal poets of the 1940s,<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> he notes that they “wrote for little magazines that were avowedly socialist”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a>—thus debunking Hutcheon’s claim that a belief in the autonomy of art was universal among modernists.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Yet Hutcheon’s portrait of an autonomous (dehistoricized, desocialized, and depoliticized) modernism in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Canadian Postmodern</span> was typical, as Jeffrey M. Perl puts  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> it, “in the microsaga of how and when modernism and New Criticism are and have been seen together.”<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a> For Perl, the pairing of modernism and New Criticism in the late-twentieth-century critical imagination is actually a mismatch, and the result of their misalignment is predictable: “[I]t was thus natural that, when the overdue rebellion against New Critical orthodoxy occurred, academic opinion would turn against modernism” . Hence the joint criticism of Canadian modernism and New Criticism that one finds in Boire:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      What emerges in so many “appreciations” of the Canadian modernist movement is a duplication in criticism of the same dehistoricized ideals contained within the literary texts. The base of critical activity is an approving, unquestioning acceptance of New Critical standards which constitute a depoliticized view of art as a psychological harmonization of the social, an aesthetic resolution of opposition and conflict into an organic whole.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    What Boire’s assessment of New Critical approaches to modernism in Canada makes all too obvious is not only their profound misunderstandings of the period’s historical, social, and political consciousness but also their misrepresentations of New Criticism’s practice by Canadian modernists themselves. Members of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group, most notably Anderson and Klein, certainly employed selected New Critical techniques in their essays, articles, and editorials on literary modernism.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> Yet closer inspection of this critical archive reveals that the accusation that Canadian modernists practiced and explicated a dehistoricized, desocialized, and depoliticized modernism, especially in the case of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group, is unwarranted.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The conjuncture of New Criticism and modernism occupied center stage in the September 1944 issue of <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>, a special number entitled “An Explanatory Issue.” Members of the group at the time—Anderson, Scott, Klein, P. K. Page, and Bruce Ruddick—contributed poems accompanied by explanatory headnotes. Assembled and introduced by Anderson, the issue fulfilled a critical mandate initiated and carried out by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group during the previous year. That mandate employed selected elements of the New Critical method as vehicles to promote the reading and writing of literary modernism in Canada, a coupling of literary and critical practices that coincided with the group’s articulation of a decolonized poetry and poetics.
	  </p>
<p><span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>’s modernism sought to supersede what Scott, in the December 1942 issue, called “our Canadian colonialism.”<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> According to his analysis, this form of colonialism is “a cast of thought, a mental climate” that inhibits the co-emergence of both a modernist poetry and a postcolonial “state of mind” that break with the imperial institutions and formations of empire.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> For the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group, postcolonial thought and modernist poetry were coextensive concerns; their coincidence is amply evidenced by the poetry, editorials, and articles published in the magazine itself. This evidence has not, however, been adequately documented in the literary-historical record; instead, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group has been characterized, at times, as no more than a colonial mimicry of the Auden generation and, at other times, as a colonizing presence importing European modernism into Canada. These characterizations bespeak the period’s symptomatic anticolonial  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> ambivalence,<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> which finds its correlative in the native-cosmopolitan debates among the Montreal modernists of the 1940s. Extrapolated to Montreal little-magazine culture in the 1940s, the term “postcolonial modernism” rearticulates the theoretical contours of <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>’s poetics and realigns prevailing literary-historical narratives of the period. Histories of the period have been preoccupied with retelling versions of the native-cosmopolitan schism in Canadian modernism. By resituating the native-cosmopolitan debate among the Montreal modernists in relation to a postcolonial-modernist poetics, we may begin to revise the ways in which critics and historians have characterized the period as a conflict between two warring factions: the cosmopolitans represented by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group and the nativists represented by the crosstown rival <span style="font-style:italic;">First Statement</span>. As Brian Trehearne argues in reassessing the Montreal poets of the 1940s, the quarrel between the two magazines has been overplayed in the historical record; he reconciles their differences and resolves the partitioning of the two magazines and their affiliated poets along native-cosmopolitan lines by presenting their aesthetic commonalities as evidence of a unified modernist poetics.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> But where Trehearne’s reevaluation of the Montreal modernists isolates their aesthetic practice, the theorization of a comprehensive Canadian postcolonial modernism necessitates a cultural remapping of their modernist poetics.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group’s approach to postcolonial modernism culminated in the publication of “An Explanatory Issue,” the origins of which can be traced to a <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> meeting in March 1944.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> At this meeting, the group recognized an urgent need to bridge what it perceived to be a communication gap between modernist poetry and its potential readership, specifically between its own poetry and the general public. <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>’s initiatives to make poetry more accessible to the Canadian public included the publication of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Victory Broadsheet</span>, a single sheet of newsprint consisting of leftist, anti-imperialist war ballads written by Anderson, not only distributed to subscribers in the August 1943 issue, but also intended for free circulation in factories, schools, bookstores, and newsstands across Canada. According to Anderson, this attempt to “bring poetry to the people” was issued in the interests of “explaining the issues of the war and the problems of the peace in terms of Canadian history and life.” Anderson’s decision, as he put it, to write for the broadsheet “poetry of a simpler, more popular kind than that usually obtaining in the parent magazine” sharply distinguished the broadsheet’s populist poetry from the magazine’s modernist poetry.<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> While this populist-modernist schism might suggest analogies to the native-cosmopolitan division often cited in accounts of Montreal literary culture in the 1940s, the swift discontinuation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Victory Broad-sheet</span> after one installment indicates <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>’s disavowal of the so-called “great divide” between literary modernism and mass culture.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> With the appearance of “An Explanatory Issue” the following year, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group would more broadly implement its populist method, providing its readers with what Anderson called “certain aids to the appreciation of modern poetry.”<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> In league with the leftist inclinations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Victory Broadsheet</span>, the political orientation of “An Explanatory Issue” was tacitly socialist, leaning toward a populist mode of dissemination. But instead of writing a populist poetry for mass distribution, Anderson designed the special issue to make <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>’s  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> modernist poetry accessible to the masses. Or, to put it another way, he drafted a plan to bridge the native-cosmopolitan “great divide.” In doing so, he presented <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>’s modernist poetry and editorial commentaries as guides to a critique of colonialism in Canadian poetry and prototypes of a postcolonial poetry and poetics.
	  </p>
<p>
	    In his editorial statement, Anderson noted that the explanatory issue had been prompted by a request from “a young man interested in <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>, a captain in the Canadian army.”<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> By identifying a member of the Canadian armed forces as part of the readership of <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>, Anderson not only remobilized the magazine’s support for the war effort, recalling the declaration against fascism and call for solidarity among writers in its inaugural editorial,<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> but also gestured toward the magazine’s potential to reach mass audiences. Having fingered the issue’s intended audience, the editorial proceeds in the manner of a New Criticism primer: “A poem is unparaphrasable and untranslatable. Once separated from the poet’s experience, it is a sovereign and autonomous entity.”<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> Even as he invoked the principles of the New Critics, Anderson found it inevitable that readers of poetry “should, especially in this political age, be still anxious about meaning,” but thought that that they should relegate political significations of the poem to “the background, especially on the important first reading” . On subsequent readings, however, he admits that a reader may wish “to apply his particular, and maybe political, standards.” For Anderson, the reader’s respect for the poem’s “sovereign and autonomous” existence need not divorce it from its political contexts, but rather allows the reader to appreciate “a greater totality of meaning than if he angrily suspects the poem of being obscure.” Anderson’s defense of the sovereign and autonomous poem appeals to the reader’s desire for sovereignty and autonomy, advancing an argument aimed at generating widespread understanding of modernist poetry among lay readers rather than among partisan audiences. Anderson viewed the hermeneutic strategies of New Criticism as tools to disarm the prevalent resistance to “obscure” modernist poetry among the general public. Rather than advance an explicitly politicized, populist leftist hermeneutics—as the apologists for socialist realism had attempted in the 1930s—he appealed to the concurrent rise of New Criticism and its focus on the “totality of meaning” in the text itself, rather than in its contexts, as a way to popularize modernist poetry. Hence his concern that “forces which are progressive politically are sometimes little more than reactionary culturally” may in fact allude to the antimodernism of programmatic leftist aesthetics, mostly notably socialist realism . Even so, Anderson’s populist approach to modernist poetry is consonant with his underlying political beliefs, for he also holds that “the poet has a real function to play in our society, particularly when social and economic progress is getting ahead of cultural and ‘spiritual’ development.” Aware of the reactionary populism among Canada’s wartime poets and their audiences, which fostered persistent colonialism and which was evident in the proliferation of patriotic, anglophile, imperialist war poetry,<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> Anderson set himself the task of developing a postcolonial practice that provided a corrective to the antipopulism of modernist aesthetics.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Critical responses to Anderson’s poetry and poetics at the time and in retrospect often invoke the native-cosmopolitan debate, placing Anderson on the cosmopolitan  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> side. From a nativist critical perspective, Wynne Francis’s portrait of Anderson depicts him as a colonizing presence, a British-born expatriate poet who came to Montreal where he “exploited” the natural resources of Canadian geography and climate and the national pastimes of skiing and hockey.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Francis’s anti-cosmopolitan commentary stems from the rhetoric of pro-nativist poets such as Dorothy Livesay, who in an April 1944 article published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canadian Forum</span> derided Anderson and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group, not for their colonizing presence in Canada, but for what she considered their poetry’s colonial derivation from European modernism.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> Anderson’s retort in the correspondence column of the May 1944 <span style="font-style:italic;">Forum</span> accused Livesay of “[a] ‘colonial’ fear of cosmopolitanism, a provincial carping at those derivations and early dependencies which are inevitable in young writers,”<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> which he followed with a poetic history and critique of Canadian colonialism in his “Poem on Canada” published the following month.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> With both sides of the native-cosmopolitan debate pointing the “colonial” finger across the “great divide,” Anderson may have intended to resolve the agon by putting together “An Explanatory Issue.” Yet his plan backfired, for instead of inciting Canadian poets and critics to embrace <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>’s postcolonial modernism, his opponents countered with a nativist, “nationalist modernism”—to borrow Jody Berland’s coinage.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> In the end, the negative reception of <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>’s postcolonial modernism was not so much a conceptual repudiation of its cosmopolitanism as a rejection of the teachings of a British-born schoolmaster.
	  </p>
<p>
	    Perhaps a better spokesperson for <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span>’s postcolonial modernism is Klein, whose poem “Montreal” appeared in “An Explanatory Issue.” In his headnote to the poem, he explains that it is “written in a vocabulary which is not exactly orthodox English. It is written so that any Englishman who knows no French, and any Frenchman who knows no English . . . can read it intelligently. It contains not a word . . . which is not either similar to, derivative from, or akin to a French word of like import; in short, a bilingual poem.”<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> Klein’s “Montreal” delineates a civic history of colonization, its bilingualism attesting to the predominant languages spoken in his Anglo-French metropolis. The poem elaborates a conceit through which the poet articulates his spiritual and bodily identification with the city. By the poem’s close, the poet is no longer a resident of the city; “the city is resident in the poet.”<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> For a Jewish poet to write of Montreal without mentioning his city’s Jewish history is a remarkable elision, for this lacuna testifies to the process of incorporation—the rative embodiment of the city in the poet—as a metaphor for the colonization of the Jewish poet’s body, the effacement of his people’s language, culture, and history. As a poet of the Jewish diaspora, Klein res the Jewish poet’s city as a colonized body, a body populated by his city’s histories of colonization and by the languages of its colonizers. The opening lines of the final stanza make plain the correlation between the Jewish poet’s and the city’s colonization, where he envisions the city as a “new-world Torah,”<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> a testament to colonial exploitation: “City, O city, you are vision’d as / A parchemin roll of saecular exploit / Inked with the script of eterne souvenir!”<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> From the opening line’s allusion to Joyce’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Finnegans Wake</span> (“O city metropole, isle riverain”) to the closing stanza’s invocation of Eliot’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span> (“City, O city, you are vision’d”), Klein’s “Montreal” is framed by a modernist practice  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> of incorporation, the juxtaposition of linguistic fragments picked from the rubble of European empires.<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> Moreover, throughout the poem, Klein deliberately mimics a celebratory rhetoric of imperial conquest and colonization, ending every sentence and every stanza with a triumphant exclamation mark; its superficial appearance might suggest the poet’s complicity with these rhetorical gestures, but he emphatically aligns himself with the colonized. His mimicry of the colonizers’ languages is, as Homi Bhabha demonstrates, a strategic tool for the postcolonial writer. Neither wholly French nor wholly English, the poet’s “postcolonial mimicry” decries the purity of a native tongue; his unorthodox language resides “in-between” the colonizers’ linguistic orthodoxies and hegemonies.<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>
<p>
	    To recast this reading of Klein’s “Montreal” in terms of the native-cosmopolitan debate, I should note that the Jewish poet’s identification with his city is neither nativist nor cosmopolitan. Although the poet resides in his native city, and his native city resides in him, Montreal is the domicile of his exile. For a poet of the Jewish diaspora writing before the formation of the state of Israel in 1948, the experience of exile is accentuated by his attachment to Montreal. Without a nation-state to affix his sense of belonging, he adopts his native city as his surrogate “state” of exile. Occasioned by his “sojourn in alien place,” for instance, the poet recalls the suburbs of Montreal as his “exile’s verdure fresh.”<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> Removed from the city and its environs, he continues to identify himself and his experience of exile with Montreal. At the same time, the poet’s consciousness of living in Montreal and in a “state” of exile is incommensurate with a cosmopolitan sense of global citizenship. For Klein, the diasporic Jewish poet is neither native nor cosmopolitan, neither at home in his native city nor at home in the world; he is <span style="font-style:italic;">unheimlich</span>. His unhomely postcoloniality is, as Scott puts it, a “state of mind.” If, for Freud, the unheimlich is “the name for everything that ought to have remained . . . secret and hidden but has come to light,” then my reading of Klein’s “Montreal” is a decidedly unhomely one: it seeks to reveal his articulation of the diasporic poet’s unhomely condition and to unveil that poet’s colonized body.<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Diasporic Modernism</h1>
<p>
	    If among members of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group and in his contributions to that magazine Klein articulated the Jewish-Canadian poet’s postcolonial modernism in concert with his Anglo-Canadian contemporaries, he elsewhere and more enduringly expressed the fully globalized view of the Jewish writer’s diasporic modernism. As significant as his involvement with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group may have been to the development of his modernist poetics, the magazine was not by any measure the most important public forum for his responses to aesthetic modernism and writers of the Jewish diaspora. That distinction belongs to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Canadian Jewish Chronicle</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">CJC</span>), the weekly paper that Klein edited and to which he contributed short stories, poetry, translations, editorials, literary essays, and book reviews on a continuous basis from October 1938 to June 1955.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The <span style="font-style:italic;">CJC</span> abounds with Klein’s views on both modernist and diasporic cultures. Writing in the 13 May 1949 issue, Klein’s conceptualization of the relationship between  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Israeli and diasporic Jewish cultures resonates with the debate over native and cosmopolitan literary cultures among Canada’s midcentury modernists:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	      The mere fact that Jewish existence has now achieved a national status and dignity cannot be without its influence even upon the culture of those who have another sovereign allegiance. And it is precisely here that the true flowering of Jewish culture is possible. A culture which is confined to but one area tends to become restricted and insular; a culture which is everywhere planted tends to become diffuse and diluted. Neither the one nor the other are consummations greatly to be desired. But with Israel hewing straitly to the line, following directly in the path of ancient tradition, and with world Jewry thinking in larger cosmopolitan terms, our culture is very likely to acquire a completeness and wholeness it never enjoyed before. At once placed solidly in the ground and yet looking with eager eyes upon the world, surely it may inherit the best qualities of both Diaspora and Israeli culture.<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	    Klein emphatically sided against those Zionists who saw the establishment of the Jewish homeland as the negation of the diaspora, a position against which he argued repeatedly in the <span style="font-style:italic;">CJC</span> through the late 1940s and early 1950s.<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> Rather, he sought the articulation of a transnational Jewish culture in the dialectics of diaspora and Israel. Together with the dialectics of nativism and cosmopolitanism, Klein articulated the dialectical relationship between Israel and the diaspora. These dialectics may not be homologous, but they are interrelated. For instance, a few years prior to his columns on the question of the diaspora, he entered the native-cosmopolitan debate via his reply to a questionnaire sent to him by the poet and little-magazine editor Raymond Souster, which Klein published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">CJC</span> in February and March 1946 under the title “Writing in Canada.”<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a> Faced with questions about national “identity” , “character” , and “consciousness”  in contemporary Canadian literature, Klein mobilizes his dialectic to arrive at a hybridized position between the nativist and the cosmopolitan where “a writer may be prompted to choose his Canadian subject so that his universal attitudes, since confined to a given locale, may be accentuated the more” .
	  </p>
<p>
	    Not unlike his rejection of the Zionist negators of the diaspora, however, Klein shows no compassion for a “factitiously nationalist . . . literature”  in Canada and thus reveals his antipathy toward the nativists. Corroborated by his commentaries on Israeli poetry in “Notebook of a Journey”—a series of seventeen articles published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">CJC</span> (August 12–December 23, 1949) reporting on his trip to Europe, Israel, and North Africa in the summer of 1949—that he later integrated into the “Deuteronomy” chapter of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>, Klein’s critique of the nativist literature and culture that he discovers in Israel bespeaks his disparagement of the same in Canada. In the context of the narrator’s survey of Israeli poetry in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>, he targets those “primitive, tribal” nativists (“Irgun poets, <span style="font-style:italic;">sabra</span> poets, Yemenite poets”) who regard themselves as “more aboriginal than the aborigines,” those who espouse “<span style="font-style:italic;">shilath hagaluth</span>—the negation of the Diaspora—a conviction that Jewry abroad was doomed, whether by uxorious embrace of assimilation or the fierce hug of anti-Semitism, doomed to disappear,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> if not immediately, eventually.”<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> Conversely, the narrator also takes to task the extreme of the avant-garde poet of Tiberias, “a completely underivative poet,” “a poet of an austere economy of words”<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a>—in other words, the epitome of the cosmopolitan modernist. Solomon J. Spiro suggests that Klein’s portrait of the Tiberian poet takes satiric aim at Ezra Pound and the imagists, and draws specific comparisons between the two sheets of paper that make up “[t]he complete works of” the Tiberian and the five imagist poems of “The Complete Poetical Works of T. E. Hulme,” published as an appendix to Pound’s 1912 volume <span style="font-style:italic;">Ripostes</span>.<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a> What the narrator’s survey reveals are limit cases of nativism and cosmopolitanism, radical extremes of antimodern primitivism and avant-garde modernism, neither of which satisfies the narrator’s “quest of the essence of contemporary Hebrew poetry” for his projected anthology.<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> Neither native nor cosmopolitan exclusively, the narrator’s ideal “poetry” is found not at the “literary soirée” but “[i]n the streets, in the shops”; its creators “were not members of literary societies, the men who were giving new life to the antique speech, but merchants, tradesmen, day labourers” . “Nameless authorship flourished in the streets” , the narrator reports, as he surveys the business signs and advertisements of Israel’s capital:

<p class="continued">
	      However “anti-climactic” the narrator’s “epiphany,” as Michael Greenstein describes it,<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a> the narrator’s celebration of a democratic, populist, everyday, modern Hebrew poetry of the people marks the conjuncture of multiple discourses—native and cosmopolitan, myth and modernity, Israel and diaspora. With his populism, the narrator faintly echoes Anderson’s stance on modernist poetry in “An Explanatory Issue,” but Klein’s aesthetic is far from the socialist modernism that informs the <span style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span> group: it is, rather, a modernism that is manifest in the signs of global capitalism, the advertisements of a globalized modernity. That the anthology the narrator discovers in a signature Joycean epiphanic moment consists of advertising is doubtless Klein’s nod to <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, whose central re, Leopold Bloom, is a professional ad man;<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a> this allusive gesture to Joyce is one of the signature ways in which Klein orients his modernist project in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Most notable among Klein’s commentaries on Anglo-American modernism in the <span style="font-style:italic;">CJC</span> is his late critique of antisemitism in the writings of two of its principal practitioners, Eliot and Pound. Although Klein had during his McGill days raised uncompromising objections to modernism on aesthetic grounds,<a name="f63-text" href="#f63"><sup>63</sup></a> his far more pointed attack on Pound and Eliot in the late 1940s was additionally motivated in the immediate aftermath of the Holocaust by their shameful legacy of antisemitism. In her analysis of Klein’s ambivalent relationship to Eliot and Pound, Darlene Kelly points out that Klein  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> launched his attack “in the Jewish periodicals which he edited,”<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> including a parodic verse-review of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Cantos</span> titled “Cantabile” (September–October 1948), an essay of protest against Eliot’s Nobel laureateship called “T. S. Eliot and the Nobel Prize” (November 12–26, 1948), and an essay of censure against the 1949 Bollingen Prize committee for honoring Pound called “Old Ez and His Blankets” (March 4, 1949)—all of which appeared in the <span style="font-style:italic;">CJC</span>. If critics have been perplexed by Klein’s repudiation of the progenitors who provided models for his own modernism through the 1930s and 1940s,<a name="f65-text" href="#f65"><sup>65</sup></a> their perplexity may find some clarification if we recall the pair of modernist projects to which Klein turned his attention in the late 1940s: <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span> and his critical commentary on Joyce’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>. After all, unlike Eliot and Pound, “Joyce was clearly a Judeophile,” and <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> provided the prototype for Klein’s own story of the diasporic Jew and his practice of a diasporic modernism.<a name="f66-text" href="#f66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<p>
	      As Klein distanced himself from the antisemitic modernism of Eliot and Pound, he started to articulate the relationship between the Jewish diaspora and Joyce’s modernism. According to Caplan, “Klein often thought of writing a monumental poem or novel that would capture the Montreal of his youth just as <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> had memorialized Joyce’s Dublin. . . . In the forties he made several starts at a novel set in Montreal, using himself as the model for its Jewish hero and drawing up elaborate schematic outlines in clear imitation of Joyce” . Although Klein cast off the idea of writing what Caplan calls the “Canadian <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>” , he retained the blueprint of Joyce’s narrative of the wandering Jew when he came to write his own version for a post-Holocaust generation in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>. As Lorraine Weir makes plain, Klein’s “Notebook of a Journey” commences in the first installment with “the catechetical technique which Joyce used in the ‘Ithaca’ chapter of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>” in which he produces a sequence of ten stylistic experiments (titled “Reportorial,” “Rhetorical,” “Sentimental,” “Ironic,” “Satiric,” “Poetic,” “Biblic,” “Mishnaic,” “Talmudic,” and “Cabbalistic”) that gloss the “<span style="font-style:italic;">plain unvarnished fact</span>” of his departure for Israel on July 31, 1949.<a name="f67-text" href="#f67"><sup>67</sup></a> These glosses also allude to the “Oxen of the Sun” episode of <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, where Joyce enlists a “progress of parodies,” as Klein calls it in his “Oxen” essay,<a name="f68-text" href="#f68"><sup>68</sup></a> through which he recapitulates the history of the English language and its literary styles from “alliterative and monosyllabic and Anglo-Saxon . . . until it ends in a frightful jumble of pidgin English, nigger English, Cockney, with Bowery slang and broken doggerel.”<a name="f69-text" href="#f69"><sup>69</sup></a> Given their obvious and deliberate indebtedness to Joyce, these stylized glosses at the beginning of the “Notebook” effectively translate the Irish author’s narrative of Bloom the wandering Jew in Dublin into the story of Klein the diasporic Jew’s return to Israel. That Klein chooses the form of the gloss to commemorate his <span style="font-style:italic;">aliyah</span> to Israel not only complements his concurrent critical project of writing glosses on <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> but also anticipates the contrapuntal text-and-gloss structure of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>.
	    </p>
<p>
	      Writing to Leon Edel on January 22, 1948, Klein outlines his <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> project: “a line-by-line, or rather page-by-page, commentary on <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, tracking down all the allusions, indicating in the abstruser stream-of-consciousness paragraphs, the mental associations and sequences, explicating text, and relating the parts to the whole etc.” His method is that of the “glossators—no more, but no less; only with embarrassment  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> to myself can I skip the cryptic.”<a name="f70-text" href="#f70"><sup>70</sup></a> For Edel, Klein’s glossatorial practice is rooted in the Jewish tradition of scriptural commentary, so that in <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> the “talmudist has found a new Talmud.”<a name="f71-text" href="#f71"><sup>71</sup></a> In his article “The Klein-Joyce Engima,” which is based in part on his correspondence with Klein, Edel describes the composition of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> glosses as “a second book . . . being created in the margins of the original,”<a name="f72-text" href="#f72"><sup>72</sup></a> a fitting image of Klein’s Talmudic style of commentary on Joyce’s text. Edel’s remarks on Klein’s work as a glossator serve as prelude to his point not only that <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> is one of the ur-texts for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span> but that the glosses on Joyce’s text initiate Klein’s own autoglossatorial practice:
	    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
		Joyce had built his <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> on the framework of the Odyssey; Klein builds his on the books of the Pentateuch from Genesis to Deuteronomy. . . . His long letters to me explain and expatiate on his Joycean labyrinth; he now provides a gloss on himself; the book is filled with a series of gloss-chapters named with the letters of the Jewish alphabet.<a name="f73-text" href="#f73"><sup>73</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	      Just as Edel notes that the divisions of the main text of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span> mirror the five books of the Torah, so the five corresponding gloss chapters (“Aleph,” “Beth,” “Gimel,” “Dalid,” and “Hai”) invoke the structure of Talmud. While the generic multiplicity of Klein’s glosses—poetry, letter, play, liturgy—corresponds loosely to the typographic interplay of multiple glosses in the apparatus of the Talmud, his glosses also represent a secondary anthology, not the “essence of contemporary Hebrew poetry” that the narrator seeks on his trip to Israel,<a name="f74-text" href="#f74"><sup>74</sup></a> but the global dispersal of texts across the diaspora. Where the main narrative culminates in the narrator’s discovery of an anthology in the streets of Tel Aviv, in its commercial signage and advertisements, the gloss chapters constitute an anthology of the diaspora. The dialectical relationship between these two anthologies can be found in Klein’s intergeneric play between text and gloss. For instance, the Tel Aviv anthology could be construed as a collection of glosses in which the narrator’s commentaries on the mythic allusions and puns on the signs are integrated into his catalogue of advertisements. And conversely, the glosses are for the most part texts rather than commentaries (with the exception of “Gloss Gimel,” which is an exemplary case of Klein’s glossatorial practice). Taken together, these two anthologies manifest <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>’s dialectics of text and gloss, Israel and diaspora, native and cosmopolitan. Building on the Talmud’s archetypal compilation of ancient and early-modern texts from Israel and the diaspora alike, the “[n]ameless authorship”<a name="f75-text" href="#f75"><sup>75</sup></a> from the streets of Tel Aviv and the glosses by the anonymous narrator (“Aleph” and “Beth”) and Uncle Melech (“Gimel,” “Dalid,” and “Hai”) from Montreal, Rome, and Casablanca embody anthologies of post-Holocaust Jewish modernity.
	    </p>
<p>
	      As anthologists, Klein and his anonymous narrator perform editorial roles, a mediating function that is integral to their enactment of a modernist poetics. Even in his unfinished attempt to write page-by-page glosses on <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, Klein embarks on what is effectively a modernist editorial project. That Klein continues his glossatorial work on <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span> in his correspondence and in his articles published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">CJC</span> speaks to the open-endedness of the Talmudic textual tradition out of which he  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> emerges as a modernist editor. His editorial work, beginning with his commentaries on <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span>, unfolds an extensible series of glosses that moves through <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span> and reappears in his letters and articles.
	    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Parchemin Roll</h1>
<p>
	      The story of Klein’s modernist editorial work is also the story of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>, a text that provoked him to offer his own commentaries on textual editing and that provides its own metatextual commentaries on the editing of the first scroll—the Torah. As numerous commentators before me have pointed out, the Miltonic epigraph that opens <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>—“And ask a Talmudist what ails the modesty of his marginal Keri that Moses and all the prophets cannot persuade him to pronounce the textual Chetiv”<a name="f76-text" href="#f76"><sup>76</sup></a>—specifically addresses the textual problems of the Torah. As Pollock and Popham indicate in their annotation on the epigraph,<a name="f77-text" href="#f77"><sup>77</sup></a> Klein supplied his own gloss in his 1951 essay “The Bible Manuscripts,” published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">CJC</span>: “[T]he word’s writ one way, and tradition bids you read another. <span style="font-style:italic;">Ketib</span>—thus it is written, but <span style="font-style:italic;">Keri</span>—you must read it thus. Nor is it a simple innocuous ambiguity which thence ensues, but often—and this is the most un-hinging thought of all—downright negation.”<a name="f78-text" href="#f78"><sup>78</sup></a> Keeping in mind that Pollock has already demonstrated that this essay serves as a “radical revision” of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>,<a name="f79-text" href="#f79"><sup>79</sup></a> I would like to extend the essay’s purview somewhat further and read it as a general guide to the textual history of the novel and, in particular, as a Baedeker to the editorial rationale enacted in Pollock and Popham’s critical edition.<a name="f80-text" href="#f80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>
<p>
	      For instance, Pollock and Popham’s method of genetic transcription of the revisions to the extant manuscript of the “Exodus” chapter bears at least faint resemblance to the third of ten edicts established by the scribes of Israel, as enumerated by Klein in “The Bible Manuscripts”: “<span style="font-style:italic;">No erasures</span>. If error has crept into the text, if the scribe’s nodding shows, alas; the words are not expungeable. Ugly, in truth sacrilegious, are deletions, outmarkings, defacements, over-writings, erasures, for it is Holy Writ.”<a name="f81-text" href="#f81"><sup>81</sup></a> I assume that the editors chose to not follow the other nine, which include “<span style="font-style:italic;">Writing to be done upon parchment</span>,” “<span style="font-style:italic;">Before writing, meditate</span>,” and “<span style="font-style:italic;">Before writing, every word pronounce</span>” . While the similarity between their genetic method of transcription and the discipline of early scribal practice is no more than incidental, it does gesture toward their attempted recovery of Klein’s “textual Chetiv”—if only in the paratextual apparatus rather than the reading text. That the original manuscript of the novel is no longer extant may invite some comparison to the lost original of the Torah, for as Klein says, “the scripture in our hands, which attests to the existence and the disappearance of its own original, is but a transcript” . It is tempting to draw analogies between the missing first manuscript version of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span> and the version of the Torah “that came down the mountain” , as Klein puts it, “the exact image, the very visual photograph, of the writ which came from Moses’ hand, of God’s primordial glyph” . Though it may not help to think of the subsequent revisions and versions of the various texts that precede and converge in the publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span> as exact  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> parallels to what Klein calls the “sacrilegious emendation and blasphemous editing” of the Torah , there is some merit in relating his essay’s account of the historical process of the first scroll’s textual transmission and editorial mediation to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>. As represented in the paratextual apparatus to Pollock and Popham’s edition, Klein’s process of composition and revision of the novel approximates the Talmudist’s compilation of “marginal Keri.” Their editorial practice is, at least in their editing of the reading text, not the scribal practice of what Klein calls “mere copyists, duplicators, fashioners of facsimile” . Nor are their minor emendations examples of “downright negation” that Klein laments in his reading of <span style="font-style:italic;">keri</span> in the margins of the Torah. Their list of variants is not a set of Talmudic commandments—“you must read it thus”—but a record of alternative readings that attest to the historicity and sociality of the texts that make up the narrative of the novel’s genesis and dissemination. Just as the story of the Torah’s transcriptions, in Klein’s words, “from the Table of Moses to the Stone of Joshua to the Scroll in the Ark to the writings of Aristeas to the calligraphy of the youngest scribe”  bears witness to the devolution of the first scroll from a state of absent oneness to that of the immanent many, so too is the story of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span>’s textual exodus from singularity to multiplicity “re-membered” among the paratextual <span style="font-style:italic;">keri</span> in Pollock and Popham’s edition.<a name="f82-text" href="#f82"><sup>82</sup></a></p>
<p>
	      Such is the story of the diasporic text. Pollock and Popham’s edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span> attests to the radical hybridity of the text’s construction out of a vertiginous array of avant-textual preliminary materials, manuscript and typescript pages, and previously published versions—all of which call attention to the sweeping range of social forces and collaborative processes that mediate the production and dissemination of the text. The lines of convergence among these forces and processes in the novel’s textual history constitute a map of the diasporic text’s travels among archives, notebooks, periodicals, anthologies, and editions. Granted that the transnational circuits of transmission traveled by the texts that compose the hybrid structure of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span> are only remotely comparable to the global networks of the Jewish diaspora, it cannot be ignored that their transit through Jewish periodicals and publishing houses in the United States is a significant feature of their dissemination within a globalized diaspora and their contribution to the formation of a diasporic modernism. At the same time, Klein’s role in circulating early versions of the main chapters (“Notebook of a Journey”) and the glosses (“Gloss Beth,” “Elegy”; “Gloss Hai,” “Of Remembrance”) in the <span style="font-style:italic;">CJC</span> speaks to his own editorial construction and propagation of a Jewish modernism in the diaspora. Pollock and Popham’s apparatus of textual notes, appendices, and cross-referencing to the apparatuses of earlier volumes in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Collected Works of A. M. Klein</span> stands as testimony to the diasporic textual history of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Second Scroll</span> and its mediation by an editorial tradition of Talmudic scholarship in the diaspora. To read the Klein committee’s now nearly three-decade commitment to editing Klein’s works as an extension of his own editorial practices is an apt tribute to and necessary acknowledgment of the diasporic tradition of textual scholarship that informs both the author and his editors alike. Diasporic editors and authors—they are always fellow travelers.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

      </div>
</blockquote>
<p>
	In Samuel Beckett’s early story “Love and Lethe,” from <span style="font-style:italic;">More Pricks than Kicks</span>, Ruby Tough asks Belacqua his reasons for proposing that she aid him in committing suicide—though the word “suicide” is never uttered and the proposal is therefore obscure. Parsing the reasons he gives would require extensive reading, as Belacqua’s list goes well beyond the standard “Greek and Roman reasons” that remain relatively well known today, most commonly, those known as death before dishonor and agent’s choice before patient’s suffering. For the purposes of this essay, one thing that stands out in Beckett’s list is an absence: its lack of reference to any of the reasons usually advanced for suicidal ideation in the lives or works of modernist writers. That is, Belacqua does not mention existential despair, crisis in norms or values, or wasteland senselessness and alienation. Aside from the final comment, that “true reasons” do not “exist, at least not for  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the purposes of conversation,” which hints at suicide’s lasting mark of taboo, Beckett’s list is both scholarly and neutral in affect.
      </p>
<p>
	How did Belacqua arrive at his particular set of reasons for suicide? Tracing the etiology of his list involves a thick historicization of the rise of suicidology in the first modern suicidological texts. Suicidology, so-called since the 1960s but nameless before then, emerged, as I will argue, from among more prominent emergent social sciences, particularly psychology, sociology, anthropology, and the new methodology of statistics. Suicide also remained in the territory of philosophy, history, the law, and literature. Physiology, though increasingly subordinated or simply side-stepped by pre–World War II proto-suicidologists, also played a role. In addition to the intellectual definition and social formation of discrete modern academic disciplines, interdisciplinary collaboration and competition combined to create modernist suicidological discourses. Non-academic commentators played major roles in these discourses as well, and a number of the most influential texts were aimed equally at the lay reader and the scholarly audience; they sought to persuade and guide ordinary readers as well as to shape and change the disciplines.
      </p>
<p>
	In the modernist period, suicidology emerged sufficiently to become what one might call an “inter-discipline.” Modernist discourses about suicide often emphasized a need to traverse different disciplines to deal with the vexing phenomenon and thus formed the basis for contemporary suicidology. While overlooked by most contemporary modernist critics, these deliberately self-modernizing proto-suicidological discourses formed the ideational background for representations of suicide in modernist literature, from that literature’s beginnings in the last decades of the nineteenth century through high modernism in the 1920s and ’30s. Literature itself played a varied role in those discourses, even as—together with literary criticism—it gradually became a disciplinary player in its own right.
      </p>
<p>
	Contextualizing suicide among the academic disciplines, however, entails reconsideration, first, of suicide’s status both as taboo and as symptom of an alleged modernist crisis.
      </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">“The Repressive Hypothesis,” Redux</h1>
<p>
	  When cultural and literary critics write of suicide in the modernist era, they usually contextualize it as A. Alvarez does in his classic study <span style="font-style:italic;">The Savage God</span>. Alvarez aligns suicide with Eliot’s “waste land” of chaos, alienation, numbness, and despair and with Conrad’s “horror.” Even when qualifying these admittedly sensationalizing terms (as Alvarez also does), suicide is offered as a symptom of the “crisis” of “modernism.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> So, indeed, is death. Inspired by Philippe Ariès’s discussion of all death having become gradually both “terrifying” and “invisible”<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> in the long turn-of-the-twentieth-century (from the 1850s to the 1950s for Ariès), one critic comments of modernist literature: “No longer natural and culturally acceptable, fictional death became attenuated, denied, or horrific.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> With application to its narratology, he continues, “[s]ubverting suspense, modern novels became circular and self-reflexive, returning repeatedly and ultimately to  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> terminal events they rarely confront or transcend. Modernists elide the dying process.”<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Not merely “invisible,” though occurring in ever-increasing numbers as populations and wars grew in size, modern death had, Ariès argues, become so taboo that people “no longer dare[d] say its name.” Once “tame,” death had become “wild.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> While Ariès later acknowledges the sexual innuendo of this phrasing and agrees with Geoffrey Gorer in linking this innuendo to persisting Victorian “prudery” about sex, such charged rhetoric invites a considered second look.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Amid Ariès’s discourse on “prudish” suppressions of death, George Minois finds “voluntary death,” ironically, “conspicuously absent” in Ariès’s study; Minois concludes his own study with a call to debate.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Perhaps modernist suicide did operate as a site of horror and taboo, but if it did, was this the only way it operated? Belacqua’s list hints at contexts in which suicide might seem the reverse of shameful self-abnegation, contexts in which suicide might seem or be romantic, heroic, or aesthetic. I do not in what follows adjudicate among these revaluations, nor try to weigh the relative worth of one view of suicide over another, but instead describe the many ways in which suicide was written, after and surrounding suicidal events, and written prolifically. As Beckett writes, Belacqua’s list of rationales does not include his own reason, for “reasons . . . he had none.” No reasons, yet plenty of ideas to offer his would-be partner in suicide.
	</p>
<p>
	  Particularly after a suicide when no author is left to write about it, even a suicide note, if there is one, strikes its readers as suspect, insufficient, or empty. Suicide has defied diagnosis by doctors and is viewed by many contemporary suicidologists as enigmatic or, again, so overdetermined as to defy rational explanation.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> Lacking voice, it seems also to lack origin—a seedless birth. As such, it has functioned as a wild vortex of manifold writings. Reminiscent of Foucault’s repressive hypothesis,<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> suicide’s taboo status did not make it a topic on which writers were silent. Rather, like some northern cultures’ names for snow, ways of speaking it proliferated. In the modernist period, thanks in part to the emerging social sciences, numerous accounts of its causes and processes were produced from within and without the universities of Europe. Modernist literature’s contributions to these discussions become especially evident when one constructs literary modernism broadly, as beginning with the aesthetic and discursive innovations of the later nineteenth century, that is, the time of most major “modernist” authors’ early cultural formation (Yeats turned 25 in 1900; Joyce turned 18).<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> But these contributions are also observable when one constructs literary modernism narrowly, as beginning just before or during the First World War in tandem with the height of global social crisis and modernist experimentalism.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> In either context, modernist literature played a more multifaceted part in thought about suicide than A. Alvarez recognized. Alvarez underrepresented modernist treatments of suicide—considering neither the diverse range of representations nor even the most renowned literary portraits of suicide (nor, for that matter, the texts of writers who verifiably killed themselves). Instead, he addressed, selectively, Dostoyevsky’s novels, the “extremist” tactics of Dada, and the war poet Wilfred Owen, treating the latter as a writer and victim of a suicidal modernist wasteland. In this article, I focus on something Alvarez largely ignored: modernist literature’s reliance on professional discourses of suicide that had arisen gradually over the course of the previous century.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	  I limit my discussion to developments in England, the United States, and (to a lesser extent) France, Belgium, and Germany. Rather than definitively answering the controversial question of how to define the “inter-discipline,” this essay explores how different emergent disciplines interacted with each other around the suicide issue, using contemporaneous publications from Europe and the United States to track the development of these multidisciplinary and disciplinary discourses. Broadly modernist social science texts about suicide, particularly by British and American intellectual workers who have been overlooked within literary studies because they were so thoroughly superseded by post–World War II suicidology, merit revisitation not only for their narratives of modern suicide but also for their roles in cross-disciplinary argumentation and knowledge production in the modernist era. This article recovers their intellectual work. “Intellectual” admittedly did not sit easily on British tongues as a social label, as Stefan Collini stresses,<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a> but I intend a capacious idea of intellectual work: most of the texts discussed here were designed for an educated literate public, not exclusively for scientific or academic circles. While this history of modernist suicide is in some ways a story of emergent professionalization, modernist discourse on suicide engaged virtually all the intellectual classes in public textual conversations. Modern doctors, lawyers, philosophers, ethicists, and artists published their conversations with each other. While usually not emanating directly from the academic “departments” that were emerging in England and America, these psychological, statistical, and sociological studies already displayed two characteristics of nineteenth-century disciplinarity: deference to mentor-precursors in scholars’ particular fields of study and observance of general rules or explicit methodologies. These texts position themselves in argumentative relationship to each other more often than in reportorial relationship to patients or events, though they occasionally cite direct testimonials or individual cases. They are generally multidisciplinary and frequently interdisciplinary, in that they seek to combine or intertwine, not merely compound, the methodologies of variant fields.
	</p>
<p>
	  Developing rapidly from the mid-Victorian era onward, multidisciplinary collaboration and disciplinary competition advanced simultaneously and self-consciously around the suicide question, as around other major issues of that time such as labor, women, and industrialism. Amid these developments, literature functioned as an (inter)disciplinary player, serving up not only representations of suicide for dramatic value but also inquiry into and indications of how it might—and might not—be known. In the limited frame of this article,<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> I seek to sketch this confabulation of suicide knowledge-productions and, as indicated above, to draw upon just one literary example—from Beckett’s “Love and Lethe.” This sketch will emphasize the point that suicide, while enigmatic, became a node around which turn-of-the-century discourses entertained abundant possibilities for analyzing and coexisting with, preventing and surviving, the suicidal.

	  Within the rise of suicide studies, one can discern continual tendencies to defend writing about suicide (acknowledging it as a taboo subject arousing discomfort) and to confront the taboo (as a personal and/or social fact demanding scrutiny). In what follows, I historicize salient episodes in suicide studies’ rise, starting in the late eighteenth century and charting the push and pull between traditional thought and its  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> critics and between one emerging discipline and another. Literature threads in and out of the suicidological texts, sometimes serving up evidence or argument, sometimes acting as bad guy in a text’s moral narrative, sometimes providing uplift. Literature also had its own clichés to trot out as well as its own carefully contextualized narrative webs to weave about suicide, and it clearly provided a vehicle (for the literate) to learn and think as well as feel and worry about suicide. Beckett’s particularly intricate story of suicide indicates how well-informed modernist writers often were about the history of suicidological thought and how much they could contribute beyond literary conventions that had been in place since classical times. Not all of the threads of this story—modernist crisis, suicide’s discursivity, disciplinary and interdisciplinary development, non-academic professional investigation, and literature (and literary studies) as itself a competitive, emergent “discipline”—align neatly. Nor do I wish to force such alignment. But this history can, with its several threads crossing each other, offer a somewhat different picture from the dominant paradigms of suicide as silenced through taboo, of modernism as numb (and dumb) with crisis, of the early history of disciplinary suicide discourses as irrelevant to contemporary suicidology as well as to modernist literature, and of literature as irrelevant, subordinate to, or even dismissed by both the other self-modernizing disciplines, in general, and by early suicidology, in particular.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Emerging Modern Disciplines in the History of Suicidology</h1>
<p>
	  From its beginnings, the study of suicide has been closely linked to the establishment of new fields. Emile Durkheim remains today the best-known thinker on suicide, and his work in 1897 on the sociology of suicide is often thought of as foundational. Like other founders, however (Freud and Marx, for example), Durkheim built his treatise on prior studies.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> The rhetorical energy in Durkheim’s study is directed not at explaining suicide but at carving out sociology as an autonomous new field. If there is an origin to the modern medical study of suicide, arguably it is the French doctor Philippe Pinel’s early psychological writings and asylum work, prompted by a friend’s self-destruction in the 1780s.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> Pinel is viewed by many as the “father” of modern psychiatry, and his work was followed by a number of psychological studies of suicide in France, most notably by the psychologists Jean-Etienne Esquirol, Pinel’s student, and Jean-Pierre Falret in the 1820s and 1830s.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> Durkheim used suicide to found sociology precisely on the ruins, as he hoped, of psychology as a social science; though psychology’s rise had been slow at first and fraught with difficulty, by the end of the nineteenth century it had become almost thoroughly institutionalized in European universities. Durkheim flew in the face of this seemingly unstoppable advance and, in doing so, distracted attention from a no less dangerous, younger competitor with sociology for prominence in social explanation: evolutionary biology.
	</p>
<p>
	  Commentators on the history of suicide tend to cite <span style="font-style:italic;">The Anatomy of Suicide</span> by Forbes Winslow in 1840 as the first British book dedicated to the science of suicide.<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> Some prior English studies had emphasized metaphysical and logical arguments for and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> against suicide, for instance, Donne and Hume’s famous essays.<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> Others had focused on the theological, like Charles Moore’s lengthy historical and Christian moralization of suicide in <span style="font-style:italic;">A Full Inquiry into the Subject of Suicide</span> in 1790 and Simon Piggott’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Suicide and Its Antidotes, A Series of Anecdotes and Narratives, with Suggestions on Mental Distress</span> in 1824, which framed its multidimensional study of suicide’s causation with theological sermons and advice.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Although Winslow, a member of the Royal College of Surgeons who dedicated his study to the late king’s “Physician Extraordinary,” concurred with the Christian viewpoint, he endeavored to legitimize science as the primary modality for studying suicide, and he deployed suicide to argue specifically for psychology as a legitimate field of study.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> Despite its ultimate institutionalization by the end of the nineteenth century, psychology had struggled at its inception in the late eighteenth century and through much of the nineteenth, especially among the English public, from identification with its subject of lunacy as well as from lingering British moral resistance to Enlightenment thinking.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Winslow sought explicitly to present the psychologist as a scholar and a doctor, focused on a mental and physiological space, apart from yet congruent with the divine’s sphere of the soul. Though psychologists studied lunacy and idiocy, he emphasized that they were not themselves lunatics or idiots.
	</p>
<p>
	  Durkheim, seeking at the turn of the twentieth century to wrest suicide studies from psychology, claimed statistics as the supreme instrument for suicidology and framed statistical methodology as specifically sociological. But these connections were not new. André-Michel Guerry, a lawyer, and Adolphe Quetelet, a mathematician and astronomer, had established statistics in the 1830s in part through the study of suicide, which they linked to crime and marriage in a single set of statistically analyzable problems. Considered at that time as moral problems, this set of issues resulted in the new field’s appellation of “Moral Statistics.”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> (Earlier writers, like Charles Moore and Richard Hey [1785], had linked suicide with dueling and gaming.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a>) As statistics developed, psychologists drew ever more readily on statisticians’ findings for their arguments, until, gradually, sociologists and social-evolutionary biologists seized both the ground and the method from them. By the 1880s, sociology had begun to assert its legitimacy in England, at least outside the university system, through the efforts especially of Herbert Spencer. The publication that most influenced the late-nineteenth-century study of suicide in England—a translation in 1881 of Italian professor Enrico Morselli’s treatise <span style="font-style:italic;">Suicide, An Essay on Comparative Moral Statistics</span>—expressed direct indebtedness to Spencer, alongside, eclectically, Charles Darwin, Henry Buckle, Henry Maudsley, Alfred Russel Wallace, and other British scientists. Morselli devotes the introduction to this book to making the arguments for scientific theory and the methodology of statistics. Along with his French nineteenth-century peers, he termed his field “social physics.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> Morselli’s treatise stood for decades as the best resource for comparative statistics on suicide.
	</p>
<p>
	  Modernist suicidology, then, was wrought both from within and across the lines of several fast-developing, self-reflexive intellectual fields—psychology, sociology, evolutionary social biology, and statistics. Winslow and the late nineteenth-century proto-suicidologists viewed their approaches to knowledge as “modern,” no longer  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> following classical, medieval, or Renaissance paradigms. These precocious self-modernizers consciously contributed to the Enlightenment activities of data-gathering and interpretation, even when deferring (in ever more qualified ways) to a final religious or humanistic moral viewpoint on suicide’s meaning or prevention. Their intellectual discourses thus paralleled theological developments of that time, including the discourses of skeptical Enlightenment theologians in Europe, which were decried by Pope Pius X as constituting “the Doctrine of the Modernists” and were regularly referred to (then and now) as “the crisis of modernism” or “the modernist crisis.”<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> (Pius intended the entire discursive phenomenon of Enlightenment skepticism by these phrases, commenting on “modernism” in a series of encyclicals from 1903 to 1914.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a>) Historically, the specter of suicide had played a critical part in Christian admonitions against the sin of despair (recall the nadir reached, for example, by the Redcrosse Knight in Spenser’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Faerie Queene</span><a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a>); as the argument went, if one failed in faith, nothing remained to forestall despairing self-destruction. In the nineteenth century, however, Schopenhauer’s metaphysics famously challenged both the motivational concept of a Christian afterlife and the negative moral valence (and taboo) applied to suicide, reconstituting suicide as a sane option. In pursuing a logical and empirical approach, the social scientists of suicide themselves sought both to alleviate moral crises associated with suicide and to open suicide as a topic for rational discussion.
	</p>
<p>
	  Like Durkheim, these earlier writers had disciplinary antagonists. For Winslow, metaphysics needed confrontation and absorption; for Morselli, it required dismissal.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> For the British barrister, S. A. K. Strahan, “morality” (and theological arguments) required sustained, rational opposition;<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> in addition, Strahan opposed psychology insofar as its proponents had settled on “insanity” as the diagnosis for all attempted or actual suicides.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> At the same time that suicidology was developing within competing disciplines, however, it was also deliberately interdisciplinary. Morselli’s list of influences, for example, indicates the extent to which late Victorian social scientists had merged naturalism and physiology with sociology, psychology, and history to produce a potent interdisciplinary blend of evolutionary determinism. The increase in statistical numbers of suicide over time in so-called civilized races signaled to these analysts a concomitant degeneration in Western, white peoples—a decline that they increasingly blamed on modernity. Like Morselli, when Winslow advocated for psychology, he did not divorce his study from physiology; then again, he did not privilege the biological either. Rather, he viewed psychology as encompassing mind and body, the nervous system and the entrails alike.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> In contrast, Strahan’s book, published in 1893, adopted evolutionary biologism as its primary model, and it thereby took exception to psychology, though unlike Morselli, Strahan regarded heredity studies as a more important tool than statistics.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> (This is the historical medical context in which Marx’s brilliant daughter Eleanor Marx [1855–98] and her artistic peers Amy Levy [1861–89] and Charlotte Mew [1869–1928] killed themselves, and in which Virginia Woolf’s early suicide attempts [1904] killed themselves, and in which Virginia Woolf’s early suicide attempts [1913] were diagnosed. Woolf’s doctor, George Savage, contributed directly to this discourse, from as early as 1884 to as late as 1911.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a>)  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	  But such (con)fusion of approaches was just one way in which interdisciplinarity worked. Philosophy and literature had, of course, been age-old companions in describing suicide: nineteenth-century English and French medical studies of suicide often began, as Belacqua does, with the “Greek and Roman reasons.”<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> In the opening decades of the twentieth century, suicidology found itself, on one hand, between the social and physiological sciences, and, on the other hand, between the sciences and metaphysics, ethics, history, and literature, with frequent cross-hatching across the lines. Another influential study on suicide published in the same year as Morselli’s by the British forensic scientist William Wynn Westcott framed his observations on suicide as <span style="font-style:italic;">A Social Treatise</span> and, though Westcott was a medical worker, analogized his study to a “textbook” of approaches, views, and findings.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Despite the terms “treatise” and “textbook,” Westcott’s book was intended to address what “may be legitimately regarded as one of our Social Problems” for a broad “community” of literate readers.<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a> Designed thus as a type of reference work, yet one more accessible than Morselli’s—whose text Westcott denigrates as “hardly a readable book, consisting almost entirely of statistics”<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a>—Westcott’s study approaches in some sections the status of an annotated bibliography, with brief discursive commentary subordinated to citations. It allots chapters to suicide’s ethics, history, literature, and jurisprudence, as well as to its “causation and prevention” (Westcott’s subtitle includes all these categories except suicide’s ethics). In Westcott, a semi-Comtean model took sociology as its overarching field, circumscribing history, literature, and economics (Comte is also viewed as a founder of sociology for his coinage and definition of the term in the early nineteenth century, though he saw anthropology as the supreme social science). A similar sort of compilation takes place in the 1882 book by a New York doctor, James O’Dea: <span style="font-style:italic;">Suicide: Studies on Its Philosophy, Causes, and Prevention.</span> While that title declines to advertise how scientifically oriented his study is, its aim nonetheless is a careful balance of “social” and “medical” causes—that is, external, social, statistically correlated causes as opposed to internal, individual, physical, and psychological ones.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> In addition, his book begins with a cross-cultural anthropological discussion that is indebted to Edward Burnett Tylor and others, and that includes deferential citations of Wordsworth, Carlyle, and Shakespeare along the way. Finally, it offers a pragmatic therapeutics at the end (without condemning atheism, O’Dea nonetheless recommends reading the New Testament among other helpful aids to prevent suicide).<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> Even Strahan’s treatise initially positions itself in negotiation among several disciplines, as indicated by his title: <span style="font-style:italic;">Suicide and Insanity: A Physiological and Sociological Study</span>. For O’Dea, the very fact that suicide must be understood from various perspectives argues for its “propriety” as a topic for general reading: “Suicide,” he explains with his first sentences, “is a question partly social, partly medical; hence it may with propriety be discussed in a volume intended for intelligent readers generally.”<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Though deliberately excluding traditional strains of thought and adopting what he viewed as a coherently scientific approach, Morselli too had intended his English translation for a British public, which he perceived as broad and “prudent”:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    As to this English edition I think it right to remark that it differs in many points from the Italian. The book, which originally reached 512 pages, was reduced by desire of the publisher to more moderate proportions. Thus many parts have been suppressed, and amongst them almost all the introduction which turned upon statistics as applied to moral phenomena . . . .To keep still more within the new limits imposed upon me, I have shortened to the utmost the theoretical part, judging it more useful to leave to the prudent English reader the application of the facts than to reduce the number of facts themselves . . . . I have thus, if I do not deceive myself, rendered the work more attractive to the English reader.<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  As for Strahan, his book leaves no doubt about his intended audience and problem-solving aims: “The remarkable prevalence of suicide in England this summer brought the painful question of self-destruction prominently before the public. . . . It is in the hope that people may be induced to use intelligently, in the propagation of the human race, some of the knowledge, care, and forethought so successfully exercised in the breeding of the lower animals that this book is given to the public.”<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  As O’Dea’s work illustrates, the emergent anthropologists of the late nineteenth century had also been attending to suicide in their comparative studies. In 1869, for example, the renowned historiographer W. E. H. Lecky produced a two-volume <span style="font-style:italic;">History of European Morals</span>, which—starkly contrasting with Moore’s late-eighteenth-century treatise—treated suicide, among innumerable other human activities, as part and parcel of a “natural history.”<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> It was not until 1922, however, that Alfred Bayet (an avowed sociologist) published a book-length study of suicide that broke new ground largely by employing an anthropological analysis. Bayet began his book with a pointed critique of Durkheim’s disciplinarily exclusive model, emphasizing literature among Durkheim’s omissions (which also include philosophy and jurisprudence).<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> Bayet believed it high time the world outgrew “suicide horror,” and he offered theories of the primitive origins of that horror.<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> These theories formed the basis, in turn, of a highly readable, Alvarez-like book by British travel-writer and historian Henry Romilly Fedden, <span style="font-style:italic;">Suicide: A Social and Historical Study</span>, in 1938. Fedden’s study contrasts sharply with Alvarez’s in arguing for a more relaxed and nuanced ethics of suicide. His history of “moral attitudes” climaxes with chapter 8, “Mr. Bloom’s Father,” where analysis of Leopold Bloom’s thoughts about his father’s suicide in James Joyce’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Ulysses</span> exposes a paradigm shift Fedden wants to mark from Victorian moralistic social gossip (and the harm he argues it did to the discourse about suicide) to modern secular rationalism.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Fedden’s final chapter, “Theories and Ciphers,” however, turns away from the anthropological and social history that had governed his text to that point and sets forth the “modern theory” most likely to affect his own contemporaries’ attitudes toward suicide. “Two schools, psychological and sociological, independently claim to account for suicide,”<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> he dispassionately notes, then proceeds to survey  the psychological “theories” from Jean-Etienne Esquirol to Freud (for the latter, Freud’s theories of the death instinct and the repetition compulsion in <span style="font-style:italic;">Beyond the Pleasure Principle</span><a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a>) and  the “ciphers” of sociological theory from Brierre de Boismont , Morselli, and Westcott, to Durkheim, Ruth Cavan , and Maurice Halbwachs ,<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> among others.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	  Liah Greenfeld sees the emergence of the social sciences as disciplines as an academic phenomenon, in contradistinction to the natural sciences, which emerged from other professions. Suicide studies do not fit her findings, however, and even the broader field of sociology arguably arose from outside academe. Studies of suicide like Winslow’s, Westcott’s, Morselli’s, Durkheim’s, and Bayet’s sprang from various professions, situated outside as well as within universities; their discussions unfolded in part as arguments aimed at an educated public beyond their specialized peer audiences, in part as metanarratives of nineteenth-century disciplinarity and multidisciplinarity. In England, the field of sociology in general and suicidology in particular grew largely through the assiduous work of social scientists who played what Greenfeld terms “social roles” rather than professorial ones—the social roles in suicidology, for example, of asylum physicians (Winslow), coroners (Westcott), and lawyers (Strahan).<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  In the United States, this phenomenon is even more marked. Frederic L. Hoffman, a German teenage immigrant whose work history included shop-keeping, making do as a hobo, and collecting premiums for insurance companies, one day found himself fascinated by the statistics of African-American deaths and, through publishing on this and other subjects, including suicide, was eventually hired by Prudential Life Insurance as its company statistician. His annual “The Suicide Record” moved during the four decades of his greatest involvement, 1894–1934, from the later to the opening pages of the insurance periodical <span style="font-style:italic;">The Spectator</span>.<a name="f51-text" href="#f51"><sup>51</sup></a> Aware of the scientific studies that preceded and surrounded him, he frequently acknowledged his debts to the books mentioned above and recommended eclectic further reading. In several issues between 1907 and 1917, for example, Hoffman urged readers to refer to the findings of the ophthalmologist C. Ernest Pronger, who had linked eye refraction problems both to insomnia and suicide.
	</p>
<p>
	  Although U.S. suicide studies were published primarily in specialized American professional journals in the first decades of the twentieth century, in the 1920s and ’30s several major books emerged, all of them from the margins of academia or entirely outside it. These outsiders-turned-insiders created the field of U.S. suicide study. Nonetheless, these writers also read their European precursors assiduously and adhered to what essentially now represented a collaboration, rather than a merger, of psychology with sociology, with statistics showing where socially situated psychological aberrations were likely to develop. Adolph Dominic Frenay, a Roman Catholic priest, published the first of these, <span style="font-style:italic;">The Suicide Problem in the United States</span>, in 1927.<a name="f52-text" href="#f52"><sup>52</sup></a> A year later, Ruth Shonle Cavan published, as her first book, a study titled simply <span style="font-style:italic;">Suicide</span> .<a name="f53-text" href="#f53"><sup>53</sup></a> Although she had received her PhD from Chicago and worked on projects for a number of years afterward with Professor Ernest Burgess in sociology, the university declined to appoint her to a faculty position. (Eventually she became the sole sociologist at Rockford College, Illinois; today, a prize named after her is offered by the American Society of Criminology for the best scholarship by a young, emerging scholar in criminology.<a name="f54-text" href="#f54"><sup>54</sup></a>) Another American, Louis Israel Dublin, a Jewish-American who had immigrated to the U.S. as a child from Lithuania, received a PhD from Columbia and taught as a lecturer at Yale, but his primary career was as vice president and statistician for the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. With his co-author and research assistant, Bessie Bunzel, he published <span style="font-style:italic;">To Be or Not To Be: A Study of Suicide</span> in 1933.<a name="f55-text" href="#f55"><sup>55</sup></a> Meanwhile, although financial ruin as a cause of suicide had appeared almost as regularly as love in scientific studies of suicide, only with the work of the Americans Hoffman and Dublin/Bunzel did the economics of suicide come into its own or, rather, stake its claims in this multidisciplinary terrain. (<span style="font-style:italic;">To Be or Not To Be</span> is not quite as literary as its title would suggest: aside from quoting <span style="font-style:italic;">Hamlet</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Richard III</span> and mentioning Carlyle and Goethe, Dublin and Bunzel ignore literature.)<a name="f56-text" href="#f56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  As this timeline indicates, more than two decades passed in the twentieth century before any more new book-length studies of suicide appeared. Extensive scientific attention in combination with sensationalist newspaper reportage of suicide at the turn of the century seem temporarily to have exhausted the subject in the scientific-book market: as contemporary historian Olive Anderson notes of the periodical literature, “[S]uicides (like homicides, daring robberies, conflagrations, and other disasters) were used to provide mass entertainment [by journalists]; but by 1911 so much else had been trivialized that these traditional topics were necessarily reported more selectively in order to make room for a whole range of foreign and home ‘stories.’”<a name="f57-text" href="#f57"><sup>57</sup></a> Still, Anderson continues, “the ethics of suicide long continued to be enthusiastically debated by the avant-garde.”<a name="f58-text" href="#f58"><sup>58</sup></a> In an Ariès-like argument, Anderson says that the significant changes wrought by professionalization of the coroner’s office and of the inquest system—removing the former from the popular electoral process and the latter from pubs to the less accessible “post-mortem room” and “coroner’s court-house,” equipped with professional witnesses and no jury<a name="f59-text" href="#f59"><sup>59</sup></a>—contributed to silence about suicide in public and to underreporting. In addition, these transformations permitted official linguistic formulations and professionals’ charitably euphemistic expressions to supplant blunter language. Yet while these changes may have succeeded in diminishing suicide as an open conversational topic, it is worth noting that the added mystery, “shrouded in an atmosphere of officialdom, expertise, and formality,” and continued newspaper coverage of inquests intensified the scandal in the public mind.<a name="f60-text" href="#f60"><sup>60</sup></a> Even as dealing with suicide became a more orderly, impersonal affair of trained professionals, families of the dead shunned the necessarily public character of these official proceedings (as Anderson also indicates), reporting cases less frequently, while noticing them all the more.<a name="f61-text" href="#f61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Amid the concourse of partly disjunctive, partly coalescent disciplinary projects and professionalized inquiry, literature flowed as often as it ebbed. Its discursive competition could be fierce. At the turn of the twentieth century, as A. H. Halsey explains, literature effectively seized the field of sociology generally from the social sciences. (Halsey does not discuss suicide studies.) In 1910, S. K. Radcliffe published “Sociology in the English Novel” in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sociological Review,</span> the official journal of the Sociological Society, and argued “that modern fiction was descriptive sociology in a larger and truer sense than the term possessed when it was used by Herbert Spencer.”<a name="f62-text" href="#f62"><sup>62</sup></a> Beatrice and Sidney Webb, H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, and T. S. Eliot all play large parts in Halsey’s narrative (res often at odds, however, with each other on the scientific and philosophical sources for literary sociology: whether, for example, in Comte and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Spencer, as the Webbs believed; or in Plato, according to Wells). On suicide, Beatrice Webb said little and that little was mildly Christian; H. G. Wells advocated not merely the right to die but euthanasia.<a name="f63-text" href="#f63"><sup>63</sup></a> Ultimately, Halsey concurs with his predecessor historians of sociology, Wolf Lepenies and Krishan Kumar, in locating “the rise of sociology”—from Trollope, Dickens, and George Eliot to the Webbs, Wells, and T. S. Eliot—as “<span style="font-style:italic;">Between Science and Literature</span>” (his italics and capitalization).<a name="f64-text" href="#f64"><sup>64</sup></a> Halsey sees the poet Charles Madge as emblematic of this history, Madge having joined “the British sociological professoriat” in 1950.<a name="f65-text" href="#f65"><sup>65</sup></a> The educated layperson, meanwhile, was more likely to get social information and analysis from literature and periodical sources than from a social science treatise.

<p>
	  Suicide is a dauntingly conventional trope in literature: a device to end a plot line, to start one or, digressively, to introduce a note of pathos or warning. Nonetheless, throughout the rise of modern suicidology, literary authors persisted in writing about suicide in fresh detail, tragically, comically, romantically, satirically, and dead-pan, both informed and not by the scientific literature but, when informed, reluctant to take its conclusions as the last word. No decade passed without abundant literary representations, and numerous critical studies have discussed suicides in texts not only by writers who killed themselves (like Hemingway and Woolf) but also by writers who did not commit suicide, including books on novels and stories by Thomas Hardy, Joseph Conrad, and Henry James.<a name="f66-text" href="#f66"><sup>66</sup></a> In the most famous example of the kinds of scandalized attention literature could demand, Goethe became internationally renowned with his publication of <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sorrows of Werther</span> in 1774 (during the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sturm und Drang</span> period in Germany to which Belacqua refers), which apparently produced what both suicidologists and the public referred to as an “epidemic” of copycat suicides.<a name="f67-text" href="#f67"><sup>67</sup></a> Scientists like Winslow argued intently against <span style="font-style:italic;">Werther’s</span> influence.<a name="f68-text" href="#f68"><sup>68</sup></a> Nearly a century later, the popular sensationalist novels by Mary Elizabeth Braddon, <span style="font-style:italic;">Lady Audley’s Secret</span>  and <span style="font-style:italic;">Aurora Floyd</span> , drew epidemiologist J. N. Radcliffe’s moral angst about “the aesthetics of suicide”; his response took the form of charting these novels’ statistically frequent allusions to suicide—despite the absence of any actual suicide narrative events.<a name="f69-text" href="#f69"><sup>69</sup></a> But literature also drew scientists’ admiration (including Winslow’s) for its insights; across the ocean in 1866, Abner Otis Kellogg published <span style="font-style:italic;">Shakespeare’s Delineations of Insanity, Imbecility, and Suicide</span>, which reads not merely as early psychological literary criticism, but as an understanding of Shakespeare as psychologist.<a name="f70-text" href="#f70"><sup>70</sup></a> The long chapter on suicide mostly sets aside <span style="font-style:italic;">Hamlet</span>’s soliloquy to focus instead on the lesser-studied representations in <span style="font-style:italic;">Othello.</span><a name="f71-text" href="#f71"><sup>71</sup></a> Westcott’s chapter “Literature” in his 1881 study actually conjoins scientific and literary discourses,<a name="f72-text" href="#f72"><sup>72</sup></a> distinguishing literature “on suicide as a fact” under the broader rubric of “literature” and cataloguing the literary and factual documents on suicide in a single list.<a name="f73-text" href="#f73"><sup>73</sup></a> Inspired by Ibsen’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Hedda Gabler,</span> Tolstoy’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Anna Karenina</span>, and Flaubert’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Madame Bovary</span>, as well as by the new sciences and philosophy of suicide, numerous poets, dramatists, and novelists collectively made suicide part of scandalous English fin de siècle aestheticized morbidity. Although these writers in turn inspired the early twentieth-century modernists, this English cohort was ultimately framed, and othered, as suicidal by W. B. Yeats’s 1922 essay “The Tragic Generation.”<a name="f74-text" href="#f74"><sup>74</sup></a> Its facts,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> however, were shaky: just one of the poets Yeats discusses, John Davidson, deliberately took his life, and he was the least “aesthetic” of this group.<a name="f75-text" href="#f75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  In this context, it might seem inevitable that the post-World War II poet A. Alvarez should mourn twentieth-century modernism as the climax in suicide history, from the classical age to Alvarez’s own moment, which was haunted by the suicide of Sylvia Plath. Suicide had seemed, to generations of scientists and artists alike, on the increase within civilized nations. On the pseudo-Darwinian links advanced among suicide, modernity, and civilization, diverse scientific thinkers and writers had agreed.<a name="f76-text" href="#f76"><sup>76</sup></a> (We now believe that the numbers of suicides did rise proportionally with modernization, except during times of war, but that the rise was far less steep than turn-of-the-twentieth-century scholars thought. Their suicide statistics had risen in step with improvements in record keeping.<a name="f77-text" href="#f77"><sup>77</sup></a>)
	</p>
<p>
	  Meanwhile, situating itself in contradistinction not only to physiology, sociology, and the other social sciences but also to nineteenth-century psychology, psychoanalysis was struggling to emerge. In her essay “Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown,” Virginia Woolf locates the moment when “character” changed as the year 1910 and sees character changing from being constituted by external data to being constituted by the inner psyche.<a name="f78-text" href="#f78"><sup>78</sup></a> In dating the moment when Edwardians became Georgians, Woolf happens to have highlighted the year also in which an important suicide symposium of psychologists—catalyzed by an “epidemic” of suicides in the secondary schools—was led off by the classicist David Ernst Oppenheim in Vienna, with Freud as chair. The symposium members traded notes on, theorized, and sought to disseminate their sketchy new views on the possible psychological causes of suicide.<a name="f79-text" href="#f79"><sup>79</sup></a> In the course of this symposium, little seemed clear about the psychological motivation and dynamics of suicide, but several participants intrepidly divulged correlations between, for example, libidinal despair, masturbation, or homosexuality with attempted or completed suicides.<a name="f80-text" href="#f80"><sup>80</sup></a> The prior nineteenth-century psychologists had not omitted these Belacqua-like “erotic, anterotic” reasons for suicide, but they had, like Belacqua, spoken of them in considerably less graphic detail. But if for Freud too, eros and thanatos eventually arose as inextricable prizeters of the psyche, he said little at the Viennese forum about this, beyond indicating the groundwork of his later theorization of suicide in “Mourning and Melancholy” .<a name="f81-text" href="#f81"><sup>81</sup></a> The questions for Freud in his concluding remarks to the symposium were, “how it becomes possible for the extraordinarily powerful life instinct to be overcome: whether this can only come about with the help of a disappointed libido or whether the ego can renounce its self-preservation for its own egoistic motives.” He went on to suggest that “[w]e can, I think, only take as our starting-point the condition of melancholia, which is so familiar to us clinically, and a comparison between it and the affect of mourning.”<a name="f82-text" href="#f82"><sup>82</sup></a> He insisted, however, that suicide’s psychic origins remained wholly obscure: “The affective processes in melancholia, however, and the vicissitudes undergone by the libido in that condition, are totally unknown to us. Nor have we arrived at psycho-analytic understanding of the chronic affect of mourning.”<a name="f83-text" href="#f83"><sup>83</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Less widely known today than Freud’s theory of mourning and melancholia is the extent to which his language reflects terminology used repeatedly by nineteenth-century  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> psychologists (excepting “libido”). The British suicide studies frequently concerned themselves with how to explain what motivates someone to overcome an “instinct” for “self-preservation”; and they theorized a “suicidal impulse” (Morselli), “instinct” (Strahan; Morselli), or “tendency” (Westcott; Morselli)<a name="f84-text" href="#f84"><sup>84</sup></a>—depending on the sociopsychological context—as operating in human minds, bodies, and societies. “Melancholy” in particular had been singled out from the start by Philippe Pinel and, for that matter, by the Renaissance writer Robert Burton<a name="f85-text" href="#f85"><sup>85</sup></a> and to a lesser extent by George Savage,<a name="f86-text" href="#f86"><sup>86</sup></a> though most theorists saw the suicide affect as considerably more multidimensional than this. For psychoanalysts, however, a powerful motive for explaining suicide may be found in the temptation to discriminate their work not only from modern psychology but from the externally derived, statistically driven determinism of Morselli and Durkheim. They hoped to substitute a definitive hermeneutics of the inner mental life of the suicidal person. At this early date, Freud himself did not exclude external factors from blame: in opening his remarks, he suggested that, much as the symposium participants might wish to excuse the schools from charges leveled at education by the news media for the rash of student suicides, they must not be in too great a hurry to “acquit the secondary schools.”<a name="f87-text" href="#f87"><sup>87</sup></a> The urgency to set the suicide question to rest, exhibited by century-end British scientists as well as these symposium members, probably also derived from their affiliations with educational institutions (if only through the degrees they had earned) along with the “modern” and “civilized” trends that their statistics ironically targeted as major social sources of suicide.<a name="f88-text" href="#f88"><sup>88</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Somewhat more beholden to academic institutions than the other American suicidologists mentioned above, Kansan Karl A. Menninger—the son of an immigrant Freudian psychiatrist—developed his specialty in psychiatry through U.S. universities, receiving his education from Washburn, then Indiana University, followed by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and finally Harvard Medical School, where he taught while working at the Boston Psychopathic Hospital. Within two years of this appointment, however, he returned to Kansas to help his father found and operate the Menninger Clinic, followed by the Menninger Sanitarium and the Menninger Foundation for study and treatment of psychiatric patients. Twenty years after his return to Topeka, he wrote his influential book on suicide, <span style="font-style:italic;">Man Against Himself</span>, in 1938. Emerging from German psychoanalysis rather than American sociology or an American insurance company, Menninger nonetheless postulated a global sociological foundation for suicide and suggested that a social framework could itself be pathological. One year prior to the outbreak of World War II, Menninger saw the “death drive” writ large. Terming his approach “human phenomenology,” he argued: “Our best defense against self-destructiveness lies in the courageous application of intelligence to human phenomenology. If such is our nature, it were better that we knew it and knew it in all its protean manifestations. To see all forms of self-destruction from the standpoint of their dominant principles would seem to be logical progress toward self-preservation and toward a unified view of medical science.”<a name="f89-text" href="#f89"><sup>89</sup></a> Applying this theory to the world, he wrote,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>
	    Men fly above ancient and beautiful cities dropping explosive bombs upon museums and churches, upon great buildings and little children. They are encouraged by the official representatives of two hundred million other people, all of whom contribute daily in taxes to the frantic manufacture of instruments designed for the tearing and ripping and mangling of human beings similar to themselves, possessed of the same instincts, the same sensations, the same little pleasures, and the same realization that death comes to end these things all too soon.<a name="f90-text" href="#f90"><sup>90</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  That notion of a “unified science” that could bring an end to war, from within or through “intelligent” application to the study of our “instincts,” proved a transient dream. In the postwar era of academic disciplines and related professional specializations, medical, psychological, physiological, metaphysic, social, and literary discourses became, of course, increasingly divided from each other and subdivided within disciplines themselves, and they found little common cause.
	</p>
<p>
	  Menninger’s dedication stresses that Freud’s re-formulation of a death drive represented a dual formulation of thanatos and eros: he dedicates the book “[t]o those who would use intelligence in the battle against death—to strengthen the will to live against the wish to die, and to replace with love the blind compulsion to give hostages to hatred as the price of living.”<a name="f91-text" href="#f91"><sup>91</sup></a> As moving as Menninger designed his book to be, even this reiteration of Freud’s work could have struck some of his learned readers as a romantic cliché; love had been routinely viewed as the prime motive, not romantically salvational, behind suicidal death. Four years earlier, in Beckett’s story-series, one dimension of the absurdist anti-conventional irony in the scene excerpted in this article’s epigraph is that the reasons for suicide that Belacqua propounds to his lover have nothing to do with love; indeed, they apply to individual, not double, suicide. Or do they?
	</p>
<p>
	  Erotic love had been routinely considered among suicide’s primary motives, and lovers’ suicides had operated as among the most conventional of suicide’s literary conventions. But none of the reasons Belacqua advances explains the type of double suicide he is proposing to his partner, and he makes no effort to romanticize it for her.<a name="f92-text" href="#f92"><sup>92</sup></a> Aside from the fact that no tragic separation of lovers is at stake, he does not love her: “He cultivated Ruby, for whom at no time did he much care, and made careful love in the terms he thought best calculated to prime her for the part she was to play on his behalf . . . . How he had formed this resolution to destroy himself we are quite unable to discover. The simplest course, when the motives of any deed are found subliminal to the point of defying expression, is to call that deed <span style="font-style:italic;">ex nihilo</span> and have done.”<a name="f93-text" href="#f93"><sup>93</sup></a> Beckett frames Belacqua’s planned suicide not as an act of love or sexual obsession but “<span style="font-style:italic;">ex nihilo</span>,” punningly, as is his wont: both the ultimate act of creation and lacking any explanation—a Nietzschean farewell, perhaps. The narrator declines to theorize it, admitting simply, as a scholar might, that “[h]ow he had formed this resolution . . . we are quite unable to discover.” Eventually, after they have downed a bottle of whisky together, the gun they have brought along to kill each other accidentally fires, missing them both. From the “subliminal” through the biblical “<span style="font-style:italic;">ex nihilo</span>” to the nihilist, the accidental deliverance prompts as many reasons, for Belacqua, and as little reason, as had the suicide attempt: “‘Digitus Dei’ he said ‘for once,’” amid the “shock” and “the silence.”<a name="f94-text" href="#f94"><sup>94</sup></a> From the narratorial perspective, the source  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> or mechanics of this rescue remain equally undecidable—and more likely to be understood by Beckett’s reader as the age-old theatrical artifice of <span style="font-style:italic;">deus ex machina</span> than as divine fate. But then, after “the silence spent its fury,” a “turmoil of life-blood sprang up in the breasts of our two young felons, so that they came together in inevitable nuptial.”<a name="f95-text" href="#f95"><sup>95</sup></a> Love, it seems, is not to be excluded from this multipronged attempt at suicide, after all. In later years, the semi-omniscient narrator concludes, sentimentally, that “when Ruby is dead and [Belacqua] an old optimist,” Belacqua will have for once “achieved what he set out to do; <span style="font-style:italic;">car</span>, in the words of one competent to sing of the matter, <span style="font-style:italic;">L’Amour et la Mort</span>—caesura—<span style="font-style:italic;">n’est qu’une mesme chose.</span>”<a name="f96-text" href="#f96"><sup>96</sup></a> Quoting pre-Freudian, sixteenth-century poet Pierre de Ronsard, Beckett’s Belacqua has re-achieved Wagner’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Liebestod</span>, but with yet another twist to this ancient tradition; for immediately after the pistol shot, he and Ruby are more alive than ever.
	</p>
<p>
	  As vexing or as engrossing as the questions of cause and motive might be, or of social and psychological diagnosis, there was also the crucial question—to which Beckett’s appellation of “felons” to his young heroes alerts us—of suicide’s legal status. Concern about its legality alone was sufficient for the American lawyer Rocellus Sheridan Guernsey to devote a pamphlet to suicide’s legal history, <span style="font-style:italic;">Suicide: [A] History of the Penal Laws Relating to It in Their Legal, Social, Moral, and Religious Aspects, in Ancient and Modern Times</span> , and as that title emphasizes, this history examined suicide’s multidisciplinary, sociocultural contexts.<a name="f97-text" href="#f97"><sup>97</sup></a> Winslow, Westcott, and Strahan all angled their books toward an attack on suicide’s controversial legal definition. In years when it is hard to find full-length nonliterary books about suicide in the English-speaking world (1901–26), discussion proceeded apace in medical, psychological, sociological, legal, and ethical journals. Writing for <span style="font-style:italic;">Transactions of the Medico-Legal Society, For the Years 1902, 1903 &amp; 1904</span>, R. Henslowe Wellington, a barrister-at-law and deputy coroner, pled “to commit suicide or self-murder the person must be a responsible agent possessing the power of knowing right and wrong, a reasonable and a sane being”;<a name="f98-text" href="#f98"><sup>98</sup></a> “not only is it incorrect to return a verdict of ‘Suicide whilst temporarily insane,’ but to say <span style="font-style:italic;">committed</span> suicide is a double error of legal phraseology, for the meaning of <span style="font-style:italic;">commit</span> in Johnson, with reference to this use of the word, is ‘to perpetrate, to do a fault, to be guilty of a crime,’ and this we have seen is an impossibility with the insane.”<a name="f99-text" href="#f99"><sup>99</sup></a> Practically no one anywhere was being charged and punished by the courts for <span style="font-style:italic;">felo de se</span>. As Wellington notes, “During the ten years 1893–1902 the verdict of <span style="font-style:italic;">felo de se</span> has been returned in less than 2 per cent. of the total number of verdicts of self-destruction.”<a name="f100-text" href="#f100"><sup>100</sup></a> The public was nonetheless aware of the law. Where Wellington wished to reinstate and uphold the basic verdict of <span style="font-style:italic;">felo de se</span> in cases of rational self-murder, most people and most courts pitied suicidal people and suicide survivors so much that they put persistent moral and traditional Christian scruples as well as legal issues aside in order to sympathize with and acquit suicides on the grounds of “temporary insanity.” In comic reversal, again, of this public concern, Belacqua—grabbing a number plate as he departs to kill himself along with his fellow “connive[r] at his felo de se”—paints the notice “Temporarily Sane” to post at their death site.<a name="f101-text" href="#f101"><sup>101</sup></a> This tight, troubled linkage of suicide with insanity cried out for more nuanced descriptions and diagnoses. Yet British law did not change until 1961, and the laws remain unchanged in some American states today.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
	  About the rich corpus of discursive legal and ethical inter-texts, it would seem folly to generalize. But one can discern fault lines in discussions of suicide’s ethics and legality—between the determined and free, external and internal, irrational and rational, insane and sane, pessimistic and optimistic, egoistic and altruistic, cowardly and courageous, despairing and stoic, fanatical and self-martyring,<a name="f102-text" href="#f102"><sup>102</sup></a> idealist and pragmatic—which were productive of enormous dissension. The questions raised by Empedocles’ late-life jump into a volcano, to which Belacqua alludes, seem as unanswerable in this period as at earlier times. It was repeatedly debated within several of these conceptual frames, especially the cowardly versus courageous and the despairing versus stoic. For some sociologists, the psychology of suicide was determined by external circumstance; Morselli, for example, had written, “[A]s to the intention and application of the statistical method to the phenomena of the moral world, it is the objective demonstration of modern determinism. . . . [H]aving devoted many years to the observation and the treatment of mental disease, I am convinced more and more every day of the universality and regularity of the laws which influence human actions.”<a name="f103-text" href="#f103"><sup>103</sup></a> By contrast, ethicists clung to a notion of free will. In one Medico-Legal Society discussion in 1922–23, for example, a participant insisted, despite the prevalent deterministic view, that “[m]any doctors will not admit that [there is freedom of the will]; nearly all lawyers deny it. . . . [T]he proper view is to regard the will as a means for improvement. . . . [A]s ordinary conduct in ordinary life is motivated by pleasure or pain, so the same sort of thing takes place in the domain of ethics.”<a name="f104-text" href="#f104"><sup>104</sup></a> For the latter reasoner, moreover, the determinism of Freudian psychology, not of sociological statistics, was the ethical target. For philosophers of pessimism, optimism was the enemy of the true, even if (or especially when) pessimism led to a justification for suicide: as Schopenhauer writes, “Therefore whenever we have contradiction and falsehood, we have ideas that have not sprung from objective apprehension, e.g., in optimism.”<a name="f105-text" href="#f105"><sup>105</sup></a> For the most traditional Christian theologians, pessimism was the enemy of the good, and suicide remained a vicious crime against God. Theologians were not above deploying logical positivist methods to argue their case, as in James Gurnhill’s painstaking treatise <span style="font-style:italic;">The Morals of Suicide</span> .<a name="f106-text" href="#f106"><sup>106</sup></a> Then again, Belacqua’s John of the Cross is equally characteristic of Christian views: an antirational mystic, remembered in part for his poetry, his “Dark Night of the Soul” offers a Job-like argument for sheer endurance. For William James—who became caught up in 1895 in the decades-long pamphlet arguments that were published under the title, “Is Life Worth Living?” —idealism (“idealities”), no matter how ungrounded in scientific fact, offered a critical article of belief, and an optimistic affect, which could and necessarily must be embraced for its own sake by anyone with a wish to live.<a name="f107-text" href="#f107"><sup>107</sup></a> For Freud, disappointed over-idealism was often a major culprit in triggering a suicide’s death drive: “[T]he loss of some abstraction which has taken the place of [a loved person], such as fatherland, liberty, an ideal, and so on.”<a name="f108-text" href="#f108"><sup>108</sup></a> The fiction writers, playwrights, and poets were, of course, far from silent on precisely these thorny questions.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">“Diligent Enquiry” and “Crisis,” Revisited</h1>
<p>
	  “Diligent enquiry” (to borrow from Belacqua) into rationales for suicide in the modernist period leads one into an intricate interdisciplinary nexus that, as I have argued, merits thicker description than has been available heretofore. Is suicidology a “discipline,” given that it appears never to have generated academic departments? Today, suicidology comes close, yet stops just sort of territorial autonomy; it does count as a medical specialty in the health sciences, psychiatry and psychology, and criminology, and it enjoys its own professional association, associated clinics, and certifying programs—if only a couple of journals.<a name="f109-text" href="#f109"><sup>109</sup></a> Recently, the topic of the association’s 2012 annual conference has been announced and, with this announcement, the association stakes out its terrain in between: “Collaborations in Suicidology: Bridging the Disciplines.” But if it now is a recognized academic interdisciplinary specialty, it clearly was not one during the modernist period, when these disciplines were gathering steam. We might term it merely a “sub-discipline” since it had acquired its own canon of scholarly literature and the first Samaritan clinics by the First World War. Yet it was intimately connected with the rise, even birth, of several full-fledged social-science disciplines: psychology, sociology, psychiatry, and statistics, even while remaining, as in the pre-Enlightenment centuries, tightly linked to theological, philosophical, and legal developments. In this sense it has operated over time as a kind of “inter-discipline,” eroding attempts to create boundaries not only between academic disciplines but between imaginative literature and social science. An intellectual history of the emergence of suicide as a topic of modernist “diligent enquiry,” which this essay provides in condensed form, suggests that as a discursive phenomenon, suicidology shows us another side to the way literature and literary studies themselves coalesced as an inter-discipline in the modernist period.
	</p>
<p>
	  Predictably, one finds two primary patterns of cross-disciplinary discourse emerging during the early history of suicidology, both of them oppositional: antinomies between establishment-oriented traditionalist belief and skeptical, methodological investigation, and opposed practices of collaborative integration and competitive disaggregation. Suicidology played a relatively small part in these processes of academic cooperation and competition. Still, amid the ever-hastening and deepening drive to knowledge, suicidology in particular was driven—not only obstructed—by its associations with shame and taboo and by the way explanations of particular suicides led into areas of private shame: money and alcohol, insanity and immorality, sex and death. Because taboo, suicide both attracted and deflected the attention of scholars. The modernist period—embedded as it was in financial crisis and alcoholic brinksmanship, subjectivist exploration and secular investigation, sexual experimentation and war- and disease-related mass deaths—witnessed an ever-increasing desire<a name="f110-text" href="#f110"><sup>110</sup></a> to fathom the “death drive” in individual persons and in human social structures.
	</p>
<p>
	  In addition, modernist suicidologists repeatedly sought to appeal to an audience beyond the academic: the “intelligent reader.” Suicide numbers appeared for a while to be rising steeply, in tandem with advances in civilization and education, so literate readers of the kind these scholars desired were increasingly abundant and, many scholars  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and professionals thought, endangered. The scholars themselves emerged as often as not from various professions outside universities. To this day, suicidology is as much a phenomenon of extracurricular study and practices by the literate non-university person as by the academic, and suicide is a subject to which the lay writer and reader is (sometimes passionately) drawn. As such, the study of suicidology has crept over and through the walls between the university and its multitudinous surrounds, sometimes emerging from without to change disciplinary behavior or ideas within.
	</p>
<p>
	  About literature’s role, Alvarez says of the “transition to the twentieth century,” “Suicide did not disappear from the arts; instead, it became part of their fabric. . . . Once suicide was accepted as a common fact of society . . . simply as something people did, often and without much hesitation, like committing adultery, then it automatically became a common property of art.”<a name="f111-text" href="#f111"><sup>111</sup></a> Yet as “common” or “ordinary” as suicide became, Alvarez persists in characterizing the suicide trope as “a sharp, narrow, intensely dramatic light on life at its extreme moments” and “the whole of twentieth-century art [as] dedicated to the service of this earthbound Savage God . . . . producing an art which is more extreme, more violent and, finally, more self-destructive than ever before.”<a name="f112-text" href="#f112"><sup>112</sup></a> While devoting a chapter to Dada’s socio-aesthetic destructivity and actual suicides, he says only about Woolf that she “drowned herself, a victim of her own excessive sensitivity”;<a name="f113-text" href="#f113"><sup>113</sup></a> about Hart Crane that he “devoted prodigious energy to aestheticizing his chaotic life—a desperate compound of homosexuality and alcoholism—and, finally, thinking himself a failure, jumped overboard from a steamer in the Caribbean”; and about Malcolm Lowry and John Berryman that they “were alcoholics who finally committed suicide.”<a name="f114-text" href="#f114"><sup>114</sup></a> The social science texts of the turn of the century elucidate the peculiar conflation here of drunkenness with suicide, for alcohol was habitually included in the lists of suicide’s causality.<a name="f115-text" href="#f115"><sup>115</sup></a> That gender and sexuality also appear in Alvarez’s rhetoric as pungently segregated categories—with the female suicide chalked up to “sensitivity” and the gay suicide to an “aestheticized” “homosexual” “failed” life—similarly reproduces the gendered discourses of those earlier decades. As contemporary suicide studies are increasingly demonstrating, race, ethnicity, age, and religion operated alongside gender as baked-in category assumptions in modernist suicidology, premises from which analysis began and to which it tautologically returned.<a name="f116-text" href="#f116"><sup>116</sup></a> Then again, to return to Alvarez’s initial comment on the pervasiveness of suicide in modernism, “common” and “ordinary” are not derogatory terms when employed by contemporary historian Olive Anderson, because in her view perceived ordinariness helped calm emotions on both sides of suicidal events. In these respects, especially, the considerably more elaborate, critical, and multi-tonal ways in which the literary writers represented suicide merit re-inscription in this period’s myriad discourses.
	</p>
<p>
	  Alvarez’s “crisis” can itself be taken as a border breached rather than a dead-end. For various modernist thinkers and writers, articulation of crisis broke open doors to altered discourse and arenas for speculation, freeing modernists to think anew. In Stephane Mallarmé’s classic Oxford lecture in defense of experimentalism in modern poetry, “Crisis in Poetry,” “crisis” did just that. Suicide appears far from his mind in this 1896 essay, yet the essay recaptures the context I have sketched—in the terms of “literature” as a competitive field of thoughtful endeavor:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>

This [change] is disconcerting for the French reading public, whose habits were interrupted by the death of Victor Hugo . . . .

	  Perhaps, however, something both more ordinary and more extraordinary was happening “between the acts.” Mallarmé declares literature “freed” in this passage by a “crisis in [modern] poetry” from other ideational, rhetorical, and proto-disciplinary discourses or traditions of thought, with those discourses implicitly “freed” also from literature’s domination—in the shape of Hugo’s massively multidisciplinary poetry. While Mallarmé emphasizes form and “technique” in this passage rather than content and ideas, positioning literature amid allied arts (especially, metaphorically, in alliance with music), that formalist gesture wrests literature, as an age-old vehicle of knowledge, from the growing dominance of the other knowledge-based fields. Mallarmé’s fervent declaration of liberty for literature does present an “idea” about it: the idea specifically of discursive, proto-disciplinary distinction for “literature.” In envisioning it as something free and distinctive, Mallarme assumed for literature a continuing place among the emergent intellectual disciplines and a compelling role there as the agent <span style="font-style:italic;">par excellence</span> of language—fundamental as language is to all discourses, shape-shifting in its artful genres and ideational systems. In numerous modernist writers’ hands, as in Beckett’s, the horror of suicide yielded to something peculiarly literary and distinctively modernist: a kind of play, chatty or profound, cheerful or desolate, with suicide’s often traditional, often irrational rationales.

	      An obvious period-designator, war often demarcates new eras of knowledge and experience for their societies: prior to World War I, the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 served as “the war [that] gave rise to Durkheim and his followers,” according to A. H. Halsey in <span style="font-style:italic;">A History of Sociology in Britain: Science, Literature, and Society</span> (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), 204. For England in the last decades of the nineteenth century, a flurry of imperial wars abroad changed the national temper; the two twentieth-century world wars are generally viewed as productive of “high” modernism. Suicide itself tended to decline during wars, resurging afterwards.

	      Not translated into English until 1951, Durkheim’s study may owe its acclaim, in part, to its semi-structuralist organization, with suicidal phenomena divided into four conditions, dependent on binary social states (integrated or not). Because he gives unequal space to the four, they are sometimes read as three. His arguments and terminology, however, perpetuated those of his predecessors. The argument (now shown to be erroneous) that the stricter Roman Catholic church produced fewer suicides than the more liberal Protestant church and the concepts of “egotism” and “altruism,” Durkheim’s two foremost conditions, were embedded in the conceptualization of his predecessors (“heroic” and “self-sacrificial” were the terms generally used by the British as opposed to the Comtean term “altruism”). See Emile Durkheim, <span style="font-style:italic;">Suicide: A Study in Sociology</span>, trans. John A. Spaulding and George Simpson, ed. Simpson (New York: The Free Press, 1951), 152, 217.

The first autonomous university sociology department was founded at the University of Chicago in 1892; six years later, the first sociology department in England was founded in 1904 at the London School of Economics. Halsey’s account of the first decades of the twentieth century is generally accepted, though reviewers critique its post–World War II omissions and personal preferences.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p></div>

	    Ibid., 22. Fifty-three years earlier in 1897, Strahan, who had pushed in his book on suicide for a strictly logical approach—toward its ethics as well as its science—contributed a poem to <span style="font-style:italic;">The Savage Club</span> papers. Titled “The Origin of the Pug,” the poem allegorically satirizes a dog’s suicide as symptomatic of the degenerative present. See “The Origin of the Pug: A New Chapter in Darwinism,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Savage Club Papers</span>, ed. J. E. Muddock (London: Hutchinson, 1897). Plenty had been written about animals’ suicides, so this poem satirizes its emblematic dog simultaneously.

	    In his 1966 foreword to the English translation of this symposium, Paul Friedman describes the year 1910 as “a definite turning point” in the “evolution of our thinking about suicide,” for it was a year in which “one of the last meetings of the original group of associates [the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society] at which Freud presided” took place; shortly after this meeting, this group also began to part company, with Alfred Adler and Wilhelm Stekel leading the “secession.” See Paul Friedman, ed., <span style="font-style:italic;">On Suicide: With Particular Reference to Suicide Among Young Students</span> (New York: International Universities Press, Inc., 1967), 11.

In the 1890s, the American comparative anatomist Burt Wilder had taken a direct interest in the brain of the “educated suicide” and, in conjunction with the 1894 exhibition of his collection of brains at Cornell University, had made known his discovery of unusual central fissures.

	—Mina Loy, “Aphorisms on Futurism”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>
	  When ancient Psyche was no longer content to remain in darkness, she broke her word and shined a light on her lover for the first time. In that instant she both recognized his divinity and marked its frailty, burning him with a drop of oil from her lamp. Eros immediately abandoned her. From “Pig Cupid” to verbal fragments and a scandalous tone lamenting the end of a love affair, the myth of Eros and Psyche permeates Mina Loy’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Songs to Joannes.</span> Several scholars have discussed the implications that these troubled trace references have for the speaker’s broken psychology, tortured desire, and discursive/discordant lyricism.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> Yet none to my knowledge has given sustained attention to the <span style="font-style:italic;">modernity</span> of Loy’s gesture. It matters that Loy’s modern Psyche might flip a light switch rather than ignite an oil lamp, for this new light casts different allusive meanings—especially when filtered through unique, artfully constructed shades. Loy’s speaker is one who “live[s] in my lantern,” intimately enveloped in its ambiance while still maintaining and directing the “subliminal flicker” emitted through “Coloured   glass.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Given Loy’s own fascination with illumination, closer consideration of this distinctly modern light suggests new ways of seeing  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> not only the <span style="font-style:italic;">Songs</span> but also Loy’s broader poetic sensibilities. Her poems abound with references to astronomical, animal, and human-made light sources. At the same time, readers have long noted her work’s obfuscating features, including lack of punctuation, layered linguistic registers, ambiguous syntax, and allusive fragments. Although these can seem like paradoxical impulses, they invite comparison with Loy’s work in the visual arts—most specifically with her famous interest in lighting design. Reading Loy’s poems in light of her lampshade art elucidates semiotic, philosophical, and social meanings that might otherwise remain opaque: doing so changes not only the object in view but also the surrounding critical setting—and thus reveals new relationships between Loy’s poetry and its environment of modernity.
	</p>
<p>
	  In <span style="font-style:italic;">Songs to Joannes</span> and other poems, we see, for example, Loy’s work both reflecting and refracting the modernist metaphor of “light” for sexual interaction. More importantly, the structure and content of her poetry reveals ambivalence toward early electrical lighting that metonymically expresses her ambivalence towards the male-dominated avant-garde of the early 1900s. Just as her lampshades enfold, direct, and decorate the radiance of electric light, her poetics of luminous opacity appropriates, filters, and shapes the brilliance of the avant-garde according to her unique and expressive need and desire. For her, it seems, light is not so much a metaphor for power and penetration as an actual substance at work in the world—including the world of art and literature.
	</p>
<p>
	  Many previous writers on Mina Loy have noted the lampshade as a ubiquitous artistic form in her career and eccentric life. Her contribution to the illustrious Independents’ Exhibition of 1917, for instance, was a painting entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Making Lampshades</span>; shortly thereafter she attended a Dada costume ball wearing a lampshade-inspired dress (details noted by both her biographer Carolyn Burke and the 2006 Daughters of Dada retrospective at Francis M. Naumann Fine Art in New York).<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Moreover, the publisher Sylvia Beach recalls that “[w]hen you went to Mina’s apartment you threaded your way past lamp shades that were everywhere: she made them to support her children. . . . Her hats were very like her lamp shades; or perhaps it was the lamp shades that were like her hats. She wrote poetry whenever she had time.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> In Beach’s description, and evidently in Loy’s living space, the lampshades and hats themselves fill most of the room. Beach touches on these items’ economic significance (anticipating feminist scholarship highlighting Loy’s status as a working woman artist) and briefly muses on similarities between the shades and hats (noting a Futurist-Dadaist-Surrealist blurring of mechanical and human spheres); her comment on Loy’s poetry seems like a non sequitur.
	</p>
<p>
	  I propose that Loy’s lighting designs are more relevant to her poetry than they might initially seem. Notably, two versions of her long poem <span style="font-style:italic;">Love Songs</span> coincide with important events in her lampshade work: in 1917, when <span style="font-style:italic;">Songs to Joannes</span> first appeared, Loy began making and selling lampshades in New York.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> With financial backing from Peggy Guggenheim and Heyward Mills, she was later able to set up shop in a fashionable Paris district, employing her daughter Joella and additional workers to help execute her designs and manage the store in order to meet growing demand.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Susan E. Dunn dates this development to 1923, the same year a subsequent version of the poem, reorganized and retitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Love Songs</span>, appears in print.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  In what follows, I look at Loy’s poetry to demonstrate its thematic and phenomenal similarities to her lamp work. At the same time, I argue that the significance of Loy’s dual work in lighting and literature radiates beyond an intriguing set of descriptions: not only do the lamps materialize poetic interests, as Burke observes,<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> but the poems also display the influence of lighting technologies—technologies that helped shape modernity’s ethos and modernist art. The curiosity and distrust, enthusiasm and contempt with which <span style="font-style:italic;">Songs to Joannes</span> treats these lighting methods are especially significant for the way they highlight gender considerations within that avant-garde realm.
	</p>
<p>
	  Jeffrey Twitchell-Waas has remarked that <span style="font-style:italic;">Love Songs</span> is “distinctively a work of female modernism: expressing both the opportunities and risks for a woman opened up by the prospect of avant-garde modernism.”<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> And to be sure, women in this milieu—especially those writing within (or against) the tradition of lyric love poetry—needed to negotiate complex terrain. Cristanne Miller sees Loy using multiple distinct strategies to this end: even as Loy’s flamboyant fashion flirts with “feminine deception,” her poetic “nongendered speaking voice” commands rigorous concentration.<a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> Still, if Loy viewed poetry as an “art . . . of ‘incognito,’ a means of protecting or concealing one’s ‘true’ identity,” as Maeera Shreiber (citing Burke) has noted, it is reasonable to see those scripted pages with their emphatic white space functioning as literary analogues to her lampshade attire: both shielding and diffusing a personal energy (which may or may not emanate from a core “self”).<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Tim Armstrong’s book <span style="font-style:italic;">Modernism, Technology, and the Body</span> helps us position Loy’s poetic choices within a period of cultural history when the newly harnessed, scintillating force of electricity helped direct and energize modernist conceptions and vocabularies of heterosexuality. Opposites magnetically attract; wires and nerves transmit and discharge invisible forces of nature, imaginatively “electrifying” social, individual, and literary bodies. As Armstrong explains, “We could postulate that [electricity] speeds up the pace of desire and allows it to flow more promiscuously through social networks—leaping past barriers and across distances, as in Pound’s likening (in 1912) of sexual energy to a spark jumping a gap, even piercing ‘a heavy book cover.’”<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> This charge has literary ramifications. As Armstrong puts it, paraphrasing Pound, “[L]iterary production is incandescence.”<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Loy, too, contemplates connections between Eros, electricity, and the literal as well as cognitive or spiritual enlightenment in unpublished essays held at Yale University’s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. In a passage entitled “Eros,” for instance, she characterizes orgasm as a “release of the intrinsic electrification inducing Eros-Bliss” and marvels at humanity’s inherent storehouse of energy, declaring, “How mysterious his own potentials remain to man.”<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> But she does more than simply transmit a widespread modernist verbal trend. While her typed comments note that the “‘man of flesh’ phrase in evolution is giving way to the ‘man of electric vitality,’” she appears subsequently to have crossed out “electric” and hand-written “electronic” instead.<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> This characteristic phrasing combines different linguistic and phenomenal modes: evolution not only is  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> biological, cultural, and lexical, but incorporates distinctly <span style="font-style:italic;">mechanical</span> connotations of generative energy in its profoundly <span style="font-style:italic;">physic-al</span> manifestations. Another piece, “Electric Eros,” makes these connections even more explicit. Again Loy uses electrical vocabulary to describe definitive moments of physical and mental human experience: “Eros recharges the electric battery of the nervous system. . . . [T]he release of Eros is the closing of the circle of all emotions fused to one emotion in instantaneous consummation. A flash of attainment to infinite sentience, resulting in perfect relaxation. Replica in reduction of the mystic’s ecstasy in illumination.”<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Diction in her poetry also often exemplifies this kind of electrified Eros. In section II of <span style="font-style:italic;">Songs to Joannes</span>, the phallus resembles a battery:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
	      The skin-sack
	<br>
	  In which a wanton duality
	<br>
	  Packed
	<br>
	  All the completion of my infructuous impulses
	<br>
	  Something the shape of a man<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  The circuit of desire closes when the speaker’s charged “impulses” meet the compressed “wanton duality” of her lover’s “skin-sack.” A similar electro-sexual structure appears in section XXIX when the speaker requests, “Let meeting be the turning / To the antipo-dean.”<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a> Electromagnetic forces, like heterosexual love, rely on a bipolar framework: neither can function well without “far further / Differentiation” between bodies.<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  One method of differentiation is separation. Section XVIII suggests that “The nascent / Static / Of night” arises from the “severing” “Of star from star.”<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a> Separation between differently charged light sources electrifies the atmosphere and time, filling the space “of night” with erotic possibility. And section XIII characterizes the fruit of possibility as still further generation of potential: “Something taking shape / Something that has a new name / A new dimension”<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> could refer to a growing human fetus, as other critics have argued, or to mysterious new horizons in technology and art.<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> In any case, its generation is “ambient” and “Something shiny”—something bright and intense enough to fuse individuals into a new, eternal entity: “Where two or three are welded together / They shall become god.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Yet, as the subsequent partition of this section reveals, not all potentialities are actualized. A perforated line of dashes interrupts the triumphant mood. And whereas Loy’s speaker began section XIII with a plea for union and sense of wonder (“Come to me  There is something / I have got to tell you  and I can’t tell”), she proceeds to announce disjuncture through wounded sarcasm (“Oh that’s right / Keep away from me”).<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a> The final line of this section enacts this same movement, the dashes cutting a combined “Me you” into isolated pronouns “—you—me” without any further mention of the ghostly third; the unrealized embryonic potential of “Something” disappears once lovers disconnect from each other.<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Sparks are fleeting; people and love affairs burn themselves out. Sometimes even the glow of current desire emits a sallow tinge of its own decay. <span style="font-style:italic;">Songs to Joannes</span> repeatedly  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> dramatizes this conjunction of new potential with decay or destruction. The coupling “We might have” experienced in section III sounds destructively explosive, juxtaposed as it is with images of “broken flesh” and bloody transformation.<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> The encounter in section XIV is even more frank:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>
	  To you
	<br>
	  I bring the nascent virginity of
	<br>
	  —Myself    for the moment
	</p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>
	  No love or the other thing
	<br>
	  Only the impact of lighted bodies
	<br>
	  Knocking sparks off each other
	<br>
	  In chaos<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a></p></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  Here, the phrase “nascent virginity” recasts the very notion of potential, because prevailing social perspectives in the early twentieth century would usually frame virginity as a condition lost, rather than actualized or developed, through experience. Loy, though, seems to use the words as synonyms.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> Placing them together magnifies the potential energy of each, and at the same time refracts the speaker’s consciousness so that she is able to speak both as “I” and “myself.” In a sense both lover and embryo, she brings generative and erotic potential to the “you.”
	</p>
<p>
	  The second stanza, though, evacuates any sense of personal desire in this exchange. Not only is love absent, but the participants become mere “lighted bodies” dissociated from the preceding pronouns “you” and “I.” The union is devoid even of a mechanical sense of design. No personal ecstasy, no social purpose inheres in this sexual act: it is only chaotic “impact.” Loy thus complicates the common modernist electro-sexual metaphor by emphasizing technology’s capacity for depersonalized danger and by critiquing its rapturous aura.<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  But her dynamic criticism does not simply reject the electro-sexual metaphor; here, she recasts it by looking to sources of animal, rather than engineered, illumination. Specifically, she considers how fireflies and glow-worms already literalize the metaphor, and implies that humans might do better to emulate these biological examples than to regard themselves as the mere machines they are not. Section XIX dramatizes this observation. Despite distraction from their “Aerial quadrille / Bouncing / Off one another,” fireflies find, rather than lose, their radiance.<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> In contrast to the flinty sexual collision between human lovers described in section XIII, the fireflies’ encounter is characterized by hope and mutual restoration: “Again conjoining / In recaptured pulses / Of light,” they rediscover their natural incandescence.<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a> And while Loy’s speaker grants that her lover once exuded a trace “Of a green-lit glow-worm,” he “slowly drenched / To raylessness / In rain.”<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> Apparently, his dimmed luster could not be rekindled after the storms of adversity had passed.
	</p>
<p>
	  In these ways, elements of Loy’s poetry reflect, resist, and redirect common electricity-sex connections within modernist culture. More than rering a popular  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> trope, her approach to the materiality of both light and language suggests alternate, <span style="font-style:italic;">non-metaphorical</span> ways of reading her work. Allusions to particular types of early electrical lighting inflect her poems with a spectrum of nuanced moods and meanings. They operate like analogies more than metaphors, providing specific potential nodes of commonality rather than casting totalizing comparisons: they emphasize tenuous and changeable bonds over abiding unions.
	</p>
<p>
	  The remainder of this essay explores some of these allusions to lighting technologies identified in Herbert W. Meyer’s helpful introduction to the field of early electrical lighting, <span style="font-style:italic;">A History of Electricity and Magnetism.</span> Meyer surveys three main types of electrical lighting in use during the early 1900s: arc-lights, based on electrical spark; tube lightning, created from glass containers filled with florescent gases or salts excited by electric charge; and incandescent lamps like Edison’s domestic light bulb, which radiates illumination from a heated wire glowing inside a vacuum. To begin, Meyer explains, “The arc lamp required that the electrodes be in contact for starting and then be separated by a sufficient space to maintain a steady arc of brightness.”<a name="f34-text" href="#f34"><sup>34</sup></a> If love resembles an arc-lamp, a single initial spark fueling an entire relationship, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Songs</span> might ask, what is the “sufficient space” required between lovers to sustain an optimal flame? How is it calibrated and protected? How does each end perceive the other and the eroticized space between them?
	</p>
<p>
	  Section XII of <span style="font-style:italic;">Songs to Joannes</span> seems to focus on just these questions. The early stanza, “Flesh from flesh / Draws the inseparable delight / Kissing at gasps  to catch it” could read like a straightforward comparison of arc-lamp technology and sex.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> Like touching electrodes, flesh “draws” electric thrill “from [other] flesh.” Interestingly, it is “delight” (with its sonic echo of “light”)—not “flesh”—that is “inseparable.” Like the spark between electrodes, the radiant glow and charge between lovers persists while they remain at “sufficient space” from one another—neither too close nor too distant. By the third line, though, that space fluctuates and wavers, resulting in erratic flickers or “gasps” that need to be caught through reconnecting kisses.
	</p>
<p>
	  The next stanza begins to explore and expose the limits of the analogy, the restlessness of the poet and speaker coextensive with an interrogation of the arc-light’s limited suitability as an illuminating source:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
	  Is it true
	<br>
	  That I have set you apart
	<br>
	  Inviolate in an utter crystallization
	<br>
	  Of all    the jolting of the crowd
	<br>
	  Taught me willingly to live to share<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  The distance between speaker and lover expands. No longer opposite equals inhabiting the same environment, two electrodes at small remove from each other both enclosed in a glass shade, the lovers shift to an unbalanced dynamic, the speaker wondering about her power over the beloved and his power over her. The earlier phrase “flesh from flesh” has verbal and syntactical equality: each noun acts on the other and they  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> are united though distinct as “flesh.” But here, the pronouns and subject-object syntax reappear. By questioning whether “I have set you apart / Inviolate in an utter crystallization,” the speaker seems to place her lover alone within the lamp and its “utter crystallization.” It remains ambiguous whether this relationship privileges the beloved for holding an elevated position or the speaker for her ability to place him there. What is clear, however, is that the connection has lost its reciprocity and become brittle.
	</p>
<p>
	  Arc-lamps were typically used as streetlights in the United States and Europe by the mid-1880s,<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> and Loy’s speaker seems to rejoin the freer electricity of the street, perhaps ironically claiming preference for the collective “jolting of the crowd [that] / Taught me willingly to live to share” over a more narrowly defined relationship (and, for that matter, over a closed poetic system). In an arc-lamp model, the spark of an isolated, serially monogamous couple (or a single linguistic charge) is destined to die after a specified period because the carbons eventually burn, destroying both individuals (as well as literary vibrancy) in the process. In a broader community, however, charges circulate more continually. The speaker becomes a “willing” partner. Loy’s characteristic omission of punctuation also loosens standard syntax, freeing verbal energy: “to share” is, ambiguously, either a discreet verb or an extension of the infinitive “to live.” Regardless, the implication seems to be that the speaker has more chance to survive outside a doomed closed-circuit arc-lamp relationship than in one. If the “you” is “Only the other half / Of an ego’s necessity,” as the final stanza posits, the result can only be “dissonance” and the physical, as well as poetic, exhaustion of “escaping breath” that leads to death.<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>
<p>
	  Other poems in Loy’s oeuvre also comment on arc-lights as fascinating but ultimately limited models for human interaction. “Crab-Angel,” for example, portrays the thrill activated between a freakish circus performer and his audience. He “dart[s] / through circus skies of arc-lit dust / . . . like a swimming star,” as the big top itself functions as a gigantic, enclosing globe shade . For a few short stanzas, performer and audience ecstatically depend on one another like scintillating electrodes; their electric connection sizzles as the “aerial acrobat / floats on the coiling lightning / of the whirligig” . But their charged relationship ends with the conclusion of the performance. “The dwarf— / subsides like an ironic sigh / to the soft earth,” again typifying arc-lights’ inherent, inevitable exhaustion . He leaves “waving a yellow farewell with his perruque” like a final spark escaping an arc-light’s globe shade . For all the attraction of arc-lighting’s brilliance, its design is unsatisfactory for the long term. As the deceased speakers in “The Dead” observe, “Street lights footle in our ocular darkness” . They are flashy trifles.
	</p>
<p>
	  Loy’s poems also allude briefly to other forms of modern lighting, in each case expressing ambivalence over whether they make fitting or desirable analogies for (troubled) interpersonal dynamics. In section XXVII of <span style="font-style:italic;">Songs for Joannes</span>, the speaker characterizes her relationship in terms that resemble components for tube lighting: “The contents / Of our ephemeral conjunction / In aloofness from Much” might describe the isolation of gases required for that form of electrical light . In 1917, exotic gases like mercury and neon were costly, so lights based on their use were primarily  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> objects of exhibition, sources of curiosity and fascination. Carbon dioxide, though, in ready supply, emitted a “good quality white light” and was frequently used in stores.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> Given the preponderance of oppressive whiteness that “Suffuse[s]” and burns in the immediately following section,<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> it appears Loy’s speaker would not find such glare inviting. The connotations of exhibitionism and consumerism in relation to tube lighting as an analogy for love seem equally disturbing. Still, it might be these very qualities that make it an appropriate comparison to the kind of love that is the subject of Loy’s poem. If the relationship itself is characterized by energies of objectification, display, envy, and possessiveness, then perhaps commercial tube lighting makes an entirely apt, if wry, analogy.
	</p>
<p>
	  But Loy resists that link. The “ephemeral conjunction,” she goes on to write, “Flowed to approachment of — — — — / NOTHING” (64–65). Without a charge of electricity to excite the contained gas, nothing happens. Loy effectively defuses the rative spark by reminding us, “There was a man and a woman / In the way” (64–65). Despite her enthusiasm for new technologies and their potential for invigorating avant-garde ideals, she seems to insist the poem is about humanity, not mechanical phenomena; production cannot overshadow the person. Her late poems “On Third Avenue” and “Mass Production on 14th Street,” both written in 1942, emphasize this perspective further, contrasting the commercial “red-lit thoroughfare” of “saturnine / neon-signs”  and “reservoir of ruby neon”  with distinctly human realms. The “dummies,” “mummies,” and “mannequin[s]” in (capitalist) store windows clearly are not people (110, 113). Indeed, those who approach their glare too closely are in danger of muting the divine spark of their own humanity, “disappear[ing]” into “shuffling shadow-bodies” with “hueless overcast / of down-cast countenances” .
	</p>
<p>
	  The incandescent light bulb offers perhaps the most hopeful analogy between light and love. Its glow is softer than tube florescence and safer and longer lasting than that of arc-lights, making it a more suitable likeness for enduring, vibrant love. And in fact, as Charles Bazerman’s book <span style="font-style:italic;">The Languages of Edison’s Light</span> makes clear, the primary setting for this new invention was the home. Family life influenced even the earliest conceptions of this mode of electric light’s fixture designs, which approximated the botanical forms of vines, stems, and flowers. Vice-president of the Edison Electric Light Company, Edward Johnson noted in 1883 that “Mrs. Edison . . . [first] suggested these floral forms as the best adapted to our purpose.”<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Thomas may have engineered the technology, but Mary is credited with the design concept that successfully made incandescent lamps fixtures of domestic space. Bazerman goes on to observe, “The sexuality of the flower imagery is further called to attention by the contemplation of the bulb as the stamen among the petals. . . . [I]t is certainly no stretch to see the female floral as softening the harshness of the technology when it is brought into the domestic nest, where the true beauty of the light may literally flower.”<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a> This blending of field and factory may come closest to Loy’s own poetic sensibilities, though her work again reveals ambivalence toward the gender relationships suggested by this form of domestic illumination.
	</p>
<p>
	  On one hand, her poem “The Widow’s Jazz” characterizes her happiness with Arthur Cravan as “everlit delight” and mourns his “incandescent memory.”<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> Theirs seems to  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> have been a union of mutual warmth and radiance; yet “The Effectual Marriage, or The Insipid Narrative of Gina and Movanni” portrays a very different dynamic operating between that couple:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
	  While Miovanni thought alone in the dark
	<br>
	  Gina supposed that peeping   she might see
	<br>
	  A round light  shining  where his mind was
	<br>
	  She never opened the door
	<br>
	  Fearing that this might blind her
	<br>
	  Or even
	<br>
	  That she should see   Nothing at all<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  Gina imagines her husband’s masculine intellectualism as a bare light bulb, “A round light shining where his mind was”—potentially either too brilliant for her feminine powers of perception to take in, or, conversely, utterly unenlightened. Fear keeps her from approaching him and leaves him “alone in the dark.” Loy’s description of Miovanni’s condition could read as an implicit affirmation that masculine modes of thinking really are not as bright as society assumes them to be. On the other hand, the poem may simply critique the broader segregation of the sexes. Who knows what lights may have dawned if Gina had had the courage to open that door into Miovanni’s study?
	</p>
<p>
	  Still, proximity does not necessarily lead to cooperative, generative interaction. Section VI of <span style="font-style:italic;">Songs to Joannes</span> dramatizes yet another variation of incandescent gender relations:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
	  I know the Wire-Puller intimately
	<br>
	  And if it were not for the people
	<br>
	  On whom you keep one eye
	<br>
	  You could look straight at me
	<br>
	  And Time would be set back<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  Here, “the Wire-Puller” might refer either to the one who tugs a chain to turn on a light or to the one who shapes the wire whose glow the light bulb eventually emits. In either case, intimate knowledge of the inner workings of a lamp or person cannot guarantee fidelity. Like the radiance of a bare light bulb, the lover’s wandering eye casts its vision everywhere, and the speaker longs to capture that gaze in order to redirect it to her alone. Such filtering, she perhaps hopes, might soften the harshness of modern misogyny and create a more livable, if slightly idealized, warm glow.
	</p>
<p>
	  Effectively, Loy’s speaker seeks a poetic and relational “lampshade”—a material, linguistic screen to reshape shadows and interior design, metonymically altering the values of avant-garde sensibilities and home dynamics. It is helpful to compare two sections to speculate about how she envisions this transformation. Whereas in section IV the speaker characterizes shadows as “abominable” and furniture as “fearful,” these threats are neutralized in section XVII: “I don’t care / Where the legs of the legs of the furniture are walking to / Or what is hidden in the shadows they stride” (54–55, 59).  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Section IV describes an “unimaginable family” among the stars, mothers in “lamp-shade red dresses” whose relationship to (f)light and children is ambiguous:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
	  One bore a baby
	<br>
	  In a padded porte-enfant
	<br>
	  Tied with a sarsenet ribbon
	<br>
	  To her goose’s wings<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  Is the “One,” the “baby,” or the (shade-like) “porte-enfant” the object “tied?” Do the “goose’s wings” refer to mother or child? Is the dominant verb to bear or to tie? Lastly, does the image indeed occur within a “starry ceiling,” or do tied wings prevent mother and/or child from approaching those astronomical lights? Such variety in possibility seems, like Loy’s hat designs, intended to reframe categories of art and gender by appropriating masculine-coded mechanized modernity for feminine-coded spheres of fashion and family.
	</p>
<p>
	  Section XVII takes this strategy another step further. Here, the redness used previously to describe mothers’ dresses is attributed to other domestic fabrics like the “counterpane” and “towel,” as well as to the general space of “the battle-field” . As if crafting an embellished lampshade, the speaker concentrates on “the fringe” and “two tassels clinging together” . Refocusing attention on these seemingly smaller, eccentric decorative details, she observes, “Let[s] the square room fall away / From a round vacuum / Dilating with my breath” . Rigid boundaries disappear, and even the “round vacuum” of the light bulb itself expands with Loy’s poetic “breath.” Ultimately, her crafting of the peripheral lampshade space is what empowers her to manipulate the brilliance of the avant-garde.
	</p>
<p>
	  This artful manipulation of energy is a skill Loy regularly utilized in constructing her lampshades. Though few of her lighting designs survive, Burke briefly describes shades embossed with ships from bygone eras, star-shaped parchment sconces, and internally lit glass spheres overlaid with antique terrestrial and celestial maps.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> Many of the works seem palimpsestic and, like theatrical scrims, explore the revelatory potential of interplay between opacity and translucence: “[S]hades made of opalescent papers layered one over the other . . . looked opaque but became translucent when illuminated. . . . [A] similar device created the shadowplay of <span style="font-style:italic;">Les Poissons</span> (<span style="font-style:italic;">Fish</span>), a green cellophane shade doubled so that the inner layer’s patterns projected onto the outer surface, evoking the blurry transparency of water in reflected light.”<a name="f48-text" href="#f48"><sup>48</sup></a> In other words, relative opacity was integral to the aesthetic and, together with the light-source, worked as mutual means to transformative illumination.
	</p>
<p>
	  Loy achieves her poetics of luminous opacity not only through imagery and diction, but also by recasting syntax, lineation, and material printing. Much of the perceived opacity of her writing is due to her characteristic use of caesuras and line breaks in place of standard punctuation and rhetorical syntax, and to her style of dropping or substituting expected pronouns and prepositions. As noted in examples above, the result can be confusion over which words function as subject and object, and how far the  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> action of a verb extends. Like electrical currents, her lines of meaning routinely jump gaps and sometimes risk short-circuiting the sense of a stanza altogether. Significantly, although the imagery of <span style="font-style:italic;">Songs to Joannes</span> fits the bipolar model of direct current electrification, its form seems calibrated to a multipolar alternating-current voltage, at once more intense, far-reaching, and dangerous than direct-current. The implications are provocative: reading Loy can be more thrilling (even, in the case of her contemporary audience, shocking) and risky than navigating a turbulent sexual relationship; it requires a literary equivalent of AC/DC transformers and converters, asking readers to make quick shifts even as they remain open to a veritable grid of possibilities.
	</p>
<p>
	  Roger L. Conover mentions in his notes that Loy implored Carl Van Vechten in 1915 to “get Songs for Joannes published for me—all together — printed on one side of each page only — &amp; a large round in the middle of each page.”<a name="f49-text" href="#f49"><sup>49</sup></a> Had her intention been carried out, the effect would have visually emphasized the material printed pages as “lampshades” to her own words’ electric brilliance, providing an even more compelling example of Loy’s ingenious use of lampshade design, and making the “Little lusts and lucidities”<a name="f50-text" href="#f50"><sup>50</sup></a> of her poetry even more alluring — if more luminously opaque — than they already are.

	      See also the concluding stanza of section I mentioned above, where the speaker positions herself “in my lantern / Trimming subliminal flicker / Virginal    to the bellows / Of Experience” . As suggested earlier, this passage may be read as a statement of sexual self-ownership (“my lantern”) and self-maintenance (“Trimming”) that ensures a perpetually active “flicker” of lived potential, responding to each moment of experience with the wonder, sensuality, and sensitivity of an always-for-the-first-time mode of discovery.

	      Loy is not unique in this critique, however. Armstrong identifies cultural ambivalence toward electromagnetism spanning centuries, its actual physical power, and metaphorical language, transforming fields as diverse as medicine, psychology (via Freud), literature, and jurisprudence (“Electrifying the Body,” 13–21). Of particular interest to him is the way early electrical lighting used in public and domestic places rered relationships between society and particular persons: “If the social and the individual body are intimately related, then the programmes for the wiring of houses that gathered pace around the turn of the century find parallels in the wiring of individual bodies, and in the way in which states of attraction, animation, incandescence are red” .

      What can disability theory bring to modernist studies?
    </p>
<p>
      Let’s start with an infamous entry in the 1915 journal of Virginia Woolf, which reports a chance encounter with “a long line of imbeciles” on a towpath near Kingston. “It was perfectly horrible,” she writes. “They should certainly be killed.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Woolf critics haven’t known quite what to do with this violent speech act. Read it as an endorsement of eugenics activism? Soften it into an early symptom of Woolf’s impending breakdown? Accord it the protected status of an uncensored private musing? Frame it in a list of Woolf’s worst offences? Accept it as an unsurprising manifestation of Woolf’s benighted political individualism?<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> None of these responses is particularly satisfying, given the wild disjunction between the brutality of Woolf’s declaration, on the one hand, and on the other its inoffensive targets, who are simply taking a group walk along a tow path on the Thames. Indeed, it is telling that none of the commentary takes much account of those anonymous “imbeciles,” who, though fingered for death, are more or less backgrounded as imprecise emblems of a bygone era of alienists and asylums. It is as if, to this day, no one quite <span style="font-style:italic;">sees</span> those people. I will be turning presently to a fuller excerpt from Woolf’s entry to ask what it is that <span style="font-style:italic;">she</span> sees. But my preliminary interest here lies in the image of the recorded event itself: Virginia Woolf’s encounter with a line of asylum inmates in a London suburb in 1915, which is rendered in language so assured and so extreme as to suggest that History itself “flashes up”—to use Benjamin’s phrase—in the journal passage.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> I take this flashing up as an irresistible invitation to try to take hold of this image at this moment, which comprises at once the English national “problem” of mental deficiency (to use  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the argot of the time), modernism’s experimental investigations of consciousness, the contested political realm of visibility, and the affective conditions for shock. I will trace these confluent provocations through a handful of writings by Virginia Woolf and her contemporary Charlotte Mew, which I will view primarily from a perspective afforded by disability theory. I take it as an uncontroversial proposition that modernist aesthetics, with its emphasis on disproportion, fracture, and incompleteness, shares with disability theory a foundational contestation of the category of “the normal.”
    </p>
<p>
      It has been suggested recently by the philosopher Licia Carlson that mental disability may be the philosopher’s “worst nightmare” because it renders reason irrelevant and poses questions that are alien to those that philosophy is equipped to answer.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a> Given modernism’s insistent experimental forays into territories beyond reason and its languages, beyond the proscriptive discourses of the symbolic realm, beyond normative models of subjectivity, we might expect to find the re of mental deficiency somewhere along those frontiers. Such a re might, for instance, offer a ready site of modernist engagement along the lines of what Henri Bergson, in his critique of the tautologies produced by philosophical analysis, famously called “intuition”: the anti-positivist effort to encounter alterity on its own terms, through a “sympathy by which one is transported into the interior of an object in order to coincide with what there is unique and consequently inexpressible in it.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> If the mentally “deficient” subject, whose mind is presumed to defy any theory of mind, were taken as both a modernist subject and as a modernist “object of thought,” what insights might an effort of sympathetic intuition yield about its unique interiority and about compositions of interiority more generally?
    </p>
<p>
      The question is complicated no less by the fungibility of the concept of “modernism” than by the culturally induced ignorance surrounding mental disability and by the medico-legal discourses of aberrancy in early twentieth-century England, which materialized in, among other institutions, its burgeoning asylum system. With this overdetermined difficulty in view, I’ll begin with a look at that legal terrain, in order to provide a context for a discussion of works by Woolf and Mew. Both writers had significant personal and familial connections to the English asylum system: Woolf’s half-sister Laura, who was likely an autist, was permanently institutionalized in a home for idiots in nearby Redhill, sometime around the age of 21; Woolf’s cousin died in an institution after going mad at Cambridge; two of Mew’s siblings were institutionalized for life in their teens after complete schizophrenic breaks; Woolf and Mew both spent time in mental homes after breakdowns; both lived in fear of insanity; both committed suicide at age 59.<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>
      While insanity plays a central role in these parallel biographical events, I want to be clear that my subject here is not “madness” (a topic that has been central to modernist scholarship); rather, it is mental deficiency, a term I am intentionally employing as a now-anachronistic descriptor that broadly includes all manner of mental disability.<a name="f7-text" href="#f7"><sup>7</sup></a> In the British nineteenth century when the asylum system began to proliferate, “mania” (madness) and “dementia/amentia” (decayed/absent powers of mind) were habitually conflated in institutional guidelines and practices. It was understood, for example, that  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> persistent mania of the kind produced by “deep and overwhelming grief” or “extreme poverty” could eventually cross a line into permanent dementia, and as dementia was considered a functional equivalent of imbecility, the borders among all of these categories were constitutionally permeable.<a name="f8-text" href="#f8"><sup>8</sup></a> In keeping with the paradoxes of biopower, this permeability was heightened with each successive piece of British legislation that aimed to stabilize mental deficiency as an object of legal and social control. The Lunacy Act of 1845 and the Idiots Act of 1886 created categorical degrees of mania, idiocy, and dementia; and in 1913, the Mental Deficiency Act (MDA)—implemented just eight months before Woolf’s encounter on the towpath—elaborated these categories and established new ones, such as “feeble-mindedness” and “moral imbecility,” while explicitly providing for the targeted sequestration of mental defectives.<a name="f9-text" href="#f9"><sup>9</sup></a> Promoted vigorously by eugenics activists (who insistently connected mental deficiency with poverty, excessive fertility, racial degeneration, and so forth), and laced with the rhetoric of humanitarian concerns (since the mentally disabled were often haphazardly incarcerated in poor houses, prisons, and lunatic asylums), the MDA was hailed by many as the comprehensive solution to the “problem” of mental defectives.<a name="f10-text" href="#f10"><sup>10</sup></a> With the passage of the act in 1913 came the triumphant sense, among eugenicists especially, that the “problem” had been solved. Because it provided for local authorities who would alert asylum officers to the presence of untended feeble-minded individuals in local communities, the MDA implicitly promised a time, somewhere in England’s near future, when defectives would once and for all “be segregated under proper conditions so that their curse died with them,” to quote Winston Churchill’s endorsement of the act. <a name="f11-text" href="#f11"><sup>11</sup></a> In effect, its passage simultaneously justified, retroactively, the construction of more than 150 lunatic and idiot asylums in the seventy years since the Lunacy Act, and projected a modern, efficient, federated approach to the institutional control of defectives.<a name="f12-text" href="#f12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>
      One aspect of the vague horizon of expectation produced by the MDA is central to my inquiry: that is, the manufactured expectation that the new social policy would effectively eliminate defectives from the public world. If “permanent segregation” was now, legally, “the dominant model of care and control” of the feeble-minded and their ilk, then how was the public to account for their continued appearance in public—their failure to disappear completely, as it were, from the sphere of citizenry?<a name="f13-text" href="#f13"><sup>13</sup></a> The MDA’s legal imperative for permanent sequestration of those deemed to be mentally deficient accomplished a discursive <span style="font-style:italic;">a priori</span> cancellation of their eligibility as sovereign subjects (if that eligibility can be said to have existed). Once singled out and signified <span style="font-style:italic;">as</span> feeble-minded <span style="font-style:italic;">for</span> feeble-minded asylums, they became a part of an institutional sign system associating mental deficiency with the condition of civil death—<span style="font-style:italic;">civiliter mortuus</span>, the stripping of civil rights and political identity from persons deemed to be law-breakers or <span style="font-style:italic;">non compos mentis</span>.
    </p>
<p>
      Here we may be reminded of Agamben’s argument, adapted from Hannah Arendt, that human rights are predicated on the manufacture of civil rights, and not the other way around; once a “declaration of rights” proclaims the citizen to be a bearer of “natural rights,” the non-citizen is nowhere to be found on the ground from which rights are claimed. In the period to which I am referring (though perhaps that period is still our  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> period), this status is further secured by the foundational presumption that mental defectives were incapable of meaningful language. It is beyond the scope of this essay to follow down to its roots the post-Enlightenment grafting onto “sovereign” subjectivity of the capacity for speech and, more specifically, the capacity for sovereign speech acts. Suffice it to say here that to be nonverbal or atypically verbal in a normate culture is to be presumed incompetent in the language of agency and therefore unintelligible as a political or moral subject; it is to be a non-subject.<a name="f14-text" href="#f14"><sup>14</sup></a> As we will see, atypical verbality plays a role in the writings that illustrate my discussions of the provocations posed to modernist writing by what is at once the political transparency and opacity of mental disability (“they” are clearly not a part of “us”), since it confounds universalist assumptions about the sovereignty of speaking subjects.<a name="f15-text" href="#f15"><sup>15</sup></a> If mental deficiency, however ill-defined, becomes the provisional ground for what is in effect a liberal state of exception, where institutions like the asylum system take up the biopolitical management of defective “life,” then what would it mean to encounter those cancelled citizens, whose public appearance or disappearance has been constitutively tethered to national health?<a name="f16-text" href="#f16"><sup>16</sup></a> I will argue that public appearance of mentally deficient persons in this moment could and did constitute the conditions for a certain kind of shock, in the manner of Freud’s <span style="font-style:italic;">Unheimlich</span>—that is, as something that shocks because it “ought to have remained hidden and secret.”<a name="f17-text" href="#f17"><sup>17</sup></a> From this hypothesis I mean to ask: what were “they” to “us”—we modernists—in the epistemic moment crystallized by the MDA?
    </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">On the Lane with Mew</h1>
<p>
	My pairing of Charlotte Mew with Virginia Woolf in this discussion may at first seem counter-intuitive, in spite of the biographical similarities I have already mentioned, to which we may add the shared quandary of lesbian desire in a sexually normative world. Woolf wrote voluminous amounts of prose—fiction, memoirs, essays, creative nonfiction—and the body of criticism generated by her work is so vast as to have acquired a sturdy name: Woolf Studies. Mew was a deeply private poet and prose writer whose output was minimal; we know relatively little about her life and less about the creative engine room of her aesthetic practices, especially when compared to our microscopic knowledge of Woolf. Woolf boldly experimented on all the frontiers that we associate with modernism—narrative innovation, the content of “literature,” formal explorations of consciousness—while Mew’s official status as a “modernist” is by no means secure, since she wrote poems that, as often as not, worked within inherited forms: the graveyard poem, the isolated dramatic monologue, the Wordsworthian country lyric. And yet, because of the sexual and social dissent that she brought to those forms, and the techniques she developed to marshal them around unspeakable, dys-modern desire and to convey within them encounters whose meanings could not be accessed by the languages of modernity, I am not alone in counting Mew as a modernist. Her modernism becomes especially clear if we consider modernist aesthetics as a disruptor of what Jacques Rancière has called the “regime of representation,” whereby we  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> know “art” through its conformity to genres and hierarchies. The breaking up of that traditional regime by modernist aesthetics entails the intrusion of history into genres, thereby revealing within them what had hitherto been imperceptible: the “significant traits deposited in the topography of spaces, the physiology of social circles, the silent expression of bodies.”<a name="f18-text" href="#f18"><sup>18</sup></a> These traits form the substrates of Mew’s poetry. Her deployment of received poetic forms affords a palimpsestic vision of the present in the past and of the confluences and disjunctions between “the modern” and the pre-modern that it purports to have left behind.<a name="f19-text" href="#f19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<p>
	A good example of this doubled historical vision takes shape in Mew’s brief, four-stanza poem “On the Asylum Road,” which appeared in her well-regarded collection <span style="font-style:italic;">The Farmer’s Bride</span> in 1916 (although the poem was probably composed a few years earlier, around the time of Woolf’s “horrible” encounter, when the MDA was becoming law.)<a name="f20-text" href="#f20"><sup>20</sup></a> “On the Asylum Road” uses the form of a quaint country lyric—Wordsworth’s fanciful “The Idiot Boy” comes to mind—which, in Mew’s hands, becomes something palpably new: a meditation on modern conditions of mental otherness. The poem’s speaker is a colloquial first-person plural “we,” which, in the first two stanzas, unself-consciously narrates an encounter with inmates on an asylum road:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<div class="verse-group"><p>
	Theirs is the house whose windows—every pane—
      <br>
	  Are made of darkly stained or clouded glass:
      <br>
	Sometimes you come upon them in the lane,
      <br>
	  The saddest crowd that you will ever pass.
      </p></div>
<div class="verse-group"><p>
	But still we merry town or village folk
      <br>
	  Throw to their scattered stare a kindly grin,
      <br>
	And think no shame to stop and crack a joke
      <br>
	  With the incarnate wages of man’s sin.<a name="f21-text" href="#f21"><sup>21</sup></a></p></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	Though the impenetrable inmates on the lane are “the saddest crowd that you will ever pass” (the “you” presumably includes modern readers), “we” merry town folk engage in a kind of neighborly, if perfunctory, friendliness with them, “[throwing] to their scattered stare a kindly grin” and “think[ing it] no shame to stop and crack a joke / With the incarnate wages of man’s sin.” These first two stanzas quickly mobilize all of the conventional pre-modernist rations of mental disability, before its absorption into medico-legal discourse: the inmates’ faces are doubly metaphorical—they are like clouded glass, and also like the darkened windows of their asylum; metonymically, their many faces comprise one “scattered stare”; allegorically their defectiveness is the sign of a punishment from God. These are res that seem to be “flashing up” from a time that has passed or is passing out of view.
      </p>
<p>
	In the third stanza, however, the “we” of the conventional “merry town folk” expands into a more universal “we” of reflexive observation. This is a technique that Mew frequently uses to create, at a stanza break, an abrupt perspectival shift from immediate human events to the contrapuntal activities of the natural world; its effect is to delay and concentrate an unsettling vision achieved in the stanza that follows.<a name="f22-text" href="#f22"><sup>22</sup></a> <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Here in the suspended third stanza, the philosophical “we” contemplates the natural chasms and mutual opacity among living things, in effect undoing the pathetic fallacy of Romanticism:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
	None but ourselves in our long gallery we meet,
      <br>
	  The moor-hen stepping from her reeds with dainty feet,
      <br>
	    The hare-bell bowing on his stem,
      <br>
	Dance not with us; their pulses beat
      <br>
	  To fainter music; nor do we to them
      <br>
	    Make their life sweet.
      <div class="attrib">
	(<span style="font-style:italic;">CM</span> 22)
      </div></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      As the suddenly irregular rhythms in these ebbing lines suggest, humans, birds, plants may coexist in nature, but their interrelations are random, not dependent. We humans may believe that nature’s creations make our lives sweeter, but we can no longer imagine that the reverse is also true. And this compressed dictum is implicitly brought to bear on the asylum inmates in the road. When “we” encounter “none but ourselves in our long gallery” of reflexive representation, who is “ourselves”? Are the inmates part of that long human portrait gallery, or are they, like birds and flowers, a separate species of the non-human? Do we recognize them and call them a part of us? Or are they as unknowable as the moor-hen and the hare-bell?<a name="f23-text" href="#f23"><sup>23</sup></a> The unresolved question hangs over the stanza break.
    </p>
<p>
      The fourth and final stanza answers it partly by way of attempting to imagine the isolated perspective of the inmates:
    </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>

    The stanza’s revised “we” calls them our “brother-shadows,” vanished siblings of a shuttered and paned/pained world; it makes an effort to afford them some subjectivity, however hazy. They are divided from us not by speciation, it seems, but by doubly clouded glass, and by the asylum road itself, which literally and symbolically marks the line between the mobile civil sovereignty of the town folk on the one side, and the shadowy civil death of the mental institution on the other.

<p>
    The thwarted face-to-face encounter picked out in the poem brings together politics—Agaben’s <span style="font-style:italic;">homo sacer—</span>and the ethics of the face, which, in the philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas, holds the unknown, naked face of the other to be the site of a profound ethical epiphany that calls me out of myself and into a relationship of non-instrumental responsibility to all others. “The face in its nakedness as a face,” writes Levinas, “presents to me the destitution of the poor one, and the stranger,” who, through the face, “presents himself as an equal.”<a name="f24-text" href="#f24"><sup>24</sup></a> The asylum road’s unequal encounter could be construed, in Levinas’s terms, as a failure of recognition and surrender on the part of the townsfolk, who seem not to “see” at all the singularity of the faces before them.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> But such a reading would be insufficient in itself, since its ahistoricity cannot accommodate the poem’s historical conditions, and its universalism cannot account for the aesthetic properties of the poem—its carefully controlled persona and minimalist poetics of reflection whereby “we” and “you” and “they” all become uncertain entities in “our long gallery.” Rather, I would suggest that the proto-Levinasian critique that may be sensed in the poem takes for its object the poem’s <span style="font-style:italic;">title</span>: the asylum road that structures our long gallery. As a permeable institutional marker crossing the spaces of the normal and the pathological, the public and the secluded, the road does the work of the asylum, in effect overcoding the inmates’ faces into one “scattered stare” of “the saddest crowd” imaginable. The asylum road ensures that the meaning of the inmates’ collective, defective visage is known to the townsfolk in advance: their clouded face has already “become a content,” to use Levinas’s words<a name="f25-text" href="#f25"><sup>25</sup></a>, and its single mien of abnormality forecloses any possibility for a “welcome of the face.”<a name="f26-text" href="#f26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>
    Also in play here is the palimpsestic temporality embodied in the asylum road. Within the context of the poem’s specific historical moment, the anachronism of the “merry folk” of ye olde village seems calculated to bring into contrast with the present of the MDA a pre-modern moment of naive village <span style="font-style:italic;">gemeinschaft.</span> On the one hand, the villager’s assumptions about the inmates—that they represent the wages of sin, for example—must seem archaic to modern ears; but on the other hand, their casual attempts at friendliness, their apparent acceptance of the inmates as part of the village topos, may seem equally outdated in an age marked by systems of “progressive” social control. “On the Asylum Road,” with its bewildering and unresolved encounter, in fact subtly discloses the real continuity between pre-modern and modern forms of social control—that is, the asylum as a persistent social fact—even as it retains the distinctly pre-modern expectations for sociability with “our brother-shadows.” Mew’s merrie band may display a benighted understanding of mental deficiency, in spite of its speaker’s attempt to inhabit the emotional state of “the saddest crowd” and to establish a filiation through differences of degree rather than kind; nevertheless, it would seem the disabled face-to-face encounter in “On the Asylum Road” does double duty as an abiding critique of the past, and, more damningly, of the modern enthymemes of mental deficiency. This dialectic of critique, according to which forms of the past become subtle staging grounds for blinkered universalist discourses of the present, is also central to “Ken,” Mew’s companion poem to “On the Asylum Road.” Before discussing “Ken,” however, I want to turn to a return with renewed focus to Woolf’s depiction, in her diary, of the encounter on the towpath.
  </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">On the Towpath with Woolf</h1>
<p>
    Woolf began her diary on January 1, 1915, while living in rented rooms in the center of Richmond. She had been banished from London to life in the suburbs after a suicidal bout of depression, which had begun in August 1913, made the stimulating urban world too risky for her continued mental fragility, in the opinion of her physicians  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> and her husband. (Indeed, six weeks after she began this journal, the violent manic phase of her illness suddenly surfaced with a vengeance.) Woolf’s early diary entries seem determined to provide a studiedly dispassionate account of her muted life in Richmond. January 2, for example, was “an altogether average sample of our life”: breakfast with the landlady and a walk to the market past “the vilest little red villas” (whose interiors she imagines, somewhat ominously, are “rank with the smell of meat &amp; human beings”) (<span style="font-style:italic;">Diary</span> 4–5). On January 9, she and Leonard walked to Kingston, several miles south of Richmond along the Thames. It was a “very good walk”; Kingston, approached via footpath through a purple field at sunset, looked “like a foreign town” (<span style="font-style:italic;">Diary</span> 13). And then in the next sentence, at the towpath on the riverbank, she breaks into the passage with which I began this essay. In spite of her measured tone, Woolf is clearly unprepared for this encounter near the foreign-seeming town, just as we are unprepared for its conclusion:
  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
      On the towpath we met &amp; had to pass a long line of imbeciles. The first was a very tall young man, just queer enough to look twice at, but no more; the second shuffled, &amp; looked aside; &amp; then one realized that every one in that long line was a miserable ineffective shuffling idiotic creature, with no forehead, or no chin, &amp; an imbecile grin, or a wild suspicious stare. It was perfectly horrible. They should certainly be killed.
    </p>
<div class="attrib">
      (<span style="font-style:italic;">Diary</span> 13)
    </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      That final sentence still manages to shock, even when we know it is coming. It circulates through the text and into us. The passage is marked by a rising sense of panic, as a group of what seem at first to be unmarked/unremarkable young men transforms before Woolf’s eyes into a long line (like Mew’s long gallery) of “miserable ineffective shuffling idiotic creature[s].” That “long line” of feeble-minded adjectives registers her increasing horror at the public encounter in the middle of a “very good walk.” Emerging in the place of the expected normal, these denizens of a parallel world of abnormality materialize literally in front of her face, and she must pass each face, each grin and wild stare, one by one.
    </p>
<p>
      Woolf’s shock has several sources: the surprise of such an encounter with the faces of imbeciles on a public road; their nonverbal, yet vividly affective communications that convey meaning without speech; the physical proximity forced by the path. But what seems essential to her horror is the <span style="font-style:italic;">dawning</span> awareness of mental disability in those faces—the slow recognition that what-seems-to-be normal is in fact an illusion, and that beneath the illusion lies an uncanny reality, a kind of negative double of the apparent world. Deepening affective shock like this, produced out of dawning perception, can be found in Woolf’s fiction as well as her nonfiction—it acts as a narrative-aesthetic trigger in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span>, for example, as we shall see—and therefore is worth our pursuing. Wittgenstein’s famous discussion of “seeing-as” may be of some use here. His discussion centers on the example of a duck-rabbit picture, which can at first be perceived (perhaps) as a duck, then (perhaps, if one probes sufficiently) as duck and rabbit:  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

</div>
<p>
      Wittgenstein is especially interested in the status of the dawning perception in this scenario: “I <span style="font-style:italic;">see</span> that [the re] has not changed; and yet I see it differently. I call this experience ‘noticing an aspect.’ . . . And I must distinguish between the ‘continuous seeing’ of an aspect and the ‘dawning’ of an aspect.”<a name="f27-text" href="#f27"><sup>27</sup></a> Aspects that at first had been un-perceived come to dominate the seer’s sense of the object, in part <span style="font-style:italic;">because</span> the dawning of the recognition demonstrates the leakiness of the conduit between perception and consciousness. Indeed, one might say that that the duck-rabbit produces the inverse operation of a metaphor: “duck” is no longer available to be like something else—it is certainly not <span style="font-style:italic;">like</span> the rabbit, since it <span style="font-style:italic;">is</span> (part of) the rabbit—and the recognition of this delimiting dependency puts the brakes on any interpretive elaborations of the duck or the rabbit. Now the duck cannot be metaphorical (it cannot be “like” Yeats’s eternal swans, for example), except insofar as it is tied to the rabbit as part of a duck-rabbit, which in turn can only be “like” other puzzle-pictures. Wittgenstein suggests that what is perceived in “the dawning of an aspect is not a property of the object, but an internal relation between it and other objects” , which is to say that the duck-rabbit has always been duck-rabbit, and what changes in the “dawning” is the certainty that one can believe what one sees. In Woolf’s encounter, “dawning” marks an unbidden shift from what we might call subjective sovereignty to “perfectly horrible” epistemological instability. The faces become permanently human-and-unhuman and, in this sense, impervious to the metaphorical machinations of the imagination. On this reading, the indignant “certainly” of “They certainly should be killed” means, in part, that “they” should be evacuated from our public world (in one way or another) because their shocking presence among us disrupts, permanently, universalist presumptions of a stable normality. This kind of shock, for someone like Woolf, must surely extend to her own tenuous mental sovereignty. The sudden appearance of the face of the idiot declares, in effect, that all bets are off; with this breaching of sequestration, such random encounters with imbeciles in our midst give the lie to “progressive” control and its anchors in political thought.
    </p>
<p>
      Part of our own readerly shock at this passage must stem from our sense of Woolf as a writer whose project challenged (rather than reified) authoritative constructions of a  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> universal subject. Clearly Woolf harbors a few monstrous universalisms of her own in this candid moment, starting with an Enlightenment premium on intellectual ability.<a name="f28-text" href="#f28"><sup>28</sup></a> And when read here against the implicit ethical charge in Mew’s poem, Woolf’s violent allergy to the inmates seems especially vivid. But what I have been emphasizing is the schismatic modern <span style="font-style:italic;">context</span> of these two encounters: on the asylum road, individual faces have already been overcoded into one pathological face, and the poetic task is to make room for something vital behind that face; on the towpath, individual pathological faces emerge from a presumedly unmarked group, and the task of the journal is to flatten the resultant shock with a sovereign-sounding speech-act of condemnation. By noting this chiasmus, I want to stress that I am not suggesting that a passage dislodged from Woolf’s journal in a very troubled year is equivalent to or may be read on the same terms as Mew’s published lyric poem. Rather, I take both of them as related and illuminatingly divergent modernist responses to the provocations of mental disability in an age when medico-legal taxonomies had wrenched it out of the realm of local knowledge and into the national discourses of biopower. Woolf’s response is routed through modernist shock, while Mew’s tunnels beneath it.

<h1 class="sec-headA">Nervous Normates and the Duskier Chamber of the Being</h1>
<p>
      Disability theorists have had a good deal to say about the interrelations between disability and textuality. Most build on Rosemarie Garland Thomson’s foundational 1997 coinage of the term “normate” to conceptualize the dominant regime in which the empowered abstract re of nondisabled corporeality (“the normate”) embodies the norm against which corporeal diversity is pathologized and regulated.<a name="f29-text" href="#f29"><sup>29</sup></a> David Mitchell and Sharon Snyder subsequently proposed that disability acts as a “narrative prosthesis” that, in effect, recursively solves problems within the normate text and thereby extends the text’s authority, and Robert McRuer has theoretically refined this argument by dovetailing it with queer theory, in order to analyze the normate phenomenon of what he calls “compulsory able-bodiedness.”<a name="f30-text" href="#f30"><sup>30</sup></a> More recently, in a project whose aims are closer to my own here, Ato Quayson has offered a nuanced study of “aesthetic nervousness”—his coinage for the textual crises produced by encounters with disability that lead to “the collapse of the dominant protocols that govern the representation.”<a name="f31-text" href="#f31"><sup>31</sup></a> Quayson’s formulations, which explicitly include mental disability, maintain a focus on textual enunciation and irruption—rather than, say, plot or character—and extend into twentieth-century global writing that includes Beckett’s <span style="font-style:italic;">End Game</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Molloy</span> (for their disabled bodies) and Coetzee’s autistic novels like <span style="font-style:italic;">The Life and Times of Michael K</span>. And yet I would argue that the project of reading <span style="font-style:italic;">modernism</span> through the lens of disability theory requires something more than what Quayson offers: it requires a doubled focus on self-conscious aesthetic practice and on the historical forces that underpin modernist textuality. I have proposed that the nominalism attending the discursive proliferation of mental disability in the early twentieth century plays a role in the volatile codes of modernism; to this I would add that one significant aspect of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the modernist aesthetic project—certainly in evidence in the writings to which I will next turn—involves the deliberate experimental creation (rather than short-circuiting or collapse) of new aesthetic domains out of the encounter with non-normate bodies and affects. In line with recent work by Tobin Siebers and Michael Davidson, I will my extend my proposal that modernism’s interest in aporia and fracture, disproportion and asymmetry, are rooted in aesthetic and epistemological challenges to “normal.”<a name="f32-text" href="#f32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Woolf’s extraordinary essay “Street Haunting,” written and published in 1930 in a limited edition, offers an extended example of this self-generating aesthetic.<a name="f33-text" href="#f33"><sup>33</sup></a> The arc of the essay is simple enough: Woolf has been at her desk in London for the length of a winter afternoon. As early dusk is falling, she seizes the pretense of buying a pencil to go out into the evening. She walks the streets for a while, relishes her place among the “vast republican army of anonymous trampers” , appreciates the beauty of the city, buys a pencil, and eventually returns home. Woolf contrasts the experience of the street with being at home, where a comfortable private “self” is both enfolded and extended by the familiar objects that surround her—the bowl from Italy on the mantelpiece, the carpet with its burnt brown ring, each with its own highly specific autobiographical connotations. But when she steps outside into the approaching darkness (that time of day when “we are no longer quite ourselves” [20]), a phenomenological change occurs: her domestic “shell-like covering” breaks apart, exposing at its center an “oyster of perceptiveness, an enormous eye” that fully and impartially takes in the city’s beautiful features (21–22). This beauty-seeking eye satisfies her for a while, as it glides across surfaces, retrieving “the prettiest trophies [like] little lumps of emerald and coral.” But when Woolf becomes sated by this diet of “simple, sugary fare,” she begins to wish for a more complex kind of vision, one that might “compose these trophies in such a way as to bring out the more obscure angles and relationships” . She feels thus compelled to

	halt at the door of the boot shop and make some little excuse, which has nothing to do with the real reason, for folding up the bright paraphernalia of the streets and withdrawing to some duskier chamber of the being where we may ask, as we raise our left foot obediently upon the stand: “What, then, is it like to be a dwarf?”

<p class="continued">
	A dwarf? The question is calculated to shock; it irrupts into the text, preceding any explanation, as though it has been sprung upon Woolf and upon us by her withdrawal to the “duskier chamber of the being”—as though, in eschewing the superficial beauty of the street and seeking a more complex form of perception, Woolf has vaulted into the bizarre and other-worldly <span style="font-style:italic;">tableau vivant</span> that is materializing in the boot shop. A dwarf, we now learn, has entered the store, and the scale of her nontraditional body produces an immediate recalibration of all other surrounding bodies: she is “escorted by two women who, being of normal size, looked like benevolent giants beside her.” Even the woman’s own affect and proportions are destabilized in this dusky chamber: as she shops for shoes, she puts forward her foot, and “behold [!]”: the foot of the dwarf is now the “shapely, perfectly proportioned foot of a well-grown woman. It was  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> arched; it was aristocratic. Her whole manner changed as she looked at it resting on the stand.” The woman’s “peevish yet apologetic expression [that is] usual on the faces of the deformed” becomes “soothed and satisfied” as she tries on pair after pair of shoes . It is as if her well-grown foot has redrawn the boundaries between normate and non-normate and has transformed her entire being through the power of synecdoche: as her foot becomes the focal point in the textual dusky chamber, the woman behaves as though the stigmas of her body have disappeared into the proportional shift around her. “Seeing nothing but her feet,” Woolf observes, not without a touch of malice, the little person “imagined perhaps that the rest of her body was of a piece with those beautiful feet” . We don’t really know what the woman is imagining, of course, because Woolf does not grant her speech; she is a silent pantomime alternating between deformity and satisfaction. Woolf maintains this supercilious tone through the rest of the scene, until at last the woman reluctantly leaves the shop: her “ecstasy fade[s],” the Cinderella scenario dissolves, and she reverts to being “a dwarf only” .

	Disability theorists have long remarked on the normate perspective that views atypical corporeal features as the sum total of an individual’s identity; here, Woolf enacts that process in reverse: the pirouetting subject-woman is narratively remanded to her status as dwarf-only. Yet something has changed fundamentally. The little woman has retained her shape-shifting power over perspective; indeed, that power seems to have grown to encompass the world beyond the dusky boot shop. Woolf discovers, upon her own exit from the shop, that the dwarf has “changed the mood” of the very streets that were, only moments earlier, sites of disjointed beauty. Now disrement and disability reign: the dwarf has
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">

Two bearded men, brothers, apparently, stone-blind, supporting themselves by resting a hand on the head of a small boy between them, marched down the street [wearing] the terror and inevitability of the fate that [had] overtaken them [ . . . ] and [cleaving] asunder the passers-by. [. . . ] Indeed, the dwarf had started a hobbling grotesque dance to which everybody in the street now conformed: the stout lady tightly swathed in shiny sealskin; the feeble-minded boy sucking the silver knob of his stick [ . . . ]—all joined in the hobble and tap of the dwarf’s dance.

<p class="continued">
	  The dwarf’s power has revealed a parallel non-normate world in its entirety; like the duck-rabbit, this shadow world is the constitutive, haunting complement of the superficially beautiful street. Its detection requires the complex vision of the duskier chamber; its seemingly magical actuation arises out of the infectious disproportion of the dwarf. The dwarf’s triad—she, flanked by giantesses—is reproduced in the triad of the blind brothers who tower over their little guide; her gait becomes the dance of the street. What, indeed, is it like to be a dwarf? It is to be uncannily powerful.
	</p>
<p>
	  Straining for some distance from this strange new world, Woolf asks, with forced nonchalance, where they live, how they survive, this “maimed company of the halt and the blind.” Her ethical imagination makes a weak appearance via an insulated “we”: surely their “fantastic” lives “cannot be altogether tragic”; surely they “do not grudge  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> us . . . our prosperity.” But at the moment of this assertion, her faux insouciance is met with a face-to-face shock:

	    This episode might be characterized as a site of aesthetic nervousness or collapse, in Quayson’s sense: the nervous narrative balks. But to read it this way would be to assume that the text itself has no prior knowledge of or expectation for its sudden unraveling. I would argue, to the contrary, that the <span style="font-style:italic;">collapse itself</span> signifies a form of experimentation, a narrative strategy, a plotted textual disruption; and I would argue further that it is part of a series of exploratory disruptions that comprise the aesthetic plot of “Street Haunting.” The first stage takes place in the familiar flat, where known objects extend the self; next, the oyster eye of surface beauty emerges in the street; then the duskier chamber produces or is produced by a sudden complex and distorted vision. The aesthetic experiment associated with this third stage—the stage of the parallel non-normate world—gradually extends modernist subjectivism to its limit point, beyond which Woolf’s narrative sentience does not go. The street dance, with its idiot boy and tapping blind men, can be navigated by means of the carnivalesque aesthetics of freakish heterogenerity. But the face-to-face encounter with the wild, glaring Jew (demented perhaps by “overwhelming grief” or “extreme poverty,” to recall the Lunacy Commission’s report) marks a complete arrest of subjectivism’s imaginative penetration. The aesthetic capabilities of this stage hit the wall, as it were; this singular face cannot be marked down to impersonal freakery, and Woolf is not compelled (or, perhaps, aesthetically unequipped) to follow it into its vortex of poverty, disability, and civil death. On this reading, “Street Haunting” is an exercise in the phenomenology of the modern. The unanswered question posed by the silent “brandished flare” of the Jew marks the end of this particular aesthetic stage of street haunting. Its resonant hollowness becomes the dimension upon which the essay’s next stage builds. In that ensuing stage, Woolf reres the halt and the blind as inanimate “derelicts” : now they are objects scattered about the streets, like pieces of the fantastic assemblages that fill up the surrounding shop windows.<a name="f35-text" href="#f35"><sup>35</sup></a> In the next moment, Woolf simply abandons them, as her beauty-seeking eye returns with heightened energy: in this post-disability stage, the eye has become a “sportive and generous” organ that “creates [and] enhances”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> her subsequent wanderings . Leaving behind the maimed company, Woolf’s street haunting continues through several more aesthetic stages until she returns home to her flat, satisfied by this “greatest of adventures” .
	  </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">The Half-lit Stair</h1>
<p>
	    The “duskier chamber of the being” is where Woolf acquires her transient vision of the haunting parallel world; the speaker of Mew’s poem “Ken” begins to acquire her permanent vision in a similarly dusky “half-lit stair” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CM</span> 17). Once again, however, Mew’s poetic account of the “brandished flare” of the non-normate may be read in reverse relation to Woolf’s. “Ken” is a dramatic monologue about a man—a mental defective—living in an ancient village in Brittany. As in “On the Asylum Road,” the setting of “Ken” and the language of the speaker telling his story are imbued with the cadences of parochial life. She is one of the town folk, and she relates Ken’s story from the perspective of her own “dawning” awareness of him.
	  </p>
<p>
	    The first stanza describes the old town in pentameter that is as neatly controlled as the “black clad people walking in their sleep” who are “watched from end to end / By the great Church above” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CM</span> 16). Only the village’s darting children seem alive, and then only in the morning and the early evening when they visit Ken’s “gabled house facing the Castle wall” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CM</span> 17). In this tomblike, pre-modern setting of Castle and Church, the second stanza, trimmed to tetrameter and tightly rhymed, recollects (and enacts through an anomalous halting caesura) the speaker’s original shock upon suddenly meeting Ken:
	  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
	    When first I came upon him there,
	  <br>
	    Suddenly, on the half-lit stair,
	  <br>
	    I think I hardly found a trace
	  <br>
	    Of likeness to a human face
	  <br>
	      In his. And I said then
	  <br>
	    If in His image God made men,
	  <br>
	    Some other must have made poor Ken—
	  <br>
	    But for his eyes which looked at you
	  <br>
	    As two red, wounded stars might do.
	  <div class="attrib">
	    (<span style="font-style:italic;">CM</span> 17)
	  </div></p></div></blockquote>
<p class="continued">
	  The completed past tense of the stanza presages change: the poem’s narrative will revise this initial impression of an unhuman, ungodly face that resists all recognition beyond the wounded eyes-stars of Christ. In the stanzas that follow, the speaker learns the language of Ken. His communications are powerful, though nearly nonverbal: “He scarcely spoke, you scarcely heard, / His voice broke off in little jars.” Rather, it is an autist’s unbridled polyglossia, spoken through the body, through gait and affect, as he “ploughed up the street, / Groping, with knarred, high-lifted feet / And arms thrust out as if to beat / Always against a threat of bars” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CM</span> 17). This affective language is  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> conveyed to the deer he visits in the park and to the children who flock to him; and it is understood, finally, by the narrator, who comes to recognize in his nonverbal communications a potent synecdochal vitalism. She learns that for Ken (in contrast to the deathliness of the village), nothing is dead:
	</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>
	  He said “a bird” if he picked up a broken wing,
	<br>
	      A perished leaf or any such thing
	<br>
	      Was just “a rose”; and once when I had said
	<br>
	  He must not stand and knock there any more,
	<br>
	  He left a twig on the mat outside my door.

<p class="continued">
	Ken retains life and gives gifts (here, a tree) through a distinctly poetic medium of ration. Reason is of little use in this medium, except as a mode by which to extrapolate discarded parts into newly imagined wholes. And it is precisely this faculty of Ken’s—this resurrecting of life from behind the broken façade of death—that is his undoing, making it impossible for him to sit quietly in the village church on Sunday nights. The sight of a dead Christ hanging on the dark altar drives him into “evil fits”: “Biting his rosary to bits. / While pointing to the Christ he tried to say / ‘Take it away.’” (<span style="font-style:italic;">CM</span> 18). The tortured god repels any of Ken’s efforts at synecdochal resurrection; the authority of the crucifix, for the villagers (though not for Ken), resides in its deathly form.
      </p>

	At this point the poem shifts into the same kind of temporal and perspectival hiatus that we saw in “On the Asylum Road.” This time the speaker abruptly turns, in the poem’s longest stanza, to the seasonal cycle of death and change:
      </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">

      </div></p></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      What has happened during this turn away from human events? What shock does Mew delay and concentrate through the narration of the death and life in a season’s natural passing? The speaker reveals the event obliquely in the last two stanzas. She begins by wondering about “that red brick barn upon the hill,” with its “twenty windows in a row” looking down at the town—the asylum that bookends the church (<span style="font-style:italic;">CM</span> 18). In “that place,” she wonders, “can one own the deer, / And does one walk with children still / As one did here”? And if you have evil fits, and  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><div class="verse-group"><p>

<p class="continued">
    Ken has been seen by the “eyes” of the asylum and has been removed to it; and the speaker, his familiar, receiver of his gifts, has been complicit in her passivity:

        So, when they took

<p class="continued">
  The asylum will discipline Ken into not-Ken, stripping him of his house and park—and of his name, which means, literally, “scope of understanding.” He will be institutionalized as inmate and absorbed into a metonym to be seen, perhaps, as part of a “scattered stare” on the asylum road.
</p>
<p>
  But although the speaker betrays Ken, she retains the indelible synecdochal transmissions that hold open her new “scope of understanding”—not only about Ken, but also about how the State may suddenly create naked life—<span style="font-style:italic;">zoe</span>—from individual lives. She had refused to look at Ken’s face when he was taken away, but his eyes remain fixed in the future tense of the broken ending of the poem, which, like the broken wing, now stands as the textual remainder of Ken. The speaker now sees and also sees through his wounded god-eyes; they have become organs of what we might call a political seeing-as: Ken’s singular face/the installed face of feeble-mindedness. His is the face invoked by Levinas, which calls into question the sovereignty of my own face, revealing the fiction of my autonomy and freedom—the face of “the other who asks me not to let him die alone.”<a name="f36-text" href="#f36"><sup>36</sup></a></p>
<p>
  In 1844, after his mother’s institutionalization, Max Stirner, that famous precursor of modernist Egoism, tried to write about the State’s production of naked life through its carceral system. In a short passage in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Ego and His Own</span>, Stirner coins the term “un-man” to mean the man who, by being designated non-normate, defines by default the normate man. The State “excludes” the un-man; “it locks him up, or transforms him from a fellow of the State into a fellow of the prison . . . [or] the lunatic asylum or hospital.” These “[m]en that are not men, what should they be but <span style="font-style:italic;">ghosts</span>? Every real man, because he does not correspond to the concept ‘man,’ or because he is not a ‘generic man,’ is a spook.”<a name="f37-text" href="#f37"><sup>37</sup></a> Ken, we may imagine, has been designated an un-man, and will have joined the ghosts of the dis-modern asylum road that is both ancient and modern. As with “On the Asylum Road,” this poem’s anxiety about the asylum (“What happens there” when inmates aren’t docile?) fuses the past and present in the recognition that “asylum” is simply a transhistorical vehicle of control that may be justified by any number of traditional or scientific beliefs. What ends “Ken” is the trauma of a horrible recognition: “These I shall see—”.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<h1 class="sec-headA">Maisie Johnson’s Shock: “‘Horror! Horror!’ she wanted to cry”</h1>
<p>
    Trauma plays a pronounced structuring role in some strains of Woolf’s aesthetic innovations, although, as I have been suggesting, shock appears to produce for her an especially potent brand of trauma that must be managed through narrative emplotment, impersonal tone, and contextualization within broader and less harrowing encounters. In “A Sketch of the Past,” the memoir written in the last year of her life, Woolf explicitly identifies shock as the <span style="font-style:italic;">primum mobile</span> of her life’s writing; as she puts it, “the shock-receiving capacity is what makes me a writer”; one of her life lessons concerns the struggle with shock, the recognition that, however horrifying it may be, shock “is or will become a revelation of some order; it is a token of some real thing behind appearances; and I make it real by putting it into words. . . . [And so making] it whole; this wholeness means that it has lost its power to hurt me.”<a name="f38-text" href="#f38"><sup>38</sup></a> In this account, shock is the name for a transdimensional shattering of appearance. As with Freud’s model of traumatic shock, when such shattering occurs without warning, it delivers a physically palpable psychic wound that must be managed, however approximately and unconsciously, by repetition.<a name="f39-text" href="#f39"><sup>39</sup></a> In Woolf’s case, we may say, that repetition takes the form of experimental nonfiction and fiction.
  </p>
<p>
    In “A Sketch,” Woolf rehearses several raw incidents of childhood shock that interrupted her boring life of “cotton wool”: out of nowhere, and “for no reason that I know about, there [would be] a sudden violent shock; something happened so violently that I have remembered it all my life.” There is the time when, while roughhousing with her brother Thoby, she is suddenly overcome by “a feeling of hopeless sadness. It was as if I became aware of something terrible; and of my own powerlessness.” And the time when, while walking in her moonlit garden, a familiar apple tree suddenly embodies the news received that day about the suicide of a recent family guest, so that the tree itself seems to imbue the whole world with the event of the suicide, paralyzing the young Virginia in a “trance of horror” .<a name="f40-text" href="#f40"><sup>40</sup></a> And then there is the moment of shock that she “always remember[s]”—one that we will recognize no less by the style of its delivery than by its components. Midsentence she breaks into the traumatic moment when
  </p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>
      the idiot boy sprang up with his hand outstretched mewing, slit-eyed, red-rimmed; and without saying a word, with a sense of the horror in me, I poured into his hand a bag of Russian toffee. But it was not over, for that night in the bath [with Vanessa] the dumb horror came over me. Again I had that hopeless sadness; that collapse I have described before; as if I were passive under some sledge-hammer blow; exposed to a whole avalanche of meaning that had heaped itself up and discharged itself upon me, unprotected, with nothing to ward it off, so that I huddled up at my end of the bath, motionless.
    </p>
<div class="attrib">
      
    </div>
</blockquote>
<p class="continued">
      The idiot boy’s paradoxical possession of power—the power to shock both physically and psychically—is overwhelming: like the dwarf who conjures up the disrement of all before her, he hypnotizes the young Virginia without words and so quite literally transforms her into a dumb, naked, paralyzed, huddling defective. What is the “real thing behind appearances” in this shocking encounter? Is it an early version of seeing-as,  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> when the reality of the non-normate world overtakes and subsumes the illusion of concrete normality?
    </p>
<p>
      An incident in <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span> portrays this kind of “seeing-as,” or “dawning,” as it plays out in a more managed context. Near the beginning of the novel, when multiple points of subjectivity are conveyed through a series of London bystanders, nineteen-year old Maisie Johnson appears briefly in Regent’s Park. She has just arrived from Scotland and asks Rezia and Septimus Warren Smith for directions. Septimus is hallucinating and Rezia is trying to distract him, and to distract others from noticing him. “Both seemed queer, Masie Johnson thought. Everything seemed very queer.” As she walks away past a cluster of “invalids most of them in Bath chairs,” the sense of queerness grows in her, until “Maisie Johnson positively felt she must cry Oh! (for that young man on the seat had given her quite a turn. Something was up, she knew.) Horror! horror! she wanted to cry. (She had left her people; they had warned her what would happen.)” This horror amidst un-homely strangers will remain with Maisie Johnson for her entire life: the scene of “this couple on the chairs [that] gave her quite a turn; the young woman seeming foreign, the man looking queer; so that should she be very old she would still remember and make it jangle again among her memories.”<a name="f41-text" href="#f41"><sup>41</sup></a> Maisie Johnson cannot say just what has shocked her, but feels certain that what she had expected to be normal turned out to be abnormal.<a name="f42-text" href="#f42"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p>
      But why must this kind of dawning encounter produce lasting “horror”? After all, in the final pages of the novel, Richard Dalloway has his own dawning experience when he realizes that he “had not recognized” the “lovely girl”  at his party as his own daughter Elizabeth, and his delayed recognition brings them together in surprised pleasure. “Seeing-as” is not always deployed by Woolf in the service of managing her private horrors. But when it is accompanied by a sense of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Unheimlich</span>—the queer young man, the invalids haunting the edges of Regent’s Park—the experience of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Heimlich</span> itself comes under fire. To return to Freud’s writings on the subject: he says of the word <span style="font-style:italic;">heimlich</span> that it “belongs to two sets of ideas . . . : on the one hand, it means that which is familiar and congenial, and on the other, that which is concealed and kept out of sight”; thus <span style="font-style:italic;">unheimlich</span> adds not only an <span style="font-style:italic;">un-</span> but also an <span style="font-style:italic;">ought-not</span> to the private, the home-ly: “everything is uncanny that <span style="font-style:italic;">ought to have remained</span> hidden and secret, and yet comes to light.”<a name="f43-text" href="#f43"><sup>43</sup></a> Lacan goes further than this: the uncanny is that which proves the human subject’s lack of autonomy by demonstrating its contingency.<a name="f44-text" href="#f44"><sup>44</sup></a> It is, we might say, the switchpoint where the normate world crumbles before its complement. The Woolfian <span style="font-style:italic;">Unheimlich</span> is in this sense the unbuffered, unanticipated appearance in public—the coming to light—of what “certainly” ought to have remained secret and private: mental disability.
    </p>
<p>
      The horror produced by this transformation of appearance bears on conventional understandings of horror as a response to something threatening and impure, usually a mixed-up creature that uncannily breaches categories, like the living-dead, or a dog-man, or even a duck-rabbit. The threat of Woolfian horror lies in the power of the revelation—that “others” exist quite naturally among, and may even be, “us”—to engulf (one might say infect) perspective itself. Maisie Johnson doesn’t begin to feel  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> that <span style="font-style:italic;">London itself</span> is queer until her encounter with the Warren Smiths; Woolf doesn’t see the “grotesque dance” of London until her encounter with a dwarf. When one is susceptible to shock’s chain reaction of transformations, the whole world is always on the verge of becoming a place in which one is not-at-home. Consider how Septimus, fully in the throes of mental illness, is continually bearing witness to the to the world-altering power of dawning: the sight of a simple tree-like pattern triggers the “gradual drawing together of everything to one centre before his eyes, as if some horror had come almost to the surface and was about to burst into flames” . A dog begins to turn into a man (a “horrible, terrible [thing] to see” [66]); his dead friend Evan materializes as the living-dead. The threat of transformation lurks just beneath the visible world.
    </p>
<p>
      Woolf, however, is in control of Septimus’s gradual dissolution into a picture puzzle: she dwells in and pilots his consciousness, leavening his horrible visions with (increasingly rare) moments of extraordinarily beautiful sensory clarity. Though becoming mad, he remains an aesthetic conduit, a vehicle for excessive imagination, not to be confused with the “maimed file of lunatics” he encounters in the street, who “ambled and nodded and grinned past him . . . each half apologetically, yet triumphantly, inflicting his hopeless woe” .<a name="f45-text" href="#f45"><sup>45</sup></a> In killing him off, Woolf prevents his institutional descent into the condition of un-man. Yet in rescuing him from the horrors of Dr. Bradshaw, she also rescues her own imagination from the impasses of the face beyond which her aesthetics cannot and will not go. Septimus’s throbbing interiority is preserved for its next stage: it becomes a space that Mrs. Dalloway sympathetically inhabits when she learns of his suicide.
    </p>
<p>
      If mental disability—and specifically the idiocy haunting Woolf’s memoirs—delivers a “sledge-hammer blow,” it is precisely because Woolf cannot enter into or dwell in its consciousness. The face of idiocy—“mewing, slit-eyed,” and utterly incomprehensible, though full of an unknown, even sovereign, power—represents the limits of her imagination, and thus the undoing of her last, best defense against her own dissolution. The triumph of <span style="font-style:italic;">Mrs. Dalloway</span> may be a narrative consciousness that “glides into the recesses of the heart . . . dispers[ing] itself” like “a bee with honey”—or, as Hillis Miller once put it, “a perfect transparency of the minds of the characters to the mind of the narrator”—but its nemesis is an alien face that stops consciousness cold.<a name="f46-text" href="#f46"><sup>46</sup></a> The power of this face to command without words, to paralyze, to conjure an opposite world, represents not only the shock-delivering arrest of her otherwise penetrating imagination, but the delimiting of the reach of self-reflexive thought. One may plan (heroically) to kill Septimus in order to save him from the Foucauldian nightmare of the institution, while at the same time wishing death upon “defectives” for their insufficient institutionalization. Surely Woolf recognizes the violence of this ethical contradiction on some level, for the idiot boy remains with her to the end of her life, in both his real, tactile form, with hand outstretched, and as an enigma haunting the bestial face that she dreams about in the <span style="font-style:italic;">mise en abyme</span> of a hall mirror.<a name="f47-text" href="#f47"><sup>47</sup></a> He is her <span style="font-style:italic;">frère</span>, her <span style="font-style:italic;">sembable</span>.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>

	  The traditional view associating speech/voice with authentic self-presence is precisely the starting point for the deconstructive turn to textuality. The traditional assumption shapes Rousseau’s adduction of speech as the constitutive cornerstone for the human subject, for example. See Jean-Jacques Rousseau, “Discourse on the Origin of Inequality,” in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Basic Political Writings</span>, trans. Donald A. Cress, intr. Peter Gay (Indianapolis, IN: Kackett, 1987), 25–111, especially 47–50.

Nussbaum in <span style="font-style:italic;">Frontiers of Justice: Disability, Nationality, Species Membership</span> (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2007), both of whom aim to disassemble the dominant Kantian conception of personhood (associated with reason and moral rationality) in order to reconceive personhood as a condition of human potential for which degrees of ability are essentially irrelevant.

	  Agamben links this condition of civil death (his more elaborately historicized equivalent is <span style="font-style:italic;">homo sacer</span>—he who may be killed without consequence) to Carl Schmitt’s idea that sovereign power must remain outside the law in order to enforce civil law, or, in the case of an arbitrarily assessed “state of emergency,” to suspend it. Schmitt notoriously supported the concept of (Nazi) dictatorship, but his “state of emergency” has been useful—to Agamben, at least—for understanding that the suspension of protective law depends upon and in turn justifies the categorical cancellation of political subjecthood for certain groups of people. And when one considers the circulation, described by Foucault, of the much weaker (though ubiquitous) emanations of biopower from local sites within liberal bureaucracies in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, one may see how those local sites of specialized, bureaucratized power could suspend (internal) law through self-adjudicating “states of emergency” whose conditions were necessarily opaque to larger regulatory apparatuses. For our purposes, these would include not only the “inside” of individual asylums or asylum systems but also the MDA’s “outside” Board of Control and its newly established Local Authorities, whose job it became to allocate local funding and to ensure that the feeble-minded in local communities were brought to the attention of asylum officers.

	  Joseph Bristow has argued convincingly for Mew’s modernism on related, though more persona-driven grounds: her poems, he writes, “exert themselves in defamiliarizing, and thus modernizing, well-established genre[s] that her speakers have no further wish to inhabit.” I am suggesting a shift from his focus on the speaker to the manipulation of history through genre.

	Mew was certainly aware of the contemporary debates about the status of “defectives.” She tells Harold Monro in a letter that “Ken” (a companion poem to “On the Asylum Road” that I will discuss presently) was rejected for publication by editors who “believed in the segregation of the feeble-minded” (cited in Fitzgerald, <span style="font-style:italic;">Charlotte Mew and Her Friends</span>, 47).

	  Leonard Woolf later collected “Street Haunting” in the posthumous “<span style="font-style:italic;">The Death of the Moth” and Other Essays</span> (New York: Harcourt Brace, 1942), 20–36. Woolf criticism abounds with thematic readings of “Street Haunting”: Rachel Bowlby deftly centers the essay in her influential critique of  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the masculine re of the <span style="font-style:italic;">flaneur</span>; on this reading, “Street Haunting” illustrates Woolf’s simultaneous participation in and transgression of the (gendered) assumptions of a cultural practice linked closely to aesthetic innovation. In general, most accounts of “Street Haunting” follow this model: Leslie Kathleen Hankins argues that “the streets provided [Woolf with] an open public space—in some ways the towerless and classless utopian vision she later espoused,” while for Makiko Minow-Pinkney, the essay “explores positively and even celebrates the dissolution of the self in the experience of the <span style="font-style:italic;">flaneur</span>.” Because of my focus linking the essay’s aesthetics with the theoretical implications of disability in modernity, my reading is anchored in those scenes where disability exceeds the essay’s aesthetic capacities.

	  The re of the Jew in this passage is part of a constellation of Woolf’s references to Jews that has drawn sustained attention from critics exploring her shifting treatments of race and class across the breadth of her oeuvre. See, for example, Merry M. Pawlowski, <span style="font-style:italic;">Virginia Woolf and Fascism: Resisting the Dictators’ Seduction</span> (New York: St. Martin’s, 2002); and Maren Linett, “The Jew in the Bath: Imperiled Imagination in Woolf’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The Years</span>,” <span style="font-style:italic;">Modern Fiction Studies</span> 48, no. 2 : 341–61. By contrast, I’m interested in his “wild” face of misery because of its sudden emergence from a hitherto undifferentiated world that subtends the “London Adventure” of the essay’s subtitle.
	</p></div>
<div class="fn"><p><a name="f35" href="#f35-text">35. </a>
	One strand of Bowlby’s multifaceted reading of this scene proposes that “[t]he ‘derelicts’ freely ‘choose’ their position, and it is to them that ‘commerce offers’ its exhibition. They are not beggars but ideal consumers” .

	  Woolf includes among these formative moments a scene in which a flower bed suddenly becomes “the whole,” “part earth, part flower” (“Sketch,” 71). In <span style="font-style:italic;">The Feminist Aesthetics of Virginia Woolf: Modernism, Post-Impressionism and the Politics of the Visual</span> (Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press, 1998), Jane Goldman provides an insightful account of the three moments together: “For Woolf where reason overcomes sensation, satisfaction results; but where reason fails and sensation dominates, she finds despair. She abhors the submission of mind to body (subject to object)” . Goldman’s monograph traces with great nuance the aesthetic transformations that Woolf’s memories undergo between genres—between, say, a journal entry and an essay, or between an essay and a work of fiction.
