Music fills the streets of the New Germany.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
<I>Stra&szlig;enmusik,</I> or "street music," is everywhere to be
heard. On a given day in virtually any German city with a population
greater than one hundred thousand, one can encounter an array of
performance sites separated from each other by, perhaps, one hundred
feet, a distance sufficient to prevent the performances of one group
from interfering with those of another. On this same day, the musicians
performing would surely represent various mixtures of Andean pan-pipe
music, a Slavic folk-music troupe, a youthful chamber trio from the
local music academy, Roma or Sinti musicians assuming various guises,
an American with a guitar and minimal stock of songs from the 1950s and
1960s folk-music revival, and a desperate-looking German in a wheelchair,
playing a cassette recorder as a musical instrument. After one has spent
some time in German cities, it may well seem that music is a permanent
fixture; the Andean pan-pipe ensembles are everywhere; so too is Irish
folk music in one form or another. Street musicians, nevertheless, are
mobile, and many travel from city to city so that they might find new
audiences, ready for new sounds and new entertainment.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Passersby respond to this street music in different ways. Some listen
intently, particularly to the most foreign and exotic music, or to the
youthful prodigies from the music academy. If the musical performance
is not particularly accomplished or the musicians present a rather
ragged-looking front, pedestrians march quickly by, looking with an
intense nervousness in another direction, but usually still dropping
some coins in the hat or guitar case on the sidewalk.

<B></B>

For the
most part, street musicians earn well from their performances. They are
sensitive to the flow of pedestrian traffic and rarely situate themselves
in such a way that they intrude upon the coming and going along the
street. To intrude physically with pedestrian traffic would also bring
them into conflict both with the merchants, whose shops are the eventual
goal of the pedestrians, and with the police, whose responsibility it
is to maintain orderliness. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that
street music has come to provide one of the ways with which German
cities represent and disseminate their own public images. Street music
makes the city a pleasant place to visit and to shop, to enjoy and to
be entertained.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Other musical traditions frequently inflect this soundscape, and the
exact mixture of tra-ditions usually indicates shifting public attitudes
toward the ways in which the city represents the past and present. In
the New Germany, these shifting public attitudes are evident in the
growing presence of foreignness, not just the Slavic troupes from
Eastern Europe, which have increased markedly in number during the
past four years, but in the repertories drawn from Jewish and Turkish
traditions. These repertories transform the streets because they are
musics to be listened to, not just heard.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 They direct the
flow of pedestrian traffic and the pace with which foreignness can be
released from the narratives of the past and integrated into the struggle
to build a multicultural present.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Street music is no single musical style or repertory, but rather a sound
mix from the past and present, which also cuts across national, ethnic,
and racial borders. Street music is also not simply an international
phenomenon. If the mix of repertories suggests a sort of world music,
a global potpourri played and played out for a society capable of
connecting itself to cultures throughout the world, closer observation
and listening fix instead on the German-ness of the conditions that make
this modern street music possible. Political themes in many German songs
are local; others refer directly to the problems inherent in Germany's
growing political presence in a Europe struggling with union on one hand
and resurgent nationalism on the other. The local is evident also in the
songs of those who sing in dialect or in foreign-language repertories from
across the borders. In these ways, street music marks and remarks upon
many of the conditions that have made the New Germany possible and that
establish the historical connections between the New Germany and its past.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The modernity that <I>Stra&szlig;enmusik</I> represents is
unavoidable. The modern German city is not a complex of simply streets,
but of streets converted to <I>Fu&szlig;g&auml;ngerzonen,</I> or
"pedestrian zones." It is as if the twentieth-century German equivalent
of Walter Benjamin's Parisian arcades is the pedestrian zone.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
The twentieth century, in fact, has necessitated the German pedestrian
zone, which replaced many of the streets of the inner city destroyed
during World War II; it is as if the pedestrian zone is a monument to
the past, at once given meaning by and establishing routine with the
rhythm of pedestrians going about their business.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 In the
German pedestrian zone, the aural replaces the visual, mapping the urban
German land-scape with sound.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 The pedestrian must negotiate
this landscape not as the fl&acirc;neur, choosing the route according
to whim or fancy, but rather as the good B&uuml;rger, following those
paths that map out the route, that routinize the everyday.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
If the soundscape possesses the qualities of everyday experience, its
individual com-ponents, nevertheless, are highly differentiated in the

New Germany. The musicians whose aural domains continually reconfigure
the street and the historical stage it creates for the everyday represent
vastly different musical traditions. The street is not the only stage
on

<B></B>

which these new forms of foreignness have emerged to contest
the modern German cultural landscape. A Yiddish folk-song revival and
the mass production of Turkish music have increasingly benefited from
an expanded market and media interest in the past decade. The bins in
German record stores overflow with Yiddish CDs and cassettes, most of
them made by young Germans, but many of them productions of "historical
recordings," remastered artifacts and rare recordings recuperated as
documents of pre-Holocaust Europe.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 For many Germans this music
memorializes "their" Jewish past. This past, however, never existed,
at least in Germany, where Yiddish was never a modern vernacular and
Jewish <I>klezmer</I> music was never more than an exotic import from
Eastern Europe.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 These attempts do serve as modern versions
of previous music histories, for example those that yielded earlier
Yiddish folk-song revivals (e.g., at the turn of the century and during
the 1920s).
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 The revival of Yiddish folk song sustains itself
as another form of memorializing the past.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The growing presence of Turkish music in Germany depends on a different
transform-ation of the cultural landscape, an implosion from within
that has necessarily spilled over to the public sphere. Turkish music
initially entered German intellectual history together with orientalist
passions, the poetry of Goethe, notably <I>West-&ouml;stlicher
Divan,</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 as well as music historical writings, the
best-known of which was Raphael Georg Kiesewetter's <I>Die Musik
der Araber,</I> which despite its name was based largely on Turkish
sources.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 The music of new Turkish musicians, however, is not
the same as that imagined by the orientalist, but rather a modern popular
music, which chronicles the experiences of <I>Gastarbeiter</I> (guest
workers), who keep Germany's industrial machinery running but remain
suspended between the cultures of two worlds. The Turkish music that
fills Turkish-German television and appears in new published and recorded
anthologies is by no means a revival; like its earlier incarnation, it
depends on a modernity born of the expansion of industry in a country
whose own population is unable to provide a sufficient work-force to
keep the assembly lines moving. Denied German citizenship, Turkish guest
workers have become an irreplaceable cog in Germany modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Modernity and foreignness are therefore inseparable from the street music
of the New Germany. The conditions that undergird street music are the
same as those that conflate modernity and foreignness, while rendering
their relationship uneasy: their cohabitation in the music of the city is
an unsettling reminder of the past. Modernity, as I wish to examine it
in this essay, arises because of the particular ways in which past and
present are connected.

<B></B>

Through musical performance, a composition
from the past or a song that signifies an event of the past enters the
present. In addition to connecting past and present, music also exhibits
the capacity to embody difference, hence the foreignness that penetrates
German modern-ity. I should also wish to argue in this essay that German
modernity, like German street music, is not simply an international
phenomenon or another version of globalization. German modernity depends,
so I shall argue, on the specific ways in which the present can index
the past; music--especially street music--renders these ways specific.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Street music creates venues in which the past is contested and
challenges traditionalized notions of music's ability to convey
identity--particularly the intractable presence of Germanness, the will
to rediscover the nationalism that has reproduced tragedy so effectively
throughout the past two centuries. It is precisely in street music,
moreover, that the constructed distinctions between folk, popular, and
&eacute;lite music come undone, for it is a music that singles out no
one audience, but rather invites all to listen. This, too, is a condition
of modernity in the New Germany. Modernity has historically undergirded
the arts in Germany. "New music," that is, "musical modernism," receives
considerable financial support from public coffers, and the production
of modern music in centers such as Darmstadt and at festivals such as
Donaueschingen thrives in unparalleled fashion. During the past decade new
musical practices have proliferated in Germany, reestablishing connections
to more troubling moments in the German past and undergirding modernity in
its generation of German history. The places in which one finds these new
musical practices assume many forms and create diverse publics. In fact,
these new musical practices would seem to mirror many different Germanies.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The insistent presence of modernity in public musical practices not only
makes the proliferation of Germanies possible, but also reifies them
through forms of performance that connect past and present. Music played
out before the public may narrate that past as if it were the present. It
therefore is of only secondary importance whether the history narrated
by music recreates a moment of Reformation history, the wedding dances
played by a Jewish <I>klezmer</I> ensemble, or the songs of Peruvian
migrant workers. Such musics are performed on many different stages in
Germany and attract diverse audiences. These audiences may well be an
&eacute;lite, concert-going public; they may well be shoppers negotiating
the pedestrian zone. I should like to argue here, in fact, that it is
characteristic of German modernity that music challenges many different
publics to confront the presence of foreignness in Germany in the past
and present.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The <I>Stra&szlig;enmusik</I> of the New Germany embodies what initially
seems like the ineluctable contradictions of modernity, the juxtaposition
of tradition and contemporaneity, of folk music and the technologies
of modern music. Music itself--as a performative art--makes these
contradictions possible, for it so effectively uses the present to
index the past. It is impossible to shake the burden of the past from
music, and yet each performance reflects the conditions that made it
possible. The <I>Stra&szlig;enmusik</I> of the New Germany is therefore
no more separable from the revivals of invented traditions or the
steady production of German automobiles than from the busy traffic of
pedestrians, whose affluence and engagement with music are necessary for
the financial support of musical performance of all kinds, in the concert
hall or on the street. If indeed sharp political differences separate
the German from the street musician, the performance of music unites
them.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 German street music, moreover, has

<B></B>

historically
been at base political, and hence transforms the pedestrian zone into
a site for the contestation of contemporary problems. That resulting
sense of expectation, nevertheless, is not at base political but rather
apolitical, ameliorated by the long history of <I>Stra&szlig;enmusik</I>
in Central Europe.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The contradictions of modernity embodied by street music are at once
immediately apparent and immediately displaced from the moment of
its production. The resurgence of Jewish, Turkish, and other musics
representing foreignness during the past decade conveys the immediacy of a
persistent problem confronting Germany throughout the twentieth century:
namely the presence of non-Germans on its soil. At various historical
moments, these non-Germans have borne the designations of different
"races" <I>(Rassen)</I> or the somewhat more neutral designations
of different "peoples" <I>(V&ouml;lker).</I> Their differences,
nevertheless, demanded that they occupy special places in German society
and history. These places, when properly maintained, can mask and hide
the conflicts of race, yet history has dictated a repetition of the same
acts of displacement, necessitating repeated forms of deracination, that
is, of excluding foreignness from notions of Germanness. Contemporary
<I>Stra&szlig;enmusik</I> is one of the most recent, most public, and
most modern of such forms.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The entangled interrelations of music, modernity, and foreignness not
only symbolize but have become a simulacrum for the presence of the
modern pedestrian zone in Germany. In this essay I wish to interrogate
this entanglement, adopting a rhetorical strategy that reflects the
contradictory ways in which one negotiates the pedestrian zone itself. We
shall move, therefore, from site to site, from performance to performance,
not so much to prove that we can unravel the fabric of modernity or that
we have solutions for the troubling responses to racism and foreignness in
German history. Instead, the musical performances we shall encounter here
will represent the conditions of modernity that make this entanglement
possible. We shall confront modernity, then, as we would in the New
Germany, as an every-day experience, whose components, nonetheless, are
anything but everyday.

<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
<!--_/attribution-->
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
German artists and intellectuals consciously began to cultivate the
concept of modernity <I>(die Moderne)</I> at the end of the nineteenth
century. Imbuing the concept with revolutionary potential, these artists
and intellectuals, such as Heinrich Hart, one of the ideologues of
the so-called Berliner Moderne, moved modernity to the streets of the
city. Formed first from a sense of rejecting the past, the new aesthetic
of modernity encountered foreignness on the streets, a foreignness
formed out of the migration from rural areas to the city, and out of
immigration to the city, largely of Eastern European ethnic groups. The
city, in turn, became a context for modernity, but this context mixed in
various forms of foreign culture represented by new residents and new
communities. Modernity, therefore, assumed no single form in Berlin,
Munich, or Hamburg, but instead reflected the flux and complex bricolage
that an expanding urban population fostered.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 Berlin
guidebooks even took pains

<B></B>

to publicize the city's modernity as
multicultural, publishing statistics that listed the different national
origins of its new residents, proclaiming at the end of one such set of
statistics that "the main railway terminals were situated in such ways
that the foreigner <I>[der Fremde]</I> will find himself immediately
caught up in the swirl of the gigantic city."
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 Modernity
thus assumed local forms, which encouraged Jewish and Eastern European
intellectuals to regard Berlin as the site for establishing new forms
of artistic production, even those with political ends.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The new modernity also signaled a liberation of the many places in
which the arts were produced and displayed or performed, were made
public. On one hand, these places were physical, the lecture halls
of the universities that Heinrich Hart and his colleagues avoided,
or the institutions that canonized the artistic production of late
romanticism. On the other hand, these places were temporal, for it
was a liberation from history--the oppressive spaces carved out by
Hegel and Heinrich von Treitschke, occupied by "historical peoples"
<I>(Geschichtsv&ouml;lker)--</I>that provided the essential literary
impulse for aesthetic modernity. The processes of liberation, however
differently they were construed, nevertheless ran head-on into the
contradictions of modernity. Munich poets, such as Ludwig Thoma,
adapted modernity to dialect and to the forms of folk literature (e.g.,
"D'Marie," the eponymous poetic narrative of a waitress), and criticized
the foreignness that increasingly characterized Munich.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
In contrast, non-Germans played an important role in staking out new
aesthetic turf, for example, Vassily Kandinsky, through his seminal
position in the Blaue Reiter movement, and Arnold Schoenberg, through
his break with tonality in music and his position as aesthetician for the
so-called New Viennese School. Both Kandinsky and Schoenberg, moreover,
tempered their modernism with folk and popular traditions, Kandinsky
with folk Catholicism and Schoenberg with cabaret.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The contradictions in turn-of-the-century modernity were by no means
isolated phenom-ena in German intellectual history. German science,
too, concerned itself, at times obses-sively, with the definition of
progress, one of several conditions giving way to modernity, through
its dialectical relation to <I>Rasse</I> and <I>Volk.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
By the beginning of the twentieth century, these terms were essential
to the understanding of difference. <I>Rasse</I> might mean "species,"
used for example to describe different animal species. When describing
humans, <I>Rasse</I> referred at one level to biological differences, but
at another to the distinctive ways in which peoples created culture. Such
terminology was totally scientistic in its capacity to parse the world
into meaningful differences.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Progress and modernity in music, too, relied on this scientism. Central
European music-ologists conflated racial difference and teleological
history, "heredity and development" as Richard Wallaschek referred
to them, demonstrating unequivocally that the greatness of modern
German music was an inevitable component of the culmination of world
history.
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>
 Central Europeans epitomized what German folk
song scholars such as Werner Danckert called <I>Geschichtsv&ouml;lker,</I>
or "people with history," whereas other Europeans represented the
<I>Randv&ouml;lker,</I> the "people at the edges," that is, "marginal
people."
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 By the turn of the century, however, the borders
between edges and history were collapsing, confronting peoples with or
without history with the conditions of musical modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The measurement of racial and ethnic differences in music continued
during the course of the twentieth century.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 The exact
balance between biological and cultural explanations of these musical
differences shifted and continues to shift, sometimes politically
correct, at

<B></B>

other times not. Quantification relies on observable
phenomena in the music itself--harmony, as the supreme achievement
of a people with history--but also on the proximity of musical to
language structure. Seemingly neutral classificatory judgments connect
music to place, privileging those repertories and genres that are
<I>bodenst&auml;ndig,</I> "rooted in the soil." The pedestrian zone, in
contrast, offers little chance of rooting musical traditions in soil; its
musicians are clearly without history, perpetually in need of seeking
out new places in which to perform modern musics, whose timelessness
confuses its relation to history.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1933, the new National Socialist government of Germany conceived of a
cultural ghetto, in which all Jews in the major cities of Germany would
be forced to live: the <I>J&uuml;discher Kulturbund.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
The <I>Kulturbund</I> presented Jews with a new dilemma, for its aim
was to prevent them from interacting with Germans in the cultural life
of urban Germany; Jewish artistic life was to be isolated. That these
new laws arose for racial reasons is obvious, but they also resulted
from a German response to modernism in the arts, with which Jews were
explicitly connected (or for which they were blamed). Jewish students
would be blocked from attending German universities, and Jewish orchestral
musicians would no longer be able to play with non-Jewish colleagues
in symphony or opera orchestras. There was an alternative, however,
namely the possibility of building up an entirely Jewish cultural
life; indeed, this was the only alternative. In the early years
of the <I>Kulturbund,</I> the alternative, even though greeted with
skepticism and bitterness, unleashed a flurry of cultural activity and
organization. Jewish orchestras and Jewish theater flourished; Jewish
publishers (e.g., Schocken in Berlin) expanded their lists; evidence of
a modern Jewish aesthetic in the arts began to take shape.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The landscape of the <I>Kulturbund,</I> soon synonymous with the
cityscape of Jewish Berlin, quickly acquired the contradictions of
modernity. The means of artistic production depended on the city,
literally on the possibilities of negotiating the streets of Berlin in
order to reach a concert or theatrical performance. The alternative
of creating Jewishness in music or in the other arts unsettled the
urbane culture of the German-Jewish community. At one level, it was
an alternative that Jewish intellectuals and artists had rejected, for
example when polemically voiced by the anti-Semitic Richard Wagner. At
another level, there was little consensus what a Jewish music was, what
its fundamental melodic and formal structure were, and where its modern
institutional venues were. The efforts to create a Jewish culture in the
German city were ironically successful, with sold-out concert seasons and
ambitious artistic experiments of all kinds documenting the transformed
Jewish neighborhoods in the German city. By <I>Kristallnacht</I> in
November 1938, the boundaries of these neighborhoods again collapsed,
ultimately during the Holocaust destroying those who failed to escape. The
destruction of

<B></B>

this German-Jewish cultural space was paradoxical,
for in fact a history of Jewish aesthetic modernity had formed and had
subverted the possibility of a German modernity without Jewishness in
music.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In 1992, the <I>Kulturbund</I> again made an appearance in Berlin,
historicized and memorialized by exhibits at the Akademie der K&uuml;nste
in Berlin.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
 A half-century later, the experiments that
transformed the public spaces of Jewish Berlin had been reduced to the
semipublic spaces of the exhibit, fixed in history because of their overt
foreignness. Even within contemporary German historicism, it is difficult
to know what to do with the artistic activities of the <I>Kulturbund,</I>
for the theaters and concert halls in which they took place--often, but
not exclusively synagogues--no longer exist, nor can they be revivified
by new performances. New histories--modern histories--have accrued in
the streets that once connected the performances of the <I>Kulturbund</I>
orchestra to the synagogues and

<B></B>

libraries of the 1930s. Defined at
that time by those who passed along them, these streets have different
meanings today. It is only through different cultural routes that
musicians in the 1990s can represent the modern Jewish music of the 1930s.

German folk song demonstrates a seemingly obsessive concern with
place. Images of place yield entire genres, notably the <I>Heimatlied,</I>
the "song of the homeland." Folk song differ-entiates regions through
their specific histories and dialects. The song of the alpine meadow is
no less characteristic of the folk-song canon than the urban broadside
ballad, sung from printed leaflets on the street and purchased by
passersby for their own entertainment at home. The musical connection
between language and place is central to that canon, so it is hardly
surprising that folk song does far more than describe the places
and regions of the German cultural landscape. Many songs, in fact,
symbolically bind regions on the cultural map, establishing the conditions
for their maintenance and even for their defense. The well-known "Wacht
am Rhein" ("Watch on the Rhine") and its many variants provide one of
the clearest calls to action, should the enemies of Germany challenge
its western border, which the Rhine forms, at least for a few hundred
miles in southwestern Germany. The Rhine, as a signifier of Germany, is
the subject of countless other folk songs, as well as composed musical
works, ranging from the Heine-Silcher "Die Lorelei" to Wagner's <I>Das
Rheingold.</I> Its musical monumentality derives in no small measure
from the danger that its loss would mean for Germany.

<B></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Rhine River, in effect, maps diverse conditions of Germanness. Folk
songs and operas alike fetishize the river's history, representing it
through performance as a means of mem-orializing the past. In "Wacht
am Rhein," it is the confrontation with France over Alsace-Lorraine
that enters popular history. The physical monuments that line its
shores--inscribed in the experiences of thousands of tourists each
year, usually with the mnemonic assistance of loudspeakers blaring "Die
Lorelei" or "Wacht am Rhein"--undergird what the river repre-sents in
the German historical imagination. Again, the performative quality of
music represents, and even monumentalizes, the past in remarkably flexible
ways. The historically controversial "Deutschlandlied," still the national
anthem of Germany, utilizes a melody, itself perhaps a Croatian folk
melody, that was adapted by an Austrian composer (Franz Joseph Haydn) in
the service of the Hungarian court (Esterh&aacute;zy). Its monumentality,
never-theless, is obvious, for countless historical experiences have
become interwoven into the song through its performances in string
quartets, Protestant hymns, Olympic games, concentra-tion camps, and
films about World War II.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Music and monuments often function together in the reproduction of
the past as present in Germany.
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 Busts of great composers
line concert halls, and musical auditoriums of all kinds occupy a
central position of particular social and political importance. The
late nine-teenth-century obsession with massive form in German romantic
music coincides precisely with the mass production of physical monuments
in Germany.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 This parallel between monuments and music
results from indirect associations, for the two refer to the past in
quite different ways. Oskar Negt and Alexander Kluge argue that the
history-making potential of monuments resides on their surfaces, whereas
in fact at a deeper level in the monument history has only an impoverished
representation.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 Song, in contrast, possesses an internal
capacity to reproduce history through performance, whereas its surface
qualities (e.g., the melody of the "Deutschlandlied," which covers and
allows very different texts) can only incompletely represent history
because the meaning of the surface depends entirely on the experience
of the listener. Music and monuments therefore complement each other.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One of the modern sites in the New Germany where music and monuments
function most effectively in this respect is the street. On its surface,
the pedestrian zone is itself a monument, often memorializing the past
that was destroyed by bombing in World War II. Other monuments punctuate
the surface of the pedestrian zone, however, memorializing city founders

or reporting the former residence of a cultural or political figure once
occupying a building on this site. The Holocaust monument, too, has
become an omnipresent historical trope in the German city,
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
ironically conflicting with other monuments to the fallen soldiers of
past wars, also ubiquitous in German cities. Street music, in quite
different ways, erects temporary monuments. Passersby pause to listen,
but also to gaze upon a performance fixed against the backdrop of the
street. The street musician provides a fluid monumentality, moving from
day to day to different spots along his or her routes (figs. 4 and 5);
those who fail to move also fail to maximize their potential earnings
and to curry the favors of shop owners who alternatively benefit from
and tire of musicians near the doors of their shops.
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
 Street
music may acquire a radical potential to reconfigure the public sphere,
to alter its meanings as different groups occupy and aim to use it as
a space in which to demonstrate their different social and political
agendas. The modernity of the music itself opens the public sphere to
precisely such reconfiguration.

<!--_/b-head-->
</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Song has provided German workers with one of the most powerful
forms of resistance. At once organizing laborers into action
and voicing their discontent with the machines of modernity, the
workers' song (Arbeiterlied) has become a genre unto itself in modern
Germany.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 As such, the workers' song embodies and conveys
German history, particularly the history of resistance against authority,
which since the 1930s has often been so con-structed as paralleling and
undergirding "democratic" and "revolutionary" history. Implicit in these
historical streams, channeled by the working class, is an empowerment
of the worker to take charge of history. Not surprisingly, then, the
major folk-music anthology of the German Democratic Republic, Wolfgang
Steinitz's Deutsche Volkslieder demokratischen Charakters aus sechs
Jahrhunderten, cast the history of the German people as one of struggle
chronicled by song.
<SUP><a NAME="REF33" HREF="#FOOT33">33</a></SUP>

<B></B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The historicizing potential of folk song was by no means a trope found
only in the former East Germany. At the local level, workers' choruses
emerged in the early nineteenth century as the standard bearers for
a sweeping folk-song movement, and by the twentieth century these
local organizations often shaped their repertories to chronicle the
struggle between modernity and the individual at the local level. Labor
movements had the power to organize the local at a global level, and to
this end they employed songbooks as means of fostering an aesthetic and
political lingua franca. The songs of these labor movements migrated from
songbook to songbook and from chorus to chorus, yielding an aesthetic
solidarity. Songs such as the "Moorlied" quickly came to unite the
local and the international. Composed in 1933 by Rudi Goguel and set
to texts by a miner named Esser
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 and Wolfgang Langhoff in
Papenburg, one of the first concentration camps, primarily for members of
the Communist Party, by 1935 the "Moorlied" had become an international
symbol of revolution. As concentration camps multiplied, both in number
and in their capacity to imprison diverse

<B></B>

groups of individuals
posing an imagined threat to the German nation, so too did the "Moorlied"
return to the local level, where it circulated in the oral traditions
of virtually every camp. After the Holocaust, the "Moorlied" became a
specifically national symbol for the struggle against fascism, for the
most part losing, however, its local and international currencies.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The political nature of the workers' song serves it well as part of a
musical repertory for the street. Individual songs may be topical--that
is, local and specific to the political moment--but they may also rely
on the public's knowledge of standard repertories.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Analyses
of

<B></B>

the repertories of individual street singers, at least those who
fashion themselves as <I>Liedermacher</I> (singer-songwriters), reveal
these repertories to signify diverse forms of resistance.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 On
one hand, the street seems to be an unlikely site for songs from workers'
movements or political protest, which, after all, reflect little of the
spirit that shoppers and tourists invest in their walks. On the other
hand, the street has been the primary site of resistance--aesthetic and
political--throughout much of modern German history.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The struggle of workers against modernity has not disappeared from the New
Germany, if indeed a new worker, the <I>Gastarbeiter,</I> is carrying it
forth. The nature of that struggle has changed, or rather the foreignness
that symbolizes it has changed. The music of neither singer-songwriter
nor street musician has abandoned this struggle. Wolf Biermann, the
most famous German contemporary singer-songwriter, utilizes Turkish
musicians and musical styles in some songs, while elsewhere adapting
Yiddish songs to his personal style.
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 The expectations
of listeners accustomed to his aesthetic of resistance, therefore,
conflate <I>Arbeiter</I> and <I>Gastarbeiter</I> in Biermann's songs,
as well as in the rock music accompanying the public demonstrations
protesting the violence against Turkish guest workers and their
families. Resistance--historical and modern--enters the songs of the
street, making them sites for the contestation that inevitably takes
place on the street.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
No single leitmotif pervades German folk song as extensively and as
malleably as <I>Heimat,</I> in the strictest sense, "home," but in the
folk imagination and usage, "homeland." <I>Heimatlieder,</I> "songs of
the homeland," evoke conflicting senses of the homeland to which one is
bound and the homeland for which one longs. Regional and nationalistic
songs remain at base <I>Heimatlieder,</I> and they usually fill volumes
designated as such. German emigrant folk-song repertories generally
privilege <I>Heimatlieder,</I> which refer not to a New World, but to the
Old World, the homeland left behind. For German-speaking communities of
Eastern Europe, forced to return to Germany after the defeat in World War
II, <I>Heimatlieder</I> historicize the homeland left behind--villages
in Romania, Poland, or Russia--not the homeland, Germany, to which they
are bound by German bloodline.
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 The song of the homeland
represents a place perennially German, at once recuperating that place
and rendering it an historical presentness.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is not by coincidence that <I>Heimatlieder</I> are folk songs, for
the pair <I>Volk</I> and <I>Heimat</I> provides one of the most cloying
tropes in popular German historiography.
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 The folk are
inseparable from their homeland; one defines the other. Other conceptual
pairs often take up and then modify the trope of folk and homeland,
perhaps the best-known of which is <I>Blut und Boden,</I> "blood and
land," one of the slogans justifying German expansion during World War
II. These conceptual pairs inevitably anchor race to place; that is,
they equate Germany with the land occupied by Germans. The Banat region
of Romania or Silesia in Poland becomes German because Germans lived
there, transforming place through their presence. <I>Heimatlieder</I> make
history portable, reinventing the connection between race and place with
each performance, regardless of its venue. Songs of the homeland are,
moreover, geographically specific, for they catalogue local events and
places, the local landscape and local customs. This historical mapping
is deeply encoded in the song itself; a melody, for example, may index
the homeland, even if texts sometime change.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Songs of the homeland are by no means limited to dialect regions,
emigrant Germans, or resettled Eastern European Germans. "Du getto
main," a Yiddish folk song from the Vilna ghetto, possesses all the
traits necessary for a <I>Heimatlied,</I> not only because of its direct
use of typical themes and vocabulary, but also because it localizes the
history and events of a specific <I>Heimat.</I> That it parodies the
story of ghetto residents who must steal food is possible only because
German- and Yiddish-speaking Jews during the early twentieth century had
transformed the ghetto into a central symbol for the place occupied by
Jewish communities confronting modernity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>
 The ghetto song
was at first not a folk song, for it did not derive from oral tradition
in the <I>shtetl,</I> but rather from the migration to the city, where
Jews became laborers in a rapidly industrializing society. The ghetto was
a modern space, defined by the streets of the city and the life on those
streets.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>
 The ghetto song was therefore about accommodating
the dilemma of foreignness fostered by modern society. The homeland of
the ghetto song represented this dilemma, situating race again in the
repertories of German folk and popular music and in German modernity.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The German city has less willingly yielded itself to the formation
of other homelands since World War II. Resettlement problems have
taken precedence over the remapping of urban spaces to accommodate a
multicultural society. Historical memory seems, instead, to be afflicted

<B></B>

by amnesia, forgetting about Jewish quarters in the German cities,
such as the Scheunenviertel in Berlin, or about the various ghetto-like
juxtapositions of race and place during the Third Reich, whether these
were putatively cultural, as in the <I>J&uuml;discher Kulturbund,</I>
or political, as in the concentration camp. The Kreuzberg district in
Berlin, nevertheless, contains one of the largest Turkish communities in
the world, and refugees seeking asylum occupy barracks abandoned since
1989 by the American, French, English, Canadian, and Soviet occupation
forces. The new <I>Randv&ouml;lker,</I> "marginal people," inhabit new
margins, namely those of the city, reconfiguring also the urban modernity
built previously by the <I>Geschichtsv&ouml;lker,</I> by those "people
with history." The irony persists that <I>Volk</I> and <I>Heimat</I>
remain coupled, but that songs now contest the homeland available or
not available for foreigners in the New Germany.

Excursus 3--The Circus as Musical <I>Heimat</I> for Foreignness
<!--_/b-head-->
</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Elaborate circus posters bedeck the walls, bus stops, and billboards
of all German cities throughout the summer. Circuses take place
during other parts of the year, but it is in the summer that they
are most mobile and can move quickly from city to city, from village
festival to urban extravaganza. Whether or not the circus possesses
specifically German qualities is moot, though many would claim this to
be the case;
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 circuses consciously represent themselves
as international, even as stages on which the world's diversity is
put on display. The German circus--or the circus in Germany--does, in
fact, put rather particular German passions on display. Not least among
these is the modern version of the "Wild West Show," much beloved at
the end of the nineteenth century, when Wild Bill Cody brought his to
Germany, staging it even before the gaze of Kaiser Wilhelm II. The Wild
West, particu-larly with its "cowboys and Indians," became a greater
fascination in the German popular imagination through the stories of
Karl May, whose novels--in department-store editions or multitudinous
movies--are well known to all German readers. The modern German circus
has transformed the literary theme of the Wild West to a grand form of
spectatorship and located it in the center ring.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The German circus poster on the street announces that a circus is in
town, using the head of an Indian chief stylized according to the popular
imagination. The same poster announces that other forms of foreignness
will be placed on display, contributing to a seductive international
flavor. Visiting the German circus, one is not disappointed: the sights
and sounds of the world and of multiculturalism, in its most fantastic
guise, are redolent in the atmosphere of the big top.
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Under the big top itself, the Wild West Show unfolds in narrative fashion,
as a story that Karl May himself might have written. A cowboy emerges
from the side entrance as the protagonist, usually quickly establishing
a liaison with a woman, whose lack of equivalent equestrian skill marks
her as a pioneer settler. The scene is disrupted by invading Indians,
heavily clad in deerskin or some ersatz thereof, and playing on musical
instruments to intensify the pace of the narrative. Drums virtually
take over the story, as a flurry of abductions, fights, and eventual
rescues bring the story to its predictable conclusion. It is at the
intermission that one learns that the musicians of the Wild West were
not Native Americans, but North Africans. Wandering through the animal
displays and sideshows, one comes to several groups of Moroccans--circus
<I>Gastarbeiter--</I>who sell leather goods (not 
<B></B> 
deerskin, however)
and small drums and end-blown flutes. Circus Indian music is, in fact, a
specialty of North Africans who spend the summer in Europe to earn enough
money to support themselves for much of the rest of the year in Morocco,
where frequently they are also professional musicians.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>
The instruments sold outside the big top are Moroccan, many of them
smaller versions of the same instruments accompanying the previous
story of racial encounter in the Wild West. Buying a small hand drum
allows one not only to purchase a musical artifact from Morocco, but
also from the Wild West and the worlds of Wild Bill Cody and Karl
May. These instruments reconfigure time in the narrative of the circus
by performing new histories of distant and modern foreigners (cover
illustration, <I>Musikautomat</I>).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Circuses have often afforded Germans a vehicle for recalibrating
history through spec-tacle empowered by music. In the <I>J&uuml;discher
Kulturbund</I> of the 1930s, the Jewish children of the Berlin cultural
ghetto transformed themselves into the "Zirkus-Knorke," singing of
this experience with the "Zirkus-Knorke-Lied" . This circus
was not only a form of escape and entertainment, but also a site of
resistance, for the children of the Jewish com-munity took charge of
their own foreignness, satirizing and parodying it (in Berliner dialect,
a <I>Knorke</I> is something like a buffoon), and placing it on a stage
that they commanded.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Similarly, the workers who created and performed the "Moorlied" used
the ironic moment of a self-made circus to resist the authorities in
the concentration camp Papenburg, acting out the narrative of resistance
in the "Zirkus Konzentrazani." The musical performance, on its surface
representing the circus of self-presentation, allowed the internees
to stage an act of resistance under the very gaze of those whom they
were resisting.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The modern German circus is a complex site of foreignness, in which the
racism of the past is confused with the racism of the present. The Native
American, representing the fantasy of the Wild West as <I>das Land der
unbegrenzten M&ouml;glichkeiten,</I> the "land of possibilities without
borders," becomes one with the North African, who crosses the borders of
modern Germany representing the musically exotic beyond those borders. The
circus, then, is a venue in which races mix but do so unnoticed, or
at least in ways that the spectators expect and desire. Each summer,
this "multicultural" moment plays itself out again and again throughout
Germany, erasing the boundaries of history and redrawing them according
to the exotic drumbeat of foreignness.

<I>Von deutscher Art und Kunst:</I> The Aesthetics of Tradition

</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
German song embodies many different kinds of boundaries: geographical,
historical, and linguistic.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 German song contains texts
in the German language, in fact, in <I>the</I> German language, High
German, whose own history parallels that of the centuries-long political
consolidation that preceded the first German unification under Bismarck in
1871. The poetic High German is not just a marker of classical art song,
say the <I>Lieder</I> of Schubert and Schumann, using texts by Goethe or
Schiller, but rather distinguishes the most important narrative genres
of folk song. German ballads, therefore, are in High German, even (i.e.,
especially) when transmitted orally in preliterate societies, thereby
reinforcing the connection to an inscribed German history. High German
folk-ballad texts cut across other boundaries, both dialect areas inside
Germany and ethnic regions outside. This is the case, for example, in
Alsace-Lorraine, where the language of ballads is distinct both from
the regional dialect/language, Alsatian, and from French, in effect
historically empowering the

<B></B>

German ballad to obviate the Rhine
boundary between France and Germany. In other boundary regions, such
as German-speaking S&uuml;dtirol in northern Italy and traditionally
multicultural Burgenland in eastern Austria, German song more clearly
establishes the conditions between German and non-German cultures, between
the <I>einheimisch</I> (at home) culture and the foreign. Even modern
songbooks from these areas contain few if any folk songs in languages
other than German, though these regions and most of their residents are
usually multilingual.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The manipulation of boundaries within the German song results from a
dialectical rela-tion between song and history. German song is a product
of the Enlightenment, particularly Johann Gottfried Herder's coining
of the term <I>Volkslied,</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 and the classicization of
a German literary language in the late eighteenth century, which in
turn became the source for romantic song composition in the nineteenth
century. In the spirit of the age, German song was constructed from
racial categories, which in turn proscribed which people could sing which
songs. In establishing his criteria for Germanness in the arts, Herder
also privileged the foreign, illiterate, wild peoples who, "distanced
from science," had no need to "commit their songs to paper."
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
It was with literate traditions that history began, and, rather than
the exoticized timelessness of oral tradition, song began to occupy
specific boundaries and genres, which in turn acquired musical forms,
such as the strophic art song, that reproduced themselves.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
The musical aspects of German song, too, developed within a specific
history of tonality, that is, the harmonic implications dependent on
relations determined by intervals of the third. At one level, German
folk song demonstrated a basic melodic gestalt of melodies anchored to
the harmonic movement of tonality; at another, German art song came to
realize an avant-garde, a musical venue for historical experiments with
tonality, as in the songs of Hugo Wolf.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
By the end of the nineteenth century, the German song was canonized,
fixed by the boundaries of a music history specific to that century. By
the turn of the century, however, challenges to these boundaries arose,
challenges launched by those going beyond and breaking with tonality,
and embracing what they themselves called modernity. In the realm of art
song, these challenges came from Gustav Mahler, and soon thereafter from
Arnold Schoenberg. Neither Mahler nor Schoenberg, of course, was German;
both were Jews whose families had been resident in the Slavic areas of
the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Their careers involved endless crossing
of boundaries, and their musical languages, particularly Schoenberg's,
eventually undermined the harmonic hegemony of German song, with the
institution of the twelve-tone system, in which all intervals were
potentially equal.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The history of Germanness in music, as an unbroken passage from oral to
literate, from simple to complex, foundered with the collapsing of these
musical boundaries. Replacing this history was not another teleological
history, but rather the experiments of modernity.
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
Paradoxically, but not surprisingly, Germanness did not disappear
because of these experi-ments. Its obstinate historical presence served
at times as the object of experimentation, as in the orchestral songs of
Gustav Mahler, <I>Des Knaben Wunderhorn,</I> which utilized the canonic
collection of German folk poetry of the same name.
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 Popular
songs, on the other hand, often achieved widespread currency because they
reproduced the idiom and familiarity of folk song. A modern German song
emerged that was not so much the product of tonality or nineteenth-century
history, but instead involved a process of interrogating the canonic

<B></B>

German song. Its historical dynamic, nevertheless, continued to
rely on its capacity to index the past, even to recuperate the past and
formulate the present from it. Bound to history, the modern German song
reproduced that history with each attempt to express modernity.

</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like other sites of musical practice that one encounters in the New
Germany, cabaret enjoys a revival. Television devotes programs to
cabaret, with Sunday night programming in the early 1990s touring new
and innovative cabarets.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>
 Cabaret performances are very
much a part of modern nightlife, which has meant a further revival of
musical practices that once throve in past cabarets, altering contexts
while reviving period-specific musical styles. The Viennese popular
stage provides one example of this historicism when the musician Roland
Neuwirth performs "neue Schrammelmusik," adapting the elements of the
musical language of the Schrammel-Quartett, the most important popular
ensemble in late nineteenth-century Vienna, but embedding in them a
biting, contemporary satire.
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 Like the circus and the venues
of aesthetic resistance that have appeared on the excursions in this
essay, cabaret depends on satire and parody, which in turn depend on
modern practices of spectatorship and narrative in popular culture. At
their deepest level, all these practices result when for-eignness and
difference are displayed on the stage in ways that would be impossible
elsewhere.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Cabaret uses satire to define a moment of deracination and to serve
as a counterforce to the Germanness that enveloped musical practices
during the nineteenth century. The history of cabaret begins, of course,
during a period coeval with the decay of obsessive nineteenth-century
nationalism. It is hardly surprising that cabaret first began outside
the sphere of German cultural hegemony, in Paris, Barcelona, and
Scandinavia, before crossing the boundaries and blossoming in the
hands of turn-of-the-century modernists such as Frank Wedekind in
Munich.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 Little is to be gained by arguing that there were
specifically German traditions of cabaret; each performance and each
caf&eacute; in which cabaret took place conflated the international
and the local. Each performer used satire to critique time and place
in highly individualized ways. The essential satire of cabaret could
function in no other way.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Similarly, foreignness finds its way to the stages of cabaret in
very different ways. Traditions of Jewish cabaret at the turn of the
century, for example, depended both on the increased population of Jews
in the urban centers of Central Europe and on the growing opportunities
for Jewish musicians and entertainers to perform in other kinds of
cabarets or in popular theater. Because of the first of these reasons,
Jewish cabaret focused its satire largely on Jews from outside Germany,
particularly on Eastern European Jews inhabiting neighborhoods such as
Berlin's Scheunenviertel.
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 Because of the second reason,
Jewish composers turned to the cabaret to find ways of interrogating
the German musical canon. Schoenberg not only performed in cabarets,
but composed cabaret songs. Significantly, these songs are not in the
twelve-tone vocabulary that broke with the history of tonality, but
rather heighten and stylize a popular musical vocabulary.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The satire of cabaret is possible only when criticism is levelled equally
at Germanness and foreignness, hence heightening their interrelation. Some
Jewish cabaret songs had texts, therefore, that were anti-Semitic. That
different spectators responded in contrasting ways to these songs was
inevitable, which may in part explain the survival of cabaret into
the Third Reich. The cabarets of the <I>J&uuml;discher Kulturbund</I>
attracted enormous attention, generating

<B></B>

also new forms of satire
and social critique.
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 Of all the sites of musical practice
and aesthetic resistance allowed in concentration camps, none survived
longer than the cabaret.
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 As satire increases on the stage
of the cabaret, it deflects the gaze of the spectator, as if in a hall
of mirrors; criticism reflects endlessly upon itself, blinding all
to the object of racism because all subjects equally have moments of
becoming that object. Because of this satire, the boundaries between
difference and racism are alternately drawn and erased, becoming
confused and confusing. In modern Germany, these boundaries have
increasingly characterized the satire of popular and political song,
and for this reason characteristics of the cabaret have spilled over
to the street, song being the vehicle that crosses the boundaries of
genre and venue. On the street, satire often provides a context for
songs drawn from foreignness, as well as those foreigners who perform
them. In this process, the relentlessly reflecting and reflexive social
criticism that characterized turn-of-the-century cabaret and characterizes
cabaret as Germany

<B></B>

approaches the turn of the next century further
contributes to the contradictions of modernity performed again and again
on the street.

History confronts the New Germany with an enormous burden of political
dilemmas and contradictions. Both liberal and conservative, Left and
Right, must deal with complex pasts that problematize the decisions of
the present. Essays attempting to sort out these ways of dealing with the
past have already come to constitute a kind of metahistory, distancing
the processes of decision-making from the reality of contemporary
contradictions.
<SUP><a NAME="REF65" HREF="#FOOT65">65</a></SUP>
 Foreignness assumes so many forms in
German modernity that it is seemingly impossible to show soli-darity
with one instance without demonstrating unsettling positions toward the
other. This dilemma particularly characterized the German Left's attempts
to support the Palestinians while at the same time claiming not to be
anti-Semitic. Stated differently, only in Germany can one not separate
Israel from the Jews, if, as modern German history insists, the final
formation of the state of Israel was also an inevitable consequence of
the Holocaust.
<SUP><a NAME="REF66" HREF="#FOOT66">66</a></SUP>
 Race and racism fail to disappear from the
present because they are so embedded in the past.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The modern slogan for the changing cultural landscape of the New
Germany is <I>Multikulturalismus.</I> This thoroughly non-German
coinage, adapted of course from English, supplants German formulations
such as <I>Minderheiten</I> (minorities) or <I>Vielv&ouml;lker</I>
(many peoples), both of which place the new foreigners in a subordinate
position, or would officially remind Germans of that position. The attacks
of skinheads and other groups from the German Right on Turkish homes and
foreigners in general illustrate the fact that the egalitarianism signaled
by terms such as "multiculturalism" simply does not exist; foreigners
remain essen-tially powerless against <I>Volk</I> and <I>Heimat.</I> Yet
multiculturalism is fetishized, sprawled across the surface of billboards
advertising Benetton sweaters or showing blacks

<B></B>

and whites in amorous
embrace because both smoke Peter Stuyvesant cigarettes.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The musics of the new multiculturalism also pervade the modern cultural
landscape of Germany. Turkish music in Germany possesses its own long
history and an historiographic tradition dating from the nineteenth
century.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 As the settings and functions for Turkish music
in Germany changed, so too did the instruments and the constitution
of ensembles. Rural folk musics entered the (German) city, and the
growing presence of female musicians regendered the predominantly
male musical traditions of Turkey. In the past several decades
Turkish-German musicians have successfully utilized the mass media,
creating published anthologies and releasing recordings, such as the
one from which "&Ccedil;ok Uzaklardan Geliyoruz" above was taken, for
Turkish consumers in Germany. Turkish television stations in Germany
broadcast enormous amounts of popular music, some of it from Turkish
television, some of it recorded in Germany, but all of it packaged for
consumption in Germany. The Turkish-German music culture, however, is not
integrated into modern Germany. It is there to experience, if one wishes
to enter the clubs of Berlin's Kreuzberg or to pause when searching for
interesting television programming. Popular German singers too, as we
have already seen in the case of Wolf Biermann, borrow Turkishness for
their repertories. Turkish music itself, however, is performed along the
boundaries of modern society, waiting for the moment to be integrated into
a truly multicultural Germany just as persistently as Turkish workers are
waiting for the moment when they will be granted citizenship.
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It is in the margins and along the boundaries of society, moreover, that
the musics of foreigners have always thrived. It is only since World War
II that these boundaries have gradually collapsed. Symbolizing the musical
foreignness located in the boundaries through-out Germany's modern history
have been Europe's most ubiquitous and professionalized musicians, Romas
and Sintis, to whom I shall refer as Gypsies.
<SUP><a NAME="REF70" HREF="#FOOT70">70</a></SUP>
 Gypsy musicians
have been distinguished by the ability to perform the musics of groups
with whom they come in contact, which is to say, those who engage them
as professional musicians. Throughout the nineteenth century and during
much of the twentieth century, accounts of Gypsy music observed the ways
in which it is really Hungarian
<SUP><a NAME="REF71" HREF="#FOOT71">71</a></SUP>
 or accompanied the festivals
and customs of other groups. The history of Gypsy music exemplifies an
extreme musical contestation of race: a music with no identity of its
own, but that achieves identity only through its capacity to express the
non-Gypsy. This capacity is the result of mobility and adaptability,
which in turn mark the presence of Gypsies throughout the streets of
Europe. Depictions of Gypsy musicians, therefore, usually place them in
public places: in the marketplace of the village, in the bands of outdoor
restaurants, in the ensembles that play for weddings.
<SUP><a NAME="REF72" HREF="#FOOT72">72</a></SUP>
 In
modern Germany, Gypsy musicians have adapted the domain of the street
to their musical <I>Heimat</I>, paradoxically not residing in or near
this domain, but rather again on the outskirts of the city or at the
edge of villages. In this function, they exhibit an extraordinary
modernity, for, despised by the public, they nevertheless become the
ultimate mirror of multiculturalism. Their history has been one of
assimilation and adaptation at the deepest cultural level of music
making. In essence, they symbolize the fallacy of insisting that Germany
cannot be a multicultural nation.

--"Die sch&ouml;ne J&uuml;din" ("The Beautiful Jewish Woman")
<SUP><a NAME="REF73" HREF="#FOOT73">73</a></SUP>
<!--_/attribution-->
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The story of "Die sch&ouml;ne J&uuml;din" describes the love relationship
between a young Jewish woman and a gentile, a relationship made impossible
because the woman may not go out onto the street, even to meet her
lover. The story begins with entreaties from the woman to her mother
to allow her to "go for a little walk" (verse 2). The mother repeatedly
refuses, rejoining that "you may not go alone" (verse 3). After repeated
attempts to find an appro-priate family and Jewish companion to accompany
the young woman's entry into the gentile world (the version here raises
the possibility of the little brother and sister), the young woman waits
until her mother is asleep and violates the rules of the community and
family by going alone, in some versions jumping from her window onto
the street below. "Die sch&ouml;ne J&uuml;din" ends either with the
conversion of the woman as necessary preparation for marriage or with
suicide by drowning (the case in this version), whereby the woman does
not cross the boundary into a gentile world, nor does she reverse her
exit from the Jewish community. The theme of homeland, in the end, proves
irreconcilable. The ballad ends as a <I>Heimatlied</I> with no homeland:
"'Leb wohl du liebe Heimat, wir sehn uns nimmermehr!'" ("'Be well, my
dear homeland, never again will we meet!'").

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
As a German ballad, "Die sch&ouml;ne J&uuml;din" has one of the most
distinctive histories of crossing the cultural boundaries of modern
Europe. The ballad was sung in both High German and in Yiddish,
with versions collected not only in Germany and German-speaking areas
elsewhere, but also in Jewish communities of Eastern Europe.
<SUP><a NAME="REF74" HREF="#FOOT74">74</a></SUP>
"Die sch&ouml;ne J&uuml;din" is therefore both a German and a Yiddish
ballad; its history, in fact, is at once German and Jewish. It has,
nevertheless, a troubled history, which symbolizes the difficulties of
recon-ciling its two ethnic domains, which in turn mark racial domains
within the song itself. This history has defied the boundaries between
German Central Europe and Jewish Eastern Europe, entering the song
canons of both. Variants in oral tradition respond to the Jewishness
of the narrative and its symbols in divergent ways, ranging from
anti-Semitic variants to those that carefully record the norms of Jewish
law.
<SUP><a NAME="REF75" HREF="#FOOT75">75</a></SUP>
 In none of the German or Jewish versions of the songs
do the boundaries between communities yield to the lovers; entry into
the German or gentile world--being seen on the street by non-Jews--makes
the decision to leave the Jewish community irreversible. Ultimately,
the street outside the Jewish woman's window, found in most variants,
becomes a world open to Jews only when they are no longer Jews.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Like the other songs experienced on the excursions in this essay,
"Die sch&ouml;ne J&uuml;din" embodies disturbing contradictions of
modernity. It is, after all, a song explicitly about the moment of
passing from the traditional to the modern, but that moment offers no
possibility of compromise. Past and present confront each other as if
the former may yield to the latter when the Jewish woman sets foot on
the street. In the song, however, it is not possible simply to pass
from the past to the present. Embracing the present means denying the
past--either conversion or suicide.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Die sch&ouml;ne J&uuml;din" refers to indistinct pasts and presents,
and its sense of modernity depends not on specific indices of real
individuals. For the most part, the music one encounters on the streets
of modern Germany relies on such indistinct references to time and
place.

<B></B>

Even the surface specificity of "Die Wacht an der Isar"
refers back to "Wacht am Rhein," which in turn acts as a simulacrum for
historical German concerns with the ways in which boundaries circumscribe
contested homelands.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This is not to say, however, that the songs of the street or of the other
moments that this essay has recounted lack history. Quite the contrary,
they are profoundly historical, precisely because they are inseparable
from the moments of their performance. The historical conditions on which
the specific performances are premised are the result of contradictions:
cabaret and its biting satire; the uncertainty about the constitution
of Germanness and its relation to homeland; the self-made circuses in
the <I>J&uuml;discher Kulturbund</I> and concentration camps; the songs of
Turkish <I>Gastarbeiter</I> and Gypsy musicians without homes. Together,
these contradictions form the long history of a nation that insists it,
unlike the United States, has no history of assimilating foreigners.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
On the streets of the New Germany, music exists only through
performance. Passersby experience musical performance largely as
fragments. Most passersby merely slow their pace in order to hear a few
words in a song; others listen intently to the performance of an entire
song; there are even a few hangers-on who listen to entire repertories
and return repeatedly to the same street musicians. In fact, street
musicians earn quite well in the New Germany, as they did in the past. It
is perhaps a sign of the persistent financial well-being of Germany that
it can afford to support the performance of its historical narratives
on its streets.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Through performance, music creates the illusion of timelessness, one
of the tropes of a modern German historical imagination. Timelessness
allows one to collapse long periods into symbols, virtually footnotes in
a larger history. Hence, the Third Reich, the Holocaust, world wars,
and the socialist GDR become local aberrations, not "our history"
but "theirs." This timelessness distresses when the contradictions
of modernity begin to trouble again, as the unwillingness to accept
foreignness has increasingly troubled the racial consciousness of the
New Germany. Again, the past has invaded the present, and modernity
repeats itself. The street music of the New Germany insists on a public
awareness of this repetition, for once passersby turn away, they are
again confronted with another performance, another repetition. The
contradictions of modernity reside in and turn on these repeated musical
performances, with musical representations of history continuously
undermining the possibility that the present might erase the memory of
the past.

I use the concept "New Germany" throughout this essay
to refer to reunited Germany, which has taken shape in various stages
after the so-called <I>Wende</I> ("turn" or "change"), which resulted
from the dismantling of the wall between the German Democratic Republic
and the German Federal Republic in 1989, and the subsequent dismantling
of the government of the GDR. Initially, the concept of a New Germany
represented the culmination of historical forces in the popular German
imagination, the return to Germany's position in Europe as it always had
been. The banality of this position, "as it always had been," however,
quickly gave way to the awareness that the New Europe, also a product of
the <I>Wende,</I> as well as the New Germany, would not be able to shake
themselves of the unsettling and implosive forces of modern history. All

The success of many street musicians lies in their ability
to earn money, and it would encumber this success were they to intrude
in the daily routine of the shopper or businessperson. Andean pan-pipe
ensembles, to take one example, create a loop of three or four pieces,
evoking the same familiarity that background music has in an airport or
American shopping mall, a music that is passively heard, not actively
listened to. The potential exoticism of such ensembles, therefore,
becomes part of the entertainment expected by pedestrians.

Pedestrian zones dominate city centers for specific
historical reasons. During World War II the British, following the policy
of Winston Churchill, in large part as revenge for the German bombing
of Coventry and London, heavily bombed all cities with populations
greater than one hundred thousand. Not only did these attacks remove the
architectural reminders of the past--the centers of cities such as Dresden
and W&uuml;rzburg, both levelled through fire storms--but they made it
necessary quickly to rebuild city centers after the war. The pedestrian
zone, in a sense, made this possible, for it directed Germans again toward
the city center. It is for this reason, however, that the pedestrian
zone symbolizes both the past that was destroyed and the need to rebuild.

The musicians making these recordings frequently display
the fact that they do not come from the tradition, as in the case of the
Viennese group gojim (literally, "non-Jews"). The groups compensate for
this, however, by carefully researching and documenting their recordings,
making them historically accurate in every detail; see, for example,
gojim, <I>Ess firt kejn weg zurik...jiddische Lieder aus dem Ghetto in
Wilna 1941-1943</I> (Extraplatte EX 139 CD), which is accompanied by the
book <I>Ess firt kejn weg zurik...Geschichte und Lieder des Ghettos von
Wilna 1941-1943,</I> ed. Florian Freund, Franz Ruttner, and Hans Safrian
(Vienna: Picus Verlag, 1992), and which in turn contains historical
essays and transcriptions of the songs. Historical recordings, such as
<I>Yikhes: Fr&uuml;he Klezmer-Aufnahmen von 1907-1939 (Trikont
US-0179),</I> often include claims that they provide the first opportunity
to hear
previously "unpublished" examples of Jewish music from a bygone era.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<a NAME="FOOT7" HREF="#REF7">7</A>.
Briefly glossed, <I>klezmer</I> is an instrumental
music, performed by variously constituted small ensembles (e.g.,
two violins, viola, and small bass violin, with a tsimbl, or large
hammer dulcimer). <I>Klezmer</I> groups played at holidays and rites
of passage in the Jewish community, as well as dances and other social
occasions. Ensembles also performed in non-Jewish settings and with
non-Jewish musicians, making it impossible to isolate it as a strictly
Jewish practice, which, however, generally characterizes the sundry
arguments used to justify <I>klezmer</I> revivals, in North America,
Europe, and Israel. See Walter Salmen, <I>,,...denn die Fiedel macht

Substituting Munich's major river, the Isar, for Germany's
most symbolic river, the Rhine, this text attacks the enemies of Munich's
conservatism. The weapon for these attacks is the reactionary literary
journal <I>Grobian</I> (1904-1912), which, however, served as a voice
for countercurrents in Munich's turn-of-the-century modernity. There
is no point in translating this song text literally here, even, as
given here, the two verses that begin and the two that end the song;
it merely contains a laundry list of the enemies who would traverse the
Isar to invade the Bavarian cultural heartland. That the final two verses
conclude this list with Germany's greatest enemies, the Jews, clearly
illustrates the contradiction they represented in German modernism.

German communities in Eastern Europe constituted so-called
<I>Sprachinseln,</I> "speech islands," and formed as Germans settled
during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, usually to bolster the
insufficient labor force in a particular area or to bring special skills
to the existing labor force. "Germans" from these areas were and are
still able to return to Germany with full citizenship, simply by virtue of
their familial connection to some previous polity historically related to
modern Germany. Other prerequisites for return, for example, knowledge
of the German language, are not necessary. The homeland, it follows,
is biologically maintained, even when the individual is politically and
geographically removed from Germany itself.

The history of the circus in North America is complexly
interwoven with German immigrant performers and owners, as testified
to by the Circus World Museum in Baraboo, Wisconsin, a museum of the

to the North American circus is the use of circus trains to increase
the circus's mobility, and by extension its potential spectacle. Circus
toys assume various forms in Germany, but one of the most characteristic
is that published in book format, to be opened into the circus's various
rings and sideshows, silently accompanied by musicians on virtually every

The standard source for the Yiddish version, "Hinter Poilen
wohnt a Jid," is S. M. Ginsburg and P. S. Marek, <I>Evreiskie narodnye
pesni v Rossii</I> (St. Petersburg: Voskhod, 1901), 313-14. This version
entered the written tradition of the Yiddish folk movement during the
early decades of the twentieth century.
