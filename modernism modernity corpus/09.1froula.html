<p>
Six weeks after <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> appeared, its author speculated on
"a new name" for her novels: "A new ___ by Virginia Woolf. . . . Elegy?"
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
  In modernizing the elegy by adapting its poetics to prose fiction and
  its work of mourning to postwar London's post-theological cosmos in
  <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> , Woolf moves beyond what Alex Zwerdling
  calls her "satiric elegy," <i>Jacob's Room</i> , to discover
  and explore the genre's full profundity, complexity, and power.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
  This communal elegy

<b></b>

unseals "a well of tears"--for the survivors no less than the war
dead--and enters into colloquy with the pastoral elegy from the Greeks
through Shakespeare to Shelley in search of consolations for "This late
age of the world's experience."
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
  In making Clarissa Dalloway its central elegiac consciousness and in
  transposing certain gender-inflected conventions to feminine registers,
  furthermore, the novel embraces the terrible losses that the war
  inflicted on "poor devils, of both sexes" and critiques the warmaking
  society that <i>Three Guineas</i>  res as "a father."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
  But what distinguishes <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> as a war elegy is its
  discovery of the genre's deep resources for dramatizing and mediating
  violence both psychic and social: the violence of war and of everyday
  death; the violence of everyday life; and the violence intrinsic
  to mourning, the grief-driven rage that threatens to derail the
  mourner's progress toward acceptance and consolation. In making the
  elegy a field for confronting the violence that had devastated Europe
  and still loomed as a threat to its future, <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>
  joins the internationalist contributions of Woolf's Bloomsbury
  contemporaries John Maynard Keynes and Sigmund Freud to postwar
  debates about Europe's future. Its characters' struggles animate
  Keynes's prophetic castigation of the Peace as war by other means
  and anticipate Freud's arguments against class oppression, and for
  the consolations of science, philosophy, and art over "religious
  illusion," for a civilization that must manage but can never eradicate
  the aggression that imperils it from within.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>

<p>
In approaching <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> as a communal postwar elegy, I rely on
Peter Sacks's psychosocial analysis of the classical elegy as a dynamic,
eventful working through of loss, fraught with real dangers. Sacks shows
how the genre's conventions mediate the mourner's arduous journey from
loss, grief, and rage to the renewed life and hope epitomized in the
final line of John Milton's "Lycidas," "Tomorrow to fresh woods and
pastures new."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
  Three features stand out in <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s exploration
  of violence. First, with roots in ancient fertility rites, the
  classical pastoral elegy res the work of mourning through
  ceremonies surrounding the death and rebirth of a vegetation god
  such as Adonis, and its dialectical movement toward consolation
  (always necessarily symbolic) recalls the funeral games and contests
  through which a community of mourners negotiates its inheritance
  from dead father-res or paternal deities. Mourning, then, has
  an oedipal dimension as the immediate loss reawakens old crises of
  loss and brokenness, early wounds to narcissism and sexuality that
  psychoanalysis res as castration. To mourn is to relive every loss
  back to the first loss of the mother and to suffer again the anguish of
  submitting to the reality principle red as the law of the father.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
  As we shall see, the accidental death of Clarissa's sister
  Sylvia--caused, it seems, by their careless father--feminizes the
  vegetation myth as Sylvia becomes the matrix of Clarissa's homemade
  consolation. Moreover, Clarissa herself "survives" her historical
  prototype Kitty Maxse's death to body forth the "divine vitality"
  that the elegy seeks to recover, while her double, the (partly
  autobiographical) war veteran Septimus, suffers a death that enacts
  a potentially redemptive "message" of witness to social violence
  (<i>MD,</i> 7, 83). In exploring its characters' conflicts with
  a society that is "a father," <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> analyzes a
  civilization founded, as Freud shows, on the sacrifice of female
  desire and lends critical substance to his prediction that the war's
  survivors will perhaps rebuild their shattered civilization "on firmer
  ground and more lastingly."

<b></b>

<p>
Second, in correlating the elegy's formal conventions with the painful
work of mourning, Sacks contrasts the elegy with its bad other, revenge
tragedy. The poetic elegy submits mourning's formidable psychic turbulence
to the rigorous formal mechanics of elegiac temporality. Meter, rhyme,
repetition, refrain, repeated questions, procession, and ceremony:
all serve to divide, order, pace, tame, channel the mourner's chaos of
feelings. This finely elaborated order indirectly attests to the dangers
that threaten the mourner's progress: on one side, melancholia--the
refusal to relinquish the lost one, to submit to reality, to attach one's
desire to a substitute object; on the other, the rage that may explode
the genre's bounds, veer from symbolic expression to actual murder or
suicide, pervert symbolic consolation into sacrificial violence in the
failed mourning of revenge tragedy. In <i>Mrs. Dalloway,</i> as looser
structures of repetition and refrain (Big Ben's striking of the hours,
"Fear no more the heat o' the sun") mark their progress through the
day, the characters battle psychic perils that write small the great
crisis of loss, grief, and anger facing postwar Europe. Miss Kilman,
impoverished because of her German ancestry, is beset by violent rage;
Septimus's experience of his society's disavowed violence is labeled
madness; Clarissa feels almost annihilated by existential doubt. Through
them <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> poses the great question of Europe's future
after what was not yet World War I (the novel calls it "the European
War") as the fate of collective mourning--a <i>historic</i> question of
genre for a traumatized Europe poised between elegy and revenge tragedy
(<i>MD,</i> 85).

<p>
Third, in keeping with the pastoral elegy's eclogic division of mourning
voices, <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> projects the dialectic of mourning into
urgent social critique and contestation of the future.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
  The funeral games and "apparently innocent" singing matches of
  elegiac tradition, Sacks observes, channel grief into skilled
  performances that contest and carry on those virtues of the dead
  "deemed important for the community's survival" (<i>EE,</i> 36). In
  the novel's depiction of a great European capital five years after the
  war, an intricate tournament of such "poetry contests" pits Clarissa's
  "atheist's religion" against Miss Kilman's allegiances to God and
  Russia; Septimus's prophetic witness against his prosperous doctors'
  policy of "Conversion" to social norms; the furtively sexual Hugh
  Whitbread against the telling silences of Sally Seton and Milly Brush
  (<i>EE,</i> 36; <i>MD,</i> 78, 100). I shall first trace Clarissa's
  emergence as an elegiac consciousness from <i>The Voyage Out</i> 
  to <i>Mrs. Dalloway,</i> and then locate the novel's intramural poetry
  contests within public debates about postwar Europe's inheritance
  and future that took place in and beyond Bloomsbury. Addressing the
  communal task--not yet negated by events--of navigating beyond anger
  and revenge toward peace, <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> conjures from the
  "beautiful caves" of its characters' grief-ravaged psyches vistas of
  fresh woods and pastures new (<i>D,</i> 2:263, 30 August 1923).

Life-Drawing after Death
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
Set on a June day in 1923, <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> emerged amid an outpouring
of art after a war that military historian John Keegan describes as a
"tragic and unnecessary conflict," which mobilized sixty-five million,
killed over eight million, left twenty-one million

<b></b>

physically and/or psychically wounded or disabled, and blighted the
lives and hopes of uncounted loved ones.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
  A voice in T. S. Eliot's <i>The Waste Land</i>  marvels of
  a crowd streaming over London Bridge, "I had not thought death had
  undone so many"; to Lucrezia Warren Smith it seems that "Every one has
  friends who were killed in the War" (<i>MD,</i> 66). The war not only
  shattered millions of lives but unleashed virulent nationalisms that
  rent the economic and cultural fabric of what had been becoming an
  increasingly international civilization. For Keynes, Leonard Woolf,
  Clive Bell, Albert Einstein, and others, it was a "Civil War" that
  threatened "the end of a civilization."
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
  Yet even as it negated Europe's Enlightenment legacy of reason, it also
  razed four ancient empires, dismantled an outworn social and political
  order, and left Europe "'a laboratory atop a vast graveyard,'" in
  which communism, fascism, and liberal democracy vied to promise the
  suddenly enfranchised masses "a New Order"--and "it was not preordained
  that democracy should win out over fascism and communism."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<p>
By 1923, Freud's early confidence that Europeans would rebuild and perhaps
improve their democratic and internationalist civilization after the war
was losing ground to the totalitarian political orders that, fostered
by the Versailles Treaty, were already beginning to form.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
  On visiting postwar Austria, British diplomat Harold Nicolson reported,
  "Everyone looks very pinched and yellow: no fats for four years. The
  other side of the blockade. . . . I feel that my plump pink face is
  an insult to these wretched people."
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
  A fewyears later, Peter Walsh returns from India to a civilization
  that seems a "dear . . . personalpossession," a London pulsing
  with the resurgent creativity--"design, art, everywhere"--and
  commercial prosperity of the 1920s (<i>MD,</i> 55, 71). Through
  the great and small eventsthat befall its characters this June day,
  <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> portrays a postwar civilization fraught with
  agonizing social contradictions, yet vibrating with the vital force
  of the future.

<p>
Could the elegy rise to this historic moment--mourn war losses of
unimaginable magnitude yet everywhere suffered as local, capture
contending social forces, work through communal grief toward consolation
and hope? The "moderns" Clarissa rejects in "Mrs. Dalloway on Bond Street"
suggest not ("The moderns had never written anything one wanted to read
about death").
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
  In the war poets' harrowing turns on the genre, savage ironies all but
  eclipse consolation: Wilfred Owen's nightmarish "Dulce et Decorum Est";
  the proleptic self-elegies of Rupert Brooke ("The Soldier"), Isaac
  Rosenberg ("Break of Day in the Trenches"), and Yeats's Major Robert
  Gregory ("An Irish Airman Foresees His Death"); Siegfried Sassoon's
  "Everyone Sang," with its stunning reversal of the mourner's progress
  from anguished grief to solacing vision.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
  On the homefront, Ezra Pound's bitter epitaph on soldiers slaughtered
  "for a botched civilization" in<i>Hugh Selwyn Mauberley</i>  and
  Eliot's monumental allegory of postwar Europe as a waste land where
  parched spirits strain toward "dry thunder without rain" memorialize
  a blasted civilization in which no consolation survives beyond the
  art of the poem.

<p>
The "tinselly" Clarissa, who has lost no one very close to her in the
war, seems an unlikely candidate for renovating the elegy, yet her three
major portrayals--<i>The Voyage</i> Out, "Mrs. Dalloway in Bond Street,"
<i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>--link her intimately with the genre (<i>D,</i>
3:32, 18 June 1925).
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
  The Clarissa of <i>The Voyage Out</i> tells Rachel Vinrace that as
  a girl she "sobb[ed] over" Shelley's "Adonais":

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
"He has outsoared the shadow of our night,
<br />
Envy and calumny and hate and pain--
<br />
. . .
<br />
Can touch him not and torture not again
<br />
From the contagion of the world's slow stain,"
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
she recites. "How divine!--and yet, what nonsense! . . . I always think
it's living, not dying, that counts" (VO, 58). If every loss awakens
every earlier loss back to the first (oedipal) loss of the mother, the
glamorous Clarissa--a substitute for Rachel's dead mother--embodies the
elegy's very principle: the necessity of relinquishing the dead and of
forming new attachments in order to carry on with life.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
  Rachel's early death dramatizes this lesson's failure, but Clarissa's
  deft critique reclaims the earthly solaces that "Adonais" sacrifices
  in its uncannily prophetic, near-suicidal closing ecstasy to urge
  Rachel toward fresh woods and pastures new.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>

<p>
In "Mrs. Dalloway in Bond Street," Clarissa steps into the glorious June
morning to Big Ben's "solemn," "stirring" strokes and reflects that her
fellow Londoners are "not all bound on errands of happiness. . . . How
people suffered" ("BS," 152). Again "Adonais" is her touchstone as she
thinks of one friend's son, killed in the war, and another's death:
"And now can never mourn--how did it go?--a head grown grey . . . From
the contagion of the world's slow stain . . . have drunk their cup
a round or two before" ("BS," 154; ellipses in original). But now she
herself ts despair as she quests for perfect gloves through London's
glittering "contagion." She almost weeps to see, upright and immobile
in her carriage, her idol, ancient Lady Bexborough, said to be "sick of
it all"; later she quells an impulse to send the shopgirl, who looks
"tired" and "twenty years older," on holiday: "Selling gloves was her
job. She had her own sorrows quite separate, 'and now can never mourn,
can never mourn,' the words ran in her head. 'From the contagion of the
world's slow stain,' . . . for there are moments when it seems utterly
futile" ("BS," 156-8). The floating predicate "and now can never mourn"
dissolves the shopgirl's "separate" sorrows in the submerged pool of
common, unconsoled grief beneath Clarissa's thoughts:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Lady Bexborough, who opened the bazaar, they say, with the telegram in
her hand--Roden, her favourite, killed--she would go on. But why, if
one doesn't believe? For the sake of others, she thought. . . . For one
doesn't live for oneself. . . . Fear no more she repeated. There were
little brown spots on her arm. And the girl crawled like a snail. Thou
thy worldly task hast done. Thousands of young men had died that things
might go on. At last! Half an inch above the elbow; pearl buttons;
five and a quarter. ["BS," 158-9]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Asking why go on, how go on, and for what--what sort of going on is
possible after so many senseless deaths--Clarissa, even while enjoying
the worldly luxuries of her class, expresses a communal grief and
desolation and a longing for solace assuaged by neither Shakespeare's
"Home art gone" (bespeaking an earlier age of the world's experience)
nor Shelley's "divine . . . nonsense."

<b></b>

<p>
As the 1923 Clarissa marks the elegiac place vacated by "the moderns,"
<i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s early title, <i>The Hours,</i> announces its
aspiration to public elegy (A New Elegy by Virginia Woolf) by echoing
Shelley's apostrophe to the "sad Hour" of Keats's death:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
rouse thy obscure compeers
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
And teach them thine own sorrow, say: with me
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Died Adonais; till the Future dares
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Forget the Past, his fate and fame shall be
<br />
An echo and a light unto eternity!
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Materializing these compeer hours in Big Ben's mundane strokes, Woolf
adapts Shelley's re to prose fiction's modernist-realist world through
the novel's technical innovation: her "discovery" of how to light up her
characters' psyches from within by arraying their interior monologues as
a system of "beautiful" psychic "caves," linked by passageways of common
memories and experiences, in which each character's past meets "daylight
at the present moment" (<i>D,</i> 2:263, 30 August 1923). Translating
Shelley's personified hours schooled by the Hour of loss into her
characters' memory-haunted present, Woolf jettisons plot for the elegy's
inward work of mourning and voices communal loss as a polyphony of
private griefs: a tapestry of thought and feeling that interweaves all
the characters' separate sorrows. Septimus's sublime hallucination of
Evans, Rezia's poignant memories of Italy, Doris Kilman's consuming rage,
Peter's anguish at losing Clarissa, Clarissa's grief for Sylvia: all
summon Hours of loss that present and future cannot, or dare not, forget.

<p>
The 1925 Clarissa is first among equals in the compound elegiac subject
formed by these "beautiful caves," privileged especially as the mourner
of Septimus's death; but through this technique she now represents
"all deaths &amp; sorrows" in a way not limited by her limitations.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s genesis in the death of Clarissa's
 original--a friend of Virginia's youth, Kitty Lushington Maxse
 (1867-1922)--dramatizes the referential diffusion and psychic mobility
 by which the elegy makes the death that occasions it encompass "all
 deaths &amp; sorrows," including the elegist's own.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  After Julia Stephen died in 1895, the glamorous and vivacious Kitty
  had exerted herself to conduct her friend's two young daughters into
  "good" society and marriages until, after their father's death in 1904,
  Vanessa and Virginia escaped to Bloomsbury to invent their modern
  lives and arts. Kitty was particularly severe on Virginia Stephen's
  artistic ambitions: she "scream[ed] against Bloomsbury," dismissed
  her writings, condemned her friends ("oh darling, how awful they do
  look!"), disliked her memoir of her father, and moaned, "Virginia
  might marry an <i>author</i> and they always talk about themselves!"
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
  Safe beyond Kitty's Kensington, Virginia recalled having felt herself
  "a kind of slug" in that "unreal Paradise," with Kitty "like salt"
  on that "very sensitive snail" (<i>L,</i> 1:209, 1 October 1905). But
  Kitty still animated her memory and imagination. The 1915 Clarissa "is
  almost Kitty verbatim; what would happen if she guessed?" (<i>L,</i>
  1:349, 10 August 1908); and when Woolf read of Kitty's death in
  October 1922, she was at work on the short story sequence begun with
  "Mrs. Dalloway in Bond Street."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

<b></b>

<p>
The news brought a flood of ambivalent memories of her old antagonist:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
the day has been spoilt for me--so strangely. . . . I hadn't seen her
since, I guess, 1908--save at old Davies' funeral [in 1916], &amp; then
I cut her, which now troubles me--unreasonably I suppose. I could not
have kept up with her; she never tried to see me. Yet yet--these old
friends dying without any notice on our part always . . . saddens me:
makes me feel guilty. I wish I'd met her in the street. My mind has
gone back all day to her. . . . She got engaged at St Ives. . . . I keep
going over this very day in my mind. [D, 2:206, 8 October 1922]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Six days later the stories "branched into a novel" as, instead of
attending the memorial service, Woolf remembered Kitty from afar:
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
now Kitty is buried &amp; mourned by half the grandees in London;
&amp; here I am thinking of my book. Kitty fell, very mysteriously,
over some bannisters. Shall I ever walk again? she said to Leo. And to
the Dr "I shall never forgive myself for my carelessness." How did it
happen? Someone presumably knows, &amp; in time I shall hear. [<i>D,</i>
2:207, 14 October 1922]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Two days later she set down the idea for <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>: "Sanity
&amp; insanity. Mrs D. seeing the truth. S. S. seeing the insane
truth. . . . The pace is to be given by the gradual increase of S's
insanity. on the one side; by the approach of the party on the other"
(<i>H,</i> 412).

<p>
Woolf's curiosity about Kitty's "mysterious" fall persisted: "there's
Kitty Maxse falling . . . and killing herself"; "I've heard nothing
about Kitty, and couldn't face the memorial service--my black being
incomplete. How on earth did it happen?" (<i>L,</i> 2:573, 574, 22 and
29 October 1922). Her later recollection that Clarissa "was originally
to kill herself, or perhaps merely to die at the end of the party" while
"Septimus, who later is intended to be her double, had no existence"
may refer to this doubt, since nothing in <i>The Hours</i> suggests that
Clarissa was to die or kill herself, and she had invented "S. S." almost
immediately.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
  About 9 November 1922, Woolf devised the double design that displaces
  Clarissa's death onto Septimus: "All must bear finally upon the
  party at the end; which expresses life, in every variety &amp;
  full of conviction: while S. dies" (<i>H,</i> 415). If Woolf ever
  settled whether Kitty threw herself downstairs or "merely" died,
  she did not record it; but in keeping with Sacks's point that the
  death the elegy mourns is always the elegist's own, her fantasy casts
  Kitty--hence Clarissa and Septimus--as her doubles. Kitty stands
  to Woolf (who had twice tried to kill herself) in much the same
  specular and sacrificial relation as Septimus stands to Clarissa;
  "S." substitutes for Kitty, Clarissa, and not least, Woolf--the
  seventh/septimus of eight Duckworth/Stephen children.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>

<p>
Once Kitty died Clarissa could not go on "living" in quite the same
way, despite her fictional status and the displacement of her death
onto Septimus. Kitty's death shadows the fictional counterpart who
survives her:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
did it matter that she must inevitably cease completely; all this must
go on without her . . . or did it not become consoling to believe that
death ended absolutely? but that somehow

<b></b>

in the streets of London, on the ebb and flow of things, here, there,
<i>she survived, Peter</i> survived, lived in each other, she being part
. . . of people she had never met; being laid out like a mist between
the people she knew best, who lifted her on their branches as she had
seen the trees lift the mist, but it spread ever so far, her life,
herself. [<i>MD,</i> 9; emphasis mine]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
As her fear that <i>she must cease</i> swerves from the normative future
conditional (<i>somehow she would survive</i>) to the declarative past
(<i>somehow . . . she survived</i>), it is as though Clarissa (like Kitty)
were already dead, or as though Kitty were speaking through her; as though
Kitty's actual death were converging grammatically with her afterlife in
the 1925 Clarissa; or as though death were scarcely to be distinguished
from life's moment-by-moment vanishing into the past. Or, since <i>somehow
. . . Peter survived</i> too, as though any ontological distinction
between life and death were obscured by the ontological resemblances
between absence and death, and between life and its afterlife in memory,
imagination, art. Clarissa and Peter have, after all, borne each other
like mist on their branches through their long mutual absence, just as
one would carry the other if one of them should die, and just as Woolf
carried Kitty in life and after death, in memory and art, in stories that
"branched" upon her death into this elegiac novel. In bringing Kitty back
to "life" on a radiant June day that <i>in fact she never lived</i>, Woolf
flaunts the elegist's power, invisibly flourishing Clarissa herself in
Escherlike proof of Clarissa's own vision of life-after-death. Through
her art Kitty symbolically survives, spreads ever so far, her life,
herself, borne on in time by those who knew her (including Woolf, who
had not seen her for years, and whose art Kitty scorned) and by people
she never met, including the novel's ever-widening circles of readers.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
But the "beautiful caves" poetics that the 1925 Clarissa bodies forth
transcends sentimental memorial. At once portrait and <i>persona</i>
(originally a facial image of the dead as well as a mask through which one
speaks [<i>EE,</i> 126]), she is no longer Kitty verbatim, an object drawn
by Woolf-as-writing-subject, but an image of the deeper, more complex
ways people survive--<i>or not</i>--in and through one another. For Woolf
can raise her old antagonist Kitty from the dead only by breathing her
own life into her. Books, she observes in her 1928 Introduction, are
"flowers or fruit stuck here and there on a tree which has its roots
deep down in the earth of our earliest life," so that "the truth" behind
fiction's "immense facades"--"if life is indeed true, and if fiction is
indeed fictitious"--would require "a volume or two of autobiography"
("I," 197). But is life "true" and fiction "fictitious"? Is Kitty the
inaccessible real behind Clarissa's marmoreal "facade"? Or does the
novel's modernist poetics, continuous with its symbolic consolations,
debunk the distinction between subject and object such propositions
assume? How exactly does Kitty survive transred in art, her counsel
"it's <i>living</i>, not dying, that counts" revived from beyond the
grave?

<p>
At stake in these questions is, first, a composite modernist
self/other-portraiture that weaves biography and autobiography, "Kitty
verbatim" and "invented" memories, observed surface and imagined depths,
into fiction's "truth," Clarissa. An interfused Kitty/Woolf, dead yet
living, absent yet present, a psyche unbounded by even a fictional
body, Clarissa is a symbolic subject/object entity that captures as in
a hologram the way the historical Woolf lifted the historical Kitty on
the branches of her life and

<b></b>

art.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
  But its postwar context gives this modernist portraiture deeper
  resonance. In 1918 Woolf saw her brother Adrian talking with a German
  prisoner of war and reflected, "The reason why it is easy to kill
  another person must be that one's imagination is too sluggish to
  conceive what his life means to him--the infinite possibilities of
  a succession of days which are furled in him, &amp; have already
  been spent" (<i>D,</i> 1:186, 27 August 1918). In this light, her
  resurrection of Kitty--whom in her mother's stead she had, in a sense,
  fought for her life--as a Clarissa who somehow survives, blooming on
  the tree of her author's "earliest life," her infinite possibilities
  unfurling through the book of her day, marks not just a technical
  breakthrough but an elegiac act of imagination that intrinsically
  opposes violence.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
  Against the still unvanquished violence of its postwar moment--everyday
  death, everyday life, as well as the murderous ethos of war--this
  modernist narrative poses a counterforce ontological, aesthetic,
  and ethical, writ small in Clarissa's thoughts on the death of a
  young man she has never met, writ large in the narrative's luminous
  divinations of its characters' unfurling lives.

<p>
If Kitty's symbolic resurrection, dramatizing a daughter-artist's
victory over Conversion-worshipping mothers, evokes the oedipal
dimension of mourning, Clarissa's dead sister Sylvia res not the
contingent opposition of a Julia, a Kitty, or a German POW but the
absolute antagonist Death. This feminine vegetation deity, naturalized
and mythified in Clarissa's re of consolation, at once modernizes
the pastoral elegy and opposes to the objectifying metaphysics of a
warmaking society that is "a father" an ontology that locates "reality"
in "Odd affinities"--not in discrete "subject and object" (<i>MD,</i>
153; <i>TL,</i> 38). Feminine in origin and history but not essence,
this metaphysics frames the novel's intersubjective character-drawing
as a consolation for "poor devils, of both sexes."

<p>
Dropping the 1923 allusions to "Adonais," <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s opening
pages follow Clarissa's thoughts from Sylvia (from Latin <i>silvanus</i>,
forest) to the re of survival as mist-bearing branches. The phrase
<i>somehow she survived</i> thus condenses Clarissa withSylvia, to
whose death Peter Walsh traces Clarissa's "atheist's religion"--an
aberration from the nationalist religion proper to her "public-spirited,
British Empire, tariff-reform, governing-class spirit." Possibly,
Peter speculates,



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
she said to herself, As we are a doomed race, chained to a sinking ship
. . ., as the whole thing is a bad joke, let us, at any rate, do our part;
mitigate the sufferings of our fellow-prisoners

<b></b>

. . . ; be as decent as we possibly can. Those ruffians, the Gods,
shan't have it all their own way,--her notion being that the Gods, who
never lost a chance of hurting, thwarting and spoiling human lives were
seriously put out if, all the same, you behaved like a lady. That phase
came directly after Sylvia's death--that horrible affair. To see your
own sister killed by a falling tree (all Justin Parry's fault--all his
carelessness) before your very eyes, a girl too on the verge of life,
the most gifted of them, Clarissa always said, was enough to turn one
bitter. Later she wasn't so positive perhaps; she thought there were no
Gods; no one was to blame; and so she evolved this atheist's religion
of doing good for the sake of goodness. [<i>MD,</i> 77-8]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
If Peter is right, Clarissa took no solace in providential father-gods
or promises of heaven but blamed malevolent "ruffians" and her inept
father (if the parenthetical condemnation is hers too), later casting off
this childlike fantasy for fatalism and a stoic ethics of decency. As
her disillusion with father-res originates with Sylvia's death, so
do the consolations of her "atheist's religion," whose imagery seems
to have influenced Peter's earlier reverie in Regent's Park. There,
longing "for solace, for relief, for something outside these miserable
. . . craven men and women," he too imagines a sylvan feminine apotheosis:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
if he can conceive of her, then in some sort she exists, he thinks, and
advancing down the path with his eyes upon sky and branches he rapidly
endows them with womanhood; sees with amazement how . . . majestically
. . . they dispense with a dark flutter of leaves charity, comprehension,
absolution, and then, flinging themselves suddenly aloft, confound the
piety of their aspect with a wild carouse. [<i>MD,</i> 57]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Symbolically reborn in Clarissa's and Peter's metaphysical trees of
life and death, the Adonislike Sylvia counters sacrificing fathers and
father-gods with a "re of the mother whose sons have been killed in
the battles of the world"--everyday conflicts and the Great War alike
(<i>MD,</i> 58).

<p>
Sylvia, of whom we learn almost nothing, is less a character than Death
itself. She is the specter of Clarissa's, the harbinger of Septimus's,
the ghost of Kitty's, and also, in this book that flowers on the tree
of its author's earliest life, of Julia's and Leslie Stephen's, and (as
shocking as Sylvia's) of Stella Duckworth's at twenty-eight and Thoby
Stephen's at twenty-six. As the vegetation god of this public elegy,
she is also the deaths of the millions destroyed by the war and the
prospective deaths that shadow the survivors. Sylvia--all dead sisters,
brothers, fathers, mothers, friends, soldiers known and unknown, lost
companions of war and peace--is death as the "life" or "truth" behind
<i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s fictional "facade," the mystery of mortality: death
as reality, necessity, <i>Ananke,</i> intrinsic to life and nature, to
thrushes breaking snails on stones and to the falling tree that fells her.

<p>
As death transred, Sylvia is also art. As Clarissa transmutes
her death and proper name into mist-bearing branches, Sylvia res
consolation's necessarily purely symbolic nature without losing her
meaning of natural death. Her name condenses the work of mourning, at
once memorializing her and dissolving her into nature's generic matrix:
<i>silvanus</i> to Sylvia to ral mist-laden branches; dust to Dust
to an urn filled

<b></b>

with ashes. Her literary name also resonates with Woolf's memory of
how Julia Stephen's death "quicken[ed]" in her thirteen-year-old self
"unveiled and intensified . . . perceptions, as if a burning glass had
been laid over what was shaded and dormant . . . as if something were
becoming visible," so that, desultorily perusing Palgrave's <i>Golden
Treasury</i> in Kensington Gardens, she was startled to find a poem



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
instantly and for the first time . . . intelligible. . . . [N]o one could
have understood from what I said the queer feeling I had in the hot grass,
that poetry was coming true. . . . It matches what I have sometimes felt
when I write. The pen gets on the scent.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Sylvia is death as the alpha and omega of poetry, art, writing; the
<i>sign</i> of Julia's, Kitty's, and all past and future deaths that
coalesced to transform stories of shopping, prime ministers, and "Cut
flowers" into this modern pastoral elegy.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>

<p>
It is no accident that Sylvia's memory sparks a reverie that takes
Clarissa to Hatchard's bookshop window, where, on seeing Shakespeare's
"Fear no more" from <i>Cymbeline,</i> she wonders, "What was she trying
to recover? What image of white dawn in the country" (<i>MD,</i> 9). The
posthumous Kitty/Clarissa evokes the Posthumus (so named because he
survived his mother's death at his birth) of <i>Cymbeline</i>--the play
that inducted the nineteen-year-old scoffer Virginia into the bard's
"company of worshippers." What she thought the "best lines" in this or
perhaps any play, "Imogen says--Think that you are upon a rock, and now
throw me again! and Posthumous answers--Hang there like fruit, my Soul,
till the tree die," find echo in Clarissa's mist-laden branches and
Woolf's tree of life hung with flowers/fruit/books (<i>L,</i> 1:45-6,
5 November 1901). Envisioning himself as a tree embraced by his soul
Imogen--or perhaps faithful Imogen as a tree on which his soul hangs "like
fruit" till death--Posthumus rejoices in her awakening from what turns out
to be only a sleep, and in his own release from suicidal despair at the
mistaken thought that he has destroyed her, his "only jewel." Imogen's
"Why did you throw your wedded lady from you? / Think that you are upon
a rock, and now / Throw me again" gently mocks his fort/da game. He has
foolishly tested and accidentally "killed" her, discovered his error
and wished to die, only to find her miraculously restored: will he
throw her again? Literalizing loss restored as only the romance can,
<i>Cymbeline</i> reunites Posthumus and Imogen as living "tree" and
"fruit" in deferral ("till the tree die"), if not defiance, of death.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
The modernist-realist character Clarissa cannot literally "recover" what
she has lost, but her longing for some lost "white dawn in the country"
summons pastoral memories of Bourton that recur throughout the day. The
most striking, Sally Seton's kiss--"the most exquisite moment of her
whole life"--she compares to "a present, wrapped up," hers to keep
but not to look at; an indestructible "diamond, something infinitely
precious," a "revelation" imbued with "radiance" and "religious feeling"
(<i>MD,</i> 35-6). Only through memory does Clarissa "recover" her lost
love, burnished with such metaphoric richness as young Virginia embraced
in <i>Cymbeline.</i> This "present," a gift too precious to unwrap or
look at--a moment once present now past, yet preserved in memory and
symbolically "present" again--bespeaks memory's power to conjure lost

<b></b>

"jewels," make them "present" in dazzling splendor. <i>Mrs. Dalloway,</i>
that is, literalizes Posthumus's consolation for its later age of the
world's experience by rescuing love-lost-and-recovered from the romance's
unreal paradise and relocating it in the symbolic realms of memory,
imagination, and art--where it defeats time and loss more securely than
the romance of presence Posthumus's very name belies, even as it enacts
the mourner's necessary submission to the reality of loss.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>

<p>
The young Virginia's query as to why <i>Cymbeline</i>'s characters "aren't
. . . more human?" foreshadows the mature Woolf's translation of Imogen's
survival to Clarissa's realist world (<i>L,</i> 1:45). Peter recalls how,
riding atop an omnibus, young Clarissa consoled herself for "how little
one knew people" and allayed her "horror of death" by theorizing that
human lives are not bounded in time and space but indefinitely dispersed
through a space/time continuum that extends beyond the organism's apparent
life and death:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
she felt herself everywhere; not "here, here, here"; and she tapped the
back of the seat; but everywhere. . . . She was all that. So that to
know her, or any one, one must seek out the people who completed them;
even the places. Odd affinities she had with people she had never spoken
to, some woman in the street, some man behind a counter--even trees,
or barns. It ended in a transcendental theory which, with her horror
of death, allowed her to believe, or say that she believed (for all her
scepticism), that since our apparitions, the part of us which appears,
are so momentary compared with . . . the unseen part of us, which
spreads wide, the unseen might survive, be recovered somehow attached
to this person or that, or even haunting certain places after death
. . . perhaps--perhaps. [<i>MD,</i> 152-3; last ellipsis in original]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Clarissa's "transcendental theory" extends Posthumus's tree hung with
Soul/fruit into a vast arboreal metaphor that augments conscious and/or
bodily presence with unconscious experience, memory, and perception--of
and by others--such that one's "unseen part" "spreads wide" in space and
"might survive" in time, "be recovered somehow attached to this person
or that."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>

<p>
The apposition of <i>survive</i> with the passive <i>be recovered</i>
finesses the question of <i>who</i> survives, <i>who</i> recovers,
as it answers Clarissa's longing for some "lost image of white dawn in
the country." How can this theory of being palliate a "horror of death"
when it renders Clarissa alive scarcely different from Clarisssa dead;
confounds life and death, self and other, presence and absence; values
memory and imagination over actualities, one's unconscious "unseen part"
over conscious "apparition"? Like Clarissa's branches and Peter's arboreal
goddess, the passage embeds the theory in its practice. Clarissa's unseen
part <i>already</i> spreads wide as she rides the omnibus with Peter;
<i>already</i> she is not (just) "here" where she seems to be, for as she
speaks her disavowed apparitional "here" detaches itself from accidents of
time and place to endure in Peter's memory, "haunting" him in her absence,
as now in the narrative present. Her assertion that she is not (only)
"here" survives to make her "present"--<i>here</i>--to Peter decades
later while, on this June day, her apparition busies itself elsewhere
with party preparations, thinking of her life's moments as "buds on the
tree of life, flowers of darkness"

<b></b>

(<i>MD,</i> 29). The Clarissa who was once (not) "here" on the bus with
Peter "survives" "attached" to his later self; is "recovered" in his
memory and by the narrative, a diamantine "present" preserved from time,
death, loss, absence.

<p>
Does it matter that it is Peter, not her apparition, for whom her unseen
part survives, or that her apparition must die as surely as Posthumus's
tree? Does it matter that their shared moments, once "buds on the tree
of life, flowers of darkness," are now memory's "fruits" on the tree
of life and <i>death</i>? And of art, for the narrative structure on
which Peter and Clarissa hang like souls or fruits is founded on this
theory of being that branches beyond one's apparition in all directions,
indeterminate and unseen. Not plot connects Clarissa and Septimus but such
odd affinities with "people she had never spoken to" as exist between,
say, Adrian--or Woolf--and the German POW. As theorized by Clarissa and
practiced in <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s intersubjective character-drawing, odd
affinities lift elegiac consolation out of the register of the sentimental
to counter the "death of the soul": the atrophy of imaginative powers
presupposed, Woolf thought, in the murderousness that objectifies beings
who are inseparably subject and object (<i>MD,</i> 58).

<p>
What then of the odd affinity between two strangers and <i>semblables</i>
at the heart of the book: "Mrs D. seeing the truth. S. S. seeing
the insane truth" (<i>H,</i> 412)? What is its nature and how does it
console? One source of Clarissa's feeling "somehow very like" Septimus is
her own everyday battle against despair (<i>MD,</i> 186). Her ontology
does not permanently allay her "horror of death" but itself forms part
of a rich web of imagery, a very garment of consolation, that she spins
out moment by moment as her mind tosses up metaphors (and genius, says
Aristotle, is metaphor) that show what life is literally "like" for her.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
  As Peter observes, she "enjoy[s] life immensely"; it is "her nature
  to enjoy," to be "all aquiver" and "such good company, spotting queer
  little scenes, names, people from the top of a bus"; she possesses
  an "indomitable vitality," "a thread of life which for toughness,
  endurance, power to overcome obstacles, and carry her triumphantly
  through he had never known the like of" (<i>MD,</i> 78, 152, 155). Yet
  her "gift . . . to be; to exist; to sum it all up in the moment as
  she passed" must ceaselessly contend against her dread of death,
  her feeling that it is "very, very dangerous to live even one day,"
  her everyday t to affirm that "it's <i>living</i>, not dying,
  that counts" (<i>MD,</i> 174, 8). This familiar "horror," highlighted
  in the draft, attacks Clarissa when she hears of Septimus's suicide
  and imagines his



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
dread, that horror, the terror; she felt it too; horror filling her
. . . the incapacity to withstand, the overwhelming hostility of the race
. . . its vast loneliness, its entire feebleness, . . . so that if Richard
had not been there, merely to read the Times aloud; so that listening one
could recoup . . . could hear him breathing in the room; could wait like
a crouched bird under a leaf; could gradually recover . . . her [belief?
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 ]; not in Gods &amp; power, but only in the breath, in the Times, in
 the fire; &amp; so fanning this little flame, could feel rise within
 once more the imperious thing. But he had not recovered.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Doubles and mirrors, exemplars of "Sanity &amp; insanity," these two
who meet at a party as though death were no unbridgeable divide see the
"truth" and alike t despair.

<b></b>

But whereas Clarissa fans her wavering flame back to life, Septimus
"had not recovered." Almost nothing separates the suicide displaced
onto Septimus from Kitty/Clarissa/Woolf (and perhaps Shelley, with his
divine nonsense) from the "divine vitality" Clarissa adores (<i>MD,</i>
7). In Clarissa, life triumphs; in Septimus, death; but in their redoubled
reflection, death-in-life mirrors life-in-death. She, like him, battles
despair; he, like her, basks--moments before he leaps--in sanity,
happiness, hope.

<p>
This is why death comes to Clarissa's party, of all the parties in
London: because she can admit it; because she lets it in. Clarissa, that
"thoroughgoing sceptic," recognizes the death that arrives uninvited, like
Sally Seton, as unmistakably as though Wilkins had intoned its name. Death
comes to her party because she (the perfect hostess) can entertain it,
a guest and a familiar. Its only seemingly fortuitous arrival clinches
the novel's "idea," "<i>the contrast between life &amp; death</i>," in
an odd affinity: resemblance and difference attenuated, infinitesimal,
yet absolute, momentous (<i>H,</i> 414). He is somehow very likeher,
borne on her branches with Sylvia and Peter, barns and trees, a <i>man
behind a counter</i> ("To look at, [Septimus] might have been a clerk"),
a <i>woman in the street</i> (<i>MD,</i> 84).

<p>
We shall return to Clarissa's impromptu elegy for Septimus and the
poetry contest it stages between her ontology of odd affinities and
the objectifying positivism of the doctors who would "forc[e his] soul,"
sacrifice him to their "Goddess[es]" Proportion and Conversion (<i>MD,</i>
184, 100). But first it will be helpful to consider a more vexed affinity
between Clarissa and that woman in the street Miss Kilman. Through their
contending metaphysics--Clarissa's "atheist's religion" and ruling-class
nationalism against Doris Kilman's turn to God and Russia--this postwar
elegy stages competing truths and values in a post-theological cosmos
in which communities and nations must grapple with their differences
and their aggression. Their conflict displays the nationalism and
class antagonism that, Keynes warned, threatened Europe's democratic
civilization as it preres Freud's postwar writings on the pressing
dangers of class oppression and religious "illusion" to Europe's future.

<p>
"[W]ith another throw of the dice," Clarissa "would have loved Miss
Kilman! But not in this world. No" (<i>MD,</i> 12). Here the "brutal
monster" of involuntary hatred lumbers in "that leaf-encumbered forest,
the soul," although she knows what she really hates is "the idea of her,
which undoubtedly had gathered in to itself a great deal that was not
Miss Kilman; had become one of those spectres with which one battles in
the night; . . . who stand astride us and suck up half our life-blood,
dominators and tyrants" (ibid.). The feeling is mutual. Doris Kilman
thinks Clarissa not kind but "merely condescending," from "the most
worthless of all classes--the rich, with a smattering of culture," and
pictures her turned out of her sofa and installed "in a factory; behind
a counter; Mrs. Dalloway and all the other fine ladies!" She violently
envies her beauty, elegance, charm, domestic luxury, glamorous social
life, adoring husband, and lovely daughter: "If she could have felled
her it would have eased her. . . . If only she could make her weep; could
ruin her; humiliate her; bring her to her knees crying, You are right! But
this was God's will, not Miss Kilman's. It was to be a religious victory"
(<i>MD,</i> 123-5).

<p>
Clarissa's intuition that she hates not Miss Kilman but a "spectre"
comprised of "a great deal" else provokes us to inquire into that
abstraction of domination and tyranny and so to grasp their class
antagonism as a microcosmic cross section of the nationalist conflicts
in which Europe's future is indeed at stake. This poetry contest indicts
postwar nationalisms that, while pretending to battle external threats
to peace and security, actually <i>produce</i> enemies, dominators,
and war by an unacknowledged violence within. The dominator-tyrant that
Clarissa projects upon Doris Kilman, whose family (then Kiehlman) came
from Germany in the eighteenth century, evokes a defeated and still
belligerent postwar Germany, thrust like a pariah outside the Allies'
international community, while the decadent Clarissa whom Miss Kilman
would re-educate personifies an England tyrannical in victory and heedless
of the political consequences of the international class oppression
instituted at Versailles. In facing these women off, <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>
explores the competition, envy, hatred, and aggression between classes
and nations that had already engulfed Europe in war and would slowly
rise to a boil again in the 1920s and 1930s.

<p>
Doris Kilman, indeed, bodies forth Keynes's warning that the economic
sanctions imposed by the Peace could only provoke another war. By the
time Woolf wrote <i>Mrs. Dalloway,</i> her old friend Maynard had gained
world fame by his critique of the Allies' war reparations policy as a
punitive, barbaric, and self-destructive holdover of nationalism.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
  Participating as a British Treasury officer in the Paris Peace talks,
  he had resigned in protest in May 1919 and retreated that August to
  Vanessa Bell's country house (near Monks House, which the Woolfs had
  just taken) to write <i>The Economic</i>

<b></b>

<i>Consequences of the Peace,</i> published in December. Keynes had
urged the Allied leaders to embrace internationalist policies that would
promote Europe's welfare as a whole, not enrich some nations at others'
expense. Instead they instituted what he diagnosed as the "abhorrent
and detestable" policy of a backward-looking "old man" who sees only
the rivals France and Germany, not "European civilization struggling
forwards to a new order" nor "humanity . . . at the threshold of a
new age" (<i>ECP,</i> 225, 36). An instrument of nationalist rivalry,
the Versailles Treaty would, he predicted, "sow the decay of the
whole civilized life of Europe" by "reducing Germany to servitude
for a generation," "degrading the lives of millions of human beings,"
"depriving a whole nation of happiness" (<i>ECP,</i> 225).

<p>
Keynes, in short, prophesied not just the economic consequences of the
Peace--"actual starvation" of "the European populations"--but their
social, psychic, and political consequences: social unrest, revolution,
and ultimately another war (<i>ECP,</i> 228). Since Germany's starving
peoples would resist a foreign tax not compelled by "their sense of
justice or duty," the reparations would incite "vengeance," a "final
civil war between the forces of Reaction and the despairing convulsions
of Revolution, before which the horrors of the late German war will fade
into nothing, and which will destroy, whoever is victor, the civilization
and the progress of our generation" (<i>ECP,</i> 282, 268). Condemning
a Treaty that violated both "human nature" and "the spirit of the age"
and would foment political revolution as surely as Russia's "bloodthirsty
philosophers," Keynes urged that "expediency and generosity agree": "the
policy which will best promote immediate friendship between nations" would
also favor "the permanent interests of the benefactor"--peace, prosperity,
the security of Europe's democratic civilization (<i>ECP,</i> 282, 238).

<p>
"Had Keynes's 1919 programme been carried out," Robert Skidelsky writes,
"it is unlikely that Hitler would have become German Chancellor."
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
  Ignored at Versailles, Keynes dedicated his book to "the new
  generation," which he sought to influence through "those forces
  of instruction and imagination which change <i>opinion</i>": the
  "assertion of truth, the unveiling of illusion, the dissipation of
  hate, the enlargement and instruction of men's hearts and minds"
  (<i>ECP,</i> 298, 296-7). In pacifist Bloomsbury, opinion was already
  with him. <i>The Economic Consequences of the Peace,</i> Woolf mused,
  was "a book that influences the world without being in the least a work
  of art: a work of morality, I suppose" (<i>D,</i> 2:33, 24 April 1920).

<p>
Works of art too may hope to influence the world. Not for nothing
does Miss Kilman possess "a really historical mind" (<i>MD,</i>
11). Despite her commanding "knowledge of modern history"--"thorough
in the extreme"--Doris Kilman has lost her teaching post because of her
German ancestry.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
  Deprived of her livelihood, she is a walking allegory of the
  aggressively aggrieved postwar Germany Keynes tried to forestall. She
  enters Clarissa's orbit through the kindness of Richard, who has
  found her "working for the Friends"--presumably, for peace--and,
  pained by her misfortune, has engaged her to tutor Elizabeth.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
  Miss Kilman reflects on how wartime nationalist paranoia has blighted
  her life:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
she had never been able to tell lies. Miss Dolby thought she would be
happier with people who shared her views about the Germans. She had had
to go. It was true that the family was of German origin; spelt the name
Kiehlman in the eighteenth century; but her brother had been killed. They
turned her out because she would not pretend that the Germans were all
villains--when she had German friends, when the only happy days of her
life had been spent in Germany! [<i>MD,</i> 123-4]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
An Englishwoman whose brother has, it appears, fought and died
for England, Doris Kilman nonetheless finds herself a racialized
outcast. Unjustly deprived of her livelihood, she feels "cheated" of
her "right to some kind of happiness"--the one kind she can hope for,
"what with being so clumsy and so poor" (<i>MD,</i> 123). Too homely
to find happiness in "the opposite sex" (men being in short supply in
any case after the war) and too poor to buy "pretty clothes" (anyway,
"No clothes suited" her "unlovable body"), she does not hope to "come
first with anyone."
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
  Still, she might have had the modest happiness of her teaching
  post--a vital social world, a secure if small income, the intellectual
  satisfactions and social place for which her degree and "more than
  respectable" expertise in "modern history" qualify her--had not her
  fellow English, anticipating both Versailles and Hitler's racialized
  violence, impoverished and degraded her in her own country (<i>MD,</i>
  132). The spelunking narrator, in short, traces her near-murderous
  envy of Clarissa not to an essentially tyrannical personality
  but to a natural resentment of social injuries. Her psychic "cave"
  illuminates her rage and self-righteousness not as isolated character
  faults but as a case study of the dynamics of nationalism and class
  in collective aggression--a fictional animation of Keynes's prophecy
  that an impoverished Germany would avenge itself on the Allies.

<p>
Miss Kilman's history anticipates the theory of human aggression that
Freud read out of "the horrors of the recent World War":



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The . . . truth . . . which people are so ready to disavow, is that
men are not gentle creatures who want to be loved, and who at the most
can defend themselves if they are attacked; they are, on the contrary,
creatures among whose instinctual endowments is to be reckoned a powerful
share of aggressiveness. . . . [T]heir neighbour is . . . someone who
tempts them to satisfy their aggressiveness on him, to exploit his
capacity for work without compensation, to use him sexually without his
consent, to seize his possessions, to humiliate him, to cause him pain,
to torture and to kill him. . . . Who, in the face of all his experience
of life and of history, will have the courage to dispute this assertion?
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Aggression and the death-instinct, Freud argued, are not pathological
aberrations but inherent in human nature and ineradicable. Civilization
demands that individuals renounce instinctual aggression (murder,
cannibalism, incest) as well as submit to moral strictures against
lust, avarice, lies, fraud, calumny and so on; hence "every individual
isvirtually an enemy of civilization."
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
  Although civilization disarms this hostility with variousforms
  of recompense, its economy of aggression renounced in exchange for
  benefitsis inherently unstable, easily disturbed by social and economic
  inequities that exacerbate this fundamental discontent.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
  Like Keynes, Freud saw class oppression as a formidable threat
  to Europe's democratic civilization, which could pacify its
  citizen-enemies only by reasonably equitable sociomaterial rewards.

<b></b>

<p>
One especially effective form of recompense, Freud notes, is
identification with the "cultural ideal," which consoles both oppressed
and privileged classes, "since the right to despise the people outside
it compensates them for the wrongs they suffer within": "No doubt one
is a wretched plebeian, harassed by debts and military service; but,
to make up for it, one is a Roman citizen, one has one's share in the
task of ruling other nations and dictating their laws" (<i>FI,</i>
17). So it is for the Londoners ("poor people all of them") who wait
swelled with pride by Buckingham Palace for "the Proime Minister's kyar"
while dreaming of "the heavenly life divinely bestowed upon Kings" no
less than for the already "upright" Clarissa, who "stiffen[s]" further
at any manifestation of Empire and sees "character," "something inborn
in the race; what Indians respected," in the Palace's "four-square"
architecture (<i>MD,</i> 12-9, "BS," 153). So it is for the imperial
Lady Bexborough, who "opened a bazaar" with the telegram informing her
of her youngest son's death in her hand, and for Mr. Bowley, in whose
"British breast" the breeze ruffles "some flag flying" (<i>MD,</i> 5,
20). And so it ought to be but is not for Doris Kilman. When she loses
her livelihood because she cannot pretend that all Germans are villains,
England's cultural ideal ceases to be hers, as it has ceased to be
international. Her aggression, which the civilization that subjects
her is supposed to reward her for renouncing, then erupts in a "violent
grudge against the world" (<i>MD,</i> 129).

<p>
What prevents Miss Kilman (an "outlaw" and "brigand" in the draft) from
acting on her urge to "fell" Clarissa, if not that she is civilized, that
she has a conscience (<i>H,</i> 202)? In Freud's analysis, self-policing
"conscience," not external police, is civilization's most powerful weapon
against aggressive instincts, which civilization can frustrate but never
destroy (<i>CD,</i> 70). The repository of civilization's prohibitions,
conscience absorbs forbidden aggression and redirects it against the self,
producing unconscious guilt.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
  By this means civilization transforms its enemies into agents: it
  restrains each individual's "aggression by weakening and disarming
  it and by setting up an agency within him to watch over it, like
  a garrison in a conquered city"--though at the cost of "a loss of
  happiness" (<i>CD,</i> 71, 81). While Miss Kilman takes pride in her
  virtue, "out of her meagre income set[ting] aside so much for causes
  she believed in," her civilized state--her conscience--has obviously
  not been bought and paid for by her society (<i>MD,</i> 125). Even the
  London poor, the vagrant woman who grins at Richard, the servants to
  whom Clarissa sends "love" at her parties, let alone the ruling-class
  Bexboroughs, Dalloways, and Prime Minister, are better compensated
  than she (<i>MD,</i> 165). Yet conscience forbids her to "ease" her
  "hot and painful" rage and redirects her aggression against herself
  (<i>MD,</i> 124). In precise proportion to the fact that she <i>is</i>
  civilized, she is wracked by suppressed and thwarted appetites, envy,
  self-pity, self-reproach.

<p>
For consolation and hope, the aggrieved Miss Kilman turns to "Russia,"
which helps her to manage homicidal rage without veering into suicidal
despair by converting violent envy into ideological aggression against
Clarissa and her kind. "With all this luxury," she thinks, looking at
Clarissa's Reynolds engraving while imagining a communized Mrs. Dalloway
laboring in a shop or factory, "what hope was there for a better state
of things?"; "She could not help being ugly; . . . Clarissa Dalloway
had laughed--but she

<b></b>

would . . . think of Russia; until she reached the pillar-box"
(<i>MD,</i> 124, 128-9). "Russia"--an alternative civilization, a more
just cultural ideal--sanctions her contempt for such emblems of the
old order as Clarissa. Her career "absolutely ruined" by the England
for which her brother died, Miss Kilman stands like a powder keg near
Russia's still-smoldering revolution (<i>MD,</i> 130). Her socialist
fantasies illustrate Keynes's warning that to bring "economic ruin"
upon "great countries" by "political tyranny and injustice" is to foment
revolution--thus far forestalled in Central Europe only by its failure to
offer any "prospect of improvement whatever" (indeed, for all her misery,
Miss Kilman is still in London).
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>

<p>
When "Russia" fails, Miss Kilman "th[inks] of God," parodying Marx's
attack on religion as palliating the masses' suffering without curing
its social causes (<i>MD,</i> 124). Her religious practice amounts to a
strenuous effort to fortify her conscience against her violent outrage,
for "two years three months" after "Our Lord had come to her," her
"Bitter and burning" anger remains unappeased. Thoughts of God bring
not peace or mystical ecstasy but a holy warrior's righteousness: "Rage
was succeeded by calm. A sweet savour filled her veins, her lips parted,
and, standing formidable upon the landing in her mackintosh, she looked
with steady and sinister serenity at Mrs. Dalloway," savoring imminent
"religious victory" (<i>MD,</i> 124-5). Although her vow to "t;
vanquish; have faith in God" restrains her violence, neither Russia
nor religion soothes her "hot and turbulent feelings" or the worldly
desires she is too poor, homely, and oppressed to satisfy ("It was the
flesh that she must control") (<i>MD,</i> 124-9).

<p>
Abandoned by Elizabeth and assailed by "shocks of suffering," Miss
Kilman remains suspended between those strange bedfellows God and Russia
as she makes her lonely way through "all the commodities of the world"
out of the Army Navy Stores and into "that other sanctuary, the Abbey,"
where she kneels in dogged prayer among "reverent, middle class, English
men and women, some of them desirous of seeing the wax works" (<i>MD,</i>
133). The narrative pointedly declines to dissociate God and the soul from
commodities, nationalism, and class. Whereas better-fed Londoners find
"God . . . accessible and the path to Him smooth," Miss Kilman, hiding
her face in twitching hands, "struggle[s]" "to aspire above the vanities,
the desires, the commodities, to rid herself both of hatred and of love,
. . . so rough the approach to her God--so tough her desires" (<i>MD,</i>
133-4). So laboring, she "impresse[s]" the well-fixed Londoners with
"her largeness, robustness, and power"--Mr. Fletcher, Mrs. Dalloway,
"the Rev. Edward Whittaker, and Elizabeth too" (ibid.). Religious
warrior, communist sympathizer, unwitting prophet of a humiliated and
downtrodden Germany's working-class hero, Miss Kilman in her starved
longing "for a better state of things" is a casualty of the nationalist
hatreds against which Keynes inveighed. She stands as a small, ominous
emblem of the economic ruin of great countries and a portent of revenge
tragedy, counterposed to the effaced German elegy--an "ancient song" of
"love which prevails"--sung by another "battered woman" in the street
at the Regent's Park Tube station.
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>

<p>
More striking, finally, than the differences between Clarissa's
ineffectual noblesse oblige and Miss Kilman's odious righteousness are
their odd affinities. "Miss Kilman

<b></b>

would do anything for the Russians, starved herself for the Austrians,"
thinks Clarissa, in whom luxury has bred a lighter, freer, if not more
honest or noble conscience;



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
she was never in the room five minutes without making you feel her
superiority, your inferiority; how poor she was; how rich you were;
how she lived in a slum without a cushion or a bed or a rug or whatever
it might be, all her soul rusted with that grievance sticking in it,
her dismissal from school during the War--poor embittered unfortunate
creature! [<i>MD,</i> 12]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Unlike the aptly named Miss Kilman, who must be very, very good in order
not to be positively criminal, the pampered Clarissa has no need of a
heavy-duty conscience. She takes her privilege for granted, confuses
Armenians with Albanians, tosses threadbare cushions to her servants
"in gratitude . . . for helping her to be like this, . . . gentle,
generous-hearted," and rides the coattails of Richard's social conscience
from the haven of her sofa.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
  Claiming "to wish everybody merely to be themselves," she yet
  finds the idea of praying shut up in a room "nauseating," and she is
  "really shocked" by the glowering Miss Kilman: "This a Christian--this
  woman! This woman had taken her daughter from her! She in touch with
  invisible presences! Heavy, ugly, commonplace, without kindness or
  grace, she know the meaning of life!" (<i>MD,</i> 125-6, 117). Yet
  hardly does she project on her "the power and taciturnity of some
  prehistoric monster armoured for primeval warfare" than "hatred (which
  was for ideas, not people) crumble[s]" and Clarissa laughs in relief
  to see her "los[e] her malignity" and become "merely Miss Kilman,
  in a mackintosh, whom Heaven knows Clarissa would have liked to help"
  (<i>MD,</i> 126).

<p>
For her part, Miss Kilman's conscience is weighty in proportion to the
mass of rage ithas had to absorb and find some nominally civilized alibi
for. In truth she would far rather resemble than despise Clarissa, and
if she did, she would not need the righteousness that weighs her down:
"she minded looking as she did beside Clarissa. . . . But why wish to
resemble her? . . . She despised Mrs. Dalloway . . . Her life was a
tissue of vanity and deceit. Yet Doris Kilman had . . . very nearly
burst into tears when Clarissa Dalloway laughed at her" (<i>MD,</i>
128). As the ur-Clarissa reflects, "All men were brothers. For that
very reason, one must hate some of them, as one hated part of oneself"
(<i>H,</i> 271). As Clarissa glimpses her role in creating the monster
she mistakes for Miss Kilman, Miss Kilman admits her secret wish to be
like this woman she pretends has no virtues. No one wins this contest,
but it shows that insofar as Miss Kilman is a monster, she is one created
by the social system--a casualty of an economic war between the wars,
a mute witness to Britain's unacknowledged tyranny.

<b></b>

<p>
Is Septimus Warren Smith mad or does he have a message? That he is mad
would seem indisputable; even sympathetic discussions cast him as a war
victim, not a prophet.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
  Yet <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s postwar world of multifarious and contested
  realities pits Septimus's reality against that of his doctors to
  frame "madness" as censored truth. If, as Michel Foucault argues,
  civilization disciplines madness to suppress its truths, art recaptures
  truths branded madness to confront the world with the necessity of
  change: "by the madness which interrupts it, a work of art opens a
  void, a moment of silence, . . . where the world is forced to question
  itself. . . . [T]he world finds itself arraigned by that work of art
  and responsible before it for what it is."
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>

<p>
<i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s opening scenes frame this contestation of a
multiplicitous reality as an outworn monotheism confronts an immanent
modernist cosmos. Clarissa's cutting-edge metaphor "another throw of the
dice" is way ahead of Einstein's mistaken objection, "God does not play
dice," in the 1926 controversy over Heisenberg's quantum theory.
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
  In <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s cosmos God does not play dice, for God does
  not exist. Fate plays dice. As the infinite possibilities that ride the
  crest of time collapse moment by moment into events, fate is arbitrary,
  time irreversible, disaster, suffering, and death inevitable if also
  unpredictable, and promises of heaven obsolete. Old transcendences
  metamorphose into an airplane swooping "like a skater . . . or a
  dancer" to leave an advertising slogan in a melting trail of smoke.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
  No two groundlings whose caves meet "daylight" at this moment
  read this celestial sign in quite the same way. "'Glaxo,' said
  Mrs. Coates in a strained, awe-stricken voice"; "'Kreemo', murmured
  Mrs. Bletchley, like a sleep-walker"; "It's toffee," murmured
  Mr. Bowley; "So, thought Septimus, . . . they are signalling to me";
  "Hadn't Mrs. Dempster always longed to see foreign parts?"; "a bright
  spark; an aspiration; a concentration; a symbol (so it seemed to
  Mr. Bentley, vigorously rolling his strip of turf at Greenwich) of
  man's soul; of his determination . . . to get outside his body, beyond
  his house, by means of thought, Einstein, speculation, mathematics,
  the Mendelian theory" (<i>MD,</i> 20-8). Meanwhile, the earthbound
  counterpart of this heavenly sign, the inscrutable state motorcar
  ("probably the Queen, thought Mrs. Dalloway"), stops traffic in Bond
  Street with a loud backfire--a parodic "voice of authority" that
  rouses "the spirit of religion," "her eyes bandaged tight and her
  lips gaping wide" (<i>MD,</i> 16, 14). Stirring nationalist piety in
  bystanders of every class, this blind spirit of monarchy and monotheism
  constellates analeatory community of spectators marveling at manmade
  miracles, even as transcendencefalls into immanence, revelation into
  high-tech marketing stunts, cathedrals into waxworks,divinely invested
  monarchs into a blank though "enduring symbol" of England's "majesty"
  (<i>MD,</i> 16). Loss of monovocal authority becomes gain as the
  weird enchanting harmonies of irreducible differences surround and
  displace the totalizing "spirit" in their midst.

<p>
Freud's meditations on Europe's future in <i>The Future of an Illusion</i>
and <i>Civilization</i> and Its Discontents illuminate the contending
poetries, or metaphysics, of Miss Kilman's religious belief, England's
nationalist religion, Clarissa's stoic atheism, and, not least, Septimus's
war experience. Consigning religion--"perhaps the most important item
in the psychical inventory of a civilization," without which many feel
life would be intolerable--to humanity's childhood, Freud advocates an
"<i>education to reality</i>" (<i>FI,</i> 81).

<b></b>

Such an education would teach that sexuality and aggression are profound
and ineradicable human instincts; that civilization must continually be
fought for in the unceasing "battle of the giants" Eros and Death for
"world dominion"; and that creative endeavors to make life "tolerable
for everyone and civilization no longer oppressive to anyone" console
for the renunciations civilization demands better than can illusions
of a heavenly afterlife (<i>CD,</i> 69; <i>FI,</i> 82). The European
religions, he complains, depict a cosmos so lacking in rationality and
realism as to reduce believers to childish credulity. They falsely soothe
an infantile "need for a father's protection" from sufferings inflicted
by nature and humanity, exacerbate unconscious aggression and guilt
by holding up impossible ethical ideals such as the Golden Rule, and
foster hopes of "Heaven" that promote passivity and dissipate creative
energies (<i>CD,</i> 19). An "education to reality," by contrast, would
emphasize science, which subjects its accounts of reality to empirical
verification, and art, which claims no transcendent authority. People
so educated would find consolation in scientific understanding of the
world and in such pleasurable pursuits as relationships, thought and
creativity, power to act in and change the world, nature, beauty, and
art. Freed from religion's "bitter-sweet . . . poison," humanity would
grow up: it would abandon fantasies of a beneficent Providence, accept
its helpless and insignificant place in the cosmos, resign itself to
fate (those aspects of life not susceptible of change), and direct its
"liberated energies" toward improving life for all here and now, leaving
"heaven to the angels and the sparrows" (<i>FI,</i> 81-2, 82n).

<p>
When Freud speculated that the "experiment of an irreligious education"
might yield "hope for the future," a "treasure" to "enrich civilization,"
his English publisher--a daughter of agnostics educated at home, not
in institutions long steeped in Church sponsorship--had already created
such treasures.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
  The skeptic Clarissa and the scapegoat Septimus dramatize the power
  of art, thought, and imagination to face reality and console for loss
  in this late age of the world's experience when "simply one doesn't
  believe . . . any more in God"; and the novel's odd-affinities ontology
  and immanent cosmos anticipate Freud's this-worldly philosophy ("BS,"
  158). At the crossroads between modern Europe's (first) civil war
  and its uncertain future, Freud's meditations on the aggression that
  threatens civilization from within resonate with Septimus's message;
  and his advocacy of art, philosophy and science over religious
  "illusion," with Clarissa's arduous belief that "life"--though
  poised over an abyss, unwatched by any Providence, unredeemed by any
  heaven--is "enough" (<i>MD,</i> 121-2).

<p>
Never spoken in so many words, Septimus's message exists as a depth-charge
in his character, story, and fate. A prophetic witness to the aggression
instinctive in human nature and ineradicable from European civilization,
he brings the war home in his very person. He not only exposes his
fellow citizens' "really fearful . . . 'settling down'" as though the
war had never been, as Katherine Mansfield put it; he brings the war
home as <i>their</i> war, <i>their violence</i>, which they disavow in
a contestation of reality to the death.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
  Tortured by the memory of Evans blown to bits before his eyes,
  confessing that he has "committed a crime," besieged by guilt at
  being alive but unable to feel, Septimus entertains the possibility
  "that the world itself is without meaning" (<i>MD,</i> 88).

<b></b>

To salvage its <i>meaning</i>, he tries to attest to the collective
murder his civilization has commissioned from him, to offer a "truth"
on which to rebuild civilization more lastingly. While Sir William
Bradshaw and Dr. Holmes--gatekeepers of a society strategically blind
to its own violence--pathologize his reality as "the deferred effects
of shell shock," he tries to "tell the whole world"; when that fails,
he acts out his "astonishing revelation" through his sacrificial death
(<i>MD,</i> 183, 70). Although Septimus loses his life in this poetry
contest, <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> captures his "truth" for the real-world
contest between Love and Death that art, like Keynes's "moral book,"
may aspire to influence.

<p>
Septimus too is an elegiac consciousness. Despite his overwhelming grief,
he is not inconsolable but struggles in his own way to survive his
message--to communicate it without being driven insane in the elegiac
progress toward life and the future that his suicide interrupts. Since
his "brain [i]s perfect"--he can read the <i>Inferno</i> and add up
his bill--he surmises that "it must be the fault of the world" that "he
could not feel" (<i>MD,</i> 88). Yet he does feel extremes of ecstasy
and pain as his wavering gaze takes in the ravishing phenomenal world,
its breathtaking beauty intensified in proportion to his devastation. He
is amazed to tears by the mysterious "smoke words languishing and melting
in the sky and bestowing upon him in their inexhaustible charity and
laughing goodness one shape after another of unimaginable beauty and
signalling their intention to provide him, for nothing, for ever, for
looking merely, with beauty, more beauty!" (<i>MD,</i> 21-2). Everything
sings to him: Evans sings "from behind the tree," sparrows sing in
Greek, the word <i>time</i> "split[s] its husk," Rezia's voice lapses
into "contented melody," sounds make "harmonies with premeditation,"
even silence sings, "the spaces between . . . as significant as the
sounds" (<i>MD,</i> 70, 69, 146, 22). His rushing thoughts tumble out
revelation after revelation. "Scientifically speaking," he theorizes,
"the flesh was melted off the world," his body "macerated until only
the nerve fibres were left," "spread like a veil upon a rock"; "I have
been dead and yet am now alive," he hazards (<i>MD,</i> 68-9). To his
"ode to Time" a pastoral, symbolically reborn Evans sings antiphonally
that the dead wait in Thessaly for the war's end when they will return,
then suddenly materializes as Peter Walsh on the path: "'For God's sake
don't come!' . . . But the branches parted. . . . It was Evans! But no
mud was on him; no wounds. . . . I must tell the whole world, Septimus
cried . . . (as the dead man in the grey suit came nearer)" (<i>MD,</i>
70). Where his insupportable memories meet "daylight," the everyday
world splinters into the incandescent visions, music, and poetry that
hold him to life.

Paul Fussell documents the chasm between the incommunicable reality
experienced by the English soldiers at the front and the jingoistic
sentimentality of civilians in England.
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
  Back "home" ("avoid the use of the word Home," notes Bradshaw),
  Septimus's boss, Mr. Brewer, applauds his distinguished war service and
  promotes him "to a post of considerable responsibility"; Septimus,
  appalled and revolted by the patriotic lies by which his fellow
  Londoners transform collective murder into "pleasurable . . . emotion"
  and himself into a war hero, is diagnosed as mad (<i>H,</i> 138;
  <i>MD,</i> 88). Sir William inquires,

Captured and stilled in the work of art, Septimus's stammer interrupts
the tanklike momentum of the heroic social script ventriloquized by
Rezia and Sir William. Like a vulnerable body before their smoothly
rolling sentences, his broken utterances mark the site of a reality, the
<i>appalling crime</i> of war, against which their supposedly transparent
"sane truth" appears unreal and insane.
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>

<p>
Septimus's doctors act as agents for a society that scapegoats him for
bringing home the murderous aggression it would disavow, that projects
its aggression upon him and expels him, its symbolic embodiment, so that
he seems to bear it away. But the scapegoat who does not suffer silently
turns victimage into prophecy.
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
  While Rezia, following doctors' orders, exhorts Septimus to "'Look'" at
  the everyday sights in Regent's Park, a different reality absorbs him:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Look the unseen bade him, the voice which now communicated with him who
was the greatest of mankind, Septimus, lately taken from life to death,
the Lord who had come to renew society, . . . suffering for ever, the
scapegoat, the eternal sufferer, but he did not want it, he moaned,
putting from him with a wave of his hand that eternal suffering, that
eternal loneliness. . . . "Oh look," she implored him. But what was
there to look at? A few sheep. That was all. [<i>MD,</i> 25-6]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
What are a few sheep to a scapegoat "come to renew society"?--



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
the lord of men . . . called forth in advance of the mass of men to hear
the truth, to learn the meaning, which now at last, after all the toils
of civilisation--Greeks, Romans,

<b></b>

Shakespeare, Darwin, and now himself--was to be given whole to . . . "To
whom?" he asked aloud. "To the Prime Minister," the voices which rustled
above his head replied . . . these profound truths which needed, so
deep were they, so difficult, an immense effort to speak out, but the
world was entirely changed by them forever. [<i>MD,</i> 67]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
From his scapegoat's perspective, Septimus's premonition of the "birth
of a new religion" (or an old one always in need of rebirth) is sane
(<i>MD,</i> 23). If the world could avow its violence, would it not
be radically altered, redeemed from its lies, filled with the power to
atone for and even renounce it? Meanwhile, his doctors--civilization's
well-compensated disciplinarians--seek to ensure that the scapegoat
stays a victim: "when a man . . . says he is Christ . . . &amp; has a
message, . . . society appoints the doctor to shut him up till he is
cured. . . . Sir William not only prospered himself but saw to it that
England should prosper too" (<i>H,</i> 149-50; cf. <i>MD,</i> 99). Making
rounds in his sleek motorcar with his wife nestled in silvery furs,
Bradshaw is "the judge, the saviour, the super man, in whose hands powers
of life &amp; death were lodged, torture, isolation; the great gaoler;
the heavy compassionate man, who had seen so much of this sort of thing,
. . . made an excellent after dinner speech, &amp; was at the top of his
tree" (<i>H,</i> 142). As Bradshaw lists reasons why Septimus must not
kill himself ("King George. . . . [D]uty, &amp; self-sacrifice, &amp;
humour &amp; courage &amp; the family"), Septimus muses on the oil
portrait of Lady Bradshaw over the mantelpiece and Bradshaw's income
of "&#163;10,000 a year" and objects, "But life . . . offers no such
bounty to us. . . . And perhaps there is no God. [Sir William] shrugged
his shoulders" (<i>H,</i> 154). Having "devour[ed] Shakespeare, Darwin,
<i>The History of Civilisation,</i> and Bernard Shaw," Septimus grasps
his meaning:the "whole world was clamouring: Kill yourself, kill yourself,
for our sakes" (<i>MD,</i> 85, 92).

<p>
Back "home," in short, Septimus is fated to know "everything," to grasp
"the meaning of the world," and to bear the burden of witnessing his
civilization's unimaginable violence without being driven mad (<i>MD,</i>
66). "The War had taught him," for example, "the message hidden in the
beauty" of even Shakespeare's words, sacred text of the civilization he
went to war to "save":



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The secret signal which one generation passes, under disguise, to the
next is loathing, hatred, despair. Dante the same. Aeschylus (translated)
the same. . . . [H]uman beings have neither kindness, nor faith, nor
charity. . . . They hunt in packs . . . scour the desert and vanish
screaming into the wilderness. They desert the fallen. . . . Brewer at the
office, . . . brutality blared out on placards; men were trapped in mines;
women burnt alive; and once a maimed file of lunatics . . . ambled and
nodded and grinned past him. . . . And would <i>he</i> go mad? [<i>MD,</i>
86, 88-90]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Lone witness of a reality that everyone around him denies, Septimus fends
off madness even as this incommunicable reality consumes the mundane
world. Beckoning airplanes, whispering trees, birds speaking Greek,
Evans cleansed and whole--all threaten to "sen[d] him mad. But he would
not go mad. He would shut his eyes; he would see no more" (<i>MD,</i> 22).

<p>
Septimus's "insane truth" is still truth, in face of which "not to be
mad would amount to another form of madness."
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
  He suffers, owns, and tries to bear witness to his

<b></b>

civilization's "appalling crime" but is finally forced to reenact it
through a death that he <i>expects to be read</i>--a death that he
offers as a gift, and that the narrative insulates from dismissal as
madness. Bathed in the light of his last afternoon, he tests his sanity,
looking cautiously at objects in his room and finding with relief that
"None of these things moved. All were still; all were real"; "He would
not go mad" (<i>MD,</i> 142). He does "not want to die":



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
why should he kill himself for their sakes? . . . Besides . . . there
was a luxury in it, an isolation full of sublimity; a freedom which the
attached can never know. Holmes had won of course. . . . But even Holmes
. . . could not touch this last relic straying on the edge of the world,
this outcast, who gazed back at the inhabited regions, who lay, like a
drowned sailor, on the shore of the world. [<i>MD,</i> 92-3]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The sun feels hot, life good, the future full of possibilities that emerge
in miniature in the hat he and Rezia, laughing together "like married
people," create for Mrs. Peters (<i>MD,</i> 143). Now the world's found
order ("Mrs. Peters had a spiteful tongue. Mr. Peters was in Hull")
seems not in the least "terrible"; his writings and drawings seem
"insane. all about death, nightingales"; his fear of "falling down,
down into the flames!" momentarily abates: "Miracles, revelations,
agonies, loneliness, falling through the sea, . . . all were burnt out,
for he had a sense, as he watched Rezia trimming the straw hat . . . of
a coverlet of flowers" (<i>H,</i> 313; <i>MD,</i> 141-3). He foreknows
that he must sacrifice his elegiac progress, perform the revelation no
one heeds. But, feeling "Every power pour[] its treasures on his head"
as his heart sings "Fear no more," he delays "till the very last moment"
the death in which two realities converge: the suicide his society
demands and, as Clarissa somehow divines, "an attempt to communicate"
(<i>MD,</i> 139, 149, 184). He is pushed, yet he also jumps. He frames
his death as the antithesis of madness, "an immense effort to speak out"
difficult, "profound truths"; an offering, a sacrifice, a gift to "human
beings": "what did <i>they</i> want? . . . 'I'll give it you!' he cried"
(<i>MD,</i> 149). Might recognition of his gift not help refound his
civilization on firmer, more lasting ground? If so, is he mad to think
that he dies for the sins of the world, dies so that others may live?

<p>
Through the artwork that reclaims his death from obscurity, Septimus
bequeathes his message to the future. His suicide, pathologized by Sir
William and Richard to promote the shell shock bill, is received by
Clarissa precisely as a message: "defiance," a Houdini-like escape from
soul-destroying doctors, a Shelleyan "plunge[] holding his treasure"
(<i>MD,</i> 184; cf. <i>H,</i> 386, where Shelley's name appears). In
her spontaneous private elegy for him, his death inversely mirrors
her life. Echoing "Adonais," she reflects that the living "would grow
old," he never. By flinging his life away he has preserved "a thing
. . . that mattered," something "defaced, obscured in her own life," lost
"every day in corruption, lies, chatter" (<i>MD,</i> 184). In opposing
truth/treasure/death to lies/corruption/life, Clarissa confronts her
own Conversion--her compromised treasure, Sally's kiss. Channeling her
own rage and grief into social contestation, she indicts Sir William as
Conversion's agent--"a great doctor yet to her obscurely evil,

<b></b>

without sex or lust, extremely polite to women, but capable of
some indescribable outrage--forcing your soul"; such men "make life
intolerable" (<i>MD,</i> 184-5).

<p>
We shall return in a moment to the sexual crises Clarissa's language
evokes. Now Clarissa's anger turns inward as existential "terror,"
an "awful fear" of having wasted her life, seizes her: "it was her
disaster--her disgrace . . . her punishment. . . . She had schemed; she
had pilfered. She was never wholly admirable. She had wanted success. Lady
Bexborough and the rest of it. And once she had walked on the terrace at
Bourton" (<i>MD,</i> 185). At last she makes peace with her own defection
from love's "sublimity" as the price of the life with Richard that she
simply likes and, accepting this reality, glimpses her survival and
future in the old woman in the window opposite (<i>H,</i> 390). Rising
like a sylvan goddess in her green dress, Clarissa concludes her small
elegy with Septimus's fate and her own in equipoise:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
she did not pity him. . . . Fear no more the heat of the sun. . . . She
felt somehow very like him . . . glad that he had done it; thrown
it away. The clock was striking. The leaden circles dissolved in the
air. He made her feel the beauty; made her feel the fun. But she must
go back. [<i>MD,</i> 186]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Elegy's brutal principle of substitution dictates the emotional logic by
which the unknown young man's death helps her to embrace life, beauty,
fun, her party, all her consolations in face of time and inexorable
loss--"That's what I do it for" (<i>MD,</i> 121). Her elegiac progress
repeats in small her navigation from Sylvia's death through perilous
grief and rage to the existential consolation simply "that one day should
follow another," that she should "wake up in the morning; see the sky;
walk in the park; meet Hugh Whitbread; then suddenly in came Peter;
then these roses; it was enough" (<i>MD,</i> 122).

<p>
If Clarissa's elegy for Septimus is inadequate to arraign the world before
the truths it brands madness, <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> captures his message
within its fictional bounds for the world beyond them. Not Clarissa but
we readers receive (or not) the message of Septimus's death, the costs of
the war he names a "crime," the measure of what his life means to him, the
infinite possibilities of his unfurling days. Meanwhile, Clarissa reflects
on her conversion, acknowledges loss, and affirms the consolations that
reward the elegist's exigent bowing to reality. Let's return now to
Clarissa's brief flare of rage at Sir William, which illuminates the
protagonists' elegiac doubling as a splitting of authorial voice into
the sane survivor and the insane war veteran whom Woolf created partly
out of herself: "S's character. founded on R[upert Brooke?]? . . . or
founded on me? . . . might be left vague--as a mad person is . . . so can
be partly R.; partly me" (<i>H,</i> 418). Traces in the novel's genetic
text illuminate Woolf's transmutation of her harrowing experience of
"madness," and of the losses, grief, and rage that fueled it, into an
elegiac work of art that might influence the world. The Septimus who is
"partly" Woolf, these traces suggest, dies not only for his society's
"crime" of war but also for the violence that its ruling "father[s]"
visit upon women.

<p>
These words belong to a draft sequence that leads from Rezia's despairing
thoughts in Harley Street to Lady Bruton's luncheon. The London medical
establishment's "truth" forcibly embraces a "miserable rag &amp;
relic" of a soul who comes "fluttering . . . bereft of shelter, shade,
or refuge, naked, defenceless," to suffer "the terrific stamp of Sir
Williams rage. He swooped; he devoured. . . . Such decision, combined
with humanity, . . . endeared Sir William greatly to the relations of his
victims" (<i>H,</i> 155; cf. <i>MD,</i> 99-101). No reader of Woolf's
letters about her incarceration in a home for the insane could fail to
sense here the remembered "mad" "me" on which she drew for Septimus nor
the "raging furnace" of feelings about "madness and doctors and being
forced" that she "kept cooling in [her] mind" for years before she could
"touch it without bursting into flame all over."
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
  Refracting Septimus's war traumas through her experiences of the
  social system in action, Woolf discloses and disguises the tangled
  sources of "madness" in familial and societal dynamics, including her
  Duckworth half-brothers' incestuous abuse, the reactions of family,
  friends, and doctors to this history, her relations' power over her
  incarceration, and the pressures of "Proportion" and "Conversion"
  (<i>MD,</i> 100). In <i>The Hours</i> Septimus, like Woolf's "mad
  . . . me," hears nightingales sing Greek, Philomela's incestuous
  violation retooled to his war experience: "Evans was a Greek
  nightingale . . . &amp; now sang this ode, about death . . . 'And so
  I reached Greece'; where he joined the poets, in Thessaly" (<i>H,</i>
  66). In <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> nightingales become sparrows singing "in
  voices prolonged and piercing in Greek words, from trees in the meadow
  of life beyond a river where the dead walk, how there is no death"
  (<i>MD,</i> 24-5). Yet Septimus never ceases to be "partly" the ghost
  of that "me" who signed herself "Sparroy" to Violet Dickinson--one
  friend who could grasp a "truth" that might as well have been Greek
  to the society that exalted George Duckworth.
<sup><a name="REF61" href="#FOOT61">61</a></sup>

<p>
In creating a war veteran "partly" out of that former "me," Woolf
foreshadows her analysis in <i>Three Guineas</i> of the war at home,
the abuses of women under the social law of masculine and heterosexual
privilege. In <i>The Hours</i> and <i>Mrs. Dalloway,</i> women's telling
of truth and lies dramatizes their negotiations of elegiac inheritance,
sexuality, and social law in a civilization being rebuilt, perhaps,
on firmer ground. As Sacks observes, the critical question of communal
inheritance from the dead implicates the mourners' sexuality psychically
and legally. The old crises of narcissism and sexuality that mourning
awakens, inheritance must somehow resolve. Through same-sex attractions,
intimations of incest and madness, and conversion dramas, <i>The Hours</i>
and <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> expose systemic social violence as it governs
inheritance, dictates the

<b></b>

mourner's sexuality, and provokes the violent energies that the elegy
diverts from tragic enactment into social critique. More specifically,
women must choose between challenging social law and submitting to
it in exchange for socioeconomic rewards. Submission to the Goddess
of Conversion, as Clarissa knows, entails lies--silences, omissions,
censorship. Thus Lady Bradshaw has "gone under" fifteen years earlier:
"a nervous twitch" signals something "really painful to believe--that
the poor lady lied"; and Clarissa contrasts Septimus's uncorrupted
"treasure" with her youthful passion, renounced and now obscured by
"lies, corruption, chatter," as she consoles herself with the pleasures
her bargain has bought her (<i>MD,</i> 100-1). This recognition--her
legacy from Septimus--weighs conversion's advantages against its costs:
"she did not pity him"; she too has felt, "if it were now to die 'twere
now to be most happy"; still, life is enough (<i>MD,</i> 186, 184, 35).

<p>
<i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> depicts a social system in which sexual desire
and practice often diverge from law and publicity. Founded, as
Freud points out, on the suppression of women's desire, civilization
<i>sanctions</i>--punishes yet permits--incest and same-sex desire:
"incest is anti-social and civilization consists in a progressive
renunciation of it" ; "we may justly hold our civilization
responsible for the spread of neurasthenia" .
<sup><a name="REF62" href="#FOOT62">62</a></sup>
  As Freud explains the contradiction, the incest taboo imposes
  "perhaps the most drastic mutilation" of erotic life that civilization
  exacts; it is thus incompletely renounced in modern society. Although
  civilization polices sexuality as if it were a subject people--it fears
  revolt, enacts strict precautions, and inflicts "serious injustice"
  by dictating "a single kind of sexual life for everyone"--it cannot
  actually enforce its prohibitions and so must "pass over in silence
  many transgressions which, according to its own rescripts, it ought
  to have punished" (<i>CD,</i> 51-2). When Clarissa judges Sir William
  "obscurely evil, without sex or lust, extremely polite to women,
  but capable of some indescribable outrage," her specific exclusion of
  "sex or lust" in a context that has not raised any such issue invisibly
  flags a ghost of Woolf's "mad . . . me" who survives the doctor's dead
  patient. In <i>The Hours</i> her owning of Septimus's death as her
  disaster and disgrace leads to a vehement vow to "t Sir William
  Bradshaw. . . . She must go back; breast her enemy. . . . Never
  would she submit--never, never!" (<i>H,</i> 398-9). Later excised,
  this rather uncharacteristic outburst of social conscience alerts us
  to other scattered and muted deflections of violated sexuality in
  both texts, traces of Woolf's own negotiation of social law in the
  course of writing the novel.

<p>
Hard on the heels of the doctor so esteemed by his victims' relations,
<i>The Hours</i> portrays Hugh Whitbread, who regularly brings his wife
Evelyn (frequently visited by Clarissa "in a nursing home") to London
"to see doctors" (<i>MD,</i> 6). A freehand portrait of the incestuous
George Duckworth, the "admirable Hugh" captures his smug prosperity,
sartorial magnificence, "little job at Court," and the "scrupulou[s]
little courtesies &amp; old fashioned ways" that have kept him "afloat
on the cream of English society for fifty-five years"--just George's
age in 1923.
<sup><a name="REF63" href="#FOOT63">63</a></sup>
  Although Hugh is one of the few characters into whose psychic cave
  the narrator does not venture, the ur-narrator hints sardonically at
  what his impeccable facade conceals: "a little information about the
  subconscious self &amp; Dr Freud had leaked into him"; "He had heard
  of Freud &amp; Stravinsky. . . .

<b></b>

His affections were understood to be deep"; "one or two humble reforms
to his credit" include his undersigning of many long "letters on girls,
&amp; stamp out . . . nuisances [<i>sic</i>]," "nor did any girl lose
her place in his household without being kept sight of" (<i>H,</i>
156-7). <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> leaves all this on the cuttingroom floor,
substituting a double entendre ("malicious" rumors that Hugh "now kept
guard at Buckingham Palace, dressed in silk stockings and knee-breeches,
over what nobody knew") and an oblique note that "servant girls had
reason to be grateful to him" (<i>MD,</i> 103).

<p>
The ur-narrator now hands off Hugh, swathed in innuendo, to Lady Bruton's
secretary, Milly Brush, who is so irritated by his inquiries after her
brother that "she was almost inclined to tell him about her brother,
except that she was almost killed her brother [denied once that she]
told a lie once about her brother. &amp; would have done so, had it not
seemed <i>margin</i>: never let on that her brother was not" (<i>H,</i>
157). Was the ur-Milly Brush almost killed [by] her brother, or did she
almost kill him--or, as her self-interfering grammar suggests, both? What
does she deny/lie about, deny lying about, and/or never let on about? Who
or what was or is her brother, or was/is he not? <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>'s
narrator affects not to know, indeed, tells us less: Hugh always asks
"after her brother in South Africa, which, for some reason, Miss Brush
. . . so much resented that she said 'Thank you, he's doing very well
in South Africa,' when, for half a dozen years, he had been doing badly
in Portsmouth" (<i>MD,</i> 103). As the narrative screws down the lid
over a site of near-fatal sibling violence, Milly Brush silently mocks
her interlocutor with the subaltern's lie.

<p>
Nothing in <i>The Hours</i> or <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> suggests scattered
cinders from Woolf's furnace of white-hot memories more vividly than
the narrative convergence of this brother, Milly's incoherent lies, and
the George-like Hugh, so solicitous, as it were, of servant girls, in a
scene that covertly links the gender dynamics surrounding revelations of
sexual violence to women's public speech. The specter of gender-marked
"madness" (and familially engineered incarceration) as implements in the
social control of "truth" hovers over the ur-Miss Brush, who seems to
survive her separate sorrows by sheltering under her powerful employer's
wing--a shadowy, diminished double of Lady Millicent Bruton. For her part,
Lady Bruton "should have been a general of dragoons" but exhibits her
own crippled relation to truth, speech, and social power in her "battle"
to compose a letter to the <i>Times,</i> for which, feeling "the futility
of her own womanhood as she felt it on no other occasion," she finally
commandeers the expertise of none other than Hugh (<i>MD,</i> 105, 109).

<p>
Hugh's sleaziness emerges more explicitly in the drama of truth and lies
surrounding a rumor that he once kissed Sally Seton in the smoking-room
at Bourton. (Innocuous as it sounds, the furor around this incident
suggests that, like Richard's kiss in <i>The Voyage Out,</i> it stands in
for sexual transgressions ruled unspeakable by actual and internalized
censors.) Having fled her "intolerable" home for Bourton, the brilliant
young rebel Sally educated the "sheltered" Clarissa in "sex . . . social
problems . . . life, how they were to reform the world" and "abolish
private property" (<i>H,</i> 43; <i>MD,</i> 33). In <i>The Hours</i>
Peter recalls a heated debate on women's suffrage, he and Sally pro,
Richard and Hugh con:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Prostitutes . . . came in; &amp; "the poor women in Piccadilly" she
called them; &amp; Hugh flushed, &amp; hitched his trousers up. . . . He
said nobody could tell what his mother meant to him . . . &amp; Sally
was down right rude &amp; echoed "your mother of course your mother["]
. . . she told Hugh that he represented all that was most detestable
in the British middle classes. She considered him responsible for the
state of those poor girls. [<i>H,</i> 76, 86]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Sally, it seems, taxed Hugh with complicity in a social system in which
middle- and upper-class men exploit lower-class women to preserve the
supposed purity of their disenfranchised mothers, wives, and daughters,
and he retaliated by forcing himself on her sexually.
<sup><a name="REF64" href="#FOOT64">64</a></sup>
  Peter's memory is hampered by the fact that "nobody ever knew what
  happened--it was considered too awful--whether he kissed her or not,
  merely brushed against her, . . . it had to be hushed up . . . Clarissa
  murmured something mysterious--but nobody could believe a word against
  the admirable Hugh, . . . always a perfect gentleman" (<i>H,</i>
  79). At the party Sally confirms the story and adds that Clarissa
  "Simply laughed" when she went to her "in a rage" (<i>H,</i> 403). In
  <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> Clarissa sees "her old friend Hugh, talking
  to the Portuguese Ambassador," and recalls how Sally accused him,
  "of all people . . . of kissing her in the smoking-room" (that male
  preserve), so that Clarissa had



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
to persuade her not to denounce him at family prayers--which she was
capable of doing with her daring, her recklessness, her melodramatic love
of being the centre of everything and creating scenes, and it was bound
. . . to end in some awful tragedy; her death; her martyrdom; instead of
which she had married, quite unexpectedly, a bald man . . . who owned
. . . cotton mills at Manchester. And she had five boys! [<i>MD,</i>
181-2]
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Nowhere to be found in the suffrage debate, Clarissa defended Hugh "of
all people" by silencing Sally at family prayers, of all places--family
piety the cornerstone of a social system that protects men like Hugh by
hushing up "truth" in the name of a hypocritical propriety.

<p>
Yet in her own mind Clarissa is not simply protecting Hugh but saving
Sally from her own reckless idealism--from "awful tragedy," "death,"
"martyrdom." Her reaction stages the question of what genre shall govern
Sally's life: the revenge tragedy that denouncing Hugh to a society
that is a father might set in motion? a martyrdom like Septimus's? or an
elegiac conversion narrative like her own? Notwithstanding the ur-Clarissa
who vows to t her "enemy" and never submit, Clarissa has submitted
to social law for the sake of life, beauty, fun. She recoils from the
danger of ting for truth and dictates conversion--lies--for Sally,
too. And her influence takes. Sally, "that romantic, that brilliant
creature" whose kiss ("a sudden revelation," "an illumination," "the
religious feeling!") holds out a protestant alternative to the patriarchal
religion of family prayers, and who shares Clarissa's "obscure dread"
of marriage ("catastrophe," "doom," "going out to be slaughtered"),
marries "a rich . . . cotton spinner" and has "five enormous boys"--a
generic outcome that strikes Peter as "a little off the mark" (<i>H,</i>
80, 47; <i>MD,</i> 32, 34-5, 171).

<b></b>

<p>
The Goddess of Conversion could display no prouder trophy than Lady
Rosseter. The bold and visionary Sally suppresses her passion for
truth to become a very paragon of conventional prosperous matronhood,
amply rewarded by social position, the sexual fulfillment her teeming
progeny suggest, and a leisurely country life in which she rarely reads
a newspaper. Her conversion affirms Freud's gendered divide between a
"civilization" that "has become increasingly the business of men," who
sustain it through "instinctual sublimations of which women are little
capable," and women's familial and sexual domain, which civilization
"force[s] into the background" (<i>CD,</i> 50-1). Whereas the penniless
Sally would "reform the world" on behalf of women and the poor, the
complacent Lady Rosseter has converted her claim on her civilization's
future into individual salvation through a marriage that indeed spells
doom for Sally's "Radical" politics (<i>MD,</i> 154).

<p>
Lady Rosseter's conversion attests to civilization's deep pockets
in buying off witnesses to the barbarities within--to some extent,
the lying Milly Brush suggests, even that seventh child Virginia, who
hid truth behind fiction's "immense facades" in forging her former "mad
. . . me" into Septimus. Yet the sibylline testimony of <i>The Hours</i>
and <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> intimates the ways Woolf's elegiac art mediated
the memories of incest, madness, and social law that threatened to
immolate her. The genres open to that remembered "me" would seem to
correspond roughly to the fates Clarissa pictures for Sally: a tragic
death by unjust social law; unsung martyrdom; suicide as an "embrace" or
"attempt to communicate"; revenge, or the eruption of grief into murderous
rage; elegiac conversion. In transforming that fluttering, bereft, naked,
miserable, defenceless rag and relic of a soul into Septimus--one of
the most astonishing characters in modern literature--Woolf wrests
from her losses, grief, and life-threatening rage this work of art:
a symbolic inheritance that lays her old self to rest (at least for a
time) by bringing her to "life." As Clarissa's small elegy for Septimus
is also an elegy for a buried self, Woolf's great postwar elegy for
"all deaths &amp; sorrows" enfolds a secret elegy for a self her art
resurrects from ignominious death for something like tragedy or martyrdom,
barely legible as she is in the work's palimpsest.
<sup><a name="REF65" href="#FOOT65">65</a></sup>
  Septimus--not just his death but the life of suffering and
  witness that endows its gift--is her monument, a fictional facade
  over autobiographical truth in a work of art that arraigns its
  civilization and holds it responsible to itself for what it is. In
  ventriloquizing her "mad" "me" through Septimus, Woolf heeds yet
  eludes the censors--Dr. Savage, Kitty, Julia, George, even perhaps
  Vanessa--that her fluttering relic of a soul must have heard cry,
  Kill yourself, for our sakes.

<p>
In vanquishing the life-threatening forces that beset her, Woolf,
like Clarissa, emerges as an elegist-hero who ts death and the
void and returns from the battlefield bearing trophies of consolation,
flaunting her powers of survival: "A new [elegy] by Virginia Woolf";
"This is what I have made of it!" (<i>MD,</i> 43, cf. <i>EE,</i>
226). A triumph of elegiac conversion, <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> transforms
a destroyed "mad . . . me" into a symbolic consolation in which she,
disguised as Septimus, poor devil of both sexes, dies for the sins
of the world, dies so that others may live. He does not want it. Why
"rage and prophesy? Why fly scourged and outcast?" (<i>MD,</i> 142)
Why indeed? Not because he is insane

<b></b>

but because the world is; only because the sins and wounds of the world,
and its consequent madness and art--not least, this postwar elegy with
its arduous celebration of "life"--demand it. No guiltier than anyone
else, his only "crime" to have tried to bear (in both senses) witness,
Septimus dies for the "terrific" institutionalized violence that Harley
Street commits against defenceless naked souls, for the admirable Hugh's
less admirable acts, for Milly Brush's suppressed history, Clarissa's
defection, and Lady Rosseter's conversion, as well as Europe's vengeful
crimes against its future, the Great War and the violent Peace.

<p>
But if no one in the novel fully claims the symbolic legacy evoked in
Septimus's last words, and if <i>The Hours</i> preserves smoldering
"truths" that even <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> cannot openly explore, how can
anyone think that art might influence the world? What force can art exert
toward change, when to t is out of character for Clarissa, conversion
so far the norm that even Sally succumbs, and Septimus's death a silent
testimony that leaves even the fictional world unchanged--while the actual
world grinds on toward the revenge tragedy for which Versailles set the
stage, horrendously enacting Hitler's 1922 vow: "It cannot be that two
million Germans should have fallen in vain. . . . No, we do not pardon,
we demand--vengeance!"
<sup><a name="REF66" href="#FOOT66">66</a></sup>

<p>
As powerless as the eloquence of Keynes and Freud to forestall another
civil war, Woolf's elegiac art battles alongside them on the side of Love
for a future that history had not yet, in 1925, foreclosed. Further,
and in keeping with the expansive web of conscious and unconscious
being that Clarissa theorizes on the bus, the novel does depict a
changing world even if no one seems to be directly changing it. To
Peter his dear old civilization seems freer, less repressed and much
improved, especially for women: "Newspapers seemed different. Now for
instance there was a man writing quite openly in one of the respectable
weeklies about water-closets. That you couldn't have done ten years ago"
(<i>MD,</i> 71). As a young man on whose "love of abstract principles"
"the future of civilization" rests, he advocated women's suffrage; now
"women's rights" are an "antediluvian topic" (<i>MD,</i> 50, 73). As he
strolls to the party on an evening marvelously lengthened by that postwar
innovation "summer time," he delights in the spectacle of beautiful,
well-dressed young people and (unlike fellow Anglo-Indians devoted to
"biliously summing up the ruin of the world") "more than suspect[s] from
the words of a girl, from a housemaid's laughter--intangible things you
couldn't lay your hands on--that shift in the whole pyramidal accumulation
which in his youth had seemed immovable" and had "weighed them down, the
women especially" (<i>MD,</i> 162). Echoing Woolf's essay "Mr. Bennett
and Mrs. Brown" , which proves by cooks borrowing newspapers and
parlor maids trying on hats that "human character" has changed, Peter
senses an exhilarating forward motion in postwar civilization that no
single life--not his, Sally's, Clarissa's, Septimus's, nor even that of
Elizabeth, who would like a profession but is "rather lazy"--can account
for (<i>MD,</i> 137).
<sup><a name="REF67" href="#FOOT67">67</a></sup>
  Yet there it is.

<p>
Lady Rosseter's conversion, moreover, represents no <i>final</i> defeat
of Sally's reformist hopes, since <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> also immortalizes
Sally, ever streaking Bourton's corridor after her sponge like a modern
successor to Keats's beleaguered maiden. And of course art may inspire
readers to act upon their social worlds not by representing

<b></b>

change but by exposing the social system in action. Precisely because its
characters defect, convert, fail of speech, die, lie, and "go under,"
<i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> carries the "t" to rebuild civilization on
firmer ground into a future that is always becoming in the wake of the
work of art--the future of its readers, whose myriad-minded creativity
the skywriting airplane's beholders only suggest. Woolf, meanwhile,
triumphed over loss, grief, and maddening rage to reach fresh woods and
pastures new--to write her books, found her press, and persevere into the
next war as "the only woman in England free to write what I like"--and
she felt, on finishing her great communal elegy, no longer "inclined to
doff the cap to death": "More &amp; more do I repeat . . . 'Its life that
matters'" (<i>D,</i> 3:43, 7-8, 8 n. 5; 22 September, 8 April 1925). If
water closets in respectable weeklies now, perhaps Milly Brush's brother
soon? For the moment, <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> embraces the world as it is,
letting Milly, Clarissa, Hugh, and Lady Rosseter live while Septimus
dies for his civilization's barbarities--the sexual violence buried in
this novel's news of the day no less than the war on its front page.

<i>EE,</i> 8f. I agree that there is "substantial overlap in men's and
women's mourning" and that a woman's mourning recapitulates the loss
of the mother and "her internalization and identification with the
idealized parent re"; but Woolf translates psychoanalytic theory's
androcentric terms of art into the ontological loss and sexual wounding
inherent in being, distinct from the systemic, socially-inflicted losses
women suffer through "male culture's establishment of an almost exclusive
relation between masculinity and the res of authority" (<i>EE,</i>
13, 15, 321).

<p>
<a name="FOOT8" href="#REF8">8</a>.
<i>EE,</i> 34-5. Sacks interprets this ancient strategy of elegy as,
first, a symbolic recapitulation of "the 'splitting' and self suppression
that accompanied the self's first experiences of loss and substitution,
its discovery of signs both for lost objects and for the self"; second, a
"dramatizing strategy" that calls attention through ritual and ceremony to
the mourners' "'work' as survivors"; third, the "confrontational structure
required for the very recognition of loss," which furthers mourning's
"necessarily dialectical movement"; fourth, the "poetry contest" whereby
contestants channel grief into skill as they contend over the communal
inheritance from the dead (<i>EE,</i> 35-6).

Jahan Ramazani pursues Owen's description of his war elegies as "to this

"the modern elegy's repudiation of the traditional elegy" and ends
in acknowledging "the persistence of the traditional elegy within the
modern" (<i>Poetry of Mourning: The Modern Elegy from Hardy to Heaney</i>

Virginia Woolf, <i>The Voyage Out</i> (New York: Harcourt, Brace,

date, but Woolf composed <i>The Voyage Out</i> between 1908 and 1913,
"Mrs. Dalloway in Bond Street" in 1922, and <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>
in 1923-24. As she approached <i>The Hours</i> (composed 1923-24) she
expressed dissatisfaction with the 1923 Clarissa ("Mrs Dalloway doesn't
seem to me to be complete as she is," <i>L,</i> 3:45, 4 June 1923);
<i>Orlando</i>'s draft takes a last swipe at her: "'There's that tiresome
Mrs. Dalloway!' recognizing a lady [Orlando] very much disliked looking
in at a glove shop window" (<i>Orlando: A Biography,</i> ed. J. H. Stape
[Oxford: Blackwell, 1998], Appendix A: 170 3Pr 1E 1A).

Elegies often re the mother's symbolic loss, whether understood
ontologically as differentiation contingent on birth or in sexual
terms as oedipal prohibition, as her literal death; thus a guest tells
Clarissa that she looks "so like her mother as she first saw her walking
in a garden in a grey hat," bringing tears to her eyes (<i>MD,</i>
176). Sacks discusses Amy Clampitt's redressing of the tradition's
"multiple exclusion or occlusion of res representing the mother" in
"Procession at Candlemas" (<i>EE,</i> 325).

As Sacks remarks, "Adonais," completed the year before Shelley's enactment
of its closing lines, drives the genre "to the brink of . . . ruin"
(<i>EE,</i> 165). In a letter of 18 May 1933, Woolf described "sitting,
by an open window, by a balcony, by the bay in which Shelley was drowned,
wasn't he, 113 [actually 111] years ago, on a hot day like this . . . Mary
Shelley and Mary Williams walked up and down the balcony of the house next
door [Casa Magni] waiting while Shelleys body rolled round with pearls--it
is the best death bed place I've ever seen" (<i>The Letters of Virginia
Woolf,</i> ed. Nigel Nicolson and Joanne Trautmann [New York: Harcourt,

On 14 April 1922 Woolf told T. S. Eliot that she expected to finish
this story in three to six weeks (<i>L,</i> 2:521). In August
she told Ottoline Morrell that she had finished two Mrs. Dalloway
stories (teasingly referred to as "my Garsington novel") (<i>L,</i>
2:543)--apparently prematurely, for on 28 August she planned to finish
"Mrs Dalloway" on "Sat. 2nd Sept" and then to work on "the next chapter
of Mrs. D. . . . The Prime Minister?" until "say Oct. 12th" (<i>D,</i>
2:196). A plan dated 6 October lists eight titles: "Mrs. Dalloway in
Bond Street," "The Prime Minister," "Ancestors," "A dialogue," "The old
ladies," "Country house?," "Cut flowers," and "The Party" (<i>H,</i>
411); cf. <i>Mrs. Dalloway's Party,</i> ed. Stella McNichol (New York:
HBJ, 1973). "Mrs. Dalloway in Bond Street" appeared in the <i>Dial</i>
in July 1923; Woolf sent it and another story to Eliot on 4 June for
the <i>Criterion,</i> but he published neither.

Jacqueline E. M. Latham, "The Model for Clarissa Dalloway--Kitty Maxse,"
<i>Notes and Queries</i> 214 (July 1969): 262-3, finds no condolence
letter from Woolf among the five hundred-odd in the Maxse papers at
Chichester; she prints a letter from Virginia to Kitty, probably of
summer 1905 when the Maxses visited the Stephen children at Carbis Bay
in Cornwall (Bell, <i>Virginia Woolf,</i> 1:195).

Daniel Ferrer makes this point but questions Kitty's death as a decisive
event in the novel's genesis in <i>Virginia Woolf and the Madness of

For other interpretations of Woolf's remark in "I" see Edward Mendelson,
"The Death of Clarissa Dalloway: Two Readings," in <i>Textual Analysis:
Some Readers Reading,</i> ed. Mary Ann Caws (New York: MLA Press,
1986), 272-80; and "RRD," 176-201. Mendelson makes (and rebuts)
the case that Clarissa does die, citing her fear of death, the heart
condition that makes her sleep alone in a narrow, coffinlike bed, Peter's
vision of her "falling where she stood, in her drawing-room" on hearing
St. Margaret's bells toll "for death that surprised in the midst of life"
("No! No! . . . She is not dead! I am not old, he cried, and marched
up Whitehall, as if there rolled down to him, vigorous, unending,
his future"), and her sudden vanishing from her party (<i>MD,</i>
50). Miller frames Woolf's storytelling as "the repetition of the past"
in the characters' memories and that of the narrator, who "remembers all"
and "resurrect[s] the past": an "invisible mind . . . more powerful than
their own," she "rescues them from the past," "registers with infinite
delicacy their every thought and steals their every secret," and "speaks
for them all," "'after' anything [they] think or feel"; thus "narration
is repetition as the raising of the dead" and Clarissa's return to her
party, her "resurrection from the dead" ("RRD," 176-9, 201).

<p>
<a name="FOOT28" href="#REF28">28</a>.
For Lytton Strachey this compound Kitty/Woolf registered as a
"discrepancy in Clarissa herself; he thinks she is disagreeable
&amp; limited, but that I alternately laugh at her, &amp; cover her,
very remarkably, with myself. . . . I think there is some truth in
it. For I remember the night at Rodmell when I decided to give it up,
because I found Clarissa in some way tinselly. Then <i>I invented her
memories.</i> But I think some distaste for her persisted. Yet, again,
that was true to my feeling for Kitty" (<i>D,</i> 3:32, 18 June 1925;
emphasis mine). Woolf lent Clarissa her girlhood passion for Madge
Vaughan ("I see myself now standing in the night nursery at Hyde Park
Gate . . . saying . . . 'At this moment she isactually under this roof"
(<i>D,</i> 2:122, 2 June 1921; cf. <i>MD,</i> 51) and experience of
"Constantinople" (often a code word for lesbian love), and otherwise
freed her from fact (e.g., that Kitty had no children).

<p>
<a name="FOOT29" href="#REF29">29</a>.
Woolf depicts Julia Stephen's antifeminism in Mrs. Ramsay and recalls her
stern rebuke when Kitty broke her first engagement in "22 Hyde Park Gate"
(<i>MB,</i> 165).

. Virginia's half-sister Stella Duckworth died in 1897.

<p>
<a name="FOOT31" href="#REF31">31</a>.
<i>H,</i> 411. Sacks relates the elegy's cut and broken branches and
flowers to the "vegetation god, whose death and rebirth governed
the phases of the rites" and "allowed the devotees or survivors
to . . . intensify their grief or gratitude regarding an otherwise
manifold and ungraspable world of nature"; the withering vegetation also
symbolically "reverses man's submission to nature," which becomes no
longer "the <i>cause</i> of human grief but rather the mourner or even
the effect of a human-divine loss" (<i>EE,</i> 20-1). On Jane Harrison's
influence upon Woolf's vegetation imagery, see Beverly Ann Schlack,

Posthumous derives from Latin <i>posthumus</i> "erroneously (by

Sacks points out, Guiderius/Polydore and Arviragus/Cadwal first sang
"Fear no more," their dirge for Imogen/Fidele, for their dead mother,
Euriphile (<i>EE,</i> 18).

Building on Elizabeth Abel's reading of <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> as a
"progression from a pastoral female world to an urban culture governed by
men" (<i>Virginia Woolf and the Fictions of Psychoanalysis</i> [Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1989], 42), Joseph Allen Boone relates this
passage to Nancy Chodorow's theories of female psychological development
(<i>Libidinal Currents: Sexuality and the Making of Modernism</i>
[Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998], 187).

For example, kissing Peter in her drawingroom stirs "the brandishing
of silver flashing--plumes like pampas grass in a tropic gale in
her breast"; when Elizabeth barges in, Big Ben strikes the half hour
"with extraordinary vigour, as if a young man, strong, indifferent,
inconsiderate, were swinging dumb-bells this way and that" (<i>MD,</i>

Keynes had lived in the communal household at 38 Brunswick Square with

Woolf wrote rather satirically of his "prophecies" about Lloyd George
and England's economic future (<i>L,</i> 2:208, 1 January 1918); later
she recorded his resignation from the peace talks (<i>D,</i> 1:280,

a good deal of difference--it is a distinct hindrance commercially"
(<i>D,</i> 1:135-6, 135 n, 14, 9 April 1918). Woolf recorded Leonard's
intention to hire her on the <i>International Review</i> at a salary of
&#163;200-250 (<i>D,</i> 1:143, 21 April 1918). The resentful, belligerent
Miss Kilman has nothing of Matthaei's "limp, apologetic attitude,"
her "odious" reluctance "to declare her opinions--as if a dog used to
excessive beating, dreaded even the raising of a hand" but shares her
"unattractive" person, blotchy complexion, "inconceivably stiff &amp;
ugly" dress, and "quick mind" (<i>D,</i> 1:136).

<i>MD,</i> 124. Masami Usui notes Miss Kilman's association with Quaker
peace activism and relates her to international struggles for women's
rights in "The Female Victims of War," in <i>Virginia Woolf and War:

University Press, 1991), esp. 158-63; cf. Zwerdling, <i>Virginia Woolf

supplements her traditionally hierarchical Protestant denomination,

The Inverted World of <i>Mrs. Dalloway,</i>" in <i>Virginia Woolf:
Lesbian Readings,</i> ed. Barrett and Patricia Cramer [New York: New

and psychic locus of Clarissa's displaced and disavowed lesbian desire;

Forms of recompense include: protection against natural forces; material
wealth and comfort, which accrue to individuals and classes in greater
and lesser degrees; the "mental wealth" of cultural identity, political
ideals, communal pride, art, religious ideas, and science; and such
personal satisfactions as drugs, love, "cultivat[ing] one's garden,"
beauty, work, and the "pleasure principle" by which individuals adapt so
as to gain all possible gratification from their environment (<i>FI,</i>
16; <i>CD</i> 22-3). For Freud as for Keynes, civilization encompasses,
on the one hand, all the knowledge and capacity by which humankind
controls destructive natural forces and uses natural resources to
satisfy its needs, and, on the other, the regulation of human relations,
"especially the distribution of the available wealth." These material and
social economies are inseparable, since human relations "are profoundly
influenced by the amount of instinctual satisfaction which the existing
wealth makes possible" (<i>FI,</i> 3). Because social relations organize
both power and wealth, some individuals function as wealth for others
through labor or sexual attachment; thus Freud sees class oppression as
a threat to civilization's stability.

Freud considers this unconscious guilt--a hidden reservoir of
unacknowledged aggressive desire--"the most important problem in the
development of civilization" (<i>CD,</i> 81).

<i>ECP,</i> 295-6. Cf. Freud on how "the narcissism of minor differences"
(Spaniards v. Portuguese, North Germans v. South Germans, English
v. Scots, Christians v. Jews) makes "intelligible" the fact that
"the dream of a Germanic world-dominion called for antisemitism as
its complement" and that "the attempt to establish a new, communist
civilization in Russia should find its psychological support in the
persecution of the bourgeois. One only wonders, with concern, what the
Soviets will do after they have wiped out their bourgeois" (<i>CD,</i>
61-2).

<i>MD,</i> 81. Miller ("RRD," 189-90) identifies the song
"<i>Allerseelen</i>" by Hermann von Gilm and Richard Strauss as the
source of the beggarwoman's age-old "fertilising" song ("<i>ee um
fah um so</i> / <i>foo swee too eem oo</i>"), which encompasses "the
pageant of the universe" and makes the earth seem "green and flowery,"
and which issues from a mouth that seems the archetype of all graves:
"a mere hole in the earth, muddy too, matted with root fibres and tangled
grasses, . . . soaking through the knotted roots of infinite ages, and
skeletons and treasure, stream[ing] away in rivulets over the pavement
and all along the Marylebone Road, and down towards Euston, fertilising,
leaving a damp stain" (<i>MD,</i> 81). Woolf's draft translation breaks
off: "Lay by my side a bunch of purple heather / The last red aster of a"
(<i>H,</i> 98 and <i>passim</i>).

<i>FI,</i> 80. Freud's remarks on such "treasure" follow closely on his
observation that no one can tell what women are like as long as sexual
and religious inhibitions of thought are inculcated from childhood;
certain affinities between his postwar works and Woolf's suggest that
he may have read her (<i>FI,</i> 79). Harry Trosman's partial catalogue
of Freud's library in the <i>Journal of the American Psychoanalytic
Association</i> lists no books by Woolf; the Freud Museum in London is
at work on a complete catalogue.

<i>L,</i> 3:180, 1 May 1925. See for example the letter to Vanessa/"Dark
Devil" in which Woolf begs to be liberated from the home for female
lunatics at Twickenham, where her family has installed her to undergo
Dr. George Savage's version of S. Weir Mitchell's rest cure. She pays
ritual homage to Vanessa and ostentatiously displays good temper and
reasonableness while trying to get across that the rest cure is driving
her insane (<i>L,</i> 1:430-1, 28 July 1910). Woolf's letter to Gwen
Raverat about Septimus adds, "You can't think what a raging furnace it
still is to me--madness and doctors and being forced. But let's change
the subject" (<i>L,</i> 3:180, 1 May 1925).

In 1915 Woolf recorded seeing "a long line of imbeciles," "every
one . . . a miserable ineffective shuffling idiotic creature, with
no forehead, or no chin, &amp; an imbecile grin, or a wild suspicious
stare"; her response, "It was perfectly horrible. They should certainly
be killed," suggests disavowal of a suicidal self that she identifies
with them, echoed in Septimus's self-mirroring memory of "a maimed file
of lunatics" who "ambled and nodded and grinned past him. . . . And
would <i>he</i> go mad?" (<i>D,</i> 1:13, 9 January 1915; <i>MD,</i> 90).
