<p>
How do we write a history of modern architecture that considers
gender? What would that history look like if we read it through its
photographic traces? Is it possible to derive from the case of one
photographer located outside the canons of architectural and photographic
history a broader lesson about gender and modernity? What if this story
were told from the perspective of Spanish modernity, a situation in the
story of modernism which itself undergoes continual revision?
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
 In this essay, I would like to propose just such a project in order
 to chart a particular instance of a woman's place in the history of
 modern architecture.

<p>
Recently, feminist scholars have turned to women's roles as patrons and
designers of modern architecture.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
 This has provided a new body of writing that addresses questions of
 agency, authorship, creativity, and methodology. Often, photographs
 of the women involved in these projects are juxtaposed with archival
 images of the buildings they helped to create. We imagine how the
 women moved in these spaces, what they looked like, and how they might
 have been perceived by the architects with whom they worked. Thus far,
 however, few have addressed the photographs as historical, biographical
 or artistic objects.
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
 Who took them? How were they composed? What control, if any, might
 these women have had over their image? Fewer studies have asked the
 broader question: how were women involved in creating the "image" of
 modern architecture? It is this last question that I want to explore,
 not in isolation but in relation to depictions of women in architectural
 spaces. I will focus on the work of one female photographer, who took
 photographs of

<b></b>

modern architecture in Barcelona during the 1930s, to draw out larger
issues about mobility, anonymity, creativity, and exile. I hope to show
that it is through an investigation of these ideas that we might begin
to decipher the difficult, yet productive, place of women in modern
architecture.

<p>
Margaret Michaelis, born Margarethe Gross in Austria in 1902, was a
stranger in Barcelona.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
 Together with her husband, Rudolf Michaelis, she fled from Germany
 in 1933. (She and Rudolf separated shortly after their arrival in
 Barcelona, and this added to Michaelis's numerous labels: single
 working woman.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>) She was part of a community of exiles, who were politically active in
the Mediterranean city during the 1930s. Like many of them, she was an
Anarchist, like some of them, she was a Jew; neither identity was easy
to negotiate in Barcelona.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
 Despite this, she was able to publish her photographs over the course
 of almost five years in the city's most modern magazines. One might
 even argue that it was largely Michaelis who supplied Barcelona with
 its modern photographic identity. Perhaps it was her "strangeness"
 which afforded her the ability to create images that were read as
 modern at the time they were published, and into the present.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
 Michaelis was trained in Vienna, worked with leading photographers there
 and in Berlin, was well-versed in the style of the "New Photography,"
 and brought all of this foreignness to bear on the buildings that she
 saw in Barcelona.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
 It is probably because of their relation to international modernism,
 vis-&agrave;-vis Germany, that Michaelis's photographs have been
 used so often in catalogues and surveys about architecture in early
 twentieth-century Spain. They have become a kind of photographic
 shorthand to demonstrate the existence of a strident, forward-looking
 architectural avant-garde that coincided with the brief reforms of
 the Second Republic government.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>

<p>
The identification of Michaelis's photographs with Spanish modernity
was assisted by the fact that the greatest number of them appeared
in <i>A.C. Documentos de Actividad Contempor&aacute;nea</i>
(<i>A.C. Documents of Contemporary Activity</i>), which was the
publication of the leading, reformist architectural group in Spain,
G.A.T.E.P.A.C. (Grupo de Arquitectos y T&eacute;cnicos Espa&ntilde;oles
para el Progreso de la Arquitectura Contempor&aacute;nea / Group of
Spanish Architects and Technicians for the Progress of Contemporary
Architecture).
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
 The magazine quickly became most closely associated with the
 Catalan faction of this group, G.A.T.C.P.A.C. (Grup d'Arquitectes
 i T&egrave;cnics Catalans per al Progr&eacute;s de l'Arquitectura
 Contempor&agrave;nia / Group of Catalan Architects and Technicians
 for the Progress of Contemporary Architecture). From about 1934
 onwards, Michaelis's photographs dominate the magazine's visual
 content. However, neither at the time nor until recently were
 they attributed to her, since almost all of the material in that
 magazine was published anonymously in accordance with the group's
 belief in collective authorship. The architects of the buildings
 that Michaelis photographed&#8212;Josep Lluis Sert, Josep Torres
 Clav&eacute;, G. Rodr&iacute;guez Arias, and R. Ribas Seva&#8212;were
 knowledgeable about the modern movement in architecture, participated
 in international meetings and exhibitions, and were among Barcelona's
 select group of progressive, financially secure, and highly educated
 artists and intellectuals. It was within this circle of the city's
 elite architects that Michaelis found her most loyal clientele.

<b></b>

<p>
Previously, historians have read her photographs as transparent signs of
the achievements of these male architects. If they have been considered
as gendered at all, it would have been as decidedly male, reflecting the
architect's designs and intentions. Now that we know that Michaelis was
the author of many of the most famous photographs of their buildings,
the question of gender becomes something of a puzzle. In relation to
these issues, but before entering into a discussion of Michaelis's work,
I want to briefly examine the photographs of modern architecture which
included women, that were taken by Catalan photographer Josep Sala before
her arrival on the scene. Comparing Michaelis's photographs with those
of the only other photographer whose services were repeatedly contracted
by the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. during the same period may provide a base for
interpreting gender in Michaelis's work.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>

1 Signs of Modernity?:<br />
Women and Architecture
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
Josep Sala was one of a handful of successful commercial photographers
in Barcelona.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
 His work was published widely and he gained a reputation as
 an accomplished publicity photographer, whose modern style images
 appeared throughout the 1930s in the city's magazines. In 1932 he became
 artistic director of Barcelona's well established illustrated magazine,
 <i>D'Ac&iacute; i d'All&agrave;</i> (<i>From Here and from There</i>),
 and helped to initiate the magazine's new look, which featured a metal
 spiral binding, larger format, and the dynamic use of photography
 and typography.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
 Sala was commissioned by Barcelona's top companies to produce ads which
 ran in all of the city's major publications. He became a household name
 among the city's elite and its mass consumers. His work is directly
 relevant to Michaelis's in that her own work appeared a few years later
 in both <i>D'Ac&iacute; i d'All&agrave;</i> and, during the Civil War,
 in another magazine that Sala helped to direct, <i>Nova Iberia</i>
 (<i>New Iberia</i>), published by the Catalan government's Comissariat
 de Propaganda.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>

<p>
Before he became artistic director for <i>D'Ac&iacute; i
d'All&agrave;</i>, Sala was commissioned by G.A.T.C.P.A.C. architects
like Josep Lluis Sert to take photographs of their newly constructed
buildings. These photographs were published in <i>A.C.</i> and in other
articles and books edited by the group in Spain.
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
 Among the most relevant for my discussion are two series of photographs
 that Sala took in the early 1930s of Sert's 1929 residential
 apartment building on Muntaner Street and the store opened by the
 G.A.T.C.P.A.C. on Barcelona's upper-class Passeig de Gr&agrave;cia. Of
 the photographs that he took of these buildings, several feature modern,
 fashionably dressed women. The women are located both outside and
 within the spaces as if they were props. They are staged to become
 signs of modernity, like the architecture itself. This use of the
 female re to signal, through her presence, a state of novelty and
 sophistication, is radically different from Michaelis's framing of women
 as active participants in the creation of a scene. Michaelis's women
 create an axis within the visual space from which the composition is
 ordered. Even when women are absent from the scene, as is the case in
 some of her photographs, she makes evident their potential design or
 use of the space. In Sala's photographs, instead, the women could be
 removed from the scene without any disturbance or impact upon it. They
 occupy the space, but do not transform it.

<b></b>

<p>
Two photographs of Sert's residential building on Muntaner Street, taken
by Sala around 1930-31, will serve as an example. In one of them, Sala
has organized his horizontally composed photograph around the modern
furnishings in the interior of the living space. (<a name="1"
HREF="10.1mendelson_res.html#1"> 1</a>) The woman is
located at the far end, about to ascend the staircase. The scale of the
architecture and furnishings dwarf her; she is framed by the darker toned
door behind her. Everything in the image has been carefully arranged
beforehand. A cactus is placed on a round modern table at the lower
center of the room. Two architectural magazines are opened on the other
side. The information in the magazines is, in fact, more legible than
the individual characteristics of the woman. We see the modern line of
her dress, her neatly cropped hair, the graceful, but firm, gesture of
her hand on the railing, but we do not see her in detail.

<p>
In a second photograph of the same space, the woman is once
again framed by the architecture in a diminutive way, this
time through the use of a vertical composition. (<a name="2"
HREF="10.1mendelson_res.html#2"> 2</a>) She now sits in
one of the modern chairs reading an architectural magazine from the
table. Hanging from the ceiling is a large globe lamp, which out-measures
the female model in size and visual importance. Like the cactus plants
and African sculpture arranged along the window sill, she is merely
another element of modernity to inhabit Sert's streamlined residency.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
 As Sala depicts her in the two photographs, she has no agency of her
 own. She does, however, actively engage in reading modern architectural
 magazines. Is she, then, the audience that the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. is
 addressing? Is she the consumer, or perhaps the client, who will
 call upon the group's services after glancing through the pages of
 <i>A.C.</i>, or a similar, internationally minded publication? Or is
 she the modern woman who the G.A.T.C.P.A.C.'s male readers imagine
 inhabiting their own spaces? In any of these possible scenarios,
 Sala establishes a relationship between women and readership that he
 carries over into his photographs of the G.A.T.C.P.A.C.'s showroom.

<p>
As with his photographs of the Muntaner Street residency, his
publicity shots of the showroom may be read as a sequence, though it
is less clear how the photographs relate to each other, especially
in terms of the space represented. The one continuous element in
both photographs is once again a fashionably dressed woman who is
carefully located in the composition. In the first photograph,
Sala positions the woman outside the showroom. (<a name="3"
HREF="10.1mendelson_res.html#3"> 3</a>) With her hand placed
on the glass pane, she looks into the space from the street. Her eyes
rest upon a number of <i>A.C.</i> that has been opened on the glass table
inside. Like the first group of photographs, Sala intentionally organizes
the interior of the architectural space. Accompanying the opened magazines
on the center glass table is a single, closed issue of the first number of
<i>A.C.</i> . The woman's pose leads the reader to the magazines,
making the photograph an advertisement not only for the showroom and its
furnishings, but also for the G.A.T.C.P.A.C.'s publications. She becomes
the agent through which consumption is advertised as a progressive,
reformist gesture.

<p>
In the second photograph of the series, the same
woman is seated inside the showroom. (<a name="4"
HREF="10.1mendelson_res.html#4"> 4</a>) She reads an issue
of the first number of <i>A.C.</i>; numerous copies of the same magazine
are spread out upon a modern chrome table. Along the window sill are

<b></b>

<b>[Begin Page 146]</b>

several cacti. She does not look at the reader. In fact, in none of
Sala's photographs does the woman direct herself to the photograph's
viewer. Instead, she is absorbed in either the act of viewing the
architectural space or its representation in the magazines. The female
re in Sala's photographs becomes a nexus point for architecture and
publicity; she brings both together compositionally and conceptually.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>

2 Michaelis's Photographs of Architecture
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
It would be tempting to metaphorically place Michaelis in the position
of Sala's women. In many ways, she cemented the relationship between
women, architecture, and publicity during the time that she worked
professionally in Barcelona. Her first photo studio was even set up
in one of Sert's residential buildings on Rosell&oacute; Street; the
building was constructed in the same year and not very different from
the one on Muntaner Street.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
 But Michaelis's photographs of modern architecture <i>were</i>
 different from Sala's, though both were stylistically marked by the "New
 Photography." In Michaelis's photographs of architecture, surprisingly
 few women are represented. When women <i>do</i> appear, they are
 not merely compositional elements as in Sala's photographs. They
 inhabit the space in a manner that makes them the focal point of the
 composition, often directly addressing the viewer in their pose. With
 this, Michaelis demonstrates that she identifies with the women who
 occupy the architectural environments that she photographs.

<b></b>

<p>
Consider Michaelis's photographs of Sert's week-end house in the coastal
town of Garraf. Sert designed the house with his G.A.T.C.P.A.C. colleague
Josep Torres Clav&eacute;. It was built in 1935, and photographs of it
appeared in the city's major magazines. In one of Michaelis's most widely
reproduced photographs of the Garraf house, she employed a horizontal
format with a strong diagonal emphasis.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
 (<a name="5" href="10.1mendelson_res.html#5"> 5</a>) The
 interior occupies the majority of the composition, with the furniture
 creating lively angles within the space. A clear line through the
 interior leads the viewer's eye out to the brighter, lighter tones
 of the exterior patio. There sits a woman, casually posed with her
 legs crossed sitting in a modern chair. Unlike the women in Sala's
 photographs, she looks directly across the architectural space and
 confronts the viewer with her presence. Hers is not a passive pose. She
 is not reading nor is she placed as a transient element. Instead, she
 seems to claim her place within the composition (and the architectural
 space). Michaelis reinforces this, as the diagonal created with the
 placement of the furniture finds its apex with the female seated
 re. The woman in Michaelis's photograph has been identified as
 Sert's wife, Moncha (<i>MMFVP</i>, 90). This being the case, we have
 an instance where the architect's wife and the woman commissioned
 to photograph

<b></b>

the house face one another. It is their gaze that fills the space between
the exterior patio and Michaelis's camera located within the house. In
other words, they activate the space with their capacity to create,
or at least occupy, a view of modern architecture.

<p>
Of course, there are competing interpretations of this
photograph. Michaelis was an outsider and, being that she was a working
woman separated from her husband, she may have been considered a threat
to the bourgeois propriety that even the most progressive of Catalan
intellectuals sought to maintain. The exchange between Michaelis and
Sert's wife might have been riddled with issues of gender, class,
and nationality. Moncha's position is ambiguous, in that while she is
a dominant element in the composition, she is located outside of the
house itself, close to nature, and the abundance of sunlight threatens
to encroach upon the clarity of her facial features and the outline of
her re.

<p>
Theorists have argued that women have often been located in the liminal,
transitional spaces between outside and inside.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
 Sometimes seen as a limiting function of patriarchy's construction of
 public and private space, the use of liminality by women has recently
 been opened to a multiplicity of interpretations. The margins might
 be seen not only as a reinforcement of hegemonic notions of status
 and position, but also as a potential site to challenge normative
 relations. In the case of this image, it may also coincide with a
 particular socially constructed condition that was shared by both

<b></b>

Moncha Sert and Michaelis as women in 1930s Spain.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
 If interpreted as a challenge to patriarchal conrations of
 architecture and space, the photograph documents an occasion when both
 women collaborated in producing an image of modern architecture that
 was at once overseen by the architects of the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. and a
 challenge to their authority.

<p>
Michaelis's relationship to her female subjects must have been
complex. But, for all of the questions that we may have about her
biography or the specific circumstances of her commissions, there is
no archival material left about these issues by her Catalan clients or
Michaelis herself.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
 We must rely almost exclusively on the photographs published at the time
 or those conserved in archives for potential answers. The published
 photographs form a record of Michaelis's activities in Barcelona;
 they also document the editorial decisions made by her publishers. As
 far as we know, Michaelis did not exercise control over the final
 selection of photographs nor over how her images appeared in print.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
 Offering a wider view of Michaelis's work are the archival and
 photographic materials conserved principally in three collections: the
 National Gallery of Australia (Canberra), the Arxiu Hist&ograve;ric
 of the Col.legi d'Arquitectes de Catalunya (Barcelona), and the
 Arxiu Fotogr&agrave;fic of the Arxiu Hist&ograve;ric de la Ciutat
 (Barcelona). The National Gallery houses the Michaelis-Sachs Archive,
 composed of photographs that Michaelis bequeathed to the Gallery.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
 In the museum setting of the National Gallery, it is the identity of
 Michaelis as artist that determines the organization of the images:
 subjects are identified as much as possible, but primary importance is
 given to the photographs as works of art and the group as indicative
 of an individual author's oeuvre. Until recently, so little was known
 of her work in Spain that many of the photographs which appeared
 in Barcelona's leading magazines went unidentified. This is very
 different from the two groups of photographs conserved in Barcelona's
 collections. These archives give primacy to subject matter and locate
 Michaelis's photographs within a body of material related to the
 G.A.T.C.P.A.C. In the Col.legi d'Arquitectes, they are classified
 within several sub-sections of the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. archive, usually by
 project or building, but also within a separate photographic archive.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
 Until a few years ago, the photographs held by the Arxiu
 Fotogr&agrave;fic of the Arxiu Hist&ograve;ric de la Ciutat were
 unavailable for consultation.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
 They are now undergoing classification. If they are integrated into the
 archive and follow its existing system, they will probably either be
 classified by location and date, or will be maintained as a separate
 collection related to the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. In either case, Michaelis's
 authorship of the photographs probably will not be the primary mode
 of classification.

<p>
When organizing the first exhibition of Michaelis's work in Spain, we
established her authorship of unsigned photographs in the Barcelona
archives by comparing them to the photographs attributed to her in
the National Gallery. Often, it was through the use of her published
photographs that series of related images were brought back together. The
series were complete in only a few instances in any of the three
archives. An exception to this are the photographs that Michaelis took of
R. Ribas Seva's Torre Eugenia. In 1936 <i>D'Ac&iacute; i d'All&agrave;</i>
published a three-page article, illustrated by Michaelis, devoted to
the building, with a small reference at the bottom of the third page to

<b></b>

"Foto Elis."
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
 The majority of the photographs are exterior shots, which emphasize
 the building's clean geometric forms and symmetrical lines. (<A
 NAME="6" href="10.1mendelson_res.html#6"> 6</a>)
 One of the few photographs of the interior features a small gym off
 the patio. With its emphasis on clarity, cleanliness, sunlight, and
 physical activity, Michaelis's photographs make of the Torre Eugenia
 a symbol of modernity. There are few vestiges of the past included
 in the published photographs. Similarly, aside from the photographs
 of the gym and the pool, both of which refer to leisure activities,
 there are few elements of domesticity, either in the decoration or as
 part of the everyday use of the architectural space.

<p>
This contrasts with the fuller range of photographs that Michaelis
took of the Torre Eugenia, which are conserved in the Col.legi
d'Arquitectes. In addition to those published in <i>D'Ac&iacute; i
d'All&agrave;</i>, there are photographs of the living room, which is
adorned with memorabilia of bull ts. The furniture in the living room
is decorative, with several elements bearing likeness to art deco rather
than international style. While these photographs speak more to the
heterogeneous nature of modernism in Spain, with its mix of tradition
and modernity, Michaelis also took photographs of the efficiently
designed kitchen and luxuriously equipped bathroom. (<a name="7"
HREF="10.1mendelson_res.html#7"> 7</a>) Neither of these
were featured in the magazine's article, yet they are images that align
Michaelis's interests with the most advanced domestic planning, namely
Margarete Sch&uuml;tte-Lihotsky's innovative kitchen designs for Ernst
May's housing complexes in Frankfurt.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
 Why would images that articulate a specific aspect of modern
 architecture not be included in the magazine's three-page article? Why
 were the leisure spaces featured above the advances in hygiene and
 efficient domestic management? Part of the answer may lie with the
 magazine's readership.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
 As an illustrated magazine, filled with articles on film, fashion,
 art, and tourism, its readers may not have been interested in the
 "behind the scenes" innovations of the Torre Eugenia.

<p>
In choosing the photographs as they did, the magazine's editors, which
included Sala, also removed the spaces that were more closely related
to women's work in the home.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
 Technical magazines like <i>A.C.</i> did include articles on modern
 innovations in hygiene.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
 But, when they focused squarely on the spaces of domesticity, like the
 kitchen, the majority of the photographs documented the unsanitary
 conditions of the tenement buildings of Barcelona's Fifth District,
 popularly called the <i>Barrio Chino</i> (China Town) because of its
 portside location and vices.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
 It is in Michaelis's photographs of these buildings that we see her
 searching for those markers within the architectural space that signal
 women's presence. Many of these were edited out of the G.A.T.C.P.A.C.'s
 publications. In comparing those that were included in <i>A.C.</i> with
 those that are conserved in Australia and Barcelona, we may begin to
 reconstruct Michaelis's complex view of women's place in architecture.

3 Women at Work:<br />
The Other Side of Modernity
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
As part of their urban plan for Barcelona, the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. architects,
with the collaboration of Swiss architect Le Corbusier, proposed the
"Pla Maci&aacute;" to the city government.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
 Although it was never carried out, the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. published numerous

<b></b>

articles and held several exhibitions featuring its major components
during the 1930s. Margaret Michaelis was the main photographer
commissioned to take photographs of the Fifth District, which was the
focus of the G.A.T.C.P.A.C.'s reformist gestures.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
 It was the city's most notorious center of poverty, prostitution,
 drugs, and crime. The photographs by Michaelis that appeared in print
 showed architectural features of the cramped tenement buildings and
 children from the neighborhood. There were also some photographs of
 the district's "typical" inhabitants, which included women either
 leaning out of their windows or posed in doorways.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
 The signage above one woman&#8212;<i>Habitaciones</i> or
 rooms&#8212;makes an oblique reference to the women's reputation as
 prostitutes. For the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. photographs, Michaelis's lens was
 trained on the tight alleyways, the garbage-filled passages, and the
 dirty interiors and exteriors that characterized housing in the Fifth
 District. All of these images gave the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. the evidence
 they needed to demonstrate the logic and urgency of their proposed
 urban reforms, which included demolishing the old housing in favor of
 modern style apartment blocks and open public spaces.

<p>
Of a more ambiguous nature are the photographs of domestic interiors and
of women in public spaces that were <i>not</i> published or exhibited
by the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. Most of these photographs are conserved either in
the Arxiu Hist&ograve;ric de la Ciutat or the National

<b></b>

Gallery, and they form two distinct groups. The first series, conserved in
the city's archive, centers around domestic interiors, probably taken in
the Fifth District. The second series was most likely taken at a slightly
later date. This series has a different, more playful tone. They feature
men and women in Barcelona's caf&eacute;s and stores, openly pursuing
their daily activities. To my knowledge, neither group of photographs
appeared in print during the 1930s. In all of the photographs, Michaelis
addresses more directly than in her other work the role of women in
Barcelona's society. She focuses less on the architecture itself and more
on how the women inhabit or activate the space around them. In terming
these photographs the "other side of modernity," I wish to address their
fundamental role in illustrating the daily work (and pleasures) of the
city's female inhabitants, a side of modernity that did not appear in
the published photographs of the city's modern architecture. While the
G.A.T.C.P.A.C. wished to demolish the Fifth District as anti-modern,
because of the dirt, disease, and drugs associated with it, Michaelis's
photographs vindicate the practices, routines, and gestures of its female
laboring class as an undeniable and constitutive part of Barcelona's
modern experience. As Michaelis shows her viewer, the disavowed spaces
of modernity are filled with the stories of her female subjects.

<p>
The first series of photographs documents the inside of a tenement
apartment. Michaelis offers us straight photographs of the tight
quarters. Two beds and an alcove are the elements that she examines, but
she also offers us a picture of the struggles of 

<b></b>

women doing piecework
for a living. Michaelis could have chosen to highlight the negative
aspects of the scene; instead, she turns each element into an integral
part of the composition. In one photograph, two beds are framed to show
their symmetry. A cross hangs between them and the area is orderly. In
another, Michaelis shows us the bottom edge of one of the beds. We
see a piece of fabric hanging from the left side of the wall and a
single boot under the bed. She captures the light on the covers, which
emphasizes the care that she has taken in composing the photograph. The
most compelling of the series is a split-frame horizontal image that
features one of the beds on the left side and, on the other side of the
door frame, two women working in a darkened alcove. (<a name="8"
HREF="10.1mendelson_res.html#8"> 8</a>) Only one of the women
is fully visible in the photograph. An outlined shadow and the slight hang
of a dress over a chair hidden behind the wall are the only indicators
of the second woman's presence. The woman in full view is wearing a
light-toned, smartly styled dress. Michaelis shows her to be a poised,
self possessed subject, who is strained in deep concentration. While
she does not look up at the viewer, all of our attention is focused on
her. As she had done with her photograph of the Garraf house, Michaelis
has worked the composition around her female subject. She uses the formal
qualities of the photograph to counter stereotypes about the living
quarters and inhabitants of the neighborhood, many of which formed
the core of the G.A.T.C.P.A.C.'s proposals. It is through Michaelis's
unpublished photographs that we learn of her interaction with Barcelona's
working women. As a single woman working to earn her own living in a
strange city, Michaelis must have sympathized with the plight of her
subjects. Like them, she had to negotiate her way through the city.

<p>
Michaelis's first experience in Barcelona was most likely in the Fifth
District, where she stayed during a brief visit to the city prior to
moving their with Rudolf in 1933. The evidence of her trip is an unsigned
typescript conserved in the Col.legi d'Arquitectes and the photographs
of the neighborhood that were published in <i>A.C.</i> in 1932.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
 In the typescript, which is written in German and makes only a
 single reference to the author's gender ("they hung onto my skirt"),
 Michaelis writes of her passage through the city's dark alleyways and
 her confrontation with its most picturesque and dangerous characters.
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
 Her camera at once gives her mobility and restricts her actions. In
 the midst of taking photographs, she is threatened by the local tough
 men. They chase her through the alleys as she ducks knowingly into the
 hostel where most of the foreigners stay. Just outside the hostel,
 she photographs a group of children being entertained by a street
 musician. She voices familiar knowledge of local customs and the
 manners that ensure safe passage through the District's most dangerous
 situations. As she moves among the city's marginal inhabitants and
 documents the scenes that she would later write about, Michaelis
 experiences a sense of exhilaration. Despite the publication of the
 photographs that she took during her "brief raid into the <i>Barrio
 Chino</i>," her text remained unpublished.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
 One wonders whether Michaelis's reluctance to emphasize her gender or
 identity in the text is an outcome of her broader belief in the very
 modern, political gesture of anonymity. As one of the city's countless
 anonymous subjects, Michaelis perhaps believed she was in a position
 of empowerment.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
 Traveling through the city's streets with her camera, she straddled
 the fence between Barcelona's marginal zones and its modern ambitions.

<b></b>

<p>
Where her relationship with the city's female subjects comes
through most unexpectedly is in the second series of photographs
taken at a slightly later date, which are conserved in the National
Gallery. Here Michaelis documents a social and photographic pact with
her subjects. Knowing gestures and relaxed smiles characterize the
women in these photographs. In one group, Michaelis photographs women
in a bread shop. By their dress and the store's decor, this image may
have been taken in the middle- class <i>Eixample</i> area instead
of the Fifth District. The women's hair has been carefully styled
and they stand with confidence, making their daily purchases. In one
photograph, the bakery attendant comfortably pats her customer's shoulder
while they stand arm in arm in front of the store. (<a name="9"
HREF="10.1mendelson_res.html#9"> 9</a>) The female customer,
who has been identified as "June" in the National Gallery records,
directly addresses the camera (and Michaelis); neither Michaelis nor her
subject flinch away from the act of documenting women's daily routines.

<p>
In these photographs, Michaelis introduces a higher level of theatricality
into her compositions. She engages her subjects as actors in creating
a narrative around their actions within the city's architectural
spaces. This directed use of the camera to include within the frame
an active collaboration with her subjects had already been present in
her earlier photographs, both of the Garraf house and the District's
tenements: but now it becomes more dominant. No longer a documentarian
"on the run" through the streets of Barcelona, Michaelis demonstrates
entitlement over her subjects

<b></b>

and her own place within the city's places of commerce and entertainment
in these photographs. Take, for example, her photograph of a woman with
two men in the Taverna dels Tenors, one of the popular music bars in
the Fifth District.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
 (<a name="0" href="10.1mendelson_res.html#0"> 10</a>)
 The Taverna was frequented by local celebrities and members of
 Barcelona's aristocracy, but in her photograph Michaelis plays on the
 criminal expectations that the <i>Barrio Chino</i> held for most of
 the city's inhabitants. A woman distracted in conversation with the
 man to her right does not notice a second man who grabs her purse. He
 looks over to her with a sidelong expression, as his cap shadows his
 face. He holds his suit jacket closed with one hand and a cigar hangs
 from the side of his mouth. As Michaelis pictures the scene, it is a
 caricature of the roles that men and women played in public spaces. She
 demonstrates her knowledge of how conventions are manipulated and how
 women's place in public spaces forms part of an elaborate narrative
 about sexuality, entertainment, crime, and spectatorship. In the other
 photographs of the Taverna we see how comfortably Michaelis was able
 to move through the space. Her mid-range photographs are carefully
 composed, with the audience members, employees, and entertainers all
 taking part in the images that she captured.

<p>
Michaelis's photographs of the city's modern architecture and its Fifth
District were only one aspect of her career in Barcelona. She also took
photographs of popular festivals, gypsies, political actions, and social
services. In addition, her work was not limited to straight photographs of
a documentary or commercial nature. She also pursued work in advertising
and in portraiture. As observed by Karl Brauner, who sometimes

<b></b>

assisted Michaelis in her studio, she had very little time for anything
but work.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
 It may be because of her tremendous output and its diverse nature that
 Michaelis never created a single identifiable style, instead developing
 a market for the many aspects of her photographic work. Her strategy
 for surviving, as a photographer and a single woman in Barcelona,
 therefore contrasted radically with the characterization of the modern
 architectural photographer put forward by Cervin Robinson and Joel
 Herschman in their <i>Architecture Transformed: A History of the
 Photography of Buildings from 1839 to the Present</i>:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The task of an ambitious architectural photographer at the beginning of
the 1930s was much what it had always been and continues to be to our
day: to produce a print of sufficient physical quality that one's work is
taken seriously, to get ahead of the pack of one's fellow photographers
by some aesthetic act, and to remain inthe public eye thereafter with
a recognizable, individual style.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
All of the characteristics that we might attribute to Michaelis's work
counter this limiting definition. Michaelis did not remain in the public
eye, at least not in Barcelona, and her work changed visibly depending
upon her environment. Much of her work was reproduced in magazines,
where the "physical quality" of a single print mattered less than its
mass distribution. Similarly, she did not "get ahead of the pack" in
Barcelona. Instead, one might argue, she was able to capitalize upon a
taste for modern images

<b></b>

that was, at least in part, introduced by some of her colleagues,
especially Josep Sala.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
 No doubt, she provided her clients with photographs of proven quality
 that, at the same time, were affordable and accessible. Where she
 differed from the rest of the photographers in Barcelona was in her
 training, her focus on women's and worker's issues, and her political
 and intellectual affinities. It was, perhaps, this last aspect of
 her life and work that might explain what appears to be a deliberate
 emphasis on anonymity as a form of photographic and political activism.


<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
4 Anonymity as a Productive Strategy
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>


<p>
What if anonymity was a conscious, strategic choice made by Michaelis? She
did not sign many of her photographs, and she participated in collective
endeavors that down-played individual authorship. Though her decision
may have been informed by economic and political considerations and/or a
sensitivity to the sexual politics of her profession (hence, the adoption
of the gender-neutral professional name "Foto-Elis"), I would like to
explore an historically specific, intellectual context for her practice.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>
 In making the critical and creative gesture to encourage the reception
 of her work as anonymous documents, Michaelis made a radically modern
 decision, one that she shared with the leading artists and theoreticians
 of her age.

<p>
During the 1920s and 1930s, the condition of anonymity and how that
condition related to memory and modernity was central to international
debates on photography. In some form or another during this time,
in Austria, Germany, Czechoslovakia, France, and Spain (all places
where Michaelis trained and worked), the document defined modernity in
photographic and filmic production. As such, it is of little surprise
that Michaelis should engage directly with the document's stylistic
characteristics, especially in her early photographs of the Fifth
District, and its wider theoretical and political implications. Among
the most eloquent of the German writers to articulate the conditions of
the document were Siegfried Kracauer and Walter Benjamin. In addition
to Kracauer and Benjamin, both of whom Michaelis could have read while
living in Berlin from 1928 to 1933, the work of some of Michaelis's most
famous employers and colleagues directly informed these debates.

<p>
In 1927, Kracauer explored the relation between camera-reality and
historical-reality through a discussion of the difference between
photography and memory.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>
 In response to a series of reflections upon documentary images
 published in the illustrated press, Kracauer came to the conclusion that
 photography and memory were at odds with each other. Whereas memory
 was constructed through personally significant fragments, oftentimes
 full of gaps, mistakes, and false records, photography retained
 everything. Photography's ability to record, to document spatial and
 temporal continuums, conversely provided little in terms of identifying
 personal or social values. For Kracauer, the "photographic face" that
 the world took on with the advent of the illustrated press decreased
 an individual's or an object's natural connection to the world.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
 Magazines, which Kracauer categorized as photographic archives,
 represented a warehouse of nature alienated from meaning. The world
 in fragments and the proliferation

<b></b>

of photographic documents represented nothing more than confusion. In
other words, the condition of photography itself encouraged the
anonymous, alienated experience of modernity.

<p>
Walter Benjamin countered Kracauer's critique of the negative effect
of photography on individual and social memory with an embrace of the
political potential that documentary photographs held for the masses. In
both "A Short History of Photography" of 1931 and "The Work of Art
in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" of 1936, Benjamin celebrated
photography's ability to absolve art of its cult value.
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
 Instead of the qualities of presence, genius, authenticity, and
 authorship that had been secured for individually created works of art,
 Benjamin upheld the value of non-auratic, democratically distributed
 mechanical reproduction. Moreover, the kinds of photographs that
 Benjamin exalted were precisely those that defined modern art and
 politics. Anonymous photographs shot with experimental viewpoints
 and published in illustrated magazines were the primary material
 from which Benjamin developed his theories on photography's political
 function. Most significant for Benjamin was photography's exhibition
 value, its place within the public sphere. It was photography's release
 from the constraints of memory and individual values that allowed it to
 have an impact on the masses; anyone could be a producer and consumer
 of photographic documents.

<p>
In relation to Michaelis's own photographic practice, Benjamin's writings
elucidate three fundamental aspects of her work in relation to the
issue of anonymity: her exposure to and participation in photographic
exhibitions and publications, her professional training, and her
commitment to photographing architecture.

<p>
In the years just prior to Benjamin's theorization of exhibition value,
Germany, along with the rest of Europe, experienced a photographic
explosion in the realms of artistic and everyday life. From 1922 to 1930,
Germany held more photographic exhibitions than any other country.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
 The most influential of these was the 1929 "Film und Foto" exhibition
 held in Stuttgart. Defining the primary stylistic characteristics of
 modern photography were the diversity of photographic categories and
 the embrace of formal experimentation. "Film und Foto" drew upon the
 work of both acknowledged masters and amateurs. Most notable among
 them was L&aacute;szl&oacute; Moholy-Nagy, who had only recently made
 the public move from the category of amateur to master.
<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
 With his classes at the Bauhaus art school, writings on photography,
 and organizational role in photographic exhibitions like "Film und
 Foto," Moholy-Nagy influenced students, colleagues, and the public in
 Germany and abroad.

<p>
The two most important books to define the new photography in Germany
were Moholy-Nagy's <i>Painting Photography Film</i> of 1925 and Werner
Gr&auml;ff's <i>Here comes the new photographer!</i> of 1929.
<sup><a name="REF51" href="#FOOT51">51</a></sup>
 Both insisted upon the need to break with the conventional rules of
 representation. For Moholy-Nagy, as for Gr&auml;ff, scientific and
 documentary photographs were among the leading areas in experimentation;
 the close-up, unusual view points, radical cropping, and x-ray were
 among the techniques that had first served the utilitarian functions
 of non-artistic photography. According to Moholy-Nagy, photography
 offered a new way of seeing with "entirely different eyes."
<sup><a name="REF52" href="#FOOT52">52</a></sup>
 In support of their attempt to popularize this new program for
 photography, progressive

<b></b>

artists in Germany and elsewhere made photography the guiding element
in their books and magazines. What had initially given the avant-garde
its impulse to embrace photography&#8212;the illustrated press&#8212;now
guided the manufacture of a new vision for the avant-garde.

<p>
Magazines like <i>Das Neue Frankfurt</i> in Germany and <i>i10</i>
in the Netherlands, fused an embrace of photo reportage, which was the
most modern of the new photographic categories, with an active leftist
political agenda.
<sup><a name="REF53" href="#FOOT53">53</a></sup>
 Photography endowed these magazines with an identifiably modern
 appearance and a revision of earlier assumptions about the conration
 of reality. As Benjamin, who contributed to <i>i10</i>, expressed in
 concert with Moholy-Nagy's writings: "The enlargement of a snapshot
 does not simply render more precise what in any case was visible, though
 unclear: it reveals entirely new structural formations of the subject"
 ("TWOA," 236).

<p>
Michaelis was a student of and a participant in the formation of
1920s and 1930s central European photographic culture. She practiced
in Vienna, Prague, and Berlin, all of which were cities that encouraged
the documentary mode of photography as one of the most avant-garde. Even
more important to the issue of anonymity were the female photographers
who were her mentors and colleagues. The quantity of women photographers
practicing in Germany during the Weimar Republic was significant.
<sup><a name="REF54" href="#FOOT54">54</a></sup>
 Most of the individuals undertaking the labor of providing photographic
 documents for the press and for exhibitions were Jewish women in central
 Europe, some of whom were Michaelis's employers. Her first job was as
 an assistant for Dora Kallmus, who opened the Atelier d'Ora in Vienna
 in 1907. D'Ora's fashion photographs were so popular that by 1925 she
 opened another studio in Paris.
<sup><a name="REF55" href="#FOOT55">55</a></sup>
 In a later job in Berlin, Michaelis was initiated into portraiture
 under the guidance of Suse Byk. Byk's photographs of intellectuals and
 celebrities appeared widely in books and magazines of the period. Like
 D'Ora, Byk sustained her photographic practice for over twenty years.
<sup><a name="REF56" href="#FOOT56">56</a></sup>
 Although Michaelis's experience with these successful photographers
 expanded her knowledge of a diversity of techniques and further oriented
 her to the photographic culture of Weimar Germany, she would really
 only fully exploit portraiture when she re-established herself in
 Australia after fleeing Europe in 1939.

<p>
For her work in Spain, Michaelis was most likely influenced by two other
women photographers. Both Lucia Moholy, who created some of the most
memorable documents of the Bauhaus school's architecture, products,
and lifestyle, and Germaine Krull, who photographed the high and low
of urban existence (the Eiffel Tower and the streets of Marseilles),
had exhibited in Germany's photography exhibitions.
<sup><a name="REF57" href="#FOOT57">57</a></sup>
 Though their direct influence on Michaelis remains undocumented, they
 were both widely published pioneers in the field of architectural
 photography.
<sup><a name="REF58" href="#FOOT58">58</a></sup>
 Michaelis's photographs of G.A.T.C.P.A.C. architecture, her
 documentation of the <i>Barrio Chino</i>, and her own photographs of
 Marseilles were certainly influenced by the concurrent activities of
 both women. Lucia Moholy had set a precedent with her photographs of
 and for the Bauhaus for Michaelis's own role as the G.A.T.C.P.A.C.'s
 most important documentarian. The connection between the two women
 is even greater than formal affinities. Just about one month before
 Michaelis moved to Barcelona, Lucia Moholy had written

<b></b>

to Josep Lluis Sert in search of employment as the group's new
photographer.
<sup><a name="REF59" href="#FOOT59">59</a></sup>
 While no response to the letter is archived with the
 G.A.T.C.P.A.C. materials and there is no evidence that Moholy ever
 photographed for the group, it may be that her inquiry sparked Sert
 and others to consider Michaelis's potential more seriously. After
 all, by enlisting Michaelis's services they were able to custom order
 affordable modern images of their buildings that could be used in
 both their illustrated publications and exhibitions. With Michaelis's
 pedigree from the photographic studios of Vienna and Berlin, she
 offered the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. a direct link to Europe's most advanced
 photographic work. In addition, she complied with the magazine's
 emphasis on collective authorship, allowing the group to publish her
 photographs without her studio name.

<p>
For Michaelis, the political significance of photographing architecture
would have been equally important to having role models. In Berlin
and Prague, modern architecture and photography were coterminous
developments. Benjamin's remarks in the "Work of Art in the Age of
Mechanical Reproduction" are instructive. He argued that architecture,
like photography, was consumed by the collective "in a state of
distraction" ("TWOA," 259). In other words, as opposed to works which
called attention to themselves, architecture encouraged a "tactile
appropriation" based on habit ("TWOA," 240). Anonymity combined
with the democratic effect of exhibition value, forged a greater
connection between the image and the masses than individual works of
art. Ironically, while Michaelis's identity may have been unknown,
her anonymous photographs contributed to the political formation of
Barcelona's collective culture. As habitual images, ones which were
reproduced in some of the city's most aesthetically progressive magazines
(<i>D'Ac&iacute; i D'All&agrave;</i> and <i>A.C.</i>) and featured in
the G.A.T.C.P.A.C.'s didactic exhibitions of the mid-1930s (<i>Nova
Barcelona</i> and <i>Barcelona Futura</i>), Michaelis's photographs,
which de-emphasized authorship, had conversely achieved wide recognition.

<p>
Michaelis and the architects, advertisers, and publications she
worked for in Barcelona held a shared education in photography and
modernity that had its roots in German (and French) developments of the
1920s. From Salvador Dal&iacute;'s 1929 "La dada fotografica," in which
he reproduced associated press photographs from L&aacute;szl&oacute;
Moholy-Nagy's <i>Painting Photography Film</i>, to the format and content
of <i>A.C.</i>, modeled after magazines like <i>Das Neue Frankfurt</i>,
the influence of the German "New Objectivity" photography was clearly
established in Barcelona before Michaelis arrived in 1933-34.
<sup><a name="REF60" href="#FOOT60">60</a></sup>
 Nor was she alone in pursuing a career in photography that drew
 upon all of the medium's modern applications. Her work did, however,
 embody more radically than any other of her contemporaries in Spain
 the qualities of the "document" and photography's exhibition value as
 put forth by Moholy-Nagy and Benjamin. In doing so, her erasure of aura
 and origin as measures of artistic worth were based, as Benjamin noted,
 "on another practice&#8212;politics" ("TWOA," 224).

<p>
How successful her practice was, as a political gesture, depends upon
where we stand as interpreters. The photographs that she published in
<i>A.C.</i>, and even more those which she took and published during the
Civil War in magazines like <i>Nova Iberia</i>, had a tremendous impact
on viewers of the period and historians of Spanish culture

<b></b>

into the present. However, the implications of her photographs for
an interpretation of culture that includes gender could only be more
fully established with the identification of Michaelis as the author
of these same photographs. Once acknowledged as the author of images
that were signposts for modernity in Spain, the relationship between
herself as photographer and her subjects becomes more complex. That
a Jewish, anarchist woman from Austria came and took some of the
twentieth-century's most recognizable images of Spanish architecture
and urban culture <i>is</i> significant, for it opens up the history of
modernity in Spain to issues of gender, class, and nationality. Moreover,
it imbeds within the fabric of modernity itself a case which rewrites
typical categories of authorship, gender, and artistic value.

In recent years, a number of exhibition catalogues have been published
on the history of modern photography in Spain. Among these, the
following provide useful background on the relationship of commercial
and amateur photography to the avant-garde: <i>Idas &amp; Chaos: Trends
in Spanish Photography, 1920-1945</i> (Madrid, Ministry of Culture,
1985); <i>Les avantguardes fotogr&agrave;fiques a espanya, 1925-1945</i>
(Barcelona: Fundaci&oacute; "la Caixa," 1997); and Juan Naranjo, Joan
Fontcuberta, Pere Formiguera, Laura Terr&eacute; Alonso, and David
Balsells, <i>Introducci&oacute;n a la Historia de la Fotograf&iacute;a
en Catalu&ntilde;a</i> (Barcelona: Lunwerg Editores, 2000).

Sala did take a widely published photograph of a man ascending a ladder
in a studio designed by Sert. It appeared in "Arquitectura moderna,"
<i>D'Ac&iacute; i d'All&agrave;</i> (Spring 1932): n.p. Notably, the
photograph emphasizes the active movement of the man through the space as
opposed to the confined movement of the women in Sala's other photographs.

This photograph is one of the only images from Spain that Michaelis
published in Australia, where she lived after fleeing Europe in 1939. The
vintage copy conserved in the National Gallery of Australia is a large,
carefully finished print which attests to the value it held for Michaelis.

Although the material on Margaret Michaelis's time in Spain is
scarce, her husband's role in the Civil War is well documented in both
primary and secondary sources. See, for example, Pere Bosch-Gimpera,
<i>Mem&ograve;ries</i> (Barcelona: Edicions 62, 1980), 199; and Ennis,
"Margaret Michaelis in Context," 159-61.

Based on documents in the G.A.T.C.P.A.C. archive in the Arxiu
Hist&ograve;ric of the Col.legi d'Arquitectes de Catalunya and magazines
published in Barcelona after the Civil War, it is clear that Michaelis
had little to do with the publication of her photographs, which continued
to appear in print even after she had left the country.

<p>
<a name="FOOT25" href="#REF25">25</a>.

Michaelis recalled the Taverna dels Tenors in a biographical statement
titled "Photography is an Art for Her," ca. 1948-49, source unknown,
courtesy of Helen Ennis and the National Gallery of Australia: "Her
greatest love was for Spain with its uninhibited peasantry and half-pagan
rituals. There she frequented the famous 'Bar of Tenoro' in Barcelona
and found her subjects never had to be coaxed." For a description of the
Taverna dels Tenors, see Vilar, <i>Historia y Legenda del Barrio Chino
1900-1992</i>, 158-59.

Juan Jos&eacute; Lahuerta has argued that Michaelis was the only
photographer in Barcelona who truly worked as a photo-reporter. See his
"My little Leica," in <i>MMFVP</i>, 164-68.

<p>
<a name="FOOT45" href="#REF45">45</a>.
The unnatural silencing of women from the canon for reasons of gender is
an important historiographical issue that directly relates to the lack
of interest in discovering Michaelis's authorship until recently and
may be related to the reasons why she chose to take on a gender-neutral
professional identity, a move which she shared with many other women
photographers. On the issue of silences, see Elaine Hedges and Shelley
Fisher Fiskin, eds., <i>Listening to Silence: New Essays in Feminist
Criticism</i> (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994).
