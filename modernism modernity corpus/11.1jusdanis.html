Ruins have always incited a reflective, lyrical, or melancholic
response. People are perversely fascinated by the sight of crumbling
temples, of abandoned cities overgrown with shrubs, of marble heads
peering out through the sand, of roads grown silent. They take a macabre
pleasure in observing the evidence of human decay and the final victory
of nature over civilization. Individuals through the ages have taken
different lessons from this drama.
<p>
Some see in ruins a cautionary tale of the futility of greatness and
the inevitability of rot. Like the anamorphic portrayal of the skull in
Holbein's magnificent painting, <i>The Ambassadors,</i> ruins serve for
them as a reminder that everything human will one day perish. For others,
however, ruins represent the longevity of human creation. The Parthenon,
the famed city of Persepolis destroyed by Alexander, and the mosaics of
Leptis Magna in North Africa stand as testaments of art and engineering,
humanity's defiance against the sands of the desert and of the hourglass.
<p>
While we, like people in the past, may be stirred by the majesty of
the Pyramids or moved by the ashes of Carthage, we nevertheless have
a different perception of the material past. Our view is colored
by archaeology, which, in its desire to save and restore the past,
transforms it into something modern. Archaeology paradoxically makes
ruins look "unancient": skeletal remains brought to life in sound and
light shows. Scrubbed, fenced off, and scaffolded, ruins have never
looked as they do now.
<p>
Previous societies, as travelers Rose Macaulay and Christopher Woodward
have pointed out, allowed buildings to tumble, disappear, and become
covered by flowers. Quite often people constructed their houses or entire
cities on the wreck of previous


<b></b>


settlements, as Christian Rome was built upon the pagan city. Early
Christian churches often incorporated broken columns, fragments
of sculptures, or marble slabs from classical temples into their
structures. These early buildings were essentially syncretic (in the
way early Christianity was), combining the pagan and the Christian
architecturally as well as theologically. Ruins formed part of the urban
and natural environment, a habitat not only for bushes, birds, and bats,
but also for hermits, visitors, and madmen. Christopher Woodward waxes
elegiac about how until the nineteenth century the Colosseum was an
enchanting garden of rare plants and flowers&#x02014;brought as seeds,
it is believed, by the exotic animals once slaughtered there&#x02014;and
a refuge for poets, artists, beggars, pilgrims, and eccentrics.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
The Acropolis was cramped with postclassical structures, including a
Frankish tower and an Ottoman minaret. Today, with these buildings
gone, the Acropolis is supposed to represent the classical period,
even though in that age it never looked like this.
<p>
Both Macaulay and Woodward mourn the cleansing and ordering of the
past. "It is the familiar tragedy of archaeology&#x02014;the sacrifice of
beauty to knowledge," Macaulay complains.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
This sacrifice of stillness and mystery represents for Woodward a loss
to the poet. For the archaeologist, "the scattered fragments of stone
are parts of a jigsaw, or clues to a puzzle for which there is only
one answer, as in a science laboratory" (<i>IR,</i> 30). The poet,
by contrast, looks for any answer stirred by the imagination. Macaulay
and Woodward bring to the fore that peculiarly modern dilemma: Should
we leave the material past as it is, deriving inspiration from it? Or
should we clean it up and protect it, thereby rendering it static? There
is little doubt on which side they stand.
<p>
Woodward, for instance, longs for the Colosseum of yesteryear, the garden
visited by Chateaubriand, Goethe, Byron, Poe, and fictionally by James's
Daisy Miller. Instead of today's "bald, dead and bare circle of stones,"
he yearns for the 1820s when Stendhal watched an Englishman ride his
horse in the arena at night. "I wish that could be me," he adds wistfully
(<i>IR,</i> 30-1). Macaulay and Woodward dream of the rapture among ruins
experienced by travelers before archaeology, like the indefatigable Lady
Hester Stanhope arriving in 1846, as one of the first Europeans, to the
once glorious Roman city of Palmyra, hidden deep in the deserts of the
Levant; or the French architect who chanced upon the extraordinary Doric
Temple of Apollo at Bassae (Arcadia), forgotten for centuries except by
local shepherds.
<p>
Those who take the hair-raising drive to this temple today, passing
by villages clinging hopefully to cliffs, come upon a Christo-like
work&#x02014;a bizarre-looking structure covered by a white, gleaming
canvas rising in a series of cone towers. Archaeologists have taken
this extreme step to protect the temple from the harsh mountain
environment while they restore it by disassembling the entire structure
piece by piece. The effect of the cover, which may last for decades,
is virtually to erase the temple from the mountain. In place of the
Doric masterpiece is a postmodern work. "Et in arcadia <i>non</i> ego,"
Macaulay and Woodward would say. One can only imagine how travelers
from the ancient geographer Pausanias onwards reacted upon arriving at
the solitary spot and witnessing the austere splendor of the ruins so
vulnerable, exposed to wind and ice. What hubris must have possessed
the cosmopolitan architects of the Parthenon to


<b></b>


construct a temple on a mountain in Arcadia! "A noble wreck in ruinous
perfection!" wrote Byron of the Colosseum
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
&#x02014;mournful lines describing the Temple of Apollo at Bassae as well.
<p>
The protective wrap that robs the temple of its nobility points to the
uniqueness of our modern, archaeological conception of ruins. In the
service of the state and the doctrines of nationalism and historic
preservation, archaeology has tidied sites by razing non-ancient
buildings, clearing the temples of vegetation, cataloguing all the fallen
pillars, fencing them off from the city, guarding them from further
decay. Archaeology has attempted for a hundred years to spruce up aging
beauties by removing blemishes and wrinkles.
<p>
Has the whitewashing of the edifices led to the departure of the Muses,
as Macaulay and Woodward fear? Can modernized ruins still mesmerize? Do
we have a spiritual relationship to ancient sites fenced off from their
urban and natural setting, trampled by tourists, and littered with Kodak
boxes? Can a building on which neither spider webs may form nor owls
roost still stir our imagination?
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>

<p>
A look at the way modernist Greek poets understood and used the past in
their work could help us answer some of these questions. For these poets,
like their nineteenth-century predecessors, made frequent references to
antiquity. The ruins of Athens had become an inevitable topic for these
poets for two reasons. First, the international discourse of Hellenism,
which had posited classical Greece as the fountainhead of European
civilization, had rendered classical culture a compelling topic for
all the arts. Modern Greeks poets followed suit. Unlike the Europeans,
however, who sought their <i>continental</i> roots in Hellas, modern
Greeks traced their <i>national</i> genealogy to the ancient Greeks. They
came increasingly to view themselves as heirs to an illustrious tradition.
<p>
Second, Greek poets could see classical monuments every day. Yiannis
Psycharis (1854-1929) had the major political, artistic, and philosophical
luminaries of Athens come to life on the Acropolis, for instance in
<i>To Taxidi mou</i> (1888 [My journey]).
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
Not solely a topic to be learned abstractly in the <i>Gymnasium</i>,
the classics could be seen in the refurbished Parthenon, heard in the
purified Greek language, and experienced in pre-Christian customs. Thus,
unlike H&#x000F6;lderlin, Freud, Ernest Renan, or Virginia Woolf, Greek
poets never had to ask themselves whether the Hellas taught in school
actually existed. Few experienced moments of epiphany on the Acropolis
or rapture in the Temple of Poseidon at Sounion. These poets had joined
artists, architects, city-planners, historians, linguists, folklorists,
and philologists in the grand enterprise of the nineteenth century to
restore classical Greece.
<p>
In order to understand the relationship between archaeology and
modernist poetry, we need to look briefly at the way archaeology
(along with folklore and literary criticism) had been conscripted in
the nineteenth-century mission to resurrect Hellas. As Greeks began in
the latter part of the eighteenth century to trace the source of their
ethnic uniqueness in antiquity, they employed archaeology to provide
the material basis for their claims.
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
In one respect this was a predictable method of justifying
authority. Royal families and ethnic groups have often sought the
prestige of a glorious


<b></b>


past to bolster their power. In modernity, as the Greek case shows,
this pursuit has been spearheaded by a nationalism that sought for the
first time in history a union between culture and power, the nation and
the state, the government and the governed.
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
In their quest for liberation from the Ottoman Empire and the
establishment of an independent nation-state, Greek nationalists used
classical antiquity as a way of demonstrating to Europeans the efficacy,
integrity, and durability of Greek culture. They also identified
the value of a glorious past in their strategy to endow Greeks with
the self-assurance to undertake the exciting but perilous journey
towards modernity. As the earliest people of the Ottoman Empire to seek
political sovereignty, they were the first to see the significance of
both the existing monuments and future archaeological discoveries as
banners of national identity. The Greeks were the first to understand
the larger political significance of archaeology, seeing in it a means
of legitimating geographical and historical claims, of demonstrating
a diachronic continuity, and of instilling in people a sense of pride
about their past. Other nations in the Balkans and the Near East have
subsequently employed this argument in their pursuit of independence.
<p>
Although the growing Greek interest in the past was partly a result of
the European discourse of Hellenism, it was also a nationalist reaction
to the plunder, motivated by this discourse, of antiquities, which began
in the seventeenth century. A German archaeologist had quipped with some
justification that by 1840 the most renowned examples of Greek art were
to be found in European museums.
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>
It was understandable, therefore, that the Greeks should attempt to
gain control of both the idea and the physical remnants of Greece. To
this effect the Philomousos Etaireia was formed in 1803 in Athens for
the study and protection of antiquities. Adamandios Korais (1748-1833),
the first Greek scholar systematically to study Greek antiquity, called
in 1807 for the end of the removal of antiquities and manuscripts from
Greece. Once established, the provisional government passed a law in
1829 forbidding the export of ancient artifacts.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
The Archaeological Act of 1834 set out to regulate the practice of
excavation. In the course of the nineteenth century the Greek government
passed successive measures to administer the excavation of sites,
fund museums in Athens and the provinces, and generally preserve the
remnants of the past. To protect the monuments of Athens, Eleni Bastea
has shown, planners fenced them off, removing them in this way from
the city fabric. More important, they endowed monuments with sanctity,
making their destruction not only illegal but also sacrilegious.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
These very acts had the effect that so strikes the modern traveler of
distancing the monuments from everyday life.
<p>
The Greek conception of the past was quite pragmatic. Greeks had little
nostalgia &#x000E0; la "Ozymandius" for the lost world of broken statues;
no feelings of sorrow at the passing of greatness; no sense of awe at
the ephemeral nature of earthly power. Rather than anguishing over the
destruction of the temples, Greeks had to preserve them and to prevent the
further plunder of what they now considered their inheritance. Archaeology
exuded this national optimism, promising more beautiful objects and
knowledge about the past.


<b></b>


<p>
The care for antiquities transcended archaeology itself, having become a
major concern of politicians, intellectuals, artists, journalists, poets,
and teachers alike. It was part of the greater effort to restore the past,
promoted by leading institutions, which touched all aspects of life. This
effort was motivated by the belief that Greeks could resuscitate the past
by planning cities according to ancient models, by purging the demotic
language of Turkish words, by giving classical names to children, by
praising the Acropolis in verse, and by designing neoclassical buildings.
<p>
This conception of antiquity shows the ongoing political and cultural
significance of the past. The Greek case shows that, rather than an
escape from daily realities, history can live in the present by pushing
it to the future. The Greeks turned to the past in their attempt to
become modern. A neoclassical Athenian house in the nineteenth century
was a sign of cosmopolitanism; a photograph of the Acropolis could serve
worldwide as a metonymic representation of modern Greece; for modernist
poets the classical material served as a way of addressing contemporary
problems. The Greek use of the past demonstrates what Woodward says more
generally of ruins: "When we contemplate ruins, we contemplate our future"
(<i>IR,</i> 2). The entry into the museum, Jonah Siegel argues in his
discussion of the "nineteenth-century culture of art," indicates a direct
engagement with what it means for a society to preserve, to organize,
and to admire objects from the past.
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>

<p>
By the end of the century and the advent of literary modernism, this
project had lost some of its confidence. The constant comparisons of
modern to ancient Greece and the inevitable disappointments became
taxing. The classical tradition, rather than providing a source of
pride and inspiration, had grown heavy. Neoclassicism developed
into a procrustean machine, pushing for linguistic and aesthetic
conformity. Under these pressures, Greek poets, like their counterparts
elsewhere, began to find the classical tradition stifling.
<p>
No European poet confronted the meaning of this de-idealization of
Greece more than Constantine Cavafy (1862-1933), who lived and died in
Alexandria, a city in the Hellenic diaspora. Cavafy was perhaps the
most archaeological poet, passionate in excavating the past but also
interested in uncovering an adulterated Greece, a Greece of cultural and
racial mixing. For Cavafy the past was alive, relevant, and modern. With
the exception of a few poems, his tone was rarely elegiac; he hardly
mourned the eclipse of ancient Alexandria. Unlike nineteenth-century
poets, and even his contemporary, Angelos Sikelianos (1884-1951), who
evoked the golden period of Greece, Cavafy preferred the Hellenistic age
and Roman late antiquity, epochs associated with decline and exhaustion.
<p>
Moreover, Cavafy developed a penchant for forgotten or neglected res
from these periods, for people to whom official narrative devoted only
a few lines. In "Kaisarion" , for instance, the speaker peruses a
book of inscriptions devoted to the Ptolemies. Bored by the sycophantic
praise of renowned kings and queens, his attention is drawn by a reference
to the minor king, Kaisarion (Caesarion), son of Cleopatra and Julius
Caesar, put to death by Augustus who feared "too many Caesars" claiming
the throne. At the end, the speaker imagines what he was like, beautiful,


<b></b>


sensual, and ideal in his sadness, because so little was written about
him. Not sharing the archaeologist's respect for historical integrity,
the speaker fills in the missing pieces of the mosaic.
<p>
In this and other poems, Cavafy dug through the deposits of time to
uncover the scraps of history. He approached antiquity as an epigrapher,
searching for inscriptions beneath romanticized layers of textual
scholarship. Characteristic is "In the Month of Athyr"  in which
the speaker attempts to decode the meaning of a gravestone. Through its
form and content the poem dramatizes the praxis of archaeology&#x02014;the
concern with the material world and the challenges of making broken
inscriptions, pots, and sculpture speak about their original surroundings.

<p>
The very first line places us in the act of reading a damaged
inscription. The vertical division of the poem emphasizes the effort
of extracting meaning from the disred surface by compelling the
reader to confront a caesura in every line. Square brackets, empty
spaces, rows of dots, and references to defaced lines further reinforce
the archaeological nature of our approach to the ancient world. As
the speaker's eyes descend along the lines of the stone, he uncovers
some facts: The inscription stems from well after the time of Christ;
the stone marked the grave of a Christian young man called Lefkios who
lived in Alexandria and died in the autumn at the age of twenty-seven;
he was loved deeply by friends and relatives.
<p>
In addition to enacting the scene of archaeology the poem reveals
Cavafy's modernist understanding of the classical past: He sets the poem
in late antiquity rather than the fifth century; he chooses Alexandria,
part of the extension of Hellenism at that time, rather than Athens
or mainland Greece; he focuses on the imaginary Lefkios, one of the
city's ordinary inhabitants, rather than on celebrated historical
res. "In the Month of Athyr" is one of about seven funerary poems
whose subjects are undistinguished young men&#x02014;young Willy Lomans of
the time&#x02014;taken from the racial, ethnic, and religious mix of the
Eastern Mediterranean. By focusing on this world, Cavafy prered by
many decades our contemporary interest in multicultural and hybrid Greece.
<p>
Having written about the Trojan War and the Battle of Thermopylae in early
didactic poems, Cavafy turned his back on heroic epochs, preferring the
"ignominy" of what


<b></b>


was then widely believed to be a period of Hellenic cultural
exhaustion. Since he studied and wrote about this period, he knew very
well that the fifth century could never be restored. Cavafy had no time
for an everlasting Greek spirit. The Parthenon makes no appearance in
his oeuvre. This stands in contrast to the paeans written to this temple
by poets in the latter nineteenth century;
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>
or to the passage in Psycharis's <i>To Taxidi mou</i> in which the
major political, artistic, and philosophical luminaries of Athens
come to life on the Acropolis of his day. Cavafy too made the ancient
Greeks come alive in his poetry, but his were the average Lefkios and
Lanis of the street. Although he took an oblique angle to Hellenism,
he continued to represent it as a supreme value, the global cultural
system of post-Alexander antiquity that elites of the Mediterranean
and Near East identified with. He qualified its authority by showing
it beholden to Roman power and vulnerable to barbarian threats. His
Hellenism, therefore, was ironic and self-mocking, conscious of its
own historical limitations while being open to racial and ethnic mixing.
<p>
Cavafy's modernist farewell to Hellas constitutes part of a larger
historicist reappraisal that had begun to situate Greece in the context
of the ancient world. No longer the originary culture par excellence,
Greece came to be regarded as an important society among the other
civilizations of antiquity&#x02014;Egypt, Persia, Israel, Sumeria, and
Babylonia&#x02014;some of which were ancient themselves by the fifth
century. Scholars of Egyptology and Assyriology, for instance, looked
to the classics as a paradigm for the development of their own fields,
adding, thereby, three thousand years to the history of Greece.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>

<p>
In this sense, classical studies paradoxically contributed to the undoing
of the Hellenic model. And archaeology itself played its part in the
ultimate ruin of this ideal. Although classical archaeology arose as a
discipline from the search for beautiful sculpture (the most prestigious
form of classical art in our post-Winckelmann world), it necessarily
unearthed information about the material world of Greece and other
Mediterranean societies that buried the ideas of Greece as source of
civilization and of classical art as ideal form.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
The excavations on the Acropolis, for instance, revealed statues of
<i>korai</i> (maidens) and <i>kouroi</i> (youth) from the sixth century
<small>B.C.,</small> painted in bright blues, reds, and yellows, colors
which seemed garish and tasteless to those who were accustomed to the
bright gleam of Pentelic marble. Similarly, the vast digs at Pompeii
and Herculaneum exposed a highly eroticized world of huge phalluses,
fornicating couples, men engaged in anal copulation. These scenes,
depicted on vases as well as on house walls, displayed a bacchic
sexuality in contrast to the idealized male torsos of neoclassicism,
which invited a restrained, if homoerotic, appreciation. Moreover,
the more knowledge archaeology yielded about Greece and about the
societies contemporaneous to and preceding it, the less credible was
the neoclassical ideal of an immaculately conceived Athens whose only
goal was the appreciation of beauty.
<p>
Modernist poets, like Cavafy, embraced this de-idealized picture
of Hellas. Modernism itself reacted against the calcification of
classicism. In general, it became disenchanted with the restoration
project in which archaeology was a chief participant. Instead of taking
the past as a given to be exploited, modernist writers problematized


<b></b>


their relationship to it. They increasingly asked themselves whether we
could know the past at all as archaeology had promised, whether it could
be resuscitated in a way still meaningful to the present, or whether
the past had become a dead weight.
<p>
We see these questions posed in the poem, "The King of Asini," by the
Nobel Prize-winning poet Georgios Seferis (1900-1971). Like Cavafy,
Seferis was born in the Hellenic diaspora, in his case, in Smyrna
(Izmir). In contrast to Cavafy's bare, reserved, metonymic language,
he wrote in the grand modernist manner of T. S. Eliot, developing an
elliptical and highly metaphoric verse overloaded with images of loss,
war, alienation, and homelessness.
<p>
Unlike Cavafy, Seferis did not develop a theory of antiquity; yet he
returned to ancient Greece as a way of commenting on the horrors of the
modern world. In the sublime "Helen," for instance, he used a different
version of the Helen myth
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
&#x02014;in which a likeness of Helen went to Troy while the real one
stayed in Egypt&#x02014;to reflect on the vanity of war and on the ease
with which human beings are deceived into ting for nothing:

<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
And the rivers swelled blood in the silt
<br />
for a linen wave, a cloud
<br />
a butterfly's flutter, a swan's feather
<br />
an empty shirt, for a Helen.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Similarly, in "The Argonauts," he employed Jason's courageous but
compliant companions as symbols of toil, exile, and silence. Having done
their duty in order to retrieve the Golden Fleece, these sailors died
one by one without any recognition. "No one remembers them. Justice."
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
Other poems are littered with broken statues that allude less to
antiquities than to a disjointed life today.
<p>
"The King of Asini" differs in that it actually deals with the ancient
world, and specifically with the capacity of archaeology to reveal the
secrets of the past. The poem begins with a brief citation of the word
"Asini," which Seferis takes from the <i>Iliad,</i> in the same way that
he starts his "Helen" with a quotation from Euripides's tragedy. That
the Greek language constitutes, along with Chinese, the longest unbroken
linguistic tradition in the world, allows Greek poems to quote texts
from previous ages without necessarily having to translate them into
the demotic. Modernist poets, as Vassilis Lambropoulos explains, used
the device of quotation, rather than that of allusion, to address an
earlier text.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
Cavafy was the master practitioner of this technique, constantly
incorporating material from classical sources in his poetry, showing
thereby the diachronic extensions of Greek as well as the thickness
of textuality.
<p>
The citation of ancient or Byzantine lines in modern poems demonstrates
the continued presence of the classics in modernity. In Seferis's case,
the quotation emphasizes that antiquity is both familiar and strange to
the Greek reader, who can recognize words but would need some help with
the ancient Greek syntax. This juxtaposition of the known with the unknown
works well in "The King of Asini," since its theme is the gulf between
antiquity and the present. The speakers, the unnamed "we," have been


<b></b>


searching two years for the grave of the King of Asini, one of the Greek
warriors who fought in Troy. They acknowledge the scanty written record,
for "only one word exists in the Iliad and that uncertain." Like Kaisarion
in Cavafy's poem, all have forgotten the king, even Homer himself. The
only reference we have is the word "Asini" in the "catalogue of ships"
section of the <i>Iliad</i> that Seferis cites. In Cavafy's poem the
speaker/poet spurns the well-documented kings and queens, deliberately
choosing to write about Kaisarion so as to fashion him freely in his
mind as a beautiful, sympathetic boy. He delights in the paucity of the
written record because this enables his creative freedom. For Seferis,
on the other hand, this lack becomes a metaphysical problem, frustrating
the speakers/poets who long to know the past. The word "Asini" lies
buried like a "funerary gold mask," incapable of speaking about itself.
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>
When they touch it, they hear an empty sound like that made by the still
unexcavated jar. The King of Asini is himself a "void below the mask,"
his children statues, and his "desires the fluttering of birds." What
remains of the king are metaphors: the wind "in the intervals of his
thoughts" and the memory of his "ships docked in a vanished harbor."
<p>
Tarrying among the stones "the poet" asks himself what we can possibly
unearth from the soil of antiquity. What can we find here "among
these broken lines, edges, points, cavities, curves?" Nothing, is his
answer. Capable of knowing little of a "previous living existence," we
are left with only the "weight" of its memory. Running our fingers along
these very stones, we can perhaps sense the king's "touch" lingering on
them. Or we can believe that he has taken the form of a bat, darting out
of the cave and striking the light "like an arrow hitting a shield." These
ghosts now haunt the once mighty citadel of Asini.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>

<p>
The image of the bat hitting the sunlight shows that these unfenced
ruins still inspire the poet. But it is important to distinguish
between the search for the citadel of Asini by the speakers of this
poem and Macaulay's and Woodward's visits to the Colosseum. Seferis's
anguished questions about the very existence of antiquity differ
from those posed by Western travelers in pursuit of a communion with
ancient ruins. Rather than expressing surprise at finally witnessing a
world-famous monument or disappointment at the sight of fences, Seferis
wonders what we can ascertain of the life beneath the funerary mask. He
asks whether the Greek stones speak to his modernist sensibilities. His
negative response indicates not only disenchantment with the sanguine
promises of archaeology to communicate with the past; it also manifests
weariness with classical antiquity as both cultural ideal and subject
matter for art. This is why the poet himself becomes a "void." His own
emptiness tacitly acknowledges that antiquity has become a "weight"
for moderns and modernists alike because they can find little to say
about it. The modernist poet is silenced by the stillness of the past
and by the modern verbiage about this stillness. The poet in Seferis's
poem expresses both the anxiety of influence&#x02014;that his approach to
antiquity was borrowed from Cavafy
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
&#x02014;and the anxiety of excess&#x02014;that thousands of lines have
already been devoted to the classics. Hence modernists chose to change
the topic or to write in a different mode, as we will see in the case
of Nicolas Calas.


<b></b>


<p>
It is ironic that, although archaeology had first raised questions about
the ahistorical conception of Greek art by unearthing information about
Greek and other societies, classical archaeology in the twentieth century
has buried its own past. It has chosen instead for decades to identify its
fate with the very classical ideal that it helped historicize. Because
of this disciplinary amnesia the revolutionary aspect of archaeology
has also been forgotten. Yet archaeology as an approach to history
is unprecedented. While other societies had an interest in the past,
nothing resembling the modern discipline of archaeology existed before
the modern age.
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
There was no systematic study of previous societies and certainly no
interest in excavating the earth for its cultural treasures, other
than the pursuit of the riches in graves. The ancient Greeks, for
instance, had a very limited antiquarian tradition, at least before
Alexander. Hellenistic kings and then the Romans first began to value
and collect examples of Greek art, a practice to be revived in Byzantine
Constantinople
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
and later in the Italian Renaissance. The great families of Renaissance
Italy, such as the Farnese, Medici, and Ludovici, as well as popes and
bishops, began to acquire vast collections primarily of Roman copies of
Greek sculpture. Their desire for Greek originals led to excavations
that yielded such extraordinary discoveries as the 1506 find of the
Laoco&#x000F6;n, a dramatic Hellenistic sculpture depicting the writhing
bodies of the Trojan priest Laoco&#x000F6;n and his two sons being strangled
by huge serpents.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
Works such as these came to represent the epitome of Greek sculpture:
simplicity and quiet grandeur, or in the words of Johann Joachim
Winckelmann (1717-1768), composure in the midst of passions.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>

<p>
This strong interest in Greek art established a relationship to antiquity
that was unique, for it posited classical Greece as a utopia worthy of
emulation. Travelers went to Italy and then to Greece with the aim of
observing, recording, and removing its masterpieces. To highlight the
difference between these modern travelers and their ancient counterparts,
Nikolaus Himmelmann points to the trip to Greece undertaken by the Roman
officer Aemilius Paullus in 167 <small>B.C</small>. Although Paullus
observed famous works of art, he saw them principally as religious
representations. Similarly, when travelers came through these regions
during the Middle Ages, they did so as pilgrims or crusaders rather than
as collectors of art.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>
It was modernity, Himmelmann argues, that first created antiquity
as a completely different society, a non-Christian alternative to
itself. There was no such temporal or cultural other for the Greeks and
Romans; no ancient languages to be learned, no substitute for Greek and
Roman literature, no supplementary world, save for the deep mythic past
and the barbarian hordes beyond the frontiers.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
Although the Greeks and Romans interacted with the barbarians in war and
trade, they had set up the cultural boundaries between themselves and
the outer world so dramatically presented in Euripides's <i>Medea</i>
and Aeschylus's <i>The Persians</i>.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
For modernity, however, the classical period constituted something
familiar and strange, a society separate from the present yet also
connected to it, an ideal to be copied and a burden to be overthrown.
<p>
Winckelmann contributed hugely to the creation of this double inheritance,
having made the admiration of classical art, particularly sculpture,
mandatory for Europeans. In <i>Reflections on the Imitation of Greek
Works in Painting and Sculpture</i> , for


<b></b>


instance, he argued that the only way for moderns to become great was
by imitating the Greeks as opposed to imitating nature.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
His observation of Greek statues in Rome helped establish the modern
appreciation of art: Viewers are invited to find in an object an ideal
of beauty. His work determined the simultaneous historicization and
idealization of art, placing Greek art in its historical context and
on a pedestal. It is not by chance that Winckelmann never traveled to
Greece, preferring an aestheticized Greece to the real one. An actual
visit might have ruined his fantasy.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
At the same time, however, his work provided art with its own
disciplinary history and associated it with a wider history. In
<i>History of Ancient Art</i>  he explicitly connected Greek
art to freedom. It was the self-governance of Greece, he argued, that
created the superiority of its art.
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
The free Greeks, in turn, he argued, loved beauty as no other people.
<p>
This idealization of Greece increased the demand for knowledge about the
country. More and more Europeans searched for an ideal in an area still
ruled by the Ottomans. Travelers extended the Grand Tour to the Greek
territories and the Levant in their effort to identify and describe
famous classical sites, often using ancient historians like Pausanias
as their guides.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
They brought back with them inscriptions, broken statues, parts of
temples.
<p>
Archaeology was a pastime for these aristocratic men concerned with
expanding both their cultural horizons and their personal collections. In
the course of the nineteenth century, however, archaeology evolved
into a scholarly practice, part of the university-based science of
<i>Altertumswissenschaft</i> that German scholars had created.
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
This was the time of the first systematic and large-scale excavations
in Greece: Olympia , Delphi , and later the Agora in
Athens. Although motivated by the discovery of exceptional sculpture
to rival the Elgin Marbles (stored in the British Museum), the Victory
of Samothrace (the Louvre), and the pediments of the Temple of Aphaia
in Aegina (the Glyptotek, Munich), these excavations actually gave
archaeology scholarly credibility in the field of classical studies. For
archaeologists in the nineteenth century were the ones responsible for
discovering, interpreting, and popularizing Greek art, the one realm
in which the ancients held superiority over the moderns.
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>

<p>
That Greek archaeology gained scholarly credibility does not mean that
it had jettisoned its idealized approach to the past. Like modernism,
it remained caught in the contradictions of its epistemological
inheritance. Both literature and archaeology were products of the
eighteenth-century philosophical, cultural, economic, and social
transformations that saw the rise of the notion of aesthetic autonomy,
the practice of aesthetic appreciation, and the institutions of art,
literature, and criticism. As a result, modernism and archaeology
conceived of culture as a collection of masterpieces and upheld the idea
of transcendent beauty. More important, both believed in the purity of
aesthetic forms.
<p>
Thus Cavafy subjected to criticism nearly all social institutions
(religion, government, bureaucracy) and norms (sexual, moral), except
beauty. He foregrounded art by turning his poems into exercises for the
reflection on art, poetry, language, tradition, and the audience.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
He rendered poetry, and by extension art, a human fabrication without
mystery and aura. At the same time, he enjoined readers to appreciate
beauty,


<b></b>


in art or in youth, with a nearly religious devotion. Beauty was for him,
on the one hand, a human invention, and on the other, a Platonic domain
of permanence. In his poetics earthly beauty, such as that of Lefkios,
could be saved in the absolute realm of poetry. The only solace in a
world of aging bodies and ruined civilizations was that transcendent
realm of art. The goal of the artist was to save ephemeral experiences
by entrusting them to this realm.
<p>
This is also the role archaeology has assumed for itself. On the one hand,
archaeology contributed to the historicization of Greek art. But on the
other, it persisted until the last few decades in affirming the primacy
of this art. Because Greek archaeology, according to Ian Morris, saw
itself as part of Classics rather than the general field of archaeology,
it showed little interest in challenging narratives based on literary
texts with its ability to trace historical change.
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
Greek archaeologists embraced "the innocuous role of shielding the
textual world from disruption by material culture."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>
Until recently they have tied their fate to the preeminence
of Greek culture in the West. But as its superiority was
subjected to critique&#x02014;to which they wittingly or
unwittingly contributed&#x02014;they were left little ideological
justification. Nonetheless, Stephen L. Dyson asserts, Greek archaeology
functions even today as if the aesthetic values of Hellenism still held
the same relevance in scholarship or society at large as they did a
hundred years ago.
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>

<p>
Modernist poets have reacted to this continued idealization of art and to
archaeology's mission of aesthetic restoration and preservation. This
critique comes out quite clearly in the poem, "Acropolis," by the
avant-garde poet Nicolas Calas (1907-1988) who, like Cavafy and Seferis,
spent his adult life outside Greece, first in Paris and then in New
York. As a modernist poet, Calas could not write about the Acropolis,
a place of overdetermined national and global significance, without
the distance of irony. After all, what could he possibly say about
it that had not already been said by politicians, poets, journalists,
art historians, or archaeologists? By the time of modernism both the
Acropolis and archaeology itself had become familiar in Greece to the
point of becoming oppressive to many. In the work of the popular national
poet Kostis Palamas (1859-1943), for instance, the word "Acropolis"
occurs eighty-eight times and "Parthenon" ninety-one times.
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
In his poem, "The King's Flute," Palamas associated the "pure and
grand Doric temple" with the nation: "Each time Fate pitilessly strikes
the Nation [<i>Genos</i>], the temple, the heart of the Nation first
withstands the blow."
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>

<p>
It would have been impossible for Calas to ignore the various
interpretations of the Acropolis. So in a typical avant-garde way, he
wrote about the uses, or interpretations, of the Acropolis. His first
object was Yiannis Psycharis, who promoted a militant demotic version of
the popular language, Greek culture, and antiquity that Calas felt debased
antiquity. He then criticized foreigners, like the Swiss photographer Fred
Boissonas (who conducted extensive photographic visits of Greece in the
early twentieth century) for exploiting the image of the Acropolis. While
in Psycharis Calas saw the vulgarization of the Parthenon, in Boissonas
he condemned its commodification. Renan, "the official sexton of the
Acropolis," initiated the modern pilgrimage by foreigners to the sacred
rock while "Herr Karl Baedeker" let in the hordes with the "Agfa and Kodak


<b></b>


rolls of film." For Calas these tourists daily bombard the Parthenon with
their cameras, shooting it much in the way that the Venetians in 1687
bombed the interior of the temple where the Turks had stored gunpowder.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>

<p>
As a modernist devoted to the purity of forms, Calas was disgusted with
the transformation of the Acropolis into a site of global tourism as
well as an object reproduced in postcards, small sculptures, and trinkets.
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
He opposed the idealization and commercialization of antiquity,
its conversion into both national shrine and house of capitalist
prostitution. This repugnance with mass culture is surely one of
the chief characteristics of modernism. As John Carey has shown,
modernists reacted with hostility to the emergence of mass culture and
such phenomena as suburbs, tourism, tabloids, and comic books.
<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup>
Actually they had a contradictory relationship with their audience,
condemning it for crassness while yearning for recognition. This
position, perhaps always defining the modern artist, was particularly
acute for radicals like Calas whose progressive politics took the
opposite direction of their elitist, highly formalized, and abstract
aesthetics.
<p>
Thus Calas still remained committed to the purity of aesthetic forms,
to an unadorned Doric temple, free from the banality of flags and
guidebooks. His critique of the archaeological project of restoration
and its cheap exploitation of classical monuments resembles that of
later writers like Macaulay and Woodward. Although Calas did not long,
as they do, for a Parthenon that still bears the accumulation of time
and nature, he believed in the primacy of the original. This explains
why Calas focused so much attention in his poem on the click-clack of the
cameras, the rolls of film, and the floodlights. The cameras for him led
to the kitsch reproduction of the temple, "killing it with their lens,"
leaving it "dead" and "fake."
<p>
Modernism and archaeology were, as I noted earlier, both products of
the same aesthetic and philosophical developments of the eighteenth
century. Ultimately both relied on the concept of pure aesthetic form
and on the majesty of the original over the copy. Even though high
modernism put into doubt many social institutions, it reserved a special
place, beyond contingency and decay, for beautiful forms. Likewise,
the disciplinary rationale of archaeology was its capacity to unearth
ever more Greek originals to house in museums packed with less desirable
Roman copies. It is not a coincidence that Calas reacted so violently
to the intrusion of the cameras on the Acropolis and the exploitation
of the Parthenon in advertising. The new technologies of reproduction
threatened, as Walter Benjamin noted, the aesthetic aura of art.
<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup>

<p>
From our perspective we have come to understand that this aura has hardly
been tarnished. If anything, photography and new electronic modes of
reproduction have reinforced the power and appeal of the original. We
see this in the high prices commanded by original works of art and the
magic allure of masterpieces like the bust of Nefertiti and the Mona
Lisa, or original documents such as the Magna Carta and the American
Declaration of Independence. All of these are approached with religious
veneration. The power of the original, to use an example from Greek
archaeology, can be seen in the decision by the Metropolitan Museum to
purchase an extraordinary krater by the master vase-painter Euphronius
depicting the dead body of the Homeric


<b></b>


hero, Sarpedon. The museum's desire for a vase by this painter was
so great that it paid a million dollars for it in 1972 and for years
highlighted its significance by displaying it alone in a darkened room.
<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>

<p>
Calas's attack on the camera represented his attempt to preserve the
uniqueness of the original from modernity's propensity towards endless
duplication and trivialization. But Calas could not escape modernity. On
the contrary, he recognized its inevitability. That he juxtaposed Kodak
film and the Parthenon in a work of high literature, something that
previously would have been seen as blasphemous, shows that the past and
the present are one. Despite the efforts by archaeologists to fence off
classical monuments from the city's inhabitants, these people arrived
in droves to observe, photograph, or pray. And quite often they came
on the tram. Such is gist of the poem significantly titled, "Tram and
Acropolis," by the surrealist poet, Nikos Engonopoulos (1910-1985):

<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
How sorrowful it would have been&#x02014;my God&#x02014;
<br />
How sorrowful,
<br />
If the hope of the marbles
<br />
Had not consoled my heart
<br />
And the expectation of a bright ray of light
<br />
That would give new life
<br />
To these magnificent ruins.
<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The joining together in Engonopoulos's poem of the tram and Parthenon,
of modernity with antiquity, shows the vitality of classical monuments
for modernist sensibilities. Furthermore, Engonopoulos did not see a
contradiction between surrealism and the classics. It is important to note
that the aim of modernism and archaeology was the modernization of Greek
society, as Artemis Leontis has demonstrated. Modern Greeks "claimed the
peninsula of Hellas with its classical sites to be their native workshop"
in order to fashion "an indigenous aesthetic." This project made antiquity
as well as archaeology vital "cornerstones of Neohellenism."
<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
The aim of both poets and archaeologists was to fashion a modernist
interpretation of antiquity. Ultimately they have created the modern
ruins of the Parthenon, free of all postclassical structures and debris
except for the seemingly perennial scaffolding, the permanent fences,
and the glare of the lights at night.
<p>
With the click-clack of cameras, the prattle of guides, and the crowds
pushing towards the exit, perhaps the committed traveler can no longer
have a romantic experience of ruins. Birds are no longer allowed to
nest along the pediments, and bats avoid the bright lights. But poets
are still attracted to antiquity and still discover their own angle.
<p>
It is with playful detachment that the contemporary American poet,
A. E. Stallings, sees the past in her poem "Consolation for Tamar&#x02014;on
the occasion of her breaking an ancient pot":

<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
You know I am no archaeologist, Tamar,
<br />
And that to me it is all one dust or another.
<br />
Still, it must mean something to survive the weather


<b></b>


<br />
Of the Ages&#x02014;earthquake, flood, and war&#x02014;
<br />
Only to shatter in your very hands.
<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Archaeology and tourism may have robbed ruins of their mysticism, but we
are still in awe of something that has survived thousands of years. And
we wonder still whether we should display the shards as they are or
reconstruct the pot.

One thinks here of Des Esseintes, the dandyish narrator of Huysmans's

(<i>Silent Urns: Romanticism, Hellenism, and Modernity</i>


<b></b>


[Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 2000]), who look
at Winckelmann's aestheticization of Greek art, often ignore this
aspect. Their line of thinking ends up rejecting Hellenism and Romanticism
as apolitical discourses. For a different perspective, see my "Greek
Romanticism: A Cosmopolitan Discourse," in <i>Romantic Poetry,</i>
ed. Angela Esterhammer (Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 2002).

With the exception of philhellenes like Byron, most of these travelers
had little interest in modern Greece, finding its inhabitants ignorant,
superstitious, and deceitful. See Helen Angelomatis-Tsougarakis, <i>The
Eve of the Greek Revival: British Travellers' Perceptions of Early
Nineteenth-Century Greece</i> (London: Routledge, 1990), 9. In their
paintings of Greece, artists depicted the glorious, legendary Hellas
rather than the drab reality of the present. See Fani-Maria Tsigakou,
<i>The Rediscovery of Greece: Travellers and Painters of the Romantic
Era</i> (London: Thames and Hudson, 1981), 28. They sought the rapture
of ruins.

Archaeology," in <i>Classics: A Discipline and Profession in Crisis,</i>
ed. Phyllis Culham and Lowell Edmunds (New York: University Press of
America, 1989), 215. Once a leader in the general field of archaeology,
Dyson concludes, Greek archaeology is ruled by tradition and fearful of
experimentation. Largely a positivistic discipline, it continues to turn
out "bulky catalogues" and "detailed excavation reports" (ibid.). Michael
Fotiadis argues that Greek archaeology was preoccupied until recently
with essentialist identities and conducted little interdisciplinary
work. "Modernity and Past-Still-Present: Politics of Time in the
Birth of Regional Archaeological Projects in Greece," <i>American
Journal of Archaeology</i> 99, no. 1 : 59-78. See also Dyson,
