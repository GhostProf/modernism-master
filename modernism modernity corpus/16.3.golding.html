<p><span style="font-style:italic;">To what extent does innovative literature require/demand innovative teaching methods?</span></p>
<p>
      Teaching modernist writing that continues to challenge, and new forms of contemporary writing, how might we theorize the felt imperative to “make it new” pedagogically? Does innovative literature require or demand innovative teaching methods? At least one recent book argues persuasively that it does. Joan Retallack and Juliana Spahr rest their essay collection <span style="font-style:italic;">Poetry and Pedagogy: The Challenge of the Contemporary</span> on the premise that “contemporary literary pedagogy is chronically behind contemporary literature by about half a century,” that innovative contemporary writing renders “the familiar battery of code-breaking techniques . . . inappropriate.”<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a> In one essay, Lynn Keller ponders the practical implications of the now-familiar ideas of “reader collaboration” or “active reading.” In what she calls the <span style="font-style:italic;">centripetal</span> classroom, “discussion” involves sharing the kind of privatized reading experience proposed by Edward Hirsch in his overtly pedagogical text <span style="font-style:italic;">How to Read a Poem</span>. With Retallack’s sequence “Icarus FFFFFalling” as her central example, Keller goes on to argue that “the new experimental poetries invite a very different model of reading, one that fosters contrasting classroom dynamics and processes” and that results in what she terms the <span style="font-style:italic;">centrifugal</span> classroom.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a> The centrifugal classroom involves “a collective rather than a privatized reading process,” “collaborative reading”; “interpretive authority is dispersed; it is located in no individual and held precariously by the group”; and one finds “the class being drawn toward the world outside the poem and how language works there.”<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Nor need this methodological shift be limited to the treatment of experimental contemporary work.  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> Jena Osman describes how “in conjunction with their reading of Eliot, I ask students to write a poem where each line is taken from a different textual source they find in their homes. They are instructed to think about why they are ordering the pieces the way they do, and to annotate the poem with footnotes. This assignment makes Eliot’s seemingly impenetrable text [<span style="font-style:italic;">The Waste Land</span>] more accessible, in that it shifts the focus of inquiry from ‘what does it mean’ to ‘how was it made’”: a shift from interpretation of a product to participation in a constructive process putatively similar to Eliot’s.<a name="f4-text" href="#f4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>
      Essays like these provide compelling <span style="font-style:italic;">initial</span> answers to my opening questions, which seem straightforward enough until we apply a little terminological pressure to the relationships among the new, the contemporary and the innovative. (Both “innovative” and “new” may be used as literary historical categories and values; only “new” and “contemporary” can also serve as neutrally descriptive chronological terms.) In my own primary teaching field, Anglophone poetry and poetics in the long twentieth century, the point can be made simply by noticing the uses of the term “new” in the titles of the two main players in the notorious anthology wars, Donald Allen’s <span style="font-style:italic;">The New American Poetry 1945–1960</span>  and Donald Hall, Robert Pack and Louis Simpson’s <span style="font-style:italic;">New Poets of England and America</span> . Hall, Pack and Simpson introduce new poets writing in familiar mid-century modes shaped by the genteel cultural conservatism implicit in Eliotic modernism while bypassing Eliot’s formal radicalism. Allen, in contrast, foregrounds a new <span style="font-style:italic;">kind</span> of poetry (also written by “new” poets) whose innovations have influenced U.S. American (and other) poetic practice ever since.
    </p>
<p>
      At the risk of stating the obvious, then, “new” is a historically specific and contingent category, and especially for teachers of modernism, terms like “new” and “innovative” have a problematic doubleness about them. In the early-mid 1950s, Frank O’Hara’s work was both chronologically and formally new. For practiced and informed readers in 2009 it is neither, though we may continue to love that work and appreciate its innovations in historical context. For many of our students, meanwhile, any poetry beyond what they were force-fed in high school is new. Poetry as a <span style="font-style:italic;">discourse</span> is “new” for them, and even work that is not innovative in a literary historical sense or is no longer innovative to the teacher will often produce the effect of newness in neophyte readers: disorientation, bafflement, a sense of readerly inadequacy.
    </p>
<p>
      So how to help students experience and think about modes of poetic newness, past and present, in ways that go beyond the dominant modes of analysis and what my fellow panelist Marsha Bryant calls “the traditional focus on originality?” The assignment that I’ll describe here is an exercise in imitation that I’ve used at all levels, from lower-division undergraduate classes to graduate seminars: write an imitation of a Frank O’Hara “I do this I do that” poem (a perfect model is “The Day Lady Died” or “Personal Poem”) and then reflect on the process of writing it. In the reflection I ask students to address such questions as “What did you find hard or easy about this assignment? What did you learn? What surprised you? What do you think you did well / less well?” I am fairly unconcerned with (as in, I do not grade) the competence of the imitation. The important parts are the reflection on process and the insights produced in coming up with the poem, not the poem itself. At the same time, for most students  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> the writing that they produce is literally “experimental”: it’s something they’ve never tried before, and they don’t know how it’s going to turn out. The assignment can work with any distinctive style: Williams, Stein, the Lyn Hejinian of <span style="font-style:italic;">My Life</span>, the Harryette Mullen of <span style="font-style:italic;">Trimmings</span> (though when I encouraged two expert imitators of Hejinian and Mullen to submit their work to their creative writing teacher some years ago, he turned it back as “not poetry”).
    </p>
<p>
      I think of this assignment in the spirit of what Charles Bernstein calls “creative wreading,” a range of “interactive and creative responses to assigned readings, including imitations” designed to facilitate “accessing the poetic strata of a work, that is, those elements that make a piece of writing a poem” “as a ground for subsequent critical interpretation: after all, you can’t interpret what you don’t experience.”<a name="f5-text" href="#f5"><sup>5</sup></a> At the same time, my goals are modest and even traditional. One is to introduce a different kind of writing into the literature classroom, a writing and reading that yields different insights from those produced within the customary boundaries of disciplinary training. A second is to have students understand, or at least think about, the dynamics and construction of a style from the inside (an author-centered approach with which I realize theoretical disagreements are possible). A third is to have students engage in the process of relating theory—or reflection on poetics—to practice. Attempting an O’Hara imitation produces an experientially based understanding that casual everydayness in poetry can be a challenging effect to pull off, and typically leads to student reflection on the pace, rhythm, content, and contradictions of their own days. A fourth goal is to have students inhabit, try on or produce forms of newness. From one point of view, I could be accused of proposing the hoariest and most conservative of exercises, that of imitating a “master.” It makes a difference, then, that the work being imitated is work written against mastery (even if it is subsequently canonized), thoroughly anti-didactic in spirit, and that success in the imitation be considered beside the point.
    </p>
<p>
      As I have suggested, the exercise commonly produces for students both insight into the work being imitated and, perhaps equally valuably, a fresh perspective on their own lives. As one student puts it, “What seemed like the most significant experience in writing the poem was that in the process of writing the events took on new meaning.” The writers comment on their efforts to “capture the spirit of playfulness in O’Hara” and “the communal aspect of my experience,” “to keep a constant flow with casual diction and blatant disregard for punctuation” and avoid “getting too preachy” with politically charged subject matter. They can show a fine ability to internalize O’Hara’s camp humor. One student detournes the end of a canonical text, “The Day Lady Died,” by invoking simultaneously her own favorite music and O’Hara’s poetics of sociability, writing “I put on some Mudhoney and open the book. / I reread some of the Frank O’Hara poems. / I don’t think we’d get along if I ever met him so I’m not sad he’s dead.” While plenty of students find the task initially daunting, this summary response is more typical: “As for the experience of writing the poem, I got a kick out of it. I tend to over-think composition so a sketchy breezy poem was a breath of fresh air. I’d do it again, I tell you.”  <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p>
      As seasoned and influential a poet-teacher as Bernadette Mayer has written, in a somewhat dyspeptic moment, that “it’s easy to rely on the Beat Poets when you’re teaching, any more abstract stuff often turns the students off, they find Frank O’Hara much too difficult.”<a name="f6-text" href="#f6"><sup>6</sup></a> Finding a pedagogy adequate to the writing at hand constitutes one of the most compelling rationales possible for pedagogical innovation. As a supplement—not a counter—to the claim that new writing demands new forms of teaching, one of my central assumptions is that a traditional teaching technique can open up innovative work. To put it another way, not all innovative work requires innovative teaching or rethinking of the classroom, though some does. Pedagogy is not self-renewing in the way that innovative literature is: it’s not a sequence of mini-revolutions, of ruptures, of avant-garde moments. Approached from the inside, using an ancient pedagogical technique that will nevertheless strike many students as “new,” apparently Frank O’Hara—as one of many possible examples—isn’t “much too difficult” after all.
