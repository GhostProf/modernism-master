<p id="lead">"On the German Republic" is the title of a lecture that Thomas Mann delivered in Berlin on 13 October, 1922. It was a moment of high political tensions, as his daughter Erika later recalled when writing her memoirs in 1956: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Waves of insurrection and terror were sweeping the country. Democratic politicians had been shamefully assassinated, including the best among them, Walter Rathenau, whom Thomas Mann knew well. The German middle classes, unwilling to acknowledge the lost war's consequences as such, held the young Republic responsible for all the hardships. Thomas Mann's great essay, "On the German Republic" , was his political recognition of the Republic in its hour of need and his most inopportune "step" since the <i>Reflections</i>. At this critical juncture its effect was startling, as if the author had thrown an incendiary bomb into his own house.<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p>Erika, all too plainly, was rehearsing a quasi-mythical account that circulated within the family circle, albeit one often affirmed by later critics. Theo Stammen has called the lecture/essay "a crucial text in the corpus of Thomas Mann's political writings," while Terrence Reed has urged that it signaled "a startling change" in his political outlook: "If his wartime stand had come as a shock to those who thought him a liberal intellectual, his new position was an equal shock to those who had come to rely on him as a conservative nationalist."<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Conservative readers, Hinrich Siefkin reiterates, "felt betrayed when the attitude he had taken and expressed seemed to change . . . in 'On the German Republic.'"<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  But it was not just his political outlook that had changed; the arguments 

<b></b>

 that Mann adopted to support this reversal were also striking, unusual, perhaps even startling. Within the essay Mann, according to Michael Maar, was justifying "this reversal, among other ways, by the fact that Walt Whitman in his phallically brimming fervour was the singer of democracy, and that democracy and male love stem from the same roots."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  Or to put it slightly differently, the essay was as close as Mann ever came to acknowledging in public his own divided homoerotic impulses, acknowledgement that tied his recognition of the Weimar Republic to an ecstatic reading of Walt Whitman. The result was a work that is dazzling, complex, and perennially surprising, yet one whose importance has largely escaped Anglophone readers chiefly because it was Mann himself who insisted, in 1942 when the essay was translated into English, that its most explicit and extended passage concerning male love be suppressed.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  As he explained to his patron and devoted friend Agnes Meyer: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>Thank you for reminding me about the decidedly desirable omission of those pages from "On the German Republic." I had almost forgotten my resolution. It's clear that an American readership, for very praiseworthy reasons, wouldn't know what to make of it. It's not scandal one has to worry about, but confusion. It is self-evident that the pages will have to go.</p>
<p>Homoeroticism is a human phenomenon as old as the hills and in antiquity it actually played a role in shaping culture and the state. To want it to have such a role today (as was attempted in Germany, in a literary way: Hans Blüher) would be bad romanticism. In my essay on Platen I said that I consider it unproductive and aesthetically death-bound, and that also comes through in <i>The Magic Mountain</i>. From an artistic standpoint, this subject can only be treated in a style that is grotesque, as Proust did.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Mann's decision, however debatable, was duly executed by his translator, Helen Tracy Lowe-Porter, with the result that Mann's great essay has been available to English-speaking readers only in a truncated, or even mutilated, form. Worse still, although the "omission of those pages" has recently been rectified through an excellent translation of them by David Fernbach, even that restoration still leaves a sadly incomplete and unsatisfactory version in English.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  For as English-language scholars of Mann have ruefully come to recognize in recent years: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>. . . essentially two Thomas Manns continue to circulate in the English-speaking world: the German originals read by academics and some students of German, and the Lowe-Porter "adaptations into English" . . . which, unbeknown to the English-speaking world, constitute a different, a pseudo-Mann. It is a deplorable situation, for which no remedy is in sight.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">That formulation, articulated by Timothy Buck, may sound extreme, but it will seem only reasonable to someone who has compared the Lowe-Porter translation of "On the German Republic" with Mann's original German. For reasons that cannot now be reconstructed, Lowe-Porter chose to drop batches of sentences that in total comprise nearly two hundred words of Mann's original text. More capriciously, quotations by Goethe and Walt Whitman are unilaterally altered.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  In short, what has rightly been 

<b></b>

 understood as a critical turning-point in Mann's development has been accessible to English-speaking readers only in a version that does not meet ordinary standards of accuracy and reliability, obscuring the import of a document that reverberates with implications for those perennial debates about modernism and politics, or the relationship between the aesthetic and the social, the private and public spheres. </p>

<p>Mann delivered his lecture at a site that was almost as improbable as some of his lengthiest sentences: the Beethoven Auditorium (Beethovensaal) of the Philharmonic complex, with its entrance on Köthenerstraße, 32, in central Berlin (see front cover). Opened in 1899, it had been intended as a venue for chamber concerts and other smaller events sponsored by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, a function it was still fulfilling in 1922. It had been designed by Ludwig Heim (1844–?), a highly successful architect responsible for several distinguished hotels and banks in Berlin, of which the most notable survivor is the Dresdener Bank building (1887–1889) on Behrenstraße, 36–39 (the east-west street is found just south of Unter den Linden and was the heart of the city's banking district). Its exterior was a readily recognizable version of late Italian Renaissance, while the interior marshaled classical motifs within a more eclectic and Wilhelmine mixture that included Gothic arches. The room had a maximum seating capacity of 1,066, and its lofty ceiling (12.8m, or nearly 42 feet high) culminated in a central fresco panel, painted by the otherwise unknown Vital Schmitt and depicting the Apotheosis of Beethoven: angels and other onlookers (are they perhaps muses?) watch, with expressions of admiration and surprise, as the composer spirals up and away into the empyrean.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  (The fresco has long since disappeared, along with the entire building complex, destroyed by Allied bombing, which fell from midnight to 6:00 a.m on 29 January, 1944 [see back cover]).<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  </p>

<p>We know very little about the event that was Mann's lecture. No notices or advertisements for it have been found in contemporary newspapers, leaving it unclear whether it took place in the afternoon or evening, or whether there was an admission fee. Subsequent press reports uniformly avoid remarking on either the size or composition of the audience, though Mann himself repeatedly makes direct addresses to "German youth" and "students," and sometimes further reference to "citizens." That raises an additional conundrum, for we cannot be certain how many of the students were also veterans, especially those former officers of lower ranks who often participated in the right-wing paramilitary groups that so threatened the Republic. Homoerotic bonds were a significant component of some groups, not least in parts of the SA (Sturmabteilung), the paramilitary wing of the Nazi party, formed in late summer of 1921 shortly after the party had accepted Hitler as its leader, together with the "leadership principle" (Führerprinzip), and effectively headed by Ernst Röhm, a homosexual. But the Nazi party, at that point, contained scarcely 2,000 members, and although these were concentrated in Munich, where Mann himself resided, and although he had expressed distaste for the party already in 1921, it is very unlikely that he knew much about its detailed workings.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  It is more likely, in other words, that his remarks responded to more diffuse (and, by their nature, undocumented) rumors about various <i>Freikorps</i> and monarchist associations. 

<b></b>

 </p>

<p>The question of the intended audience and its constitution is important for its bearing on another issue: the nature, genre, or kind of the work. Are we to read the text of "On the German Republic" as the transcription of a talk or lecture? Or should we instead view it as something more formal, a polished and intricate essay that just happened to be read aloud before it achieved its proper embodiment in print? Are we to assess it as hortatory rhetoric, intent on argument and persuasion? Or was it something more literary or even fictional in nature, something intent on play and speculation, and scarcely concerned with the pragmatic outcomes typically at stake in acts of persuasion? We make—and indeed <i>must</i> make—such distinctions in everyday life. But "On the German Republic" both invokes and dissolves them. One strand of the text insists on its rhetorical, persuasive ambitions: "Let me say it openly: to the extent it's needed, my aim is to win you over to the side of the republic, of what is termed democracy, and what I term humanity" (113.42–114.1). Or again: "In my attempt to convince you . . . " (bei meinem Überredungsversuch) (130.36). Another is openly, even self-consciously fictive. It directly addresses the German dramatist Gerhart Hauptmann, even placing him in the front row of the auditorium—though he was not present at the lecture at all, except in Mann's imagination. It repeatedly pauses to comment on the reactions of the audience, even offering retorts to those reactions; but the audience's reactions were and are entirely fictional creations by Mann. It was precisely this uneasy conflation or confusion of genres and modes that more than one critic found disconcerting: </p>



<blockquote class="disp-quote-extract">
<p>I had been invited to a lecture [Vortrag], which is an oral, personal, and direct utterance that flows from one person to another, who is affected by it. Thomas Mann, instead, read an essay [Aufsatz] that has already been set up in print, if not yet published. In comparison with what one expected, the experience—however good the essay may well be—was a dry and mediated affair of galley-proofs rather than of something flowing to its auditors. Still worse, as was the case here, when the essay infelicitously plays with the form of a lecture, refers to fictive circumstances and answers imaginary audience reactions that were never to be seen or heard among the audience actually in attendance. "My angry friends!" When nobody has expressed anger. "I hear booing." When not even a cat has stirred. "There is a hush in the auditorium, for which I am partly responsible." When nothing in the auditorium has changed.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>	<!--CLOSE disp-quote-extract-->




<p class="continued">Yet another commented on the bewilderment of "anyone who tried to follow this lecture without being confused, or rather something that was more essay than lecture, one that will soon be in print."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  </p>

<p>"On the German Republic" breaks with the proprieties that normally distinguish the lecture and essay, invoking and yet dissolving both within an antic swirl of quotations, citations that often diverge into extensive digressions that are then threaded back into yet another swirl of quotations. In total there are more than seventy-five of them from Gerhart Hauptmann, Stefan George, Goethe, Nietzsche, Flaubert, Wagner, Novalis, Whitman, the Austrian writer Adalbert Stifter, the Russian critic Merezhkovsky, the German poet August von Platen, and even the Holy Roman Emperor Lothar I (795–855). Characters from plays by Shakespeare and Schiller jostle alongside ancient heroes like Harmodios and Aristogiton, all surrounded by contemporary popular expressions and 

<b></b>

 proverbs. A genuine playfulness surges through the entire text, surfacing, for example, in the speaker's unconcealed pleasure over the effect that he imagines his words having on his audience: "Republic—how do you like that word coming, as it does, from my lips? Not very much, to judge by certain sounds . . . " (113.9–10). This discernible pleasure in the play of ideas and language is real, unmistakable, almost palpable, and it infuses the essay with an element that borders on the voluptuous—which, after all, is one of the essay's central and recurrent themes: the sensual pleasures of the body, pleasures that range from homoerotic ones to others such as song or even the joys of speech and conversation. Language, or at least speech, is produced by the body, after all, and it is a literal body politic that now becomes the foundation for a notion of democracy differing from one grounded solely in rationalist or Enlightenment principles, one now wholly compatible with the romantic tradition deemed crucial to German national identity. As a consequence, Mann can also reconcile the divide between culture and the state, between aesthetic creation and politics, that had been such a prominent legacy of nineteenth-century German thought precisely because until 1871 there had been no German state in which they could be reconciled, while after 1871 the state's authoritarian cast had still led thinkers such as Nietzsche and others to reassert that strict divide between art and politics, the aesthetic and the social.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  Through quotation, Mann now restages the creation of an imaginary community of writers actively, and as it were bodily, engaged with the public sphere. </p>

<p>Neither lecture or essay, or rather an uneasy mixture of both, Mann's work may also owe something to another genre in which elements of performance were intermixed with stylized announcement of a position about some matter of urgency. Certainly Mann himself invoked a third genre when he wrote a letter to his friend Ernst Bertram on 8 July, 1922, just when he was beginning to write "On the German Republic." "I am in pain over the distorted state of Germany's features. I am thinking about shaping a birthday article on Hauptmann into a sort of manifesto, in which I will appeal to the conscience of young people, or those young people who listen to me. I am not renouncing the <i>Reflections</i> and I'm the last person to ask young people to be enthusiastic about things that are beyond them, such as socialism and democracy. But the mechanical adoption of reactionary positions I have already dismissed as sentimental crudity, and a new humanity can thrive on the soil of democracy no less than on the soil of the old Germany."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>  </p>

<p>Mann completed "On the German Republic" by the end of August and sent off the manuscript on 1 September. On 6 October he read it aloud to a small circle of friends, a group that also included his brother Heinrich. That inclusion was telling: it was only since the beginning of 1922 that the two brothers had begun to speak to one another again, drawing an end to nearly eight years of silence that had begun with the breakout of the First World War in 1914. Heinrich had strongly opposed the war, and it was in great measure as a result of his quarrel with Heinrich that Thomas Mann had gone on to write the <i>Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man</i>, his long apologia for the war that finally appeared in 1918. When, two weeks after the private reading, Mann read his lecture/essay/manifesto aloud to the audience gathered at the Beethovensaal in Berlin, 

<b></b>

 Heinrich was again in the audience. Indeed, he is the only member of the audience whose identity is firmly established. </p>

<p>Perhaps it does not really matter which genre we assign to "On the German Republic." It offers pleasures, both in content and form, that are genuine enough, and its complex affirmation of the Weimar Republic was indeed a brave and prescient step. Its guarded affirmation of male love also bespoke a level of tolerance that was unusual for its time and still valuable today. Whatever genre we ascribe to "On the German Republic," it remains a compelling political and literary testimony from one of the golden moments of modernism, a moment also fraught with tension and anxiety. After all, ten months before Mann delivered his lecture, <i>Ulysses</i> had just been published, while "The Waste Land" would make its first appearance in periodical form only three days later. Two weeks after that, the March on Rome would bring Benito Mussolini to power, giving apparent legitimacy to a political movement unknown before the outbreak of the First World War. For Mann, the moment was indeed a turning point, and he never looked back. When he next appeared at the Beethovensaal in Berlin in 1930, it was to deliver his famous "Appeal to Reason," an impassioned warning to voters of the dangers contained in the growing forces of the far right. Three years later, Mann would feel the force of that warning on his own pulses: he was in exile in Switzerland, never to return to live in Germany. </p>

<p>The translations that follow present three works by Mann, "On the German Republic" and two others closely related to it. The first of the others is "Hans Reisiger's Edition of Walt Whitman: A Letter" ("Hans Reisigers Whitman-Werk: ein Brief"), an open letter in which Mann celebrates the ethical and literary power of Walt Whitman, as experienced in a two-volume translation into German by Hans Reisiger. The letter appeared in April, 1922, some six months before Mann gave his public reading of "On the German Republic." The other is "Foreword [to 'On the German Republic']," a polemical defense that was published on Christmas eve of 1922, or some seven weeks after "On the German Republic" first appeared in print. </p>

<div class="fn">
<p><a name="FOOT9" href="#REF9">9</a>. The following is a brief catalogue of unwarranted omissions and alterations by Lowe-Porter in her translation of "On the German Republic" (see note 5):  on page six, up four lines from the bottom, between the words "within himself!" and "He stood . . . " there are two sentences (twenty-five words) in the original that are simply dropped;  on page nine, ten lines up from the bottom, immediately following the word "comradeship," there are three sentences (ninety-three words) and then a quotation of seven lines (another fifty words) from a poem that are omitted.  On page twenty-five, down eleven lines from the top, the paragraph ending with "whoever does is a republican": in the original German the paragraph continues for another fourteen words, all omitted.  On page forty-one, down three lines from the top, the words from "If the manager" to "are safe" make up a sentence within a quotation from Goethe, one that Mann deliberately omitted when he quoted the entire passage, signalling his omission with an ellipsis. Lowe-Porter restores the omitted sentence.  On the same page, up ten lines from the bottom, following the word "researches," Lowe-Porter omits another six words which all list the fields of study that Wilhelm Meister explores.  Again on the same page, the passage assigned to Walt Whitman that runs from eight to five lines up from the bottom, is one found nowhere in his oeuvre; it represents Lowe-Porter's adaptation of another passage that is indeed by Whitman, an adaptation presumably invented to meet the syntactic exigencies of her translation. One could also quarrel with Lowe-Porter's rendering at a very basic level of accuracy. Mann, at one point, quite correctly quotes a passage from Novalis that condemns <i>Philister</i>, or Philistines. But Lowe-Porter, one page ten, fifteen lines down from the top, turns the Philistines into "philosophers"! </p>
