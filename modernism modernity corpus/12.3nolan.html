University and academic presses are turning out a huge volume of meta-critical material these days. Most of these companions, anthologies, or guides to criticism are aimed at undergraduate as well as more specialist readers, and it could be argued that their focus on single, well-established periods or authors does not generally demand much innovative research or writing from those that produce them. Inevitably, the vast amount of criticism devoted to the works of James Joyce (only Shakespeare has inspired more essays and books) has become a prime target for such treatment. Joyce is unquestionably canonical as well as formidably obscure, and was at the forefront of debates about "theory" in Britain and France; historicist approaches to his work, focusing on topics such as censorship, popular culture, and colonialism have proliferated more recently. However, Joseph Brooker's <i>Joyce's Critics: Transitions in Reading and Culture</i>, a handsome volume in a new series on Irish Studies and Culture from the University of Wisconsin Press, demonstrates that work which modestly proposes to survey earlier criticism can on occasion be more insightful and useful than many a supposedly original monograph. Brooker's is not the first full-length account of Joyce criticism (Geert Lernout has already written on <i>The French Joyce</i>, and 

<b></b>

Joseph Kelly's <i>Our Joyce: From Outcast to Icon</i> is concerned with the American Joyce industry), but it is the most comprehensive and judicious. In particular, it will be genuinely indispensable for any graduate student who is contemplating working on Joyce (or modernism in general).
</p>

<p>
Jean-Michel Rabat&#x000E9; is already a distinguished Joycean, and a pioneer of the so-called "genetic" reading of Joyce, which is based as much on the author's "avant-textes" (notebooks, drafts, and proofs) as on the printed versions of the books. He has an alternative take on the current near-saturation of the market for introductions to Joyce in this edited volume, <i>Palgrave Advances in James Joyce Studies</i>. Avoiding essays devoted to individual works or to the more familiar themes of Joyce criticism, Rabat&#x000E9; asserts that his contributors will stress "the organic and quasi-systematic nature of a work grasped as globally as possible. Joyce's works and life obey an organic logic, and  . . .  this logic opens up on a general problematic hinged around the discovery of a new type of writing" . While what could fairly be described as Rabat&#x000E9;'s Derridean emphasis is apparent here, the essayists in fact take rather divergent approaches to questions of gender, genre, science, politics, and geography (among others) in the collection. Some do summarize the state of research in a given area, but most offer complex new arguments as well. Many offer a view of Joyce that is postmodernist in a recognizably American style (ten of the twelve writers are based in North American universities). This is somewhat at odds with the much more explicitly political recent work on Joyce in Britain and Ireland that Brooker addresses in the final chapter of his study.
</p>

<p>
Brooker begins <i>Joyce's Critics</i> by stating that the "excessive" quantity of writing on Joyce has become one of "the definitive facts about the writer" . It is therefore a considerable achievement for Brooker to have found a meta-narrative, largely based on how "the reading of Joyce has invoked and involved place and nation" , which enables him to engage in a detailed analysis of such key res as T. S. Eliot, Harry Levine, and Richard Ellmann without losing the forward momentum of a coherent and compelling argument. While he occasionally indulges in a little irony at the expense of the critics he writes about, he is invariably closely engaged with the evolving opinions and the long careers of some of these commentators (in this regard, Rabat&#x000E9;'s rather Olympian essay on "Classics of Joyce Criticism" in his own volume suffers by comparison). Brooker recounts the (relatively familiar) story of how Ezra Pound attempted to "internationalize" Joyce while T. S. Eliot strove to assimilate him to a classicist aesthetic, but he also devotes attention to less well-known responses to Joyce by H. G. Wells and Wyndham Lewis. In many cases, hostile treatments of <i>Portrait of the Artist</i> and <i>Ulysses</i> disclose much that Pound and Eliot sought to repress, but which would return in later criticism&#x02014;including the questions of historical particularity, national identity, and of what Brooker describes as the somatic and kinetic effects of <i>Ulysses</i> on the unsuspecting novice reader. And certainly one misses in contemporary criticism the sense that negative assessments of Joyce might even be contemplated; as Derek Attridge puts it, almost all work on this author now presupposes a prior approval, based on "the unquestioned assumption that Joyce's writing is to be enjoyed, admired, and learned from rather than weighed in evaluative scales and pronounced good, bad or a mixture of the two" (quoted in Brooker, 172).
</p>

<p>
Brooker informs us that his book was written in London. While he appears to be as comfortable discussing (say) the Parisian Eugene Jolas as the American critic Margot Norris, Brooker's own location has nevertheless clearly had an influence on the shape of his argument. We might expect to find here a long account of the quarrel between the two most important American Joyceans, Richard Ellmann, author of the 1959 biography, and the Poundian Hugh Kenner, but the prominence of critics from Cambridge, England in his story is possibly more surprising. Brooker gives an extended explanation of F. R. Leavis's rejection of Joyce in favor of D. H. Lawrence as the "great creative genius of our age" (quoted in Brooker, 82), and outlines in some detail the later Cambridge careers of such res as Stephen Heath, Colin MacCabe, and Derek Attridge, for whom the name of Joyce helped to lend status to post-structuralist theory . One of the strengths of Brooker's volume is his serious attention to the Irish reception of Joyce in independent Ireland, offering nuanced considerations of the topics of class, sectarian affiliation and "cosmopolitanism" in writers including W. B.Yeats, John Eglinton and Patrick Kavanagh, as well as in the work of contemporary cultural critics such as Seamus Deane and Declan Kiberd. He also makes some acute observations about the exploitation of Joyce by the heritage 

<b></b>

and tourist industries in present-day Dublin. Nevertheless, the fact that Brooker concludes the book with an account of the work of his own London-based colleagues does rather tend to give the impression that he thinks that the writings of his own friends represent the culmination of Joyce criticism so far. But any arrangement of such a large amount of diverse material is bound to result in distortions of one kind or another. One misses, for example, the possibility of tracing the history of Marxist interpretations of Joyce, which is not facilitated by the trajectory Brooker traces from Paris to the United States and back again to Britain and Ireland. There is not enough acknowledgment of significant readings of Joyce by critics who are not themselves "Joyceans," such as Fredric Jameson or Franco Moretti, or of responses to Joyce from beyond the Anglophone world. Brooker perhaps underestimates the effect of partition and the Northern Irish conflict on perceptions of Joyce in Ireland, although he does usefully point out that the question of religion (specifically Catholicism) is the only major theme in Joyce that has been relatively neglected in contemporary criticism.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, the Irish or "postcolonial" turn in Joyce studies is generally passed over by the contributors to <i>Palgrave Advances in James Joyce Studies</i>. In an essay entitled "Joyce's politics: race, nation and transnationalism," Joseph Valente argues for the necessity of going beyond what he characterizes as recent attempts to connect Joyce to "the romantic nationalist tradition of asserting the properly organic relationship between the ethnicity of a people and their language, culture and/or political framework"; this project can now be superceded by a more general "re-evaluation of his geopolitical vision" . In a similar way, Margot Norris states in her essay, "Joyce, history and the philosophy of history," that "Irish history is the nightmare from which Joyce scholars have awoken, but only to find themselves facing the even more loaded issue of Joyce's philosophy of history" . Valente denies that Joyce belonged to an "unequivocally colonial society" (whatever that might be), and contends that his fiction presents Dublin as a "metro-colonial space" , in which all "the dialogized voices of Irish culture" can be heard . The piece makes good use of Joyce's non-fictional early writing, and ends with a fascinating re-reading of the end of the story "The Dead" from <i>Dubliners</i>, arguing that Gabriel Conroy's final vision invokes "the universalizing rhetoric of Christendom"  rather than the imagery of the Irish nation. By way of conclusion, Valente comments on the "exquisite difficulty of Joyce's aesthetic project" in its heroic attempt to
</p>

transcend the ideological limits of so-called national culture or art, unfolding the hybrid and contradictory elements of Irish life in every more capacious designs, but to contrive against losing the local, and yes, the national particularity of those elements in elevating them to the dignity of the universal.

Such a formulation might lead us to question whether Joyce is really so much at odds with the many other twentieth-century postcolonial theorists and writers to whom he has latterly been compared, in grappling with the ironies of nationalism, modernization, and decolonization. And while Norris's essay is a superb account of the "revisionary, dispersed, non-progressive, non-teleological, cyclical, and deconstructed"  theories of history to which Joyce was attracted (including those associated with Vico, Quinet and Nietzsche), she does not consider whether Ireland's colonial experience might have influenced his preferences in this regard.
</p>

<p>
Ronald Bush's essay on "Joyce's Modernisms" argues that living in a country where industrial modernization had not yet taken hold, "Joyce felt the strong need of both the discourses of scientific and post-scientific modernity" . Bush offers a subtle and intricate account of Joyce's philosophy of modernity, mediated through such key res as Ibsen and Flaubert. But in case we are in danger of regarding Joyce as altogether too clever, Sam Slote, in his contribution on "Joyce and science," describes some of the things that Joyce knew about (like how a television works) and some that he did not understand (Einsteinian relativity). Several of the contributors to this volume, including Slote, pay a good deal of attention to <i>Finnegans Wake</i>. This material is likely to be of interest only to the most "advanced" students of Joyce. Nevertheless, Michael Groden provides a lucid and necessary introduction to the somewhat arcane controversies of textual scholarship in relation both to <i>Ulysses</i> and the <i>Wake</i> in his "Genetic Joyce: textual 

<b></b>

studies and the reader." As Rabat&#x000E9; comments, the debate that followed Hans Walter Gabler's 1984 revised edition of <i>Ulysses</i> in effect forced all Joyce scholars to take a position on editorial issues . But Laurent Milesi's essay on "Joyce, language and languages" is definitely one for specialists rather than a general readership; as Brooker implies, Attridge's <i>Peculiar Language</i>  remains the most accessible attempt to vindicate the claims of <i>Wake</i> scholars that the text represents "not an aberration of the literary but an unusually thoroughgoing <i>exemplification</i> of the literary" (quoted in Brooker, 171).

Garry Leonard and Vicki Mahaffey, on the other hand, tackle two of the most fashionable topics in contemporary Joyce studies&#x02014;popular culture and gender, respectively. Neither of these contributors offers any overview of their fields. Instead, they both argue that Joyce shows us how ordinary people manage their everyday lives in modern conditions, mainly through constant consumption, and occasionally by attempting to escape from the constrictions of their environments through sexual and other fantasies. Leonard and Mahaffey link the realms of commodity culture and private fantasy to the infinite (but lost) possibilities of history that Stephen dwells on in the "Nestor" episode of <i>Ulysses</i>. Leonard asserts that
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
For Joyce, the momentary is momentous; the "everyday" is not where we make history, but where we live despite it, and "low" art chronicles this disorder. If we seek the full splendor of Joyce's accomplishment, examples of "low" art are what we must read and read doubly, instead of our Roman history.

<p class="noIndent">
The imperial narratives of official history occlude the experience of lived history. However, according to Leonard, those that are banished from history are condemned instead to the inadequate satisfactions of the marketplace. He does not seek to celebrate what he describes as the "embarrassed" consumerism  of Dubliners such as Maria in "Clay," but yet for Leonard there is no real <i>critique</i> of capitalist society in Joyce, nor any basis for an analysis of its historical origins or its future tendencies. Despite what would appear to be Leonard's radically democratic perspective, he regards Dublin's citizens as effectively imprisoned by the dominant economic and political system. He does not consider the view, for example, that elements of a truly <i>popular</i> culture (one with its roots in the history of the people) might survive even into an era of <i>mass</i> culture.
</p>

<p>
Mahaffey also appears to uncover a zone in which the existing order of things might be challenged. She carefully traces how the "vague and hackneyed dreams marketed by popular culture" in <i>Dubliners</i> give way to the "idiosyncratic, artificial, impossible"  fantasies of the three key protagonists in <i>Ulysses</i>. But she makes it clear that she is outlining only a "psychological, artistic response to the social divisions of gender, class and age, not a political one" , as real politics is governed by the tyranny of material possibility. At one level, this appears to be a valuable insight into the imaginative capacity of at least Joyce's main characters to understand the limitations of their social worlds. However, it is reductive to limit dreams of transcendence to a mere protest against "the insufficiency of choices available to individuals" . It may be that&#x02014;contrary to Mahaffey's suggestion&#x02014;contemporary capitalism can quite easily accommodate an individual's fantasies about transgressing the "bounds of gender, age, religion, or nationality" . But this does not mean that these are the most urgent desires of the citizens of Dublin in <i>Ulysses</i>&#x02014;or indeed of most of the less privileged inhabitants of the world today.

Virginia Woolf, rather than James Joyce, is the key modernist writer in Lois Cucullu's <i>Expert Modernists, Matricide, and Modern Culture</i>. Cucullu devotes two chapters of her book to Woolf's revision of the re of the domestic woman in her novels, and one chapter each to E. M. Forster and Joyce (although one might have expected D. H. Lawrence to re more prominently in her study). This book began life as a doctoral dissertation, and could have been more extensively revised. The dense critical style is at times bewildering; most of the footnotes consist of quite lengthy paragraphs, many citing several critical sources at once. Nor is the reader helped by the preference of the publisher, Palgrave Macmillan, for cramming as many words as possible onto every page. This is a pity, because the author does have a bold and original argument to advance. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
Cucullu attempts to take up where Nancy Armstrong's seminal <i>Desire and Domestic Fiction</i>  left off, with an analysis of how the sexual politics of English fiction evolved in the early twentieth century. Whereas Armstrong described the domestic woman as wielding considerable power over her husband and children in the private sphere, Cucullu suggests that in modernism we witness the demise of this authoritative maternal re. But modernism was not simply about a reassertion of patriarchal privilege (although the author appears to be unsure about whether or not it was fundamentally a positive development). Cucullu argues that women modernists such as Woolf achieved new forms of authority for themselves in the wake of this symbolic matricide. Thus Woolf is "not the modernist with a difference but the exemplary modernist" . In particular, Cucullu dwells on the moment in 1917 when Woolf installed her own printing press in the drawing room of her house, as she prepared to publish "domestic novels that aestheticize and commodify the very space she confiscated" . The elegized matriarchs of <i>To the Lighthouse</i> or <i>Mrs Dalloway</i> represent Woolf's appropriation of domestic culture, which she sought to replace with an educated female elite and a cult of refined artistic sensibility.
</p>

<p>
Thus modernist artists sought to join the "expert class," a new group of professional specialists who claimed authority over the "private domains of self, affect and consciousness" . Only they could teach how the "secular, consumerist, desiring, and sexual" life-styles  of the modern individual could be managed and enjoyed. But while it is true that the twentieth-century discipline of literature is "inconceivable without the expertise and cult of the literary modernists" , it is harder to understand the precise nature of the specialist knowledge that literary modernists supposedly brought to bear on the bourgeois home. Certainly, they did not inaugurate a social revolution of the kind that happened in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Britain. Nancy Armstrong has claimed that these enormous changes were prered and even shaped by the realist novel. Did modernist fiction really have a comparable historical importance? For while other "experts" in the fields of law, medicine, or psychology are still very much with us, the era of the modernists was short-lived and Cucullu does not attempt to tell us if anything changed with its passing.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, towards the end of her book, Cucullu appears to revise her view of the woman modernist as "exemplary":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Woolf mythifies the domestic woman by turning her into art, that is, by making her over into culture, and thus makes culture accessible to her educated daughters. By contrast, Joyce, Lawrence, and Forster bar the domestic woman from culture by turning her into nature.

<p class="noIndent">
Given the reputations of D. H. Lawrence and Joyce in twentieth-century literary studies, it is hard to see how Woolf remains the dominant or most influential re here. Cucullu's reading of Joyce in particular does not allow that there is much that is progressive in his representations of mothers or of anything else (although she does not consider the rather different historical situation of a Mrs Dedalus compared to a Mrs Ramsay). Rather, the "expert status" to which Joyce and other modernists aspired contributed to their subsequent institutionalization and to the creation of "a monopoly on cultural competence that is fundamentally at odds with any liberatory politics" . We might, after all, have been better off with realism and its angels of the hearth.
