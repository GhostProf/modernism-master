<div class="contrib"><a href="#back">Jeffrey T. Schnapp</a></div>
</div>
<div id="body">
<p>When the founding manifesto of Futurism first appeared in the Saturday, February 20, 1909 edition of <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span>, a brief preamble was tacked on by Gaston Calmette, the managing editor:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>Mr. Marinetti, the young Italian and French poet endowed with a remarkable and fiery talent [1], known throughout the Latin world thanks to his stirring performances [2] and followed by a constellation of enthusiastic disciples [3], has just founded the School of "Futurism" [4], the boldness of whose theories exceeds that of all prior and contemporary schools [5]. The <span style="font-style:italic;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">ro</span></span> has provided a platform for many of the latter [6] (and not the least outstanding among them). So, today, it presents its readers with the manifesto of the "Futurists" [7]. Needless to say, the manifesto's author assumes full responsibility for his singularly daring and extravagant ideas [8] and for their often unjust attack on eminently respectable and universally respected things [9]. Yet it seemed worthwhile to grant our readers an exclusive first look [10] at this document, irrespective of one's views regarding its merits [11].<a name="f1-text" href="#f1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Properly speaking, the moment of Futurism's birth had occured four months earlier, when the following article appeared in <span style="font-style:italic;">Corriere della Sera</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>This morning, a bit before noon, F. T. Marinetti was heading down Via Domodossola in his car. The vehicle's owner was at the wheel accompanied by a 23 year-old mechanic, Ettore Angelini. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Although the details of the incident remain sketchy, it appears that an evasive maneuver was required by the sudden appearance of a bicyclist, and resulted in the vehicle being flipped into a ditch.<a name="f2-text" href="#f2"><sup>2</sup></a></p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">Within a few short weeks the event had been reworked as the foundation myth of the century's first cultural political avant-garde, initially literary but soon encompassing the full spectrum of the arts, whose eleven-point platform weds advocacy of "the habit of energy and fearlessness," "aggressive movement, feverish insomnia, the race pace, the mortal leap, the slap and the punch" to the exaltation of the beauty of speed. The prose is telegraphic, the message time-sensitive; the manifesto is news from the future. Marinetti sought to publish it immediately (and there were leaks and pre-releases). But the news pipeline was so clogged with reports on the simmering Bosnian crisis, soon to be followed by the Messina earthquake, that three months would pass before backstage lobbying by a family friend led to the text's appearance on the Parisian newspaper's front page.</p>
<p>As the artfully crafted prose of the preface reproduced above suggests, the three month delay may also have been motivated by other considerations. Authored by Calmette, <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span>'s managing editor since 1903 and the older brother of the noted bacteriologist Albert Calmette, it was strategically placed before the manifesto in order to vaccinate the newspaper's readership against Marinetti's breach of the then-conventional decorum governing cultural debates. Such prefaces were infrequent even in a daily that courted controversy as recently as the Dreyfus affair, carrying no less than four of Émilie Zola's fiery polemics in the run up to the publication of his no less incendiary <span style="font-style:italic;">J'accuse</span> on the pages of its republican socialist rival <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Aurore</span>.<a name="f3-text" href="#f3"><sup>3</sup></a> Though omitted from subsequent editions of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Foundation and Manifesto of Futurism</span>, Calmette's preface marks the inaugural moment in the reception history of the 20<sup>th</sup> century's first avant-garde.</p>
<p>The commentary that follows tracks Calmette's attempts to comfort and contain even as he acknowledges the manifesto's disruptiveness. The tone is self-assured. The aim is to push Futurism back into the mold of prior literary-artistic schools: to frame its rhetoric of rupture, however incendiary, in a manner that conveys continuity. Yet, in so doing, Calmette cannot resist the temptation to traffic in two of the mainstays of the emerging public sphere of the early 20<sup>th</sup> century: sensationalism and the claim that this is a <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span> exclusive. Five years later, the editor himself would fall victim to one of the era's most sensational crimes when he was murdered by Henriette Caillaux, wife of the French Minister of Finance, Joseph Caillaux, who had been under attack by the paper.</p>
<p>The French original follows, accompanied by a brief commentary.</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>M. Marinetti, le jeune poète italien et français, au talent remarquable et fougueux [1], que de retentissantes manifestations ont fait connaître dans tous les pays latins [2], suivi d'une pléiade d'enthousiastes disciples [3], vient de fonder l'Ecole du "Futurisme" [4] dont les théories dépassent en hardiesse toutes celles des écoles antérieures ou contemporaines [5]. <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span> qui a déjà servi de tribune à plusieurs d'entre elles [6], et non des <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  moindres, offre aujourd'hui à ses lecteurs le manifeste des "Futuristes" [7]. Est-il besoin de dire que nous laissons au signataire toute la responsabilité de ses idées singulièrement audacieuses et d'une outrance [8] souvent injuste pour des choses éminemment respectables et, heureusement, partout respectées [9]? Mais il était interessant de réserver à nos lecteurs la primeur [10] de cette manifestation, quel que soit le jugement qu'on porte sur elle [11].</p></blockquote>

<h1 class="sec-headA"></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[1]</span> Thirty-two years old at the time of the manifesto's publication, Marinetti's reputation as a "remarkable and fiery" poet in his pre-Futurist period was based upon the dramatic flair demonstrated in his public readings of hyperlyrical symbolist works such as <span style="font-style:italic;">La Conquête des étoiles—Poème épique</span> (Paris: Éditions de "La Plume," May 1902), <span style="font-style:italic;">La Momie sanglante</span> (Milan: Édition du Journal "Verde e Azzurro," Jan. 1904), <span style="font-style:italic;">Destruction—Poèmes lyriques</span> (Paris: Librarie Léon Vanier, 1904), and <span style="font-style:italic;">La Ville charnelle</span> (Paris: Edward Sansot et Compagnie, July 1908), all written and published in French. Many of these works contained dialogical poems, including so-called <span style="font-style:italic;">petits drames de lumières</span> ("short dramas of light"). Marinetti's play, <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Roi Bombance—Tragédie satirique</span> (Paris: Societé du Mercure de France, June 1905), remained unperformed at the time. The poet had experimented with musical stagings of early poems such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Carillon de Nöel</span> as early as 1907, of which there exist several period recordings (sung by Laura del Lungo and Elisa Petri, always with piano accompaniment). <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[2]</span> The "stirring performances" in the Latin world surely included the poetic declamations alluded to above, but the word <span style="font-style:italic;">retentissante</span> emphasizes noise, which suggests that Calmette had a more recent clamor in mind: that which accompanied the January 15, 1909 debut of <span style="font-style:italic;">La donna è mobile (Poupées Électriques)</span> at Turin's Teatro Alfieri, performed by the Compagnia Drammatica di Spettacoli Storici e Popolari "Città di Milano." Reacting to the audience's whistling, Marinetti appeared on stage at the end of the second act, deliberately provoking an upheaval in the auditorium. The resulting uproar made the front page of <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="disp-quote">
<p>Un geste d'audace vient de valoir à F. T. Marinetti les honneurs de la caricature dans les principaux organes humoristiques d'Italie. Comme il advint souvent à son illustre compatriote d'Annunzio, Marinetti n'a pas eu le don d'être compris du public devant lequel se représentait pour la première fois à Turin sa pièce <span style="font-style:italic;">Souvent femme varie</span>. Ce n'est pas impunément, en effet, qu'un talent aristocratique comme celui du poète de <span style="font-style:italic;">La Conquête des etoiles</span> en appelle aux intelligences médiocres. On le lui fit bien voir. Dès les premières scènes, les sifflets et les bruits les plus invraisemblables saluèrent l'oeuvre nouvelle. Les partisans de Marinetti ripostèrent par leur enthousiasme. Il y eut des bagarres et des corps à corps, si bien que l'auteur, poussé à bout, parut soudain à la rampe pour exprimer son mépris à la foule hurlante. Ce geste crâne fut aussitôt le motif de nouvelles querelles parmi les spectateurs; des pugilats s'en-suivirent, si bien que par mesure d'ordre public, la pièce fut interrompue à Turin; mais aussitôt trois nouvelles compagnies ont demandé à l'auteur l'autorisation de la monter, ce qui prouve qu'un beau four est parfois plus glorieux et plus profitable qu'un succès médiocre.</p>
<div class="attrib">(<span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span>, Feb. 1, 1909)</div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="disp-quote"><p>[A courageous gesture just earned F. T. Marinetti the honor of being caricatured in Italy's main satirical reviews. As happened often to his illustrious compatriot d'Annunzio, Marinetti proved unable to win over the audience assembled for the Turin premiere of his play <span style="font-style:italic;">La donna è mobile</span>. It is not with impunity that an aristocratic talent like that possessed by the poet of <span style="font-style:italic;">La Conquête des étoiles</span> reaches out to appeal to mediocre intellects. The result was plain to see. Whistling and unimaginable noises greeted the play right from the opening scene. Marinetti's defenders responded with enthusiasm. Tussles and shoving matches broke out, so much so that the author, pushed beyond the pale, suddenly appeared on stage in order to express his contempt for the screaming mob. This brave gesture prompted renewed conflict among the spectators and fistts rerupted: so much so that the forces of order interrupted the Turin performance. But, as soon as this was done, three new theater companies asked for permission to stage the play, proving that a boiling cauldron is sometimes a greater source of glory and gain than a modest success.]</p></blockquote>
<p class="continued">The reference to the enthusiasm of Marinetti's partisans is, of course, echoed less than three weeks later in Calmette's preface to the founding manifesto where he describes the poet's disciples as <span style="font-style:italic;">enthousiastes</span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[3]</span> Calmette's choice of the term <span style="font-style:italic;">pléiade</span> is polyvalent. The word alludes to a cluster of six—or, to follow ancient astronomers, seven—stars found in the constellation Taurus: stars that become identified with the seven Alexandrian poets and tragedians who would serve, in turn, as models for two classical revivals—the Toulouse Pléiade of the 14<sup>th</sup> century and the Renaissance Pléiade of the 16<sup>th</sup> century, formed by Pierre de Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay, and Jean-Antoine de Baïfe, whose "manifesto" was <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Du Bellay's <span style="font-style:italic;">La Défense et illustration de la langue française</span> . Accordingly, in 1886, Rodolphe Darzen selected <span style="font-style:italic;">La Pléiade</span> as the title for his Symbolist review, the immediate predecessor to <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercure de France</span>. In all of these cases, the implications are clear and intended as reassuring: despite the manifesto's identification of the <span style="font-style:italic;">we</span> who speaks not only with incendiary poets but also with "large crowds agitated by labor," "the destructive gesture of anarchists," and "the polyphonic tides of modern revolution," Marinetti's disciples will remain a small, aristocratic cohort, not an avant-garde with aspirations to reach out to the working masses. Futurism may not be classicizing like the <span style="font-style:italic;">pléiade</span> of Du Bellay, Calmette suggests, but it will prove but another school in a long lineage of literary currents. The Futurists may hurl their defiance at the stars, but they will remain within the known contours of the galaxy of literary history.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[4]</span> Nowhere in the Futurist manifesto's text is there any indication that the concept of the literary <span style="font-style:italic;">school</span>, a defining feature of the French 19<sup>th</sup>-century literary scene, remains the appropriate vehicle for the revolution propounded by Marinetti. But Calmette is deliberate in his presentation of Futurism as yet another school: a school cast in the familiar mold of predecessors as Parnassianism, Symbolism, or Naturalism. His reading finds support in the manifesto to the degree that it repeatedly asserts that Futurism is a movement of poets (the turn towards painting, sculpture, music, and architecture would come soon thereafter).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[5]</span> The key distinguishing adjective is <span style="font-style:italic;">hardiesse</span>, derived from the same root as the English <span style="font-style:italic;">hardness</span>, with insinuations of both insolence and novelty. The emphasis is tonal. Jean Moreas's <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Symbolisme</span>, published on September 18, 1886 in <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span>'s literary supplement, was anything but <span style="font-style:italic;">hardi</span>. It begins: "Like all the arts, literature evolves: a cyclical evolution with strictly regulated cycles that are complicated by the changes imposed by the march of time and cahnges in context. It would be superfluous to note that each new evolutionary stage corresponds with precision to old age, to the inexorable decline of the immediately preceding school. [...] A new expression of art was thus expected, necessary, inevitable." For Moreas, there was no need to rush into the next century.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[6]</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span> had indeed hosted the leading res of 19<sup>th</sup>- and early 20<sup>th</sup>-century French literature, counting among its contributors, Gerard de Nerval, George Sand, Charles Nodier, Guy de Maupassant, Théophile Gauthier, Émile Zola, and Marcel Proust (who dedicated the lead volume of <span style="font-style:italic;">À la Recherche du temps perdu</span> to Calmette). It was identified in particular with Naturalism and Symbolism, having commissioned Moreas ("one of the most visible of these literary revolutionaries") to formulate "the fundamental principles of this new expression of art" (<span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro, Supplement Littéraire</span>, Sept. 18, 1886).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[7]</span> The word "manifesto" generally bore political connotations when employed by the newspaper, though Moreas's <span style="font-style:italic;">Le Symbolisme</span> was indeed presented under the editorial title <span style="font-style:italic;">un manifeste littéraire</span> (albeit on the second page of <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro's</span> weekly literary supplement, whereas the Futurist manifesto appeared on the front page of the actual issue). Among the other literary manifestos associated with <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span> was the <span style="font-style:italic;">Manifeste des Cinq (Le ro</span>, Aug. 18, 1887), signed by Paul Bonnetain, J.-H. <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  Rosny, Lucien Descaves, Paul Margueritte, and Gustave Guiches, a group of young naturalists disgruntled with Émile Zola (another <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span> contributor). This so-called manifesto, however, was published under the title <span style="font-style:italic;">La Terre</span>, in keeping with the title of the Zola novel that was being invoked as proof of the naturalist master's inexorable artistic decline.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[8]</span> The key word in this section of Calmette's preface is <span style="font-style:italic;">outrance</span>: a literal transgression of boundaries, a going beyond that which is reasonable or licit, always with a hint <span style="font-weight:bold;"></span>  of immorality, as in the juridical phrase <span style="font-style:italic;">outrance aux bonnes moeurs</span> (the violation of public morality). This was the standard crime of which licentious writers were accused during the period (among them Barbey d'Aurevilly and Flaubert).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[9]</span> The "eminently respectable and universally respected things" that the founding manifesto of Futurism heaps scorn upon, thereby eliciting Calmette's disapproval, were most likely the museums, libraries, and academies whose destruction was called for in point ten of the manifesto and reprised in its concluding pages. <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span> surely had little use for Marinetti's celebration in point nine of "the destructive gesture of anarchists," given its rightward leanings –it had opposed the 1871 Paris Comune—its sympathies for positivism, and belief in progress. N.B. the phrase in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Foundation and Manifesto of Futurism</span> is, in French, "le geste destructeur des anarchistes," in Italian, "il gesto distruttivo dei libertarî." In neither case is the translation "freedom-bringers," proposed by R. W. Flint in various English editions, accurate or acceptable.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[10]</span> The emphasis placed upon the value (<span style="font-style:italic;">interessant</span>) and freshness of the document, reserved for the readers of <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span> alone, suggests exclusivity inasmuch as the term <span style="font-style:italic;">primeur</span> evokes produce that is harvested before its naturally occurring moment of ripeness and wines consumed immediately without undergoing even a modicum of aging (<span style="font-style:italic;">vins nouveaux</span>). So, in spite of his caveats, Calmette is promising his upper and middle class readers a heady, volatile brew whose delivery has been rushed to market.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[11]</span> Calmette assumes that the court of public opinion –or, at least, <span style="font-style:italic;">Le ro</span>'s bourgeois readership—will be composed not of "mediocre intellects" like those who rioted at the inaugural Turin performance of <span style="font-style:italic;">La donna è mobile</span>, but of thoughtful and critical citizens. His readership will see beyond the manifesto's incendiary hype and attribute its <span style="font-style:italic;">hardiesse</span> to the extravagant lyrical sensibilities of an artist endowed with an "aristocratic talent." Yet in the backdrop of the preface hovers the specter of a public sphere, that, instead of fulfilling the values of Enlightment reason, has the potential to become a theater where forms of irrationality regularly trump and triumph over critical reason: a theater of scandal and thrill like that enacted by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Foundation and Manifesto of Futurism</span> itself.</p>
