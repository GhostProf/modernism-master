<p>
Mass culture as an interlocking complex of technologically sophisticated
and increasingly international media and entertainment industries (among
others, newspapers, popular magazines, bestsellers, professional sports,
film, fashion, advertising, and the like) emerged in Europe and America
during the two decades prior to the First World War.
<SUP><a NAME="REF1" HREF="#FOOT1">1</a></SUP>
 Highly responsive to this development, Futurism played a significant,
 creative role within mass culture not only in Italy but across Europe,
 a role that was noted by astute contemporaries and has more recently
 been explored by scholars such as Claudia Salaris.
<SUP><a NAME="REF2" HREF="#FOOT2">2</a></SUP>
 In general, however, Futurism's interaction with the new mass-culture
 industries has been slighted in favor of concentration on Futurism's
 relations with Fascism (Futurism as proto-Fascism, as a movement within
 early Fascism, as the shaper of Fascist ideals of war, virility,
 and misogyny). While no one would dispute Futurism's importance
 for the understanding of Fascism, such concentration has relegated
 Futurism to the status of an independent variable and led to serious
 distortions. Few would deny, for example, that Futurism strongly
 apppealed to masculinist ideals and frequently asserted a misogynism
 later appropriated by Fascism. Yet from its beginning Futurism also
 held a strong attraction for women anxious to escape the confines of
 traditional roles, an interest that further increased during World War
 I as the rapid social changes it imposed created new opportunities and
 expectations for women. That attraction, I shall argue, may have much
 to do with Futurism's involvement



<B></B>



with mass culture, a conjunction that (despite increasing recognition
that mass culture was gendered as feminine from its inception) has been
little explored and that seriously complicates our current understanding
of Futurism's gender politics.
<SUP><a NAME="REF3" HREF="#FOOT3">3</a></SUP>
 Similarly, stress on Futurism's relations with Fascism has led to
 emphasis on their common rhetoric, an idiom characterized by its
 affiliations with a new, non-static, non-traditional, "modernist" type
 of nationalism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF4" HREF="#FOOT4">4</a></SUP>
 Yet such rhetoric was peripheral to Futurism's main thrust, except
 during the nine months prior to Italy's entry into the war in May 1915.

<P>
More fundamental to its prewar history were its erotic and
mass-entertainment dimensions. Despite its nationalist rhetoric, Futurism
was internationalist in practice, since it understood itself as part of
an emerging global culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF5" HREF="#FOOT5">5</a></SUP>
 To claim that Futurism was enmeshed in the emergence of mass culture
 and yet also modernist may seem contradictory. But, as scholarship
 has increasingly called attention to the divergences among European
 modernisms and as their connections with capitalism and consumerism
 have been more fully appreciated, it has become apparent that the old
 paradigm of "modernism vs. the culture industry" will no longer do.
<SUP><a NAME="REF6" HREF="#FOOT6">6</a></SUP>
 My primary aims in this paper are to clarify the nature of Futurism's
 relations with both modernism and mass culture, to consider some of the
 implications this has for our understanding of Futurism and gender, and
 to show how F. T. Marinetti and other Futurists understood the reshaping
 of the artistic vocation in the face of a mass society of consumerism.

1. Modernism, Mass Culture, and Futurism
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
As Andreas Huyssen argued in his pathbreaking work of the 1980s, the
notion that modernism and mass culture arose in hostile opposition to
one another has proven "amazingly resilient," in part owing to its close
association with two canonical theories of modernism, those of Theodor
Adorno and Clement Greenberg.
<SUP><a NAME="REF7" HREF="#FOOT7">7</a></SUP>
 In this context, modernism refers to intellectual efforts to secure the
 work of art as an autonomous realm in the Kantian sense by stressing
 self-referential, ironic, and experimental means and by eschewing
 not only a moral role for art but even a mimetic or representational
 one. While such an art becomes possible historically only with the
 separation of art from its traditional moorings in religion and the
 patronage system, and their replacement by a secularized art market,
 its practitioners resolutely resist any "contamination" by mass culture
 and entertainment.

<P>
Although Huyssen offered some qualification to the Adorno-Greenberg
model, he accepted the "great divide" between "high" modernism and
"low" mass culture as an accurate historical description of the late
nineteenth and early twentieth-century world. Where he innovated was
in his suggestion that we sharply distinguish between modernism and
avant-gardes such as Futurism, dadaism, constructivism, and surrealism,
since, according to the model he appropriated from Peter B&uuml;rger,
modernism is committed to the autonomy of art while the avant-gardes
are concerned with the aestheticization of life.
<SUP><a NAME="REF8" HREF="#FOOT8">8</a></SUP>
 Such an aestheticization or merging of art and life attacks the bourgeois
 institution of art, which continues to regard art as a transcendent
 or sacral



<B></B>



sphere above mundane everydayness. Avant-gardism breaks down barriers
between pure and applied art, draws mass-cultural elements from
advertising and newspapers into art, and insists on performing art in
a public sphere where the enunciated poetic word functions to incite
action, much like a speech at a political rally.

<P>
Unlike modernism, then, avant-gardes for Huyssen were not necessarily
hostile to mass culture; indeed, they not uncommonly pursued a "perhaps
deluded dream of an avant-gardist mass culture."
<SUP><a NAME="REF9" HREF="#FOOT9">9</a></SUP>
 Because mass culture broke with the contemplative model of art
 and relentlessly stripped art of its aura, it could be useful in
 furthering the aestheticization of life. In making this move, however,
 avant-gardes were breaking with modernism and embracing the other side
 of the "great divide." Thus the aestheticization of life, according
 to Huyssen, did not mean overcoming the opposition of high and low but
 simply casting the avant-garde's lot with the latter. The possibility
 that the avant-garde might remain modernist in important ways and yet
 also embrace mass culture was not considered, presumably because it
 was regarded as contradictory and implausible.

<P>
As we will see, however, there are some important respects in which
Italian Futurism continues to pursue a modernist aesthetic, while
simultaneously embracing mass culture.
<SUP><a NAME="REF10" HREF="#FOOT10">10</a></SUP>
 In part, this is because it continues to insist on autonomy--both in
 the sense that it resists reducing the value of art to market valuation
 and in the sense that it embraces the classic features of a modernist
 aesthetic such as irony and rejection of mimesis. Futurism, we will
 see, is best grasped not with the three-term model of modernism,
 avant-garde, and mass culture, but with a four-term model that also
 includes sacralized bourgeois culture. As Lawrence Levine has shown
 for turn-of-the-century America, the rise of mass culture had as one
 of its concomitants a stiffening of "cultural hierarchy" along the
 high/low lines of the "great divide," and I would argue that a similar
 phenomenon is quite evident in Europe, certainly in Giolittian Italy.
<SUP><a NAME="REF11" HREF="#FOOT11">11</a></SUP>
 Futurism, then, must be approached not as an avant-garde that fled
 modernism for the "perhaps deluded dream of an avant-gardist mass
 culture," but as an avant-garde--the first avant-garde, in fact--which
 sought to fuse mass culture with modernism in a challenge to sacralized
 bourgeois culture.

<P>
Such an approach must also deal with two further theoretical
complications. First, if avant-gardes like Futurism work within mass
culture, which is itself gendered female, how do we account for
its masculinist rhetoric? Huyssen's book made both points without
acknowledging the tension between them.
<SUP><a NAME="REF12" HREF="#FOOT12">12</a></SUP>
 One might try to resolve it by claiming that the Futurists hoped
 to masculinize mass culture, but even then one would have to make
 theoretical sense of the palpable fact that Futurism was a project
 which excited both men and women; even if we suppose that Marinetti
 wanted to make Futurism an all-male club, he was increasingly unable
 to do so. Secondly, Futurism as an avant-garde project must be
 historicized. Much of the literature on avant-gardism, particularly
 that which slights Italian Futurism in favor of its Franco-Germanic and
 Russian successors, associates it entirely with the politically turbulent
 atmosphere of the war and immediate postwar years and, therefore, with
 the notion of a revolutionary reconstitution of modern culture. Futurism
 certainly participated



<B></B>



in this atmosphere, above all in the year and a half that stretched from
the end of the war to its scission with the Fascists at the second Fascist
Congress of May 1920. But Futurism's six prewar years, in many respects
its most creative, were not concerned with revolutionary dreams. While
it did then hope to undermine or even destroy sacralized bourgeois
culture--which, as a set of values, styles, and cultural institutions,
it regarded as a relic of the past and out of touch with modernity--it
worked entirely within the framework of rising consumerist capitalism
and confined itself to reorienting the mass culture associated with that
capitalism under its own leadership. In short, it opposed high-bourgeois
culture but not the principles of capitalism or even the hegemony of
the bourgeoisie in the capitalist order.

2. Futurism, Modernity, and the Market
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Futurism was the first artistic movement to respond aggressively to mass
culture rather than to retreat from it, as French symbolism had. In moving
beyond the symbolist posture of his journal <I>Poesia </I>(1905-1909)
and launching Futurism, Marinetti not only intuited the compression and
commodification of space and time that recent theorists have seen as
central to modernism, but he also understood that a generalized concept
of modernity or "the future" was possible precisely on this basis.
<SUP><a NAME="REF13" HREF="#FOOT13">13</a></SUP>
 Indeed, the Futurist reduction of modernity to the phenomenon of speed
 <I>(velocit&agrave;) </I>probably communicated the basic rationale for
 a modernist art more clearly than did any other modernist movement.

<P>
Marinetti's achievement becomes fully apparent, however, only when one
considers the range of interconnections he made between his Futurism and
the conditions of modern life. He understood the emerging power of the
press and advertising and, thus, the need for the artist/intellectual to
use these means for his own ends--a task he himself undertook on virtually
a daily basis with every media tool he could devise. More generally, he
understood that modern civilization is based on the dominance of vision,
and that visual images would not only increasingly replace written forms
but also reorient print media by heightening the visual dimensions of
their typography.
<SUP><a NAME="REF14" HREF="#FOOT14">14</a></SUP>
 He understood how the commodified image implied the need to reconstruct
 one's own personality as a set of masks and poses (from our perspective,
 Marinetti might well be called the first Madonna). He understood that
 the spectacle of modern life was based on a marketplace whose dimensions
 were not bounded by the local community, the city, or even the nation,
 but were genuinely global. He understood that modern society as a
 "mass" society was inevitably bound up with the concept of cultural
 democratization. That is why, even though he rejected parliamentary
 forms, he always insisted on the concept of democracy when discussing
 Futurism's cultural politics, which were relentlessly antimonarchical,
 anticlerical, and anticlassical.
<SUP><a NAME="REF15" HREF="#FOOT15">15</a></SUP>
 He was contemptuous of intellectual movements that failed to
 appreciate the need to join what you cannot beat and that pursued
 <I>recherch&eacute; </I>language as a way of establishing an
 &eacute;litist niche. He cultivated poetry--the most antibourgeois of
 the literary arts, according to Bourdieu--but insisted on separating it



<B></B>



radically from psychic interiors and presenting it accessibly in forms
that anticipated those of modern advertising.
<SUP><a NAME="REF16" HREF="#FOOT16">16</a></SUP>
 In the latter regard, he paid especially close attention to the design
 of book covers <I>(copertine), </I>and he and his Futurist friends used
 many abbreviations and insignia drawn from the world of consumerism
 in their poetry and painting. Similarly, in his building designs, the
 Futurist architect Antonio Sant'Elia always included spaces specially
 designed for lighted advertising, and artists like Umberto Boccioni and
 Fortunato Depero did designs for the Touring Club of Italy and Campari.
<SUP><a NAME="REF17" HREF="#FOOT17">17</a></SUP>
 Finally, the innovations Marinetti and the Futurists produced in
 the areas of literature, painting, film, and theater were frequently
 linked to the newer mass entertainment venues such as variety theater
 and cabaret; only exceptionally did they make a primary appeal to the
 traditional, high-culture-oriented &eacute;lite.

<P>
Of course, none of this attention to mass-cultural forms guaranteed
commercial success, and there were undoubtedly occasions when the
Futurists failed to exploit the full potential of the new media and
venues in which they were working.
<SUP><a NAME="REF18" HREF="#FOOT18">18</a></SUP>
 The difficult question to answer in this regard is whether such failures
 resulted primarily from an inability to achieve commercial success, or
 whether Futurist art and performance were sometimes complicated by other
 motives. Or, to put matters more generally: does sensing the potential
 power of mass culture and the consequent necessity of participating in it
 mean that one is endorsing the commodity status of art and reducing the
 test for artistic excellence to box-office receipts? Did the Futurists
 believe that art had become simply a commodity, an exchange value to be
 determined by the marketplace, that is, by the demand it could generate,
 rather than by the intrinsic worth of the art object as determined by
 the traditional means of evaluation by professional critics and other
 artists? Did the Futurists hitch their star to the consumer society
 wherever that might lead in terms of the definition of art, the standards
 to which it was beholden, and control over its production?

<P>
To answer these questions in the affirmative would certainly be to upset
the usual understanding of what aesthetic modernism was about. Yet this
has not prevented at least one recent critic from concluding that "the
deeper rationale of its [Futurism's] apparently irrational metaphysic was
quite simply that of the market," that it retained no critical leverage
against the reduction of artistic value to marketplace demand, and that
"the logic of consumerism . . . [was] welcomed [by the Futurists] as the
perfect antidote to a decadent economy of accumulation and repression."
<SUP><a NAME="REF19" HREF="#FOOT19">19</a></SUP>

<P>
In my view this argument is too extreme. There is no question that the
Futurists aimed at mass appeal, but there are several senses in which
they were less than fully adapted to marketplace logic. They insisted,
for instance, on an antagonistic self-presentation before their
audiences--the famous "pleasure in being booed" so much in evidence
at their "evenings" <I>(serate), </I>a topic we will take up farther
on. This "pleasure" certainly contributed to their notoriety, but it
also evidenced an &eacute;litist view of themselves as above the masses
for whom they performed and, thus, as the final arbiter of the value
of their art. Moreover, by no means all their enterprises were aimed at
a mass audience. The "edizioni Futuriste di <I>Poesia</I>"--books that
Marinetti continued to edit for several years after the last issue of
the journal <I>Poesia </I>appeared



<B></B>



in October 1909--were aimed at an audience of no more than a thousand
(as their publication runs attested) and their quality was uncompromising.
<SUP><a NAME="REF20" HREF="#FOOT20">20</a></SUP>
 Finally, in those few texts in which they discussed the concept of
 value, Futurists did not reduce it to market exchange.

<P>
One of the fullest of these discussions is the manifesto, "Weights,
Measures, and Prices of Artistic Genius," written in 1914 by Bruno
Corradini and Emilio Settimelli, two of the young cohort of Florentine
Futurists who would edit <I>L'Italia futurista </I>during the war.
<SUP><a NAME="REF21" HREF="#FOOT21">21</a></SUP>
 They are unabashed in their enthusiasm for the idea that "the
 producer of artistic creativity must join the commercial organization
 which is the muscle of modern life." They pooh-pooh "criticism" as
 "pass&eacute;ist pseudo-criticism" and claim it has "no right to make
 judgments." Instead they invoke the more positivist sounding terms
 "measurer" and "measurement." "Measurers" should judge art the way all
 human activities are judged: by the raw amount nervous energy put into
 them. Such traditional critical standards as beauty and inspiration
 should be rejected, and something called "value," which is based on
 "natural rarity," should be put in their place. In the "intellectual
 field," they claim, "rarity" is a direct function of the quantity of
 "cerebral energy" needed for production. "The Futurist measurement
 of a work of art means an exact scientific determination expressed
 in formulae of the quality of cerebral energy represented by the work
 itself, independently of the good, bad or non-existent impression which
 people may have of the work."

<P>
Despite the appeal to science and objectivity, then, artistic
value for these Futurists is strictly a function of the artist's
"cerebral energy" and has nothing to do with external reception
in the marketplace. Moreover, the "measurer" is not some external
authority but the Futurist himself. It is the "Futurist measurer" who
"will . . . analyse the work of art into the individual discoveries of
relationships of which it consists, determine by means of calculations
the rarity of each discovery, that is the quantity of energy necessary
to produce them, fix on the basis of this rarity a fixed price for each
one of them, add up the individual values, and give the overall price
of the work." Why any of this should be done by the producer rather
than by simply allowing the market to determine price and value is
left undiscussed. What is clear is only that "because all that matters
is the quantity of energy manifested, the artist will be permitted all
forms of eccentricity, lunacy or illogicality." True "genius" invariably
manifests such qualities. Of course, some purported geniuses are "frauds"
(D'Annunzio, Puccini, and Leoncavallo are cited as examples). Far from
trusting the market to eliminate them, these Futurists ask "the state
to create a body of law for the purpose of guarding and regulating the
sale of genius."

<P>
Futurism operates in venues that are frequented by the masses, but it
clings to a modernist mode of establishing artistic value and refuses
to accept the masses as the arbiter of taste. In their amalgam of
avant-gardism, modernism, and mass culture, Futurists seek to exploit the
gap between their own autonomous "calculation" of artistic taste and that
of the masses both as a means of creating notoriety for themselves and
of exerting critical leverage against features of the actually existing,
"sacralized" bourgeois culture they oppose. In short, the Futurists want
to have matters



<B></B>



 both ways. They know they have to play to a mass audience, using the
 modern media and technologies it will appreciate, but they also seek to
 remain firmly in control of their own product. Neither the masses nor
 culture-industry capitalists are to have any say about what ought to
 be produced or how. In this respect they remain as firmly modernist as
 Baudelaire or Mallarm&eacute;. Faced with a mass culture that threatened
 to negate them, all the early modernists understand that there is no
 possibility of retreat; modern forces have to be faced, and, since
 that is so, they may as well be embraced. If this means the end of
 "Art with a capital A," then so be it.
<SUP><a NAME="REF22" HREF="#FOOT22">22</a></SUP>
 On the other hand, to submit to exchange value as the determinant of
 artistic worth and, thus, of the kind of art that should and would
 be produced, threatens the extinction of the autonomous artistic
 enterprise. Most modernists before the Futurist generation turned
 inward and retreated before this threat, but the Futurists respond by
 seeking to reshape the artistic vocation within a mass culture that they
 hope to control. In their hands modernism moves beyond being simply a
 reaction formation to mass culture. They see the culture of posters,
 advertisements, and commercial design generally as a new means to
 stimulate cultural life and to subvert its tired, "pass&eacute;ist,"
 bourgeois forms. And they are brazen (or foolhardy) enough to believe
 that it is they who will ride herd over an emerging global mass culture.

3. Milan, Marinetti, and the International Futurist Roadshow
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Though best known as the apex of the industrial triangle that grew up
in Northern Italy after 1895, and for the socialist and trade-union
movements that accompanied this industrialization, Marinetti's Milan
was also undergoing a major cultural transformation that included the
development of significant culture industries.
<SUP><a NAME="REF23" HREF="#FOOT23">23</a></SUP>
 These were the years of major expositions, the largest of which--at
 84,000 square meters of enclosed space--was the International Exposition
 of 1906. Grand department stores also appeared, and professional sports
 took off. The Touring Club of Italy, based in Milan, organized its first
 automotive <I>"giro d'Italia" </I>in 1901, and motorcycle racing also
 became popular. The first Milanese soccer team, the "Milan Cricket and
 Football Club," was formed in 1899. Clubs for mountain-climbing, skiing,
 and rowing, all formed in the late nineteenth century, became more active
 (the first <I>coppa Milano </I>in rowing dates from 1904), and bicycling,
 iceskating, rollerskating, marksmanship, tennis, fencing, wrestling,
 boxing, and aviation all began to find enthusiastic participants and
 spectators.

<P>
Theater-going remained a major focus of cultural life--these were the
Arturo Toscanini years at La Scala--but its audiences became less
aristocratic as private boxes were sold off and ticket prices were
standardized; and, increasingly, operas produced, such as Giacomo
Puccini's <I>Madama Butterfly </I> or <I>La fanciulla del West
</I>, were aimed at a mass audience.
<SUP><a NAME="REF24" HREF="#FOOT24">24</a></SUP>
 Part of what made this possible was the growing acceptance of repertory
 opera, which meant that the opera season could be based, year in and
 year out, on the same fifteen or twenty "classic" operas. Alongside
 traditional theater, audiences grew for operettas, variety theater,
 circuses,



<B></B>



and, above all, for the silent cinema, which had its golden age in the
Italy of the immediate prewar years. In Milan, cinema prices averaged
only about fifty cents (half that for children and military personnel),
and an elegant theater, the Centrale, was constructed in the Galleria next
to its northern portico. The first cinema production company in Italy was
formed in Turin in 1908, but by 1914 Milan had three. The new films they
produced presented longer narratives, and by 1913 large blockbuster shows
such as Mario Caserini's <I>Last Days of Pompeii, </I>Enrico Guazzoni's
<I>Quo Vadis, </I>and Giovanni Pastrone's <I>Cabiria </I>were attracting
huge audiences.

<P>
These years also witnessed the emergence of mass journalism under the
leadership of Luigi Albertini, editor of Milan's <I>Corriere della Sera
</I>from 1900 to 1921.
<SUP><a NAME="REF25" HREF="#FOOT25">25</a></SUP>
During these two decades its print run increased from about 75,000 to
over 600,000, as major Lombard firms gave it their financial backing. The
<I>Corriere </I>became the model, not only for other city newspapers
but also for more partisan ones like the Socialist <I>Avanti!, </I>which
had a daily circulation of 400,000 in 1914.

<P>
What fueled all these developments, in addition to the growth of
industrial capitalism, was an enormous increase in urban population. In
the hundred years up to 1914, Milan's population nearly quintupled
from about 140,000 to 655,004. Much of the increase reflected a
pattern of migration into the city from nearby farms. The influx
produced major problems such as a housing crisis, but also stimulated
many modern infrastructural changes, such as new buildings and road
widenings downtown, the development of public transportation (trams
were electrified in 1899), and the expansion of telephone service
(lines went underground beginning in 1901 and the first calls to Paris
were put through in 1902). From the perspective of the new mass-culture
industries, however, the main point was the vast increase in the size
of potential audiences and their changed character with the swelling
tide of recent rural immigrants.

<P>
What sort of offerings should be made to such an audience? One answer
would be simply to give it <I>kitsch, </I>while also cordoning off a small
&eacute;lite sector where genuine art would continue to prevail. This
is an answer often associated with modernism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF26" HREF="#FOOT26">26</a></SUP>
 Marinetti's answer, however, was quite different. He sought to raise
 <I>kitsch </I>to art or, perhaps more accurately, to blend <I>kitsch
 </I>and art in a way that satisfied both the recent rural immigrants and
 other workers in the audience as well as the poets on stage. His mode
 of art aimed to preserve the standards associated with artistic autonomy
 while also catering to the masses. And it had the additional advantage of
 continuing to appeal to the taste for exoticism among the aristocratic
 elements in his audience (elegant ladies not infrequently attended his
 <I>serate</I>),<I> </I>while almost entirely bypassing the need to cater
 to the bourgeoisie. In short, he saw himself as both a new specialist
 in mass cultural entrepreneurship who knew how to retain control of
 the artistic product and as the leader of a pocket of resistance to
 the bourgeoisie and its sacralized high culture. For a brief period
 at the end of World War I, he even dreamed that this resistence could
 galvanize the masses sufficiently to become the basis of a new society.



<B></B>

<P>
In the founding manifesto of Futurism, Marinetti claimed that "the oldest
of us is thirty."
<SUP><a NAME="REF27" HREF="#FOOT27">27</a></SUP>
 In fact, when these words appeared in <I>Le ro </I>in February 1909,
 Marinetti was already thirty three and had been involved in avant-garde
 circles in Paris and Milan for well over a decade. Yet the prevarication
 was truly revealing in one respect: Marinetti was already a longstanding
 and adept practitioner of the art of self-publicity via the carefully
 manufactured image.
<SUP><a NAME="REF28" HREF="#FOOT28">28</a></SUP>
 <I>Poesia </I>was a sumptuously produced journal with a circulation
 that may have reached 40,000 copies by its final issue.
<SUP><a NAME="REF29" HREF="#FOOT29">29</a></SUP>
 It sold for the then-astronomical price of ten lire, but this was more
 a reflection of Marinetti's image of the journal than a desire for
 profit-making. Marinetti gave away many copies to people he wished
 to influence, and he financed the enterprise partly on the basis of
 a substantial inheritance he had received from his father, a wealthy
 businessman with links to Egypt who died in 1907. He used contacts
 with some of his father's old Egyptian cronies, then stationed in
 Paris, to get his manifesto published in <I>Le ro, </I>which was
 sometimes known as the "Jockey Club's daily" and was very far from the
 bohemian world.
<SUP><a NAME="REF30" HREF="#FOOT30">30</a></SUP>
 As a direct spinoff of this publication, Marinetti got press coverage
 in many major dailies in other European capitals, and he further fanned
 the flames himself by writing literally hundreds of letters to prominent
 European intellectuals promising to reprint their evaluations of Futurism
 in <I>Poesia.</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF31" HREF="#FOOT31">31</a></SUP>
<I> </I>A few months later he managed to get his play <I>Roi Bombance
</I>produced by the posh Marigny Theater. And he punched out critics,
and even fought one duel, to create yet more scandal.

<P>
These examples of Marinetti's self-promotional activity could be
multiplied at length. As a whole they make overwhelmingly clear that
what drove the young Marinetti was much less ideological conviction than
entrepreneurial ambition, albeit of an unconventional, cultural sort. Yet,
though the energy and singlemindedness with which he pursued this vocation
was without peer, there were a few others from whom he had learned a
trick or two. One of these was his friend Umberto Notari, who had made
his name in 1904 as the author of <I>Quelle signore </I>(Those Women)
a novel set in a bordello that had sold 80,000 copies in six months.
<SUP><a NAME="REF32" HREF="#FOOT32">32</a></SUP>
 It was Notari's good fortune to be accused of obscenity by a court in
 Parma two years later. Marinetti, who attended and clearly relished
 the trial, wrote a detailed account of it for the Parisian readers of
 <I>Gil Blas, </I>and then translated his account into Italian, appending
 a brief, self-congratulatory introduction. It reads in part:

Notwithstanding the triumphant Americanism of his journalistic career,
it would have been difficult for Notari to have gained the resounding
success that he has with his novel, even to this day, had the Attorney
for the King of Parma, during the provincial festivals, not had an idea
worthy of a sublime Barnum: that of denouncing the pornographic immoralism
of the book, which, by his order, was seized and prosecuted. . . . It is
impossible to imagine such an atmosphere when one has, right and left,
seductive journalists who put their feet up on the table, promising you
voluptuous publicity, and when you have before you orators who take
such dangerous gambits. . . . The sentence of the Parma Tribunal was
proclaimed immediately through every channel of publicity, and this gave
an extraordinary boost to the book's sales such that, today, one finds
it in all the elegant

<P>
Four years later, Marinetti would succeed in getting his own effort at
high pornography, <I>Mafarka il futurista, </I>tried for obscenity, an
event that kept him in the limelight like none other.

<P>
Evidence of political convictions, particularly irredentism and
nationalism, are not entirely lacking in the young Marinetti. In 1908,
for example, he traveled to Trieste to carry a wreath at the funeral of
the mother of Guglielmo Oberdan--a young Italian who had been executed
in 1882 by the Austrians for a murder plot against the Emperor and who
had then become a martyr to the irredentist cause. While there, Marinetti
was arrested for an anti-Austrian speech.
<SUP><a NAME="REF34" HREF="#FOOT34">34</a></SUP>
 Yet, in the absense of much political writing, such acts can always also
 be read in the same light as the Mafarka trial or the Trieste <I>serata
 </I>of 1910, which again raised the irredentist theme in a context of
 theatrical showmanship. It is difficult to escape the impression that
 what counted most for the young Marinetti was performing the self;
 politics was simply a useful theater for that performance.

<P>
Much the same could be said for Notari. He, too, was not without
political convictions, but they were always subordinated to essentially
self-promotional acts.
<SUP><a NAME="REF35" HREF="#FOOT35">35</a></SUP>
 In 1910, for example, he attempted to form his own "Italian Association
 of the Avant-garde" and published a long manifesto called <I>Noi
 </I>(Us) in which a number of the political causes he favored were
 discussed, above all a campaign, supported by Marinetti, to get the
 Vatican expelled from Italy.
<SUP><a NAME="REF36" HREF="#FOOT36">36</a></SUP>
 Yet, in a self-advertisement on the first page, Notari listed ten other
 books he had already authored, including four novels, two of which,
 he noted, had been "tried for obscenity"; three books of politics
 and sociology; two of journalism; and one play (a staged version of
 two of his novels). His ad also noted that <I>Noi </I>was a volume of
 one hundred fifty pages; in fact, the reader can easily see that it
 has only one hundred nineteen very small pages with very large print
 and wide spacings. In this context, the claims the manifesto makes
 about imminent formation of the "Association," Notari's draft of its
 constitution, and his plans for its "convention" in San Marino, are
 difficult to take seriously as political projects.

<P>
Despite their many similarities, however, there are at least three
important differences between the self-promotional styles of Marinetti
and Notari which are instructive in clarifying Marinetti's distinctive
orientation. The first is that Notari's approach to the new sphere of
mass culture was always much more that of a conventional businessman than
Marinetti's. Perhaps because Notari had been born into a working-class
family in Bologna and never had the flexibility associated with
Marinetti's independent wealth, he was always much more driven by
profit-making motives and much more prone to give his mass audience
precisely what it demanded. Though his work does use gentle ironies to
provoke its audience, the gap between the artist's autonomous taste and
that of the masses, which Marinetti never ceased to exploit, is completely
absent in Notari. Thus, for example, while Marinetti's intense opposition
to <I>"passatismo"</I> was an implicit criticism of his audience and
of Italy's museum and tourist culture, Notari actually used his main
journal of the prewar



<B></B>



period, <I>Verde e Azzurro</I>, to help promote Italy as a land of
tourism.
<SUP><a NAME="REF37" HREF="#FOOT37">37</a></SUP>
 Moreover, while Notari explicitly invoked a modernist aesthetic, his
 great passion was the new world of mass sport, which he approached with
 the mind of an ardent fan.
<SUP><a NAME="REF38" HREF="#FOOT38">38</a></SUP>
 Though not without articles on literature, art, and theatre, <I>Verde e
 Azzurro </I>made its name for its coverage of sports, the first journal
 in Italy to do so. Indeed, Marinetti later recalled that <I>Verde e
 Azzurro</I>, popular enough to develop over time into a daily, "had
 provided the impetus for the first marathons of twenty thousand young
 men, bare-chested in the sun, racing competitively through the streets
 of Milan."
<SUP><a NAME="REF39" HREF="#FOOT39">39</a></SUP>
 The other promotion for which the Notari became known in the prewar
 period was an international traveling fair of Italian commercial
 products. After the war he developed <I>L'Ambrosiano, </I>the Milanese
 daily best known for its coverage of sports. By 1926 he had also founded
 and was editing a business daily, <I>La Finanza d'Italia, </I>and his
 books in the postwar perior are mostly economic discourses done in
 a humorous vein, a genre that Massimo Bontempelli dubbed "novelistic
 economics" <I>(economia romanzata)</I>.
<SUP><a NAME="REF40" HREF="#FOOT40">40</a></SUP>
 While the avant-gardist impulse that gave rise to <I>"Noi"</I> never
 entirely died out--another of his dailies, edited during the war years,
 was <I>Gli Avvenimenti, </I>the "third page" of which was overseen by the
 Futurist poet Paolo Buzzi--it gradually diminished, and by the fascist
 era it had been reduced to a stylistic flourish within a mainstream
 publishing business.

<P>
A second difference in their self-promotional styles is that, while
both men demonstrated enormous energies, Marinetti lived his life--and
especially the half-dozen years after the first Futurist manifesto--in a
perpetual international whirlwind. Carlo Linati, who initially co-edited
<I>Verde e Azzurro </I>with Notari and also knew Marinetti well,
credited the latter after his death in 1944 with "having presented us
with a totally new human type: a kind of model of the 'man in a hurry,'
an agitator of the spirit which the times probably called for and of
which, up to now, we have had no more historical examples."
<SUP><a NAME="REF41" HREF="#FOOT41">41</a></SUP>
 During the first Futurist years, Marinetti never ceased being on the
 run, giving "conferences," exhibitions, and <I>serate</I> in two dozen
 Italian cities and a dozen countries, and managing all the details
 himself. As two of his young Futurist disciples marveled, "Marinetti
 spends half of his life on the train: war correspondent and soldier
 in Tripoli and Bengasi and in the Bulgarian trenches of Adrianopolis;
 Futurist propagandist in Paris, Bruxelles, Madrid, Moscow, Petersburg,
 Milan, Palermo. His home is not the Casa Rossa of Milan nor the Excelsior
 Hotel in Rome but the railroad car."
<SUP><a NAME="REF42" HREF="#FOOT42">42</a></SUP>
 All told, between 1909 and 1915 he paid four extended visits to London,
 seven to Paris, four to Berlin, two to Brussels, and one each to Russia,
 Libya, and Bulgaria, and he did roughly twenty-five <I>serate </I>from
 Trieste to Palermo and Turin to Catanzaro. At the same time, he was
 producing literally hundreds of poems, articles, and manifestos.

<P>
Finally, though Notari certainly appreciated how consumerism and the
new technologies of communication and transportation had revolutionized
the conditions of cultural production, Marinetti was more acute in his
theoretical understanding of these developments.
<SUP><a NAME="REF43" HREF="#FOOT43">43</a></SUP>
 As he boasted to a female admirer just after the publication of the
 founding manifesto:

I also enjoy a lucid knowledge of my epoch. I believe that the methods of
action and intellectual propulsion today cannot be those of fifty years
ago. I believe that the most fertile and reinvigorating ideas cannot
be propagated by the book. Ideas in books are hopelessly bewildering
to people, given the flood of industrial and commercial forces, and the
sickness and tiredness of the human brain, shaken by the incessant racket
of economic interests in a life that has become, for almost everyone,
more cinematographic and anxious than ever. We must therefore adapt
the movement of ideas to the frenetic movement of our acts. In this
regard, isn't it absurd how the <I>Giornale d'Italia </I>these days makes
accusations against me, asking ironically if Alessandro Manzoni would have
proclaimed his romanticism by designing huge billboards, with bright red
lettering on a white background, declaring 'Romanticism-Manzoni'? Does it
make sense to you, dear friend, that there might be something in common
between our life today and the one our grandparents led? . . . Let's
conclude: I think that today one can propagate an idea perfectly by
splashing two-color posters on the walls of our great cities.
<SUP><a NAME="REF44" HREF="#FOOT44">44</a></SUP>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
For Marinetti, the main problem with the older generation of writers,
like D'Annunzio, is that they fail to understand how the book has been
superseded and how, to have any practical effect on popular behavior,
they have to avoid verbal complexity, literariness, and other elements
that create distance between writer and reader.
<SUP><a NAME="REF45" HREF="#FOOT45">45</a></SUP>

<P>
This point is worth bearing in mind as one considers the attitude towards
the masses inscribed in Marinetti's public performances. He certainly
derides the audiences of his <I>serate</I> for their stupidity, credulity,
and docility, yet he also knows that his ability to provoke them with the
longwinded readings of the poets on stage derives from the new mode of
cultural production he has discerned in contemporary society. Moreover,
he fully recognizes that this new mode is linked to a rising society of
consumerism, which is in turn predicated on mass appeal, that is, on
the greatest possible breadth of appeal. In this sense he understands
that he is wholly dependent upon his audiences, that the spectacle is
nothing without them. And he is quick to exploit their power in order to
create a new more spontaneous and participatory style of performance. In
this performance the audience becomes the power of the city crowd into
which the poet-<I>fl&acirc;neurs</I> have wandered; the excitement
and the spontaneous, unforseeable turns in the event depend on it, not
them. The notoriety of the performance, the possibility of yet bigger,
more spectacular, more turbulent, raucous, and violent <I>serate</I> in
the future, likewise depend on it, not them.

<P>
Thus, while each <I>serata </I>unfolded as a unique event, there were
a number of carefully orchestrated stages through which they typically
proceeded.
<SUP><a NAME="REF46" HREF="#FOOT46">46</a></SUP>
 First, days before the event itself, groups of Futurists would display
 themselves--like the goods in a department-store window--at a local,
 <I>chic </I>caf&eacute;, or they would stage their arrival at the
 local railway station with absurdist ceremony. Soon enticement would
 be supplemented by printed advertisement--leaflets handed out on street
 corners, posters tacked up on walls. Then, on the day of the event, hours
 before its announced starting time, crowds would begin milling about in a
 carnival atmosphere in some <I>piazza </I>near the rented theater, which
 would be the grandest available. Gradually they would enter the theater,
 becoming steadily rowdier as their numbers increased, and would begin to
 pelt the empty stage with whatever they had brought for that purpose. The



<B></B>



Futurists would deliberately delay their own arrival perhaps two or three
hours, the better to overheat the atmosphere. Then, dressed formally in
"smoking jackets" to accent their aristocratic difference, they would
alight on stage and, one by one in the spotlight, declaim their verse or
manifesto, often to the accompaniment of intensified pelting. Finally,
to prove that the violence had left them unfazed and to reemphasize the
ultimate separateness that their genius required, they would troop off
in a post-performance procession to the local caf&eacute; for late-night,
private merriment.

<P>
The performance, in this wide sense, staged the separateness, absence, and
difference of the Futurists at every turn, even while it sought to provoke
the audience into a leading role in making the event spontaneous. It
played with the ambiguity of dependence (we are the goods that you are
buying) and domination (we declaim regardless of what you throw). You are
the <I>passatisti, </I>and we, the <I>Futuristi. </I>You buy our tickets,
honor us with your presence, make us famous, yet we remain Futurist
geniuses autonomously pursuing our own pure art. The result is theater,
but it is variety theater, not the mainstream "contemporary theater
(verse, prose, and musical) . . . [which] vacillates stupidly between
historical reconstruction (pastiche or plagiarism) and photographic
reproduction of our daily life."
<SUP><a NAME="REF47" HREF="#FOOT47">47</a></SUP>
 In the <I>serata, </I>as in the variety theater, there is a flight from
 mimesis, an acting out of the desire to present rather than represent so
 characteristic of every modernist aesthetic. The <I>serata </I>appears
 to declaim, to remain wedded to the printed book of poetry, yet this
 declaiming is never didactic or educational, never an end in itself;
 it has become a vehicle designed to elicit the main performance as
 a spontaneous act of audience and Futurists together. D'Annunzio's
 plays, however grandly staged, remained representations rather
 than true theatrical presentations. Only in the variety theater and
 <I>serata</I>--only, that is, in the theater of the new mass culture--was
 an avant-garde, modernist performance possible.

<P>
To the Futurists, then, modernism and mass culture were not merely
compatible but mutually reinforcing: only through a reconstructed
mass-cultural performance was it possible to realize the modernist value
of a pure, non-mimetic art. In essence, this performance is a provocative
staging of difference which aims to generate friction sufficient to ignite
its potential for spontaneity. While, as performance, this is new, it is
important to recognize that its staging of difference traded on a very
old structure within modernist art. As Peter Nicholls has incisively
demonstrated, Baudelaire constructed an ironically anti-social position
for the poet by inserting two voices within the poem. In one voice,
Baudelaire sympathizes with a young girl of the lower classes (or the
faces of a crowd or some other ration of the masses); in the other,
the girl or the crowd or the masses become simply the occasion for the
poem, and the reader is forced to confront the irony that the poem's
subjects are nothing without the poet who commemorates them. With the
first voice he makes clear that the poet is as poor as the girl; with
the second, that he does not wish to become close to her, that there is
a gap between them he does not wish to cross.
<SUP><a NAME="REF48" HREF="#FOOT48">48</a></SUP>

<P>
The Futurist staging of difference is structurally identical, and it
would repeat itself during the war when the Futurists, having celebrated
war and incited the Italians



<B></B>



to intervene, strongly identified with the mass of ting soldiers
and yet also insisted on setting themselves apart in their "Futurist
squads," which were usually devoted to the most technologically exciting
and ostensibly daring activities such as the armored-car division or the
aviation unit. When, in June 1917, the Italian High Command created the
&eacute;lite units known as <I>arditi </I>in order to try to break the
stalemate with the Austrians, Futurists flocked to them as if to further
institutionalize their sense of difference from ordinary soldiers.
<SUP><a NAME="REF49" HREF="#FOOT49">49</a></SUP>
 The resulting alliance of Futurists and <I>arditi </I>lasted into the
 postwar period and provided an important source of early Fascism.

<P>
It was in the early postwar context that Marinetti's revolutionized
his political objectives and began to fantasize a counter-bourgeois
political order with the Futurists installed as the new political
class. "I believe that parliamentarism, a fallacious and short-lived
institution, is destined to perish," he wrote in May 1919. "I believe
that Italian politics will inevitably see its death throes hastened,
unless it shows its flexibility by substituting the artists--geniuses
at creation--for the class of lawyers--geniuses at dissolution and
excuse-making--that have monopolized it up to now. . . . It is above
all from the lawyerly spirit that we want to liberate Italian politics."
<SUP><a NAME="REF50" HREF="#FOOT50">50</a></SUP>
 The new, non-lawyerly, non-parliamentary order would abolish prisons and
 police, reduce government to the minimum, dissolve the family for free
 love, and, most importantly in light of the present discussion, promote
 a new, free artistic sphere. Six months later, Marinetti spelled out
 the details of this new sphere which, since it would be "lavished upon
 everyone," would "multiply the number of creative artists." Life would
 "no longer be simply one of bread and labor, nor one of idleness, but
 one of <I>life as a work of art [vita-opera d'arte]."</I>
<SUP><a NAME="REF51" HREF="#FOOT51">51</a></SUP>
 As such images suggest, however, the spirit of these writings is
 festively anarchic, and they leave unclear just how participatory this
 new sphere would be (Marinetti's category, <I>"gli artisti,"</I> appears
 caste-like throughout) or how the mass culture that had emerged before
 the war might be reinstitutionalized.

<P>

4. Futurism and Women
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Another topic to which Marinetti gave careful attention in his postwar
political writings was the emancipation of women, towards which, as is
well-known, he was quite favorable.
<SUP><a NAME="REF52" HREF="#FOOT52">52</a></SUP>
 In part, this sympathy probably reflected the changed position of
 women in Italian society generally, and in the Futurist movement in
 particular, during the war. Yet, as we have just seen, Marinetti never
 felt bound to a politics of realism. Nor were his postwar political
 writings the first place he had expressed the view that women ought
 to be granted the same social and political rights and opportunities
 as men. Marinetti's notorious expression of a "scorn for woman" in his
 founding manifesto has tended to obscure not only the enthusiasm many
 women felt for Futurism but also the nature of Marinetti's "scorn."

<P>
From the beginning Marinetti's persona, style, and ideas appealed to many
women, especially poets, and he was receptive enough to their creative
efforts to make a substantial place for them in <I>Poesia</I>. Indeed,
one of the most notable aspects



<B></B>



of the journal was just how many female contributors it had. At a time
when women were almost completely excluded both from mainstream journalism
and avant-garde reviews, <I>Poesia </I>published the poetry of roughly
fifty women or about fifteen percent of the journal's total contributors.
<SUP><a NAME="REF53" HREF="#FOOT53">53</a></SUP>
 Many of these women, such as Ada Negri, remained loyal friends of
 Marinetti to the end of their lives.

<P>
In comparison with their presence in the <I>Poesia </I>years, women were
relatively absent from early Futurism, a fact which the declaration of a
"scorn for women" might appear to explain. Certainly, given his hopes
of transforming Italy in an anticlerical, antiliberal, and intensely
individualist direction, Marinetti was intent upon attracting a very
aggressive male to Futurism. In this regard, the "scorn for women" was
part and parcel of the Futurist cult of speed, sport, force, courage,
danger, and risk, and the Futurist hatred of quietism, the academic,
the classical, the traditional, the nostalgic, and the sentimental. As
such, the phrase reflected the sort of militarist male-bonding that the
Futurists exhibited during the war. It may even have reflected a certain
unacknowledged homoeroticism and "male homosexual panic."
<SUP><a NAME="REF54" HREF="#FOOT54">54</a></SUP>
 Yet, it is also clear that Marinetti intended the phrase not literally
 as a sexist denigration of women (though he undoubtedly would not have
 minded had some men been drawn to Futurism because they misunderstood
 it in that way) but, more subtly, as a denigration of the quietist and
 sentimental virtues traditionally associated with women. Or, to put
 it differently, Marinetti's "scorn for women" was a rejection not of
 women as a biological category, but of the discursive position that
 the feminine had come to assume in fin-de-si&egrave;cle life.

<P>
In a preface to the 1910 Italian translation of <I>Mafarka le futuriste,
</I>for example, Marinetti wrote that, "when I said to them, 'scorn
woman,' everyone threw vulgar insults at me, like so many whores enraged
by a police dragnet. And yet, I wasn't talking about the worth of women as
biological entities but of the sentimental importance that is generally
attributed to them. . . . I want to conquer the tyranny of love, the
obsession with the unique woman, the romantic moonshine that bathes the
facade of the bordello!"
<SUP><a NAME="REF55" HREF="#FOOT55">55</a></SUP>
 This point is then reiterated in what is perhaps Marinetti's most
 famous declaration on women during the prewar era, "Against <I>Amore
 </I>and Parliamentarism":

<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<!--_extract-->
We scorn woman conceived as the unique ideal, the divine reservoir of
love, the voluptuous lure, the tragic bibelot, the fragile, obsessing
and fatal woman whose voice, laden with destiny, and whose fairylike
hair, reach out and become entangled with the foliage of the moonlit
forests. . . . In this struggle of ours for liberation, our best allies
are the suffragettes, because the more power and rights they attain
for women, the more woman will cease being a mere provider of love and
hotbed of sentimental passion and luxury. . . . If women dream today of
winning their political rights, it is indisputably because they feel
deep inside, unconsciously, that as mothers, wives or lovers they are
pent up in a narrow circle, purely animal and devoid of all usefulness.
<SUP><a NAME="REF56" HREF="#FOOT56">56</a></SUP>

<!--_/extract-->
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Still more telling is the parallel interpretation of the "scorn woman"
injunction by early Futurist women such as Eva K&uuml;hn Amendola, wife
of the philosopher and later



<B></B>



anti-Fascist Giovanni Amendola, who wrote under the pen name Magamal. In
an essay of 1913, she read Futurism's scorn for women as a very positive
"indication that Futurism spells the end of the reign of the eternal
feminine. . . . The future century will speak with disgust and contempt
of an age where men were allowed to exploit the feminine and in which
she was his slave."
<SUP><a NAME="REF57" HREF="#FOOT57">57</a></SUP>
 The reign of the "eternal feminine," with all its Puccinian perfumes
 and softness, with woman as symbolic of mere species regeneration and
 motherhood, is coming to an end, and Futurism is the first political
 movement to have understood this and to have set as a goal the hastening
 of this development.

<P>
Besides Magamal, the most famous <I>femme futuriste </I>of the early
years was Valentine Saint-Point, grand-niece of the French poet Alphonse
de Lamartine and a consummate artist in her own right.
<SUP><a NAME="REF58" HREF="#FOOT58">58</a></SUP>
 Like Magamal, Saint-Point directly confronted the phrase "scorn for
 woman" and read it as a criticism of what women had been, that is, of
 what men had encouraged women to be in the past, but also, of what
 women had allowed themselves to be. Following Nietzsche, she argued
 that the success of that campaign had produced an overly feminized age
 and, thus, the need for a masculine corrective. "What is most lacking
 in women and men alike is masculinity," she wrote in 1912. "That is
 why Futurism, with all its exaggerations, is right."
<SUP><a NAME="REF59" HREF="#FOOT59">59</a></SUP>
 Women must cease to be fearful of war, nurses who encourage weakness
 or mothers who are "octopuses of the hearth, whose tentacles bleed men
 dry and make their children anaemic." They are the equals of men but
 have been waylaid by sentimentalism and deprived of their sensuous
 instincts. They must return to their instincts, become as strong as
 men, and lead men and themselves to a new heroic age.

<P>
Arguably, Magamal and Saint-Point were exceptional women who cultivated
their sense of being exceptional and were attracted to Futurism on that
basis. Yet, considering Marinetti's many letters from <I>amiche </I>and
the many women who attended his trial and <I>serate </I>(which were not
all-male homoerotic events as has sometimes been claimed), it is clear
that Futurism appealed to many creative women tired of the limited and
familiar options with which bourgeois life presented them and anxious
to forge pathways of their own.
<SUP><a NAME="REF60" HREF="#FOOT60">60</a></SUP>
 Nowhere was this demonstrated more clearly than in the fifty-one
 issues of <I>L'Italia futurista, </I>the Florentine journal inspired
 by Marinetti which ran from June 1916 to February 1918.

<P>
The editorial collective that produced <I>L'Italia futurista </I>numbered
seven, of whom one, Maria Ginanni, was a woman. Ginanni was regarded
as their leading poetic talent, but as the war dragged on into 1917,
she became the journal's leading editorial writer as well, and she was
charged with the administration of its publishing house, the Edizioni di
<I>L'Italia futurista, </I>from the beginning. The journal's short life
was tumultuous, and three quite different phases can be identified. In
the first, running from June 1916 to the end of the year (about twelve
biweekly issues), the emphasis is on poetry and prose poems with little
overt political content. The journal's effort to cultivate its evidently
large female readership is, however, already quite apparent.
<SUP><a NAME="REF61" HREF="#FOOT61">61</a></SUP>
 In the second phase--roughly, the seventeen weekly issues of the first
 half of 1917--the poetry is supplemented by a spirited cheerleading
 for the war, mostly in



<B></B>



articles written by Ginanni. Finally, in the most interesting phase--the
twenty-two issues from mid 1917 to early 1918, the cheerleading
diminishes, and in its place arises a debate about women which was clearly
provoked by a sense of how much the war had altered the lot of women and
by hopes and anxieties regarding the postwar world. Here female writers
in addition to Ginanni--above all Enif Robert, a poet and novelist, and
Rosa Ros&agrave;, a graphic artist and novelist--step to the fore. In
addition, there were occasional contributions from a number of other
women including Magamal, Fanny Dini, Irma Valeria, Fulvia Giuliani, Marj
Carbonaro, Emma Marpillero, and Shara Marini.

<P>
Though consistently avoiding a feminist label as too intellectualist,
these women gave no quarter in the fierceness with which they defended
women's interests. By July 1917, Rosa Ros&agrave; was already predicting
that the war had so toughened women that they will "supersede by a good
deal all the most feminist feminists have hoped." When the soldiers
return home they will find "strong women . . . women whom the war has
shaken up just as much as it has shaken up men."
<SUP><a NAME="REF62" HREF="#FOOT62">62</a></SUP>
 In effect, her argument was that Saint-Point's desire for a masculinized
 woman, which had become canonical among Futurist women, was being
 transformed into historical reality. Because of the war, the
 masculine/feminine split had been trumped by one along <I>futurista/

 But this merely provoked Enif Robert to reply with a sociological
 categorization of men--there are the vulgar sexist brutes, the
 intellectualist eunuchs, and those rare men who combine equal quantities
 of physical and mental potency--and she was fully confident that women
 could and would choose intelligently among them. Unlike Ros&agrave;, who
 championed "women who work, study, earn money and create . . . who have
 learned to appropriate for themselves a clean and clear vision of the
 world on their own, independent of men," Robert sought a new male-female
 partnership that redefined love as "an intelligent cooperation between
 two beings who together, with equal rights and equal will," work together
 for common solutions to common problems.

<P>
The fundamental point, then, that arises from the late issues of
<I>L'Italia futurista </I>is that women who counted themselves Futurist
played an important role in the journal, forced a debate about the "new
woman" and Italian society, and demanded a postwar world based on full
equality between the sexes. Whether or not Futurist men welcomed their
ideas, Futurist women were now sufficiently great in number to demand
inclusion in the world of Futurism. For them, Futurism represented a
vision of social equality that transcended the narrow sphere of political
right, that promised the possibility of a new public sphere based on
the avant-garde's transformative role within mass culture, altogether a
most exciting alternative to the suffocating constrictions of bourgeois
society. Yet I would go further to argue that



<B></B>



Marinetti himself--for reasons having much to do with his commitment to
mass culture--had long recognized the importance of women in Futurism,
and that this was the primary motive which underlay his call for the
emancipation of women. It certainly was no coincidence that he chose
the last two issues of <I>L'Italia futurista </I>as the place to begin
to make this case.
<SUP><a NAME="REF67" HREF="#FOOT67">67</a></SUP>
 There, in the midst of an acrimonious debate between Futurist men and
 women, Marinetti positions his Futurism with progressive women and the
 democratizing forces of modernity--and against what he regards as the
 failed romanticism and sexism of the past.

<P>
Yet the story of how women demanded inclusion in the world of Futurism
would not be complete without mention of a curious <I>serata </I>which
took place in Paris in 1926.
<SUP><a NAME="REF68" HREF="#FOOT68">68</a></SUP>
 That spring, Marinetti was asked to speak at the weekly gathering of a
 French women's group. At first he demurred, claiming that their proposed
 topic--"whether war toys excite or do not excite violent instincts in
 children"--was too dependent upon the specific culture in question,
 and that he was Italian and they, French. But, after more pressure,
 he agreed, a decision he would regret when, on the appointed day, he
 entered the elegant lecture hall to find about two thousand Parisian
 women awaiting him. Hesitantly, he tried to condense his views into a
 rambling story about how puppies, when they emerge still blind from
 their mother's womb, cruelly battle each other for milk and, in so
 doing, establish a natural hierarchy of strength which is far more
 important for their development as warriors than any toy would ever
 be. Before he could finish, however, his words were "drowned out by a
 deafening burst of feminine shrieks with insulting whistles and ironic
 smiles." They shouted that the <I>patria </I>was dead and that he was a
 <I>passatista, </I>to which he replied that "the supreme civilization
 is the perfected, gigantic <I>patria." </I>And so it went, back and
 forth, until he exited "the hail of virulent insults" and headed for
 the local caf&eacute;. It may not have been Marinetti's last <I>serata,
 </I>but it was very likely his most memorable.

5. Futurism and the Reshaping of the Artistic
<!--_/a-head-->
</H3>

<P>
Futurism's view of women was part and parcel of its more general
assessment of, and attempt to alter, the state of contemporary European
mores, degraded as they had been by the feminization of manners in
the nineteenth century. The Futurist gospel was the Nietzschean lament
about worldweariness, and their solution, like his, was a remasculinized
society which would restore to humanity its natural, heroic instincts and
virtues. Though their focus in this project was clearly on men, Marinetti
at least recognized that the demand of Futurist women for inclusion in
the modern world on equal terms with men was both consistent with the
democratic ethos of modernity and, from the point of view of society as
a whole, desirable. In this regard, the hail of invective thrust upon him
by the Parisian women in 1926, however painful, was welcome as yet another
proof that the Futurist ethos was enjoying a certain social success.



<B></B>

<P>
Yet, as we have seen, except for a brief period in the immediate postwar
era, the Futurists did not conceive this project politically as part of
a revolutionary reconstruction of society. Rather they believed that
economic and technological forces which had grown up in the west were
operating globally to alter the human lifeworld, and that the artist's
role was to hasten this development, especially in those societies
most infected by lingering <I>passatismo. </I>So, at least, does the
Futurist project appear if we look back from the vantage point of
the 1920s. Looking forward from 1909, however, Futurism appears more
like just a new style of mass entertainment, one that thrust modernist
intellectuals into an eroticized <I>pas de deux </I>with the urban crowd
it had seduced through its well-orchestrated advertising campaign. Yet,
even this pursuit of commercial success as entertainment involved a
reshaping of the artistic vocation that few artists or intellectuals
besides the Futurists were prepared, or knew how, to undertake.

<P>
Futurism was the first artistic movement to show how a modernist aesthetic
of autonomy and a commitment to quality could be realized in mass-cultural
venues and with mass-cultural forms and techniques. Marinetti understood
that the short and discontinuous acts of the variety theatre, for example,
were much more amenable to a non-mimetic aesthetic of presentation than
was the now sacralized sphere of traditional high art. And he understood
that while some mass-cultural venues were male bastions--variety theater
had something of this character, vaudeville still more--mass culture as
a whole was very attractive to women. With the <I>serata </I>he proved
able to produce a form that toyed with a sado-masochistic ritual of
male-bonding even as it excited new liberating fantasies for women
tired of corsets and demure dinner parties. But, quite independent of
Marinetti's escapades, artistic women saw Futurism as something they
could appropriate for themselves, and they used it to try to advance
objectives which, while not literally feminist, were certainly connected
with new liberating social roles for women. And in accepting their right
to be part of Futurism, Marinetti further reshaped the artistic vocation.

<P>
Among the assumptions in Marinetti's early concept of Futurism were that
mass culture was the only form of art in tune with the inherent democracy
of modern everyday life; that mass culture was only now in the process of
being invented and so was fully capable of being creatively reshaped; and
that so long as that reshaping remained in tune with modern conditions,
Futurists could fuse modernism with mass culture in a way that would allow
them to retain control over their artistic product. Though all of these
assumptions were plausible in 1909, the last of them would eventually
prove to be the Futurist Achilles' heel. For while Marinetti was right
to think that mass culture offered fertile ground for modernism, he
was wrong to imagine that his modernist, mass-cultural synthesis would
ultimately prevail against purely commercialized competition. That many
later artistic movements, like the French and Italian avant-garde cinema
of the 1950s and 1960s, made the same mistake, may lead us to excuse
Marinetti's na&iuml;vet&eacute;. But it does not diminish the irony of
Futurism's concerted effort in the 1930s to be recognized as official
Fascist art.



<B></B>



For just as Futurism was attempting to seduce a false master, the true
master was seducing Futurism.

<P>
As the Futurist Fortunato Depero sighed wistfully in 1931, after a
two-year sojourn in New York, "the shop windows along the most luxurious
avenue in the world, in other words New York's Fifth Avenue, are for the
most part Futurist. . . . At every streetcorner, in every space reserved
for advertising, I see myself more or less plagiarized or robbed,
with more or less intelligence, with more or less taste; my vibrant
colors, my crystalline and mechanical style, my metallic vegetation,
fauna and humanity, geometric and fantastic, is greatly imitated and
exploited." But then, regaining his Futurist composure, he added: "This
pleases me very much; even though I have dedicated myself to advertising
only for a limited time, I recognize and do not hesitate to say that I
have been influential."
<SUP><a NAME="REF69" HREF="#FOOT69">69</a></SUP>
 In the end then, perhaps, Futurism's failure to reinvent mass culture
 in its own image and dominate it did not matter. For more than any
 other avant-garde movement, it did leave an indelible mark on modern
 culture, and our sense of what modern culture is would not have been
 the same without it.

The modernist aesthetic was continually evident in the journal's
coverage of the arts; it became reflected in the new subtitle of
the journal--<I>"Giornale quotidiano della modernit&agrave;, della
forza, e dell'ingegno"</I> (A Daily Journal of Modernity, Force, and
Wit)--beginning on March 14, 1904. See also the editorial in the 6
December 1903 issue, in which Notari promised that "<I>Verde e Azzurro</I>
will be the most audacious and 'new' daily that could be conceived within
the field of modernity." For a statement of the journal's dedication
to sports, likewise continually evident, see the lead editorial on the
first page of the 14-15 February 1904 issue.

The original reads: "che mise in moto le prime maratone di ventimila
giovani a torso nudo sotto il sole, in gara di passo e di corsa sui
bastoni di Milano." Marinetti's description is taken from an article he
wrote for the <I>Gazzetta del Popolo</I> and reprinted as a self-promotion
by Notari at the conclusion of his <I>Dichiarazione alle pi&ugrave; belle
donne del mondo</I> (Milan: Instituto Editoriale Italiano, 1933). For the
details of the marathon, which was held on May 12, 1904, see the reports
on "La maratona italiana," <I>Verde e Azzurro</I> (March 31-April 1,
April 2-3, April 4-5, April 5-6, May 11-12, and May 14-15, 1904); all
reports begin on the first page. See also Wanrooij, "Umberto Notari,"
who notes that participants were clad in green and blue to match the
name of the journal, which was also printed on blue paper with green ink.

The original reads: "egli ci propone tuttavia un tipo d'uomo tutto nuovo:

quale i tempi forse desideravano, e di cui sino ad oggi non abbiamo

The original reads: "Marinetti passa met&agrave; della sua vita in treno:
corrispondente di guerra e soldato a Tripoli a Bengasi e nelle trincee
bulgare di Adrianopoli, propagandista futurista a Parigi, Bruxelles,
Madrid, Mosca, Pietrogrado, Milano, Palermo. Il suo dornicilio non
&egrave; la Casa Rossa di Milano o l'Excelsior di Roma, &egrave;
il vagone" (Bruno Corra and Emilio Settimelli, preface to <I>Come si
seducono le donne,</I> by F. T. Marinetti, 2nd ed. [Rocca San Casciano:
Cappelli, 1918], 13).

For Notari's appreciation of such matters, see his references to the need
for <I>Verde e Azzurro</I> to be "a great shopwindow in which all the
profound and suggestive beauties of the Italian landscape" are portrayed,
to be a very visual journal "sumptuously and prodigally illustrated,"
and to be "cinematographic" (19 April 1903): 1.

The original reads: "Sono per&ograve; anche un lucido conoscitore della
mia epoca. Credo che i metodi di azione e propulsione intellecttuale
d'oggi non possano pi&ugrave; esser quelli di cinquant'anni fa. Credo che
le idee feconde e rinnovatrici non possano essere pi&ugrave; prpagate
mediante il libro. Esse vi si smarrirebbero irreparabilmente, dato lo
straripare delle forze industriali e commerciali, le facili nausee
e la stanchezza del cervello umano, scosso dal frastuono incessante
degl'interessi economici, in una vita diventata, quasi per tutti,
cinematografica e affannosa quanto mai. Bisogna dunque adattare il
movimento delle idee a quello frenetico dei nostri atti. Non &egrave;
assurda, a questo propostio, l'accusa che mi maneva il <I>Giornale
d'Italia,</I> in questri giorni, il quale si domandava ironicamente se
Alessandro Manzoni non avesse dovuto proclamare il romanticismo con degli
avvisi enormi che recassero, in rosso vivo sul bianco, queste parole:
'Il romanticismo--Manzoni'? Ma le pare propria, gentile amica, che
vi sia qualche cosa di comune fra la nostra vita d'oggi e quella che
conducevano i nostri nonni? . . . Concludiamo: Io credo si possa oggi
perfettamente propagare un'idee con lo scoppio di due colori sui muri
delle grandi citt&agrave;" (Beinecke 1:1).

Addressed to an "illustre e gentile Signora," the letter is undated but
is almost certainly from 1909 given the <I>Poesia</I> letterhead and

The original reads: "Io credo che il parlamentarismo, istituzione
politica fallace e caduca, sia destinato fatalmente a perire. Io credo,
che la politica italiana vedr&agrave; inevitabilmente precipitare la sua
agonia, se non si piegher&agrave; a sostituire degli artisti--igegni
creatori--alla classe degli avvocati--ingegni dissolventi e
palliativi--che l'hanno monopolizzata fina ad ora. . . . Quindi, &egrave;

politica italiana" (Marinetti, "Democrazia futurista," 449).

The original reads: "Quando io dissi loro: 'Disprezzate la donna!' tutti
mi lanciarono improperii triviali, come altrettanti tenitori di
postriboli, invipriti da un retata poliziesa! Eppure, io non discuto
gi&agrave; del valore animale della donna, ma dell'importanza sentimentale
che le si attribuisce. . . . Io voglio vincere la tirannia dell'amore,
l'ossessione della donna unica, il gran chiaro di luna romantico che bagna
la facciata del Bordello!" (F. T. Marinetti, "Dedica" to <I>Mafarka il
futurista: Romanzo,</I> trans. Decio Cinti [Milan: Edizioni Futuriste di
"Poesia," 1910], 4).

The original reads: "Noi disprezziamo la donna, concepita come unico
ideale, divino serbatoio d'amore, la donna veleno, la donna ninnolo
tragico, la donna grafile, ossessionante e fatale, la cui voce, greve
di destino, e la cui chioma sognante si prolungano e continuano nei
fogliami delle foreste bagnate di chiaro di luna. . . . In questo
nostro sforzo di liberazione, le suffragette sono le nostre migliori
collaboratrici, poich&eacute; quanti pi&ugrave; diritti e poteri esse
otterranno alla donna, quanto pi&ugrave; essa sar&agrave; impoverita
d'amore, tanto pi&ugrave; essa cessar&agrave; di essere un focolare di
passione sentimentale o di lussuria. . . . Se la donna sogna oggidi di
conquistare dei diritti politici, &egrave; perch&eacute;, senza saperlo,
essa &egrave; intimamente convinta di essere, come madre, come sposa e
come amante, un cerchio ristretto, puramente animale e assolutamente privo
di utilit&agrave;" (Marinetti, "Contro l'amore e il parliamentarismo"
[1915], in <I>Teoria e invenzione futurista,</I> 292-7).

The original reads: "il futurismo segna la fine dell regno dell'eterno
femminile. . . . Il secolo futuro parler&agrave; con schifo e con
disprezzo di una epoca dove l'uomo si ha lasciato sfruttare della
femmina e ne era lo schiavo" (Magamal, "Il Futurismo--la nuova religione
dell'umanit&agrave;," unpublished essay dated 20-24 December 1913, in
Beinecke 47:1884).

<P>
K&uuml;hn Amendola took her pen name Magamal from Marinetti's novel,
<I>Mafarka il futurista,</I> where Magamal is the protagonist's
brother. In the novel Mafarka sees Magamal as having a "feminine
sensibility." In a letter to Giovanni Papini of 6 December 1913, held at
the Fondazione Primo Conti in Fiesole, K&uuml;hn Amendola declares that
she has just adhered to the Futurist movement (though she "has always
been a Futurist") but must use a penname in order to keep her identity
concealed from family and friends.

In a prefatory manifesto entitled "Courage + Truth," Robert set forth
her formula for the Futurist woman. The time had come, she argued, to
get rid of the "coquettish and inconsequential tone of contemporary
women's literature" <I>(il tono civettuolo e inconcludente che &egrave;
caratteristico della letterature muliebre d'oggi)</I> and to replace it
with a "vigorous enunciation of the non-aesthetic realities of our souls"
<I>(l'enunciazione vigorosa di realt&agrave;, anche non estetiche, delle
nostre anime)</I>. We need to throw away all the "rigamarole . . . about
shining stars and moonlit nights" <I>(le tiritere . . . delle stelle
luminose, delle notti lunari)</I> and replace it with a writing of
"bold and strong seriousness" <I>(seriet&agrave; audace e forte).</I>
Marinetti cosigned the statement and added, "I approve unconditionally"
<I>(Approvo incondizionatamente).</I> See Enif Robert, "Coraggio +
