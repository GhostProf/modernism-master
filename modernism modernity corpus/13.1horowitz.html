<i>Ulysses</i> is a book about two things, Dublin life on June 16, 1904, and life. It is the story of a day (arbitrary enough to be everyday) in which a man (perverse enough to be everyman) wanders through a city (indistinct enough to be every place.) On the one hand, there are streets, pubs, postcards, newspapers, and Bloom's wayward thoughts. And on the other hand, there is myth, death, nationalism, and the cosmos. If <i>Ulysses </i>deals with colonialism, it does so because Bloom has stepped into Barney Kiernan's pub; if capitalism, because he is trying to sell an ad or buy some soap. At every turn, there is a welter of particulars set beside an intimation of the universal.
</p>

<p>
The early reviewers were quick to recognize this duality in <i>Ulysses</i>:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

. . . Mr. Leopold Bloom, ranges like Moby Dick throughout the watery globe, and communes with incommunicable things under the stars.

"Ulysses" is the <i>Odyssey</i> retold, episode by episode, as the story of a day's life in the streets, pubs, and brothels of Dublin, and is an attempt to give a complete account of the nature of man. It is apparently almost miraculously successful.

<i>Ulysses</i> is the meeting-place of the mundane and the transcendent. From the teapot to the universe, from the public baths to the incommunicable, from the brothel to the nature of man is but the smallest of steps. Every vulgar detail becomes a window on the monumental.
</p>

<p>
Notice, though, how strained the language is. All the reviewers are trying to say is that the book is at once universal and particular. But somehow they keep stumbling. Phrases like "trivial but tremendous," "inconsequential but significant," and "communes with incommunicable things" have no intellectual force; they are just oxymorons, yoking together things that do not seem to fit together.<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  They tell us <i>that </i>the book is particular and universal without telling us <i>how</i> that might be. Or, more accurately, they tell us that the particular/universal relation in <i>Ulysses</i> is simply a paradox, a palpable truth with no sure intellectual ground, and one that can only seem, as the <i>New Witness</i> says, "apparently almost miraculous."
</p>

<p>
The thing about <i>Ulysses</i>, though, is that even its paradoxes are universal; in this case, the same paradox that underlies Joyce's novel grounds high modernism as a whole. <i>Ulysses</i> may lack a particular/universal logic, but it does have a particular/universal <i>alchemy</i>; and its alchemy is a vestige of that rich alchemy that lies at the heart of high modernism and which we might translate: dissolution explodes into transcendence. In the case of <i>Ulysses</i>, it works like this: if the particulars are properly bare, they will explode into the universal; if the details are sufficiently vulgar, then they will leap into the realm of myth. So long as the alchemy of high modernism holds, then Dublin can be everywhere, Joyce's realism can be mythical, his styles can constitute a style, and this daily Dublin day can be all of life.
</p>

<p>
Once the alchemy ceases to hold, however&#x02014;once high modernism fades and a new aesthetic emerges&#x02014;then <i>Ulysses</i> comes to look like a mere paradox again. <i>Ulysses</i>, we might say, has the kind of particular/universal logic that only a modernist can understand.

Why Dublin?
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
One way to begin would be to ask, why Dublin? Why this particular place as the locus of every place? Did <i>Ulysses</i> have to be set in Dublin or could it have been somewhere else?<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>  Would any city work? Any town or village? I could put the question another way: how much do you have to know about Dublin to understand <i>Ulysses</i>? If you read the book with New York in mind&#x02014;or Paris or Shanghai&#x02014;how much can you appreciate? Nothing? Or how about: none of the details but everything that matters? This would be one facet of the particular/universal problem&#x02014;the local and the global.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
There is a long tradition of critics who have wondered about the Dublinness of <i>Ulysses</i>. As early as 1922, the <i>Dublin Review</i> opined that "Nothing could be more ridiculous than the youthful dilettantes in Paris or London who profess knowledge and understanding of a work which is often mercifully obscure even to the Dublin-bred."<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  In recent years, this line has been continued by post-colonial Joyce critics, who tend to emphasize the representation of Irish colonial life.
</p>

<p>
There have been others, however, who dismiss Dublin and claim the book for broader pluralities&#x02014;sometimes humanity, sometimes Modernity. Pound, for one, wrote: "I doubt if the local allusions interfere with <i>general</i> comprehension," adding about Molly, "she exists presumably in Patagonia as she exists in Jersey City or Camden."<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  This approach has been taken up most directly by Marxist critics like Franco Moretti and Terry Eagleton, the latter of whom once wrote:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The novel celebrates and undermines the Irish national formation at a stroke, deploying the full battery of cosmopolitan modernist techniques to re-create it while suggesting with its every breath just how easily it could have done the same for Bradford or the Bronx.<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
There are two possibilities, then. Either all that is local melts into air, or it blocks the gates. Either Dublin defines the book or the book happens to pass through Dublin. And one way to discriminate between those possibilities would be to look at the function of Dublin within the novel. What does this city add to the thematics of Joyce's novel? What are the features that make Dublin fit for <i>Ulysses</i>? And do they allow Dublin to stand in for every place?
</p>

<p>
In 1800, Dublin was the second largest city in the British Isles (only London was larger). By 1850, it was only the fifth largest. And at the turn of the twentieth century, it was no longer even the largest city in Ireland (that distinction belonged to the more highly industrialized Belfast).<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>  The Dublin of 1904 was a city in advanced decline. With the fifth highest death rate in the world and infant mortality higher than Moscow and Calcutta, it had lost its place among the advanced European capitals and earned its image as a municipal slum.<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  So when Joyce says, "When you remember that Dublin has been a capital for thousands of years, that it is the 'second' city of the British Empire . . . it seems strange that no artist has given it to the world," he means at least two things: it is strange that no artist gave it to the world at a time when it seemed worth giving; and it is strange that he should be tasked with giving it to the world now, in its waning phase.<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
There is more to Joyce's Dublin than just its historical character, though&#x02014;more to it, in other words, than just this background of economic decline. There is also its fictional character. After all, Joyce's Dublin is not Dublin; it is a representation of Dublin. If Dublin can serve as the gateway to everywhere in <i>Ulysses</i>, then it is thanks, on the one hand, to certain characteristics of the historical city and, on the other hand, to certain characteristics of the fictional city. And so "why Dublin" has to mean both: "What made Dublin seem like the appropriate&#x02014;perhaps inevitable&#x02014;setting for <i>Ulysses</i>?" and also: "How did Joyce's fictionalization of Dublin contribute to 

<b></b>

that appropriateness?" To simplify, the two questions we have to answer are: "Why Dublin?" and "Why Joyce's Dublin?" The declining status of Dublin belongs with the first question. And if we leave it at that, then any declining city should work&#x02014;a Bronx <i>Ulysses</i> or a Camden. But there are features of Joyce's Dublin, in contrast, that make the Bronx seem a poor substitute.
</p>

<p>
For one thing, Joyce's city still has a village character&#x02014;whether or not that is true of the historical Dublin. The people you bump into are as likely to be intimates as strangers. And the streets tell a story about Irish history, albeit alongside the din of commodities. To call it a knowable community would be too strong, but it exhibits some characteristics for which the more common expressions about modern urban life&#x02014;shock, alienation, <i>Erlebnis</i>&#x02014;are simply inadequate. So much of Dublin is familiar (to its inhabitants at least): faces, locales, stories. Who, at the end of the day, hasn't heard about the postcard that reads U.P.: up? Or about the funeral of a single, rather undistinguished, man named Dignam? These things are still communal, as is the love of music, the penchant for gossip, and the burden of a failed revolutionary history (the cost of all this communal knowledge in <i>Ulysses</i>, incidentally, is the elision of large segments of Dublin life, from the slums on the one hand to the Anglo-Irish on the other.) Bloom may busy himself hatching entrepreneurial schemes and devising captivating advertisements, but his world is still full of pre-capitalist residues.<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  To put it bluntly, when he shits he schemes, but he does not flush.
</p>

<p>
That may sound crass, but I think it is crucial to <i>Ulysses</i> and crucial to the question of how Dublin can be every place. The key here is the toilet&#x02014;in Bloom's case the absence of a toilet. Not all shit is created equal, or more precisely not all shit is excreted equal. Bloom, in particular, excretes in "the jakes," which is simply an outhouse with a bench and a hole.<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  His jakes is musty, full of the "stench of mouldy limewash and stale cobwebs," so much so that he has to remind himself not to dirty his nice trousers before the funeral. There's a "chink" in the wall through which he can see his neighbor's house&#x02014;though on this particular morning it happens that no one is there. He brings his newspaper and takes some pleasure in reading a vignette called "Matcham's Masterstroke," though decidedly less pleasure than he takes in the dynamics of release:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Quietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but resisting, began the second. Midway, his last resistance yielding, he allowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still patiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Hope it's not too big bring on piles again. No, just right. So. Ah! Costive. One tabloid of cascara sagrada. Life might be so. It did not move or touch him but it was something quick and neat. Print anything now. Silly season. He read on, seated above his own rising smell.

<p class="noIndent">
What is fun about this passage&#x02014;as so many others have noted&#x02014;is the confusion of defecation with reading; it is hard to say which is meant by the word "column," or whether "It did not move or touch him" refers to the story or his leavings. In any case, the thing to notice is just how sensuous the whole experience is for Bloom. He plays at restraining and yielding as if it were a courtship&#x02014;and then gushes at its success ("So. 

<b></b>

Ah!"). Bloom's counting house may be full of mouldy limewash, but that doesn't stop him from imagining himself in the role of the king.
</p>

<p>
After finishing the story and his business, Bloom wipes himself with the newspaper, picks up his pants and buttons them, before emerging "from the gloom into the air" . The one thing he doesn't do is flush. After all, a jakes is not a toilet, though that should have been obvious all along. Toilets belong to a different space altogether&#x02014;less cracked and wooden and more polished and industrial. In particular, they belonged at that technological fantasyscape convened at the Crystal Palace exhibition in 1851, which did in fact house the first public toilets.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>  Had he lived in London, Bloom would likely have ended his story with a flush, since, by 1904, the toilet had overrun the outhouse in much of England. So if famed nineteenth-century toilet engineer George Jennings is right, and "the civilization of a people can be measured by their domestic and sanitary appliances," then <i>Ulysses</i> says something damning about Irish civilization&#x02014;with its jakes and its open sewers.<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
But, then, Joyce did not think it was damning. Quite the opposite. He thought the obsessive industrialization of waste disposal the surest sign of cultural perversity. Hence Professor MacHugh's joke about the Romans:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: <i>It is meet to be here. Let us build an altar to Jehovah</i>. The Roman, like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set his foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession. He gazed about him in his toga and he said: <i>It is meet to be here. Let us construct a watercloset</i>.

<p class="noIndent">
"Our old ancient ancestors . . . were partial to the running stream," is Lenehan's response. And if Bloom's and Stephen's simultaneous urinations are any guide, the new modern Dubliners still are.<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Joyce was not the only artist treading this ground in the late War years. Duchamp's infamous <i>Fountain</i> (i.e. urinal) was first rejected in April 1917, about the time that Joyce began writing <i>Ulysses</i> in earnest.<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  It, too, uses the toilet (or a near relation) as an index of artistic and technological madness, the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of one or the other, if not both. As Duchamp put it, in a way that MacHugh and Joyce would have understood perfectly, "The only works of art America has produced are her plumbing and her bridges."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
To my mind, though, the most incisive account comes from Ernst Bloch's 1918 <i>Spirit of Utopia</i>. Bloch uses the re of the machine to describe both the modern obsession with technology and the modern obsession with toilets:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
It knew, the machine, how to make everything as lifeless and subhuman on a small scale as our newer urban developments are on a larger scale. Its real objective is the bathroom and the toilet, these most indisputable and original accomplishments of our time, just as Rococo furniture and Gothic cathedrals represent structures that define every other art object of their respective epochs. Now <i>lavatoriality</i> [Abwaschbarkeit] dominates; somehow, water runs from every wall, and even the most expensive products of our age's 

<b></b>

industrial diligence now partake of the wizardry of modern sanitation, the <i>a priori</i> of the finished industrial product.<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
The toilet, according to Bloch, is the telos of capitalism, the "real objective" of all technology. Everything moves towards the bathroom, with an inertia worthy of the name <i>lavatoriality</i>. It is a great word&#x02014;lavatoriality&#x02014;not only for this particular capitalist complex, but also for <i>Ulysses</i>.<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  That is because, in <i>Ulysses</i>, it is not just waste that matters but also evacuation. Bloom sits on the jakes not in order to remind us that everyone does&#x02014;as in so much scatological literature&#x02014;but rather to remind us of a pre-technologized way of life <i>that is not just being repressed but actually effaced</i>. If the toilet prevails, people may never shit like Bloom again, and may never know the sensuousness that he finds amidst the jakes of Dublin. So while the toilet belongs to the sanitized world of London capital, the jakes belongs to the sensuous world of Joyce's Dublin.<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
When toilets do appear in <i>Ulysses</i>&#x02014;and there are a few&#x02014;they have nothing to do with waste disposal. At one point Patrick Dignam, restored to life in a satiric s&#x000E9;ance, tells us that "he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as t&#x00101;l&#x00101;f&#x00101;&#x000F1;a, &#x00101;l&#x00101;v&#x00101;t&#x00101;r, h&#x00101;t&#x00101;k&#x00101;ld&#x00101;, w&#x00101;t&#x00101;kl&#x00101;s&#x00101;t" &#x02014;the joke, of course, being a confusion of the spiritual with the technological. The most these spirits can look forward to is electricity and indoor plumbing&#x02014;rather, than, say eternal bliss.
</p>

<p>
The more interesting example, however, comes from Molly and her memory of a visit to "Dr. Collins for womens diseases." As part of his diagnosis, Collins asks her about her stool, which prompts the following rumination:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not . . .
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<div class="attribution">
<!--_attribution-->
(633&#x02013;4)
<!--_/attribution-->
</div>

<p class="noIndent">
Molly is reluctant to describe her stool to the doctor&#x02014;threatens, in fact, to give him a closer look than he really needs by way of a good smathering. Then, "by the way," she praises the toilet as a "nice invention." And finally, remembering how she used Milly's stool as a diagnostic aid, she acknowledges that "theres something in it"&#x02014;"it," I take it, being both the doctor's questioning and the stool itself. The toilet affords some privacy, but at a cost.
</p>

<p>
The toilet affords something else, though&#x02014;and this is what makes the passage so rich. It affords a new kind of pleasure; you just have to learn to misuse it. For her part, Molly likes to lower herself into the toilet and flush, to feel the prickly spray of the swirling water. There is something so charming about that idea; with a bit of irreverence 

<b></b>

the toilet becomes a secret pleasure-chamber, a private fountain for our most delicate parts. In any case, her fondness for the toilet clearly has nothing to do with sanitation or cleanliness or invisibility&#x02014;all those things which drive lavatoriality. Even when there are toilets in Dublin, they are still not used for flushing. Molly has found a way to strip the toilet of its technological aura and restore its materiality&#x02014;and its delights. As with Bloom's jakes, what matters for Molly is the sensuousness of it all; the pins and needles is to her what the game of restraint and release is for him. To borrow from Bloom, it is just so "Ah!," which, in a word, is why <i>Ulysses</i> is set in Dublin.
</p>

<p>
Joyce's Dublin is a place that still values pre-capitalist pleasures, and it is a place that still knows how to misuse capitalism for pleasure&#x02014;think of Molly's toilet, or Bloom wiping himself with a prize story, or Bloom and Gerty's reenactment of a dime novel. This is not a city driven by efficiency or enslaved to technology. Who, among Joyce's characters, lives to work? They live to drink, to sing, to gossip, to argue, to think, to scheme, and to flirt with sexual dalliance.<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  When they do work, their work has a largely pre-industrial character: waiters waiting, apothecaries mixing, butchers chopping, newsboys hawking, milkmaids delivering, Stephen teaching, and of course, Bloom chasing down editors. Capitalism has not yet remade the city in its image, even if it has made inroads everywhere. There are still no factories, no department stores, and above all, no toilets.<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  Lavatoriality, that drive to claim the bathroom for capitalism, is nowhere to be found. The British, like the Romans, have their waterclosets, but the Dubliners in <i>Ulysses</i> prefer something more sensuous. Indeed, there is no more fit image for Joyce's Dublin than Bloom in the jakes. It captures both the vestigial nature of Dublin and the pleasure Dublin takes in being vestigial.
</p>

<p>
If Bloom is <i>l'homme moyen sensuel</i>, then Dublin is <i>la ville moyenne sensuelle</i>. And, like Bloom, it is really equal parts <i>sensuelle</i> and <i>moyenne</i>, a place of everyday pleasures but also of deep mundaneness. Dublin is a city whose lack of advancement befits it for mundane pleasures&#x02014;as opposed to the more rarified delights of "t&#x00101;l&#x00101;f&#x00101;&#x000F1;a, &#x00101;l&#x00101;v&#x00101;t&#x00101;r, h&#x00101;t&#x00101;k&#x00101;ld&#x00101;, w&#x00101;t&#x00101;kl&#x00101;s&#x00101;t." It is a city that revels in its backwardness and that opens itself to the pleasures of decline (and anti-lavatoriality). What we have, then, are two interlaced answers to our two interlaced questions. First: Why Dublin? Because it is a city whose protracted economic decline has made it susceptible to serving as Joyce's Dublin. Second: Why Joyce's Dublin? Because in Joyce's fictionalization, that decline reveals possibilities&#x02014;of immediacy, of sensuousness, of development, and perhaps of <i>being</i>&#x02014;that advancement forecloses. Dublin matters because it expresses the relation between decline and possibility, because it reveals the degree to which only coarseness can make us more sensuously, and more fully, human.<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
This is one way to resolve the particular with the universal, not by finding the most typical instance but the most germane. Here Dublin is less an image <i>of</i> the world than an image <i>for</i> the world. It is universal not because it looks like everywhere else&#x02014;after all, it has no toilets&#x02014;but because it makes not having toilets seem like a universal imperative. That fact that there is so much local detail does not prevent the book from taking on a universal character; local detail is what gives it that character. Not flushing away its waste&#x02014;reveling, instead, in the bare materiality of local life&#x02014;is what allows 

<b></b>

Dublin to become a repository for untapped human possibilities. Put differently, Dublin can serve as the gateway to the universal because it knows something that the world once knew and now needs to relearn: how to enjoy emptying.<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>

The Real Myths of Modernist Style

<p class="noIndent">
There are other facets to the particular/universal problem in <i>Ulysses</i>&#x02014;other than geography and the local/global. And it is time to leave Dublin behind and move from questions about the setting of <i>Ulysses</i> to questions about its style. But before I do that, I want to add something to my earlier account of the relation between Dublin and Joyce's Dublin. So far, I have said two things: 1) Joyce's Dublin is not Dublin; 2) Joyce's Dublin makes no sense without Dublin. Those two points are rather generic; they describe the relation between any given historical city and its fictional image. The third point is far more specific: 3) <i>Ulysses</i> goes to heroic lengths to make Joyce's Dublin seem identical to Dublin; it actively confuses the fictional with the real.
</p>

<p>
Joyce, himself, seems to have indulged that confusion, as we know from the accounts of friends like Frank Budgen:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
To see Joyce at work on the Wandering Rocks was to see an engineer at work with compass and slide-rule, a surveyor with theodolite and measure chain . . . [Joyce wrote the episode] with a map of Dublin before him on which were traced in red ink the paths of the Earl of Dudlee and Father Conmee. He calculated to a minute the time necessary for his characters to cover a given distance of the city.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
It is a wonderful image that Budgen paints&#x02014;a portrait of the artist that finally discloses what it means to pare one's fingernails. This is Joyce at his most meticulous and most obsessive: using map, compass, and stopwatch to ensure that his fictional Dublin conforms in every physical way to the city of his birth&#x02014;when of course, he is free to place Bohemia on the coast or Cortez in the Pacific. But Joyce wanted something else, something for which even the term realism may not be adequate.

"I want," he had said earlier to Budgen, "to give a picture of Dublin so complete that if the city one day suddenly disappeared from the earth it could be reconstructed out of my book."<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Why we should want that from a novel&#x02014;when we could get it from a map or a survey&#x02014;I am not sure. And in the end, <i>Ulysses</i> does not give it to us; there are errors of commission and errors of omission alike. To take one of a number of examples that may or may not matter, the Dalkey tram that Almidano Artifoni hails and misses in the <i>Cyclops</i> episode did not run in 1904.<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In another book this kind of slip might be called a contrivance, but in <i>Ulysses</i> it really does feel like an error, because the emphasis on the mimetic is so painstaking. There are more street names, more businesses, more public houses, more government buildings, more statues, more policemen, and more people than in any prior novel&#x02014;all of them mappable and legibly interrelated. There is also more mundaneness than ever before: more eating, drinking, masturbation, bathing, idle chatter, random encounters, 

<b></b>

gossip, shopping, and fatigue. Even the vaunted stream of consciousness method has a realist flavor&#x02014;psychological realism being the favored phrase. It heralds a new, more invasive, brand of realism: an X-ray as opposed to a mirror.<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  These kinds of things are hard to quantify, and perhaps it is too much to say that <i>Ulysses</i> is more realist than its predecessors. What can be said, though, is that it contains more unplotted detail than its predecessors. It is more vulgar&#x02014;more detailist&#x02014;than any prior realism.
</p>

<p>
It is also, however, more mythological than any prior realism&#x02014;indeed perhaps more mythological than any realism can be. <i>Ulysses</i>, remember, is a rewriting of the <i>Odyssey</i>&#x02014;a modern myth. "In <i>Ulysses</i>," Joyce once said, "I have tried to keep close to fact"&#x02014;a claim that is only as true as it is absurd.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  The title, <i>Ulysses</i>, could not be further from the world of fact; it belongs to a different world altogether. The more precise thing to say is that <i>Ulysses</i> tries to keep close to fact <i>and to the Odyssey</i>. It is as unabashedly mythological as it is tenaciously detailist.
</p>

<p>
At least on the surface, however, realism and mythical method are patently contradictory. Realism imitates the bare facticity and pervasive contingency of everyday life; it opens itself to chance, arbitrariness, and in the extreme case, insignificance (e.g. Bloom mentioning to Lenehan that he could throw away the newspaper, Stephen and Bloom being both dressed in mourning black, Molly thinking that Bloom wants breakfast in bed). And though there is something artificial about this realist arbitrariness&#x02014;it is everywhere staged by authorial design&#x02014;the patina of contingency remains. In realism, it always seems that what happens could also have failed to happen.
</p>

<p>
That is not true of myth. Mythological worlds don't develop; they merely unfold&#x02014;according to the pattern established by the myth itself, as opposed to the whims and choices of individual characters (e.g. Bloom could not have ended up in a public lavatory, as Richard Aldington predicted during the novel's serialization. He was destined to make it home). In mythical method, what happens is what had to happen. More precisely, what happens is what has already happened and whose happening the new text is attempting to reproduce. To the extent, then, that <i>Ulysses</i> borrows its structure from Homeric myth, it undermines its own realist contingencies. And vice versa.
</p>

<p>
Yet, despite their apparent incompatibility, realism and myth coexist in <i>Ulysses</i>.<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  Joyce's text, as I said before, is only as realist as it is mythological. It treats things as things, and in the very same breath treats things as types. How that is possible is the real question&#x02014;and actually, the same question that we have been tracing all along: how does <i>Ulysses</i> reconcile the particular (mere things) with the universal (enduring myths), how does it manage to treat <i>this</i> and <i>everything</i>?
</p>

<p>
Before we move ahead, though, with this consideration of <i>Ulysses'</i> style, and before we try to resolve the paradox of mythical realism, it is worth pausing over the one solution we have already found: some particulars (Dublin) open into the universal (every place) precisely insofar as they exploit the mereness of their particularity. What matters about Dublin is the pleasure it takes in decline, the sensuous possibilities that appear when life itself has been stripped not just of toilets but of all the technological perversity they imply. One way to extrapolate from Dublin would be to say that what allows the particular to cross into the universal is a certain way of being denuded; the particular 

<b></b>

can become universal only if it is sufficiently bare. If that is right, then the thing to say about Joyce's style is that his realism can be mythical if it, too, is properly bare.
</p>

<p>
The best place to see this is in Joyce's catalogs&#x02014;that most numbing of his stylistic innovations. As an exemplar, consider just the final section of the paean to water in <i>Ithaca</i>, which follows the question: "What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier, returning to the range, admire?":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
. . . its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe), numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Not only is this a catalog, it is a catalog of catalogs; it is a list whose elements, often enough, are themselves new lists, as in "its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts" and so on. Like so many of Joyce's catalogs, this one works by piling things up until they cease to seem like things, until they add up to something more than a mere sum of parts. To put it more mundanely, it works by making us stop reading.
</p>

<p>
Reading through a Joyce catalog is an excruciating task, rather like drowning. The elements are so capricious, so haphazard, that no single item ever seems significant. Instead, they seem arbitrary and unworthy of careful scrutiny. It does not help that these insignificant elements are also abstruse, and often demand some further investigation. What, for example, is a minch? Or the difference between a lacustrine marsh, a pestilential fen, and a stagnant pool? Could it possibly matter? Even if it does matter, does it matter enough to justify putting <i>Ulysses</i> aside and consulting an encyclopedia or a textbook on environmental science? Probably not. Unfortunately, though, the same is true for every item in the list. They all require more attention than they can repay, which is what makes the catalogs so difficult to read in the first place: it never seems worth it.
</p>

<p>
But that is just the point. The catalogs actively frustrate reading. They demand, in a word, to be skimmed&#x02014;if not skipped altogether. And, what is more, not only do we skip over large chunks of the catalogs, we think we know what we are skipping. To not read&#x02014;to skim&#x02014;is to treat the elements in the catalog as if they were already known, already situated in a meaningful context. Once we have red out what the list is about, we can safely skim to the end. You do not have to know the difference between a marsh and a fen to know that what Bloom appreciates about water is its malleability and its endless potentiality. In some crude sense, that is all the catalog signifies, or all that we as readers can make of it. And it is when we make that extrapolation&#x02014;when we 

<b></b>

treat the unread as if it were known&#x02014;that we pass from the particular to the universal. Skimming is the proof that what had been just a heap of particulars has come to seem more like instances of a greater whole.
</p>

<p>
As predicted, in other words, what makes us skim our way from the world of particularity to the world of universals is the mereness of particularity. It is because Joyce's catalogs are composed of elements at once trivial and refractory that they encourage skimming. The more evocative way to put it would be to say that in Joyce's catalogs particularity has become so dense&#x02014;burdened with an abstruseness far beyond any possible relevance&#x02014;that it explodes into the universal.
</p>

<p>
Not all of Joyce's catalogs work this way, however. Whereas, in the paean to water, skimming means treating things as if they were already known, it can be that skimming means treating things not as if they were known but as if they were unknowable. In those cases, we skim when we realize that we cannot make the extrapolation to the universal. The list of "Irish heroes and heroines of antiquity" from the <i>Cyclops</i> episode provides a good example:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

<p class="noIndent">
It starts out alright, but it is not long before this list of Irish kings and rebels degenerates into satiric motley. Dante Alighieri and Christopher Columbus most definitely do not belong. But even they have a better claim than the Rose of Castile or the Woman Who Didn't&#x02014;at least they are real historical res.
</p>

<p>
The same reading problems apply: how much do you need to know about Mother Maccabee or the plot of <i>The Woman Who Did </i>in order to get the joke? Not much, I imagine, and certainly no more than you need to know about fens and minches. Insignificance and abstruseness seem to be mixed in the same ratio as before. The difference is that in this case we cannot extrapolate because there is no unifying theme, certainly nothing so immediately recognizable as the idea of potentiality was before. There is no universal category that can compass all of these particulars. And if we skim nonetheless, it is not because we have intuited the organizing principle, but rather because we have intuited that there is no organizing principle. What the list <i>is</i> can only be described in terms of what it <i>is not</i>. And once we have red out that it is <i>not</i> a list of Irish heroes and heroines&#x02014;that it is a list that <i>mistakes itself for </i>a list of Irish heroes and heroines&#x02014;all we can do is skim the remainder and enjoy the occasional pleasure of glimpsing a Lady Godiva or a Brian Confucius. The list of things doesn't become a category, as in the catalog of water. Instead, it destroys a category, empties 

<b></b>

it out one heaping exaggeration at a time. To pick up on the image I used before, this time particularity has become so dense that it implodes into nothingness. The catalog simply piles things up until nothing is left.
</p>

<p>
There are, in other words, two kinds of catalogs&#x02014;for ease of reference we could call them totalizing catalogs and chaotic catalogs. Neither kind can be easily read (they are both composed of elements as trivial as they are esoteric.) But they nonetheless function in different ways. Totalizing catalogs, like the paean to water, integrate their elements into a legible whole; what they list are the attributes of some higher order unity. Chaotic catalogs, on the other hand, undermine the very idea of unity; instead, they collapse into a formless mass of details. These two types of catalogs, the totalizing and the chaotic, stand in for two versions of <i>Ulysses</i>. One, that its daily Dublin day is also every day, that somehow all the things and elements are integrated into a meaningful whole. Two, that the vertigo of <i>Ulysses</i> prevents it from amounting to anything other than a chaos of details. Either the particulars explode into the universal or they collapse into a heap.
</p>

<p>
Judging from the catalog of Irish heroes, it is fair to say that <i>Ulysses</i> flirts with chaos as often as it flirts with totality; dissolution is as much a part of its fabric as is universality. We have already seen one other example of this, namely its style. The tension between dissolution and universality is neatly mirrored in the tension between realism and myth. Realism, as I said before, is the genre of chance, contingency, and the bare facticity of material life. It tends to weigh things down, to make them less susceptible to abstraction and more resolutely particular. Its elements belong with those of the chaotic catalog, too dense and too arbitrary to be universalized. Myth, of course, has the opposite effect. It integrates all things into its structure of signification. And in that sense its elements are more fit for the totalizing catalog.
</p>

<p>
All of which returns us to our original questions: Is <i>Ulysses</i> realist or mythical? Is it a chaos of particularity or does it brush against the universal? The disembodied catechist of <i>Ithaca</i> asks the same question, only this time about Bloom:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
What universal binomial denominations would be his as entity and nonentity? 
<p class="blockquote">
Assumed by any or known to none. Everyman or Noman.

<div class="attribution">

</div>

<p class="noIndent">
Notice the shift in conjunctions: entity <i>and</i> nonentity becomes Everyman <i>or</i> Noman. We have seen Bloom on the jakes, and we have seen him reigning over a New Bloomusalem. We have seen him as Elijah and we have seen him as the "aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic pauper" . And the question now is, what does that mean for Bloom? Does it make him a nonentity? Or is being a nonentity just another way of being an entity? Is he still a mythical Everyman or is he just another anonymous modern Noman?<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Or is he perhaps both? And if both, how? What is the status of this character that can channel Odysseus and yet be pummeled with "decomposed vegetable missiles" ? And what can it tell us about the status of his book, and about its style?

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
As it turns out, <i>Ulysses</i> alone cannot answer these questions. Instead, we have to look both at <i>Ulysses</i> and at high modernism. The answers, in other words, have to do not just with the structure of Joyce's text but with the structure of thought that nurtured it. The peculiar thing about high modernism is that it doesn't treat Everyman and Noman as alternatives; it knits them together. And the same could be said about totality and chaos: they are not antithetical so much as copresent. Being a high modernist means never having to choose. The nearest example is Joyce's own etymology for Odysseus, which he took to be a combination of Outis, meaning nobody and Zeus, meaning god.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>  The two fit together effortlessly, and in a form that Bloom can then inherit. If Odysseus can be a nobody and a god, then Bloom can be an Everyman and a Noman, an Elijah who defecates.
</p>

<p>
It is easy enough to multiply examples of this kind from Joyce's work. There is the familiar: "am I walking into eternity along Sandymount strand?"  and the less familiar "they creepycrawl after Blake's buttocks into eternity" . There is Mulligan's claim&#x02014;about a bottle of Bass&#x02014;that "Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the incorruptible eon of the gods"  and Stephen's claim that he is "a conscious rational reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void" . Each is an affirmation of the proximity of the mundane and the eternal, even if each imagines that connection in slightly different terms (Stephen thinks they are connected by a void and Mulligan thinks every site is a potential joint.) Everywhere, the universal is brought into communication with the everyday. What <i>Ulysses</i> does is give expression to this strange proximity of the eternal with sand, of realism with myth, or of the particular with the universal.
</p>

<p>
What <i>Ulysses</i> does <i>not</i> do is explain that proximity. It offers no logical explanation, and indeed no mystical explanation either. And the reason it offers no such explanation is that there are no such explanations to be found. There is no theory, no intellectual answer to the questions we have been asking all along: How can <i>Ulysses</i> be both realist and mythical? How can Bloom be Noman and Everyman? How does the novel manage to be both painstakingly particular and unabashedly universal? <i>Ulysses</i> doesn't treat these questions as intellectual problems, to be resolved by way of Hegelian dialectics or theosophic mysticism or Catholic transubstantiation. It treats them, instead, as problems that can only be resolved aesthetically. The strange proximity of the particular and the universal is possible because high modernism makes it possible. <i>Ulysses</i> can be particular and universal because high modernism means <i>the aesthetic reconciliation of material particularity with the universal by way of chaos</i>.
</p>

<p>
Sweeping though it may be, this description of high modernism captures the most distinctive, and most fundamental, aesthetic principle of the movement as a whole. If we look at high modernism as a constellation of artistic practices, then the gravitational force holding that constellation together is the belief that material particularity opens into universality under the right aesthetic conditions. And the right condition, as far as the high modernists were concerned, is that the particular be sufficiently denuded. If the work of art can reduce things to their most vulgar, least interrelated, and most meaningless form, then they will explode into everything. Or simply, the closer you get to chaos, the surer your path to totality.

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
To help make sense of this strange relation, I want to juxtapose two accounts of high modernist method: one from Walter Benjamin and one from T. J. Clark.
</p>

<p>
Benjamin, first, is the contemporary who theorized modernism most vividly and also the one who did the most to justify it philosophically. His description of its method begins, however, not with modernism proper but with its fore-history, which he traced back to the baroque <i>Trauerspiel</i>:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
That which lies here in ruins, the highly significant fragment, the remnant, is, in fact, the finest material in baroque creation. For it is common practice in the literature of the baroque to pile up fragments ceaselessly, without any strict idea of a goal, and, in the unremitting expectation of a miracle, to take the repletion of stereotypes for a process of intensification. The baroque writers must have regarded the work of art as just such a miracle.<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
The fragment, for Benjamin, is the material of miracles. If the fragments that you find can be piled up without purpose, something miraculous may stir. As long, that is, as the fragments are utterly fragmented (lying in ruins), and as long as their arrangement foregrounds their fragmentariness (being without purpose) then the work of art can approach what Benjamin later calls resurrection.
</p>

<p>
And if this is true of the <i>Trauerspiel</i>, it is only more so of the high modernist aesthetic that the <i>Trauerspiel</i> prered. Modernism, too, builds its monuments with fragments. Benjamin had something like that in mind, but here Clark's makes it explicit:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
For surely transcendence in modernism can only be achieved&#x02014;is not this central to our whole sense of the movement's wager?&#x02014;by way of absolute immanence and contingency, through a deep and ruthless materialism, by a secularization (a 'realization') of transcendence&#x02014;an absorption in the logic of form . . . modernism was <i>already</i> that dissolution and disabusal&#x02014;but exactly a dissolution held in dialectical tension with the idea or urge to totality, which idea or impulsion <i>alone gave the notion of dissolution</i> (or emptying, or ascesis, or fragment, or mere manufacture, or reduction, or deadpan, or non-identity) <i>sense</i>.<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
All these modernist hallmarks&#x02014;emptying and ascesis and reduction and non-identity and fragment&#x02014;do the same kind of aesthetic work, the work that Clark calls dissolution and that I have been calling chaos. The fact that he refers to it as a process (dissolution) while I refer to it as a thing (chaos) is itself telling, because what matters here is the combination of the two: the act of reduction and the stuff that results, fragmentation and its fragments. Picking just one term, however, is less important that recognizing their shared function, which is to open a back door to the universal: transcendence is only possible by way of absolute immanence; dissolution only makes sense when paired with resolution; and chaos belongs with totality. These forces are sealed together not by an intellectual theory but only by the artworks themselves. Dissolution, as Clark has it, empties the world into fragments, but if the fragments are heaped together in as conspicuously arbitrary a way as Benjamin describes then they may explode into everything. That alchemy is what lies at the heart of the modernist aesthetic. 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
As examples, think of the fragments that Eliot shores in his <i>Waste Land</i>, of the thin film of images in Pound's fourth canto, of the mere anarchy that signals revelation in Yeats' <i>Second Coming</i>, or of Lily Bart's answer to the meaning of life ("in the midst of chaos there was shape"). In each, you find the quintessential high modernist method: courting fragmentation so as to overcome it. Totality emerges through chaos, and the universal peers through heaps of mere particulars. Modernists break things up in order to find new wholes. You can see it not just in the British literary tradition but throughout European modernism. In Marinetti and Picasso, in Malevich and in Kafka, you find the same mad method: to fragment and fracture and dis integrate, not in order to reassemble but so as to reveal a truth that only fractured objects can reveal. That is the majesty of modernist art: its ability to produce fullness by emptying.<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>  Modernism generates what Joyce playfully called chaosmos.
</p>

<p>
It is only by way of this alchemy that we can answer the questions we've been pursuing all along: the questions about Dublin's uniqueness, about the conflict between realism and myth, and about the relation between the two types of catalogs. This approach does not, I should say, provide a final answer to any of them. But it does offer a set of historically-bounded answers, answers that make sense of a modernist <i>Ulysses</i>, but that suffice for only as long as the assumptions of modernism themselves suffice.
</p>

<p>
The best place from which to craft a response is back on the toilet, this time not with Bloom but rather by way of Wyndham Lewis' accidentally apt response to <i>Ulysses</i>&#x02014;written, incidentally, as part of his assault on modernism:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
It is like a gigantic Victorian quilt or anti-macassar. Or it is the voluminous curtain that fell, belated (with the alarming momentum of a ton or two of personally organized rubbish), upon the Victorian scene. So rich was its delivery, its pent-up outpouring so vehement, that it will remain, eternally cathartic, a monument like a record diarrhoea.<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Lewis saw <i>Ulysses</i> as the supreme waste product of Victorian culture, rubbish heap and jakes in one. Everything that was distinctive in Victorian life, Joyce turned into indistinguishable dross. Lewis's word for that is diarrhea. And it is a perfectly good word if what you want to describe is a state absolutely lacking in distinction, or that which is closest to formless stuff. We know, however, that diarrhea means something different in Joyce's Dublin than in Lewis's London. A record diarrhea would fit nicely beside Bloom's story about how he "attained the point of greatest altitude" in a high school pee-off . So long as we are within the context of <i>Ulysses</i> and high modernism, being formless dross means being closest to the universal. Indeed, it is because <i>Ulysses</i> is a diarrhea that it can be universal. In <i>Ulysses</i> the world is reduced to the barest, most fragmented particulars, but those bare, fragmented particulars are the ones that approach the universal. That was true of Dublin and it is true of the book as a whole. Bloom on the jakes is just one re for that, for a city made universal because it is still in touch with its material waste&#x02014;more in touch, in fact, because its decline has made that materiality newly palpable.
</p>

<p>
The catalogs provide yet another re. I suggested before that they stand in for two versions of <i>Ulysses</i>, but that is not quite right. <i>Ulysses</i> does not resemble one catalog or 

<b></b>

the other; it resembles both. Indeed, it is the impossible proximity of these two types of catalogs that makes <i>Ulysses</i>. Only together do they fully embody the alchemy of Joyce's text, its ability to court chaos and produce totality. In the same way, it is only together that realism and myth make sense. Tempting as it may be to think of <i>Ulysses</i> in realist terms&#x02014;and tempted as Joyce was to give his novel unprecedented exactitude&#x02014;the text is not realist but modernist. Realism is not the end but only the means. Through exacting realism, <i>Ulysses</i> reveals the mereness of the world; it dissolves things into bare things and symbols into isolated fragments. But it is only in that denuded form that Joyce's things can take on mythological significance.
</p>

<p>
All of these answers are variants on a single theme: Dublin can be everywhere because it exploits the sensuous possibilities of its decline; Bloom can be Everyman because he is the commonest type of Noman; and <i>Ulysses</i> can be mythical because its realism is sufficiently vulgar. In the most general terms, <i>Ulysses</i> can be universal not in spite of its particularity but only because its particularity is properly bare.
</p>

<p>
As glibly paradoxical as that might sound, it is just not possible to find a more intellectually satisfying answer. In fact, any answer that was more intellectually satisfying would belie the deep and powerful illogic of the modernist aesthetic. If <i>Ulysses </i>has a particular/universal alchemy rather than a particular/universal logic, it is hardly because it failed to meet the demands of logic; rather, it is because no logic could meet the demands of its art. In the end, <i>Ulysses</i> manages to be both particular and universal because it participated in an aesthetic that buried the universal in the mire. Such is the structure of art we call modernist; only through relentless emptying does art reveal new wholes. But the fact that Joyce and his peers found totality at the edge of chaos does not make their work paradoxical, only epistemic. So long as the alchemy of high modernism holds, so too does this particular/universal character of <i>Ulysses</i>.

If modernism had succeeded in finding the aesthetic conditions of chaosmos and in producing totality through a heap of fragments, then these answers would still be ours and the kind of resurrection Benjamin hoped for might already have come. As it happens, though, the alchemy of high modernism cannot hold. The proximity of fragmentation and transcendence which defined their episteme no longer defines ours. And without that aesthetic resolution, <i>Ulysses </i>really does feel like a mere paradox: part chaos and part totality, part realism and part myth&#x02013;without any resolution in sight. Today, then, the question that remains for <i>Ulysses</i> is simple: do we try to restart modernism in hopes of reopening the back door to the universal? Or do we try to re out how just to read this book called <i>Ulysses</i>.

This might not seem like much of a question, given Joyce's lifelong intimacy with the city he never quite left behind. But there is really nothing inevitable about the choice of Dublin. Conrad did not spend his life writing about his native Poland. And the same can be said of Pound and Eliot. The Dublinness of <i>Ulysses</i> is as much a question of narrative function as of authorial biography.

When he began writing <i>Dubliners</i> in 1904, Joyce described Dublin as "that hemoplegia or paralysis which many consider a city." Quoted from Ellmann, 163.

This is how Fredric Jameson describes it: "So in that great village which is Joyce's Dublin, Parnell is still an anecdote about a hat knocked off, picked up and returned, not yet a television image nor even a name in a newspaper; and by the same token, as in the peasant village itself, the ostensibly private or personal&#x02014;Molly's infidelities, or Mr Bloom's urge to discover how far the Greek sculptors went in portraying the female anatomy&#x02014;all these things are public too, and the material for endless gossip and anecdotal transmission."

The origin of this little joke seems to be H.G. Wells' generally favorable review of <i>Portrait</i>, which incidentally accused Joyce of harboring a "cloacal obsession." Anticipating MacHugh, Joyce responded: "Why, it's Wells's countrymen who build water-closets wherever they go." Part of what the incident suggests, of course, is that <i>Portrait</i> piqued its readers in much the same way that <i>Ulysses</i> would five years later. And it is worth mentioning at this point&#x02014;by way of preration&#x02014;that another <i>Portrait</i> reviewer felt that Joyce "would be really at his best in a treatise on drains."

For one thing, it articulates the difference between Joyce and the other famed scatological authors: Rabelais, Cervantes, Swift, et al. Joyce's scatology belongs not only to some broad discourse on the irreducible or trans-historical truths of the body but also to a particular dynamic of early twentieth-century capitalism, the one Bloch calls <i>lavatoriality</i>. For an example of that trans-historical discourse, see Bakhtin, Mikhail, <i>Rabelais and his World</i>, Trans. Helene Iswolsky, (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1968).

When Richard Aldington sat down to review the as yet unfinished book in 1921, he made the following glib prediction: "Logically, I see no end to <i>Ulysses</i> except the suicide of Bloom, though no doubt it will terminate in the pleasant purlieus of a public lavatory." He was, of course, wrong on both counts; though Molly does spend a good portion of the final pages seated on her chamber pot, a chamber pot is hardly a lavatory. Still, what is interesting about his claim, and about the reviews more generally, is the degree to which they sensed not just the scatology but in fact the anti-lavatoriality of <i>Ulysses</i>&#x02014;its resistance to the technological imperialism of the toilet. Aldington, Richard, "The Influence of Mr. James Joyce," <i>English Review</i>, April 1921, 337.

One could argue that this is true of most novels; work is rarely an explicit topic. But then, most novels solve this problem by choosing their characters from the upper echelons of society. Where that isn't the case&#x02014;as in Dickens or Zola&#x02014;people work. Only in Joyce's Dublin do the poor get to enjoy their leisure.

All of this, it must be said, is about Dublin <i>as we find it in Ulysses</i>. There were, in fact, factories in Dublin, not to mention slums and a host of other things Joyce didn't manage to include.

It should be clear now why the distinction between Dublin and Joyce's Dublin was necessary in the first place. The economic decline that Dublin experienced in the 19th century lends a certain plausibility to the sense of coarseness that Joyce's exploits. But as to whether Dubliners had a unique ability to revel in that coarseness, that is probably a function of nostalgia, distorted memories, and politico-literary necessity on Joyce's part. It is something that he brought to the city through his fiction.

To be fair, none of this rules out the possibility that <i>Ulysses</i> could be set elsewhere. After all, the fact that Dublin revels in its decline hardly precludes Brooklyn from doing the same&#x02014;especially if what matters is not actual reveling but some susceptibility to reveling in fiction. Still, there are some discriminations to be made. Yes, it could be set elsewhere, but the book would diverge from its present form to the degree that the new setting lacked the generic character of Dublin&#x02014;i.e., the entanglement of backwardness with sensuousness. This, I take it, explains why people who nominate alternate sites seem to gravitate towards underdeveloped cities near burgeoning metropolises&#x02014;the Bronx, Bradford, Jersey City&#x02014;namely because those kinds of cities already share something of Dublin's economic condition. By contrast, nobody seems to have suggested that <i>Ulysses</i> could be set in London. Bloom would never be able to shit there.

Robinson Crusoe would be another example. It has the same doubled structure as <i>Ulysses</i>: minutely detailed on the one hand and persistently allegorical on the other. As to how it manages to reconcile the two, the answer is completely different: not modernism but providence.

There is an added wrinkle here, since Noman is the name Odysseus uses to conceal his identity and escape from the Cyclops. Noman, we could say, is one of the modes of Everyman. But it is, to borrow from Adorno and Horkheimer, the one mode that already belongs to our bourgeois ad-man. See, in particular, the first excursus in Adorno, Theodor and Horkheimer, Max, <i>Dialectic of Enlightenment</i>, trans. John Cumming, (New York: Continuum, 2001).

As to the historical conditions that contributed to this redemptive vision of fragmentation, it is not enough to cite the experience of fragmentation in the early twentieth century. There is, no doubt, ample testimony to that fact, as for example Edmund Wilson's: "towards the breaking up of things, furthermore, all the forces of the time seemed to drive: life itself was anarchic and confused; even the unity of capitalism had collapsed." There is, however, a problem with this interpretation. The modernists were hardly the first to feel the fragmentation of everyday life. Wordsworth felt it, Carlyle felt it, Marx felt it, Dickens felt it, Baudelaire felt it&#x02014;indeed it is one of the most characteristic experiences of the social and economic transformation that usually comes under the heading of the industrial revolution. Only with high modernism, however, does the experience of fragmentation become the aesthetic basis for the overcoming of fragmentation.
