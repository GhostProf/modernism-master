Talking in the Cinema
<!--_/aHead-->
</h3>

<p class="noIndent">
The German novelist Gert Hofmann's <i>The Film Explainer</i>  is a semi-autobiographical account of Hofmann's grandfather, who was a film "lecturer" or "explainer" (and cinema pianist) in provincial Germany throughout the silent era and beyond. Finally made redundant in the early 1930s by the triumph of sound film, he defends his role to the cinema proprietor until the last: "I'm not superfluous. An audience needs someone to explain a film to them, at least its finer points. They have no idea what is contained in a film if you look at it closely, in every single shot. No, no, said Grandfather, that must be explained. Otherwise, it would be lost."<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>  He is finally routed by a screening of <i>The Jazz Singer</i> (which arrives in the village some years after its U.S. premiere): "After a while, the film started talking again. It explained itself . . . Ridiculous, all that talking! Who does that in real life, whispered Grandfather, I certainly don't, and everyone shouted: Quiet! You're being a nuisance, Hindenburg! . . . . Anyway, instead of sitting and listening quietly, Grandfather talked and commented his way though the first sound-film ever shown at the Apollo in Limbach" (<i>FE</i>, 82&#x02013;3).
</p>

<p>
As an increasing number of films start to talk, the grandfather retreats into silence. His "silent period" is broken by his attendance at local Nazi party meetings: "when the sound-film era began, I suddenly couldn't talk any more. I thought: There is no one left who is interested in your ideas. But now I'm talking again!" (<i>FE</i>, 177). In fact, what he wants to talk about are 

<b></b>

film-scenarios and a proposal for "the re-introduction of silent films in the context of national renewal" (<i>FE</i>, 179). In 1939, the old man is taken to Berlin with a local group to attend a Nazi rally, but, leaving his party and his veteran's flag behind, he slips into Berlin's empty Gloria Palais. "Then, before the film began &#x02013; my first and last film in Berlin&#x02014;said Grandfather&#x02014;I played my life as a cinemagoer to my inner eye, beginning with my very first picture. Some went by quickly, some slowly, some completely stopped" (<i>FE</i>, 226). The film he saw "and was to rave about until his death was of course <i>Gone with the Wind</i>"; returning to the rally, he listens to Hitler, while thinking about Scarlett O'Hara. Not long after this, he is killed in an explosion in the cinema in his home town.
</p>

<p>
The novel-memoir ends with these words:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Grandfather at seventy said: In the beginning was the light. The light was switched off. I stood in front of the screen, all alone. I looked into the audience. There weren't many of them there. I gave the signal <i>Go! </i>He said: In all the films of that time, even if they played indoors, it rained. That was because the films had been damaged by the fingers of the projectionists. We lined the gate with black velvet to slow the film. Even that damaged it. Also, they got old and worn. Grandfather took me by the hand. He said it wasn't the shaking projection that made everything tremble. Nor was it people's breathing. It was the heartbeat of the man who was supervising everything, the film explainer's, mine.

The writer on cinema, in its first decades, was a "film explainer" of a very particular kind. "Discourse about the cinema" was the phrase Christian Metz used in his account of cinema's "third machine," the sphere, additional to those of the industry and the spectator, of the <i>cinematic writer </i>(critic, historian, theoretician).<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>  Such discourse, inflected in very particular ways in the silent period, can, I would argue, be understood as a form of "talking in the cinema."
</p>

<p>
This is nicely literalized in the first English-language book of film theory, the American poet Vachel Lindsay's <i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i>, first published in 1915, and revised in 1922. In the revised version, Lindsay referred to a passage of his original text in which "I suggest suppressing the orchestra entirely and encouraging the audience to talk about the film."
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
No photoplay people have risen to contradict this theory, but it is a chapter that once caused me great embarrassment. With Christopher Morley, the well-known author of Shandygaff and other temperance literature, I was trying to prove out this chapter. As soon as the orchestra stopped, while the show rolled on in glory, I talked about the main points in this book, illustrating it by the film before us. Almost everything that happened was a happy illustration of my ideas. But there were two shop girls in front of us awfully in love with a certain second-rate actor who insisted on kissing the heroine every so often, and with her apparent approval. Every time we talked about that those shop girls glared at us as though we were robbing them of their time and money. Finally one of them dragged the other out into the aisle, and dashed out of the house with her dear chum, saying, so all could hear: "Well, come on, Terasa, we might as well go, if these two talking <i>pests</i> are going to keep this up behind us." The poor girl's voice trembled. She was in tears. She was 

<b></b>

gone before we could apologize or offer flowers. So I say in applying this chapter, in our present state of civilization, sit on the front seat, where no one can hear your whispering but Mary Pickford on the screen. She is but a shadow there, and will not mind.<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The story's gendered divide (the absorbed shop-girls and the running commentary of the men) bears an interesting relationship to the narratives of "talking in the cinema," in which a demotic <i>feminine</i> speech tends to operate as a model of distracted viewing.<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>  My present focus is on the ways in which the scene in Lindsay's text, too, is shadowed by the film lecturer or film explainer, who, in the early years of cinema, provided a spoken commentary to accompany films as they were projected. Film historians have discussed the continuities between the magic-lantern lecturer of the late nineteenth century and the moving picture commentator of the first years of cinema; early "film lectures" would indeed have included both lantern slides and moving pictures. In the U.S., film lecturing largely appears to have died out in the early 1910s with, as critics including Tom Gunning and Rick Altman have argued, functions previously filled by lectures now folded into narrative technique and an increasing use of intertitles.<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>  There would also have been a greater use of accompanying written material, including printed synopses, so that spectators would ideally be familiar with the outlines of the film narrative before the film; they would come to the theater, in the scenarist and early writer on film Epes W. Sargent's words, "with the facts predigested as it were and . . . ready for the silent running of the reel."<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Writers about cinema in its first decades inherited something of the role of the commentator on the unfolding action of the film. While narrative and explanatory functions relating to a specific film may have been transmuted into broader formal and aesthetic questions, early writers on film nonetheless retained a significant didactic role, pointing to ways of seeing appropriate to the new medium of film, and, as Altman has argued of early film lecturing, not so much <i>explaining</i> the visual as <i>redefining </i>the images according to an alternate set of rules (<i>SFS</i>, 71&#x02013;2). If, moreover, film required from spectators new visual and interpretative skills, it also seemed to demand that writers on the cinema find discursive strategies adequate to the new art and technology&#x02014;in particular, its powers of motion, its abilities to create a total (virtual) world in which, as Virginia Woolf was to write in her 1926 essay "The Cinema," "[w]e see life as it is when we have no part in it"&#x02014;and the intensity of its appeal to the eye.<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
From the writings of Henri Bergson onwards, the philosophy of film has been focused on the paradoxical relationship between the immobile image and the mobility of the projected film, in part as a way of theorizing consciousness and time consciousness, in particular. One of my concerns is with the ways in which this paradox&#x02014;of stasis and mobility&#x02014;was negotiated in the "talking about the cinema" of critics and theorists. <i>Photog&#x000E9;nie</i> was a key term for French film theorists of the 1910s and 1920s; it was variously described as a form of defamiliarization, as a seeing of ordinary things as for the first time, and as a temporal category, a sublime instant. The French avant-garde film-maker and theorist Jean Epstein wrote that "the value of the photogenic is measured in seconds," though what it flashes up also exists, he wrote, in an impossible 

<b></b>

or illusory time, that of the present:<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>  "The future 'I' is shed as 'I' past: the present is merely this instantaneous and perpetual sloughing. The present is merely an encounter. The cinema is the only art capable of depicting the present as it is."<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>  <i>Photog&#x000E9;nie</i> also became synonymous with screen or cinematic "beauty," a beauty of "the moment" or "the interval," glimpsed rather than held. As Louis Delluc wrote, in an article on "Beauty in the Cinema" : "For a long time, I have realized that the cinema was destined to provide us with impressions of evanescent eternal beauty, since it alone offers us the spectacle of nature and sometimes even the spectacle of real human activity."<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>  Issues of time, duration and movement were thus inextricably intertwined with aesthetic questions, and with attempts to define the specific aesthetic of the cinema, which was at times, as for Delluc, differentiated from the properties of the artwork, since its proclaimed abilities to capture reality were held to put it on the side of nature and life rather than that of art.
</p>

<p>
For the French art historian Elie Faure, writing on the art of cinema in the early 1920s, <i>photog&#x000E9;nie</i> was both shock or "commotion" and recognition: "The revelation of what the cinema of the future can be came to me one day: I retain an exact memory of it, of the commotion that I experienced when I observed, in a flash, the magnificence there was in the relationship of a piece of black clothing to the grey wall of an inn."<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>  Here the aesthetic of film is rendered as a form of visuality quite distinct from plot and narrative: the essence of film is pure image, and it inheres in the instant, "in a flash." Faure's account, however, produces a complex model of cinematic time and duration; the image is retained as an "exact memory," thus becoming, in effect, an "afterimage." There are echoes here of Goethe's <i>Theory of Colour, </i>in which afterimages are represented as "physiological colours":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
I had entered an inn towards evening, and, as a well-favoured girl, with a brilliantly fair complexion, black hair, and a scarlet bodice, came into the room, I looked attentively at her as she stood before me at some distance in half shadow. As she presently afterwards turned away, I saw on the white wall, which was now before me, a black face surrounded with a bright light, while the dress of the perfectly distinct re appeared of a beautiful sea-green.<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
Faure's account transmuted Goethe's colour theory into the monochromatic field of the film, and his eroticized vision into the metonymic purity of cloth and wall. Nonetheless, there is for both writers the perception that, in Mary Ann Doane's words, "the afterimage is accessible only through an experience of intensity, of dazzlement."<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
If on the one hand the model of <i>photog&#x000E9;nie</i> served to isolate a cinematic essence as a sublime instant, to extract the image from the flow, on the other "talking about the cinema" seemed to demand adequation to the "movement" or "motion" that also served to define the qualities of the new art of the film. The film critic Robert Herring's <i>Films of the Year 1927&#x02013;1928</i> (which appears strongly indebted to the pictorial criticism of Vachel Lindsay and Victor Freeburg, discussed later in this article) was a collection of stills aimed at providing "a permanent record" of those "striking scenes [that] flash across the screen for an instant and then remain only as a memory": "Movement 

<b></b>

is life," he writes, "and the cinema is the only art that can preserve this quality in its expression. Yet, for doing this, it suffers . . . . A film is projected at the rate of twenty-two pictures a second; much must be unnoticed, much must flash by before we have grasped its essence."<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>  The movement that defines cinema (as it comes so often to define modernity itself) is also a more fragile and unstable ephemerality that inheres at every level, from the fleeting nature of the projected images to the vagaries of cinematic exhibition. In Herring's words: "A movie is perhaps pre-released. It is then shown everywhere, at once, for a week. Then it is nowhere any more. If you are a day too late you may never see it again, unless you track it down to some village hall or find it by the seaside, drearily" (<i>FY</i>, 1). It was in substantial part the anxiety over the mutability of the medium and its exhibition which, from the 1920s onwards, led to the establishment of such institutional spaces for cinema as the film societies, the new film journals, and, in the 1930s, the first film archives. There are significant connections between these sites of cinematic culture, the conceptual, literary and philosophical understandings of the filmic medium, and theories of modernity more broadly.
</p>

<p>
Such connections were made explicit in a number of works on film art in the first decades of the twentieth century, as was the concern with the ways in which critical discourse could provide a satisfactory account of filmic movement and representation. Eric Elliott's 1928 study <i>Anatomy of Motion Picture Art</i> addressed directly the problems attendant upon writing about film. In Elliott's words, "the experience of one observer is necessarily limited. He may read a book at his convenience but a film, like time and tide, waits for no man, and passes out of existence even while he is dutifully engaged in making observation of another."<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>  A correlation, present in many other studies written in this period, existed between the ephemeral screen-image and the ephemeral film as a whole, linked in complex ways to the illusion of screen-motion itself, whereby still photographic images appear as moving ones. For Robert Herring, writing, like Elliott, about attempts to commit films to memory: "it is unsatisfying, and it does not tend towards critical balance, to sit in a state of suspense, waiting for one scene, trying to carry it away intact and probably being impressed by a new group and another pattern" (<i>FY</i>, 1).
</p>

<p>
"Coming to the fluent expressions possible in screen continuity," Elliott wrote, "one is at a loss how to explain in words the appeal they make." Verbal description, he argued, might not be "fully adequate to interpret the appeal of a painting," but "where there are accepted terms relating to the initiated a sense of the original impressions, there is none at all relating to the screen . . . Again, the film is not merely a succession of scenes that can be described separately and consecutively; it is not so much the individual expression as the expression of all combined that results in the cinematic effect" (<i>AMPA</i>, 49). Herring concurs: "The cinema places before us not a series of patterns one after the other, but a moving, flowing design" (<i>FY</i>, 4).
</p>

<p>
The problems, it would seem, were manifold and self-perpetuating. The absence of established terms for this new art meant that it eluded the critical grasp and gaze. As Herring wrote of the cinema: "The transience of its creation makes serious consideration difficult and demands a quickness of apprehension not always forthcoming 

<b></b>

from those used to more static forms" (<i>FY</i>, 1). At the same time, aesthetic categories deriving from, and addressed to, the static and the verbal arts were, for many commentators, perceived to be inadequate to the mobile, visual representations of film. At a different level of cultural life, the absence of an archive or cinemath&#x000E8;que meant that there was often difficulty in seeing films more than once. Thus viewing became a form of erasure, and the film, once seen, "passes out of existence." It could not even be recalled adequately in memory, because, Elliott asserted, "Scientific tests have shown that not more than sixty per cent. of a film is seen by the spectator"; attention is "diverted from its material elements and the technique of its scenes" and towards the "values of story, character and personality" (<i>AMPA</i>, 16). The attractions of narrative, Elliott suggested, occluded the visual qualities of the film. At yet another level, there was instability and variation in the exhibition of films, which could be edited differently according to localities and at the behest of censorship.
</p>

<p>
The imperative critical task, then, was to establish forms of persistence and permanence&#x02014;aesthetic and archival&#x02014;that would nonetheless do justice to film's mobility and the fleeting quality of its medium. As the film critic Iris Barry enjoined her readers in her 1926 study <i>Let's Go to the Pictures</i>: "I ask then: critics arise, invent terms, lay down canons, derive from your categories, heap up nonsense with sense, and, when you have done, the cinemas will still be open and we can all flock in as proudly as we do now to the theatre and the opera, which indeed it is regarded as meritorious and noble to support."<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
One way of capturing the "essence" of the mobile medium was to focus on the film still. For Robert Herring, the isolation of the still from the moving whole was justified by the perception that film's significance lies in its patterning of images. "What one remembers," he wrote, "of [Chaplin's] <i>A Woman of Paris</i> is not the story, but the treatment, and the treatment gave rise to a string of such symbols as Menjou's handkerchief. We remember the lit windows of the train, a dress collar, a necklace flung out of a window, some chocolates and a serviette full of holes" (<i>FY</i>, 3). The film still, in this account, would seem to be an appropriate way of seeing, or a mnemonic for, the objects, or part-objects, in which the film's "themes" are contained. Moreover, focusing attention on the pictorial or, more precisely, photogenic qualities of the "scene" was a way of diverting attention away from narrative, character and story, and hence of training the spectator in specifically visual modes of apprehension. Herring's brief comments on each of the stills he selected (from films including Murnau's <i>Faust</i>, Galison's <i>The Student of Prague</i>, Hitchcock's <i>The Lodger</i>, Borzage's <i>Seventh Heaven </i>and Man Ray's <i>Emak Bakia</i>) emphasized chiaroscuro effects and the interplay of vertical and horizontal planes. The focus on the film still was, nonetheless, framed in strategic terms; movement, for Herring as for so many other writers on film, continued to define the art of the cinema.
</p>

<p>
The question of vision and cinema's singular appeal to the eye persisted into the transition period of the late 1920s and beyond, even in discussion of those late silent films possessing a significant aural dimension. Walther Ruttmann's <i>Berlin</i>, is, as its subtitle indicates, the "symphony of a city," expressing, as Steven Connor has argued, "the 

<b></b>

sense of visuality passing across into aural form."<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>  F. W. Murnau's <i>Sunrise</i>, sub-titled "A Song of Two Humans," clearly revealed that a film's pictorial qualities could co-exist with both the representation of movement and engagement with the auditory. Yet, for the majority of commentators in the period, "beauty" was identified with "silence," drawing on a longstanding aesthetic credo in which silence is equated with universal and enduring values. The "silent forms" of Keats's Grecian Urn (whose lineaments were traced in early accounts of film as a return to Graeco-Egyptian art) lead us back to the question of the "moment" captured in the work of art, which both represents all time, and takes us out of contingency, time and history.
</p>

<p>
In the context of French avant-garde criticism, as I have noted, "beauty" became near-synonymous with <i>photog&#x000E9;nie</i>, in which concept was also to be found the aspiration, as Leo Charney writes, "to remove the moment from the flow and flux of time and, like the frame of the painting, declare: This is the present moment, right here, right now."<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>  In this sense, concepts of eternal value and of the moment independent of time and change could co-exist with the "modernist" focus on the isolated moment. Baudelaire's much-quoted assertion in his essay "The Painter of Modern Life" is apposite here: "By 'modernity' I mean the ephemeral, the fugitive, the contingent, the half of art whose other half is the eternal and the immutable."<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
"Beauty" in the cinema also has this dual or paradoxical dimension. Writing in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, the critic Martha Kinross asserted: "Architecture, sculpture, painting are static arts. Even in literature "our flying minds," as George Meredith says, cannot contain protracted description. But moments of fleeting beauty too transient to be caught by any means less swift than light itself are registered on the screen."<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>  The concept of "fleeting beauty" can be identified with the modernist effort, in Charney's words, "to seize a moment on the terms of its evanescence."<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>  It contains an echo of Walter Pater's account, in the conclusion to <i>The Renaissance</i>, of "that continual vanishing away, that strange, perpetual, weaving and unweaving of ourselves."<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>  Yet behind Pater there is Plato, and, in particular, Plato's <i>Phaedrus</i>, with its allegory of an earthly beauty (the beauty of the human body) which acts as a reminder to the beholder of Beauty, "true beauty," in the heavenly realm from which he has fallen. Film, too, is a doubled world, and, in the idealizing language of much early film writing, it is as if the film world offers "glimpses" of pure forms through the lifted veil or screen. This is then linked to the fleeting or evanescent qualities of such "glimpses" as an effect of filmic movement. "Platonist beauty" and "modern beauty" are intertwined.

American Beauty

<p class="noIndent">
In turning now to the ways in which cinematic "beauty" is taken up in early American film criticism, my focus will be a group of texts written and published in the U.S. in the 1910s and 1920s: Vachel Lindsay's <i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i> (1915, extended edition 1922) and <i>Progress and Poetry in the Movies</i> (written in 1925, but unpublished in Lindsay's lifetime); Hugo M&#x000FC;nsterberg's <i>The Art of the Photoplay</i>  and Victor 0. Freeburg's <i>The Art of Photoplay Making</i>  and <i>Pictorial Beauty on the Screen</i> 

<b></b>

. The founding of "film studies" as a discipline can also be located here: Victor Freeburg taught the first courses on Photoplay Composition at the Columbia University School of Journalism in the mid-1910s, and founded the Columbia Composers Club in 1916. (The term "photoplay" had been arrived at after the Essanay film production company sponsored a contest in 1910 to select the most appropriate name for the new medium.) Lindsay, M&#x000FC;nsterberg and Freeburg were very much aware of their status as pioneers in the field and of each other's work, so that an internal dialogue or "conversation" often developed within and between their respective studies. While there were some significant differences between their approaches to film, they were also linked by the perception that the pursuit and the apprehension of beauty in the photoplay was a crucial dimension in the development of the mass art of cinema.
</p>

<p>
If Lindsay is known today, it is most often as a populist poet, who, by the time he was working on <i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i>, had published two collections: <i>The Congo and Other Poems</i> and <i>Adventures while Preaching the Gospel of Beauty</i>. His writing had been taken up by Harriet Monroe and published in <i>Poetry</i> magazine in 1913; aligned, for a period, with the Imagists, Lindsay would propose an "Imagist photoplay" in <i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i>, which would, in his words, bring "Doric restraint" (a term that echoes throughout H. D.'s film articles for <i>Close Up</i>) into the "overstrained" and "overloaded" world of even the finest photoplays (<i>AMP</i>, 158). Lindsay called his most successful poetry the "Higher Vaudeville," and he was in effect a performance poet, who, at the height of his popularity, travelled the length and breadth of America giving readings. Born in Springfield, Illinois, the mid-Western town which remained the center of his communitarian and localist politics, Lindsay had studied at the Chicago Institute of Art (1901&#x02013;1903) and subsequently at the New York School of Art (1903&#x02013;1908). One of his teachers in New York was Robert Henri, a central re in the "Ashcan School" of art, and his fellow students included George Bellows, Rockwell Kent and Edward Hopper. Lindsay achieved no great success as an art student&#x02014;Henri encouraged him to pursue his poetry rather than his drawing. But the terms of "beauty" in his writings undoubtedly had as one of their contexts the claims, in the first years of the century, for the new forms of beauty awaiting discovery by artists in modern American cities, translated in Lindsay's conceptual schema into "democratic beauty."<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In a letter written at the beginning of 1915 to George Brett, editor-in-chief at Macmillan's, Lindsay outlined his new book, whose working title was "The Higher Criticism of the Movies":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
My particular equipment for writing this book is ten years of Art Education the last three of which were spent (winters) in lecturing in the Metropolitan Museum. My fundamental proposition is that the highest type of movie is a <i>picture</i> not a drama&#x02014;the movie-theatre is at best an Art-Gallery not a play-house. I am proving it out a hundred ways . . . [Movies] are as revolutionary in our age as the invention of Hieroglyphics was to the cave-man. And they can be built up into a great pictorial art. The Egyptian Tomb-painting was literally nothing but enlarged Hieroglyphics. We now have Hieroglyphics in motion&#x02014;and they can be made as lovely as the Egyptian if we once understand what we are doing.<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup> 

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Lindsay's "hieroglyphic" model of film language is perhaps the best-known aspect of his film writings.<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>  Reaching back to the American Transcendentalist fascination with hieroglyphics (as in the writings of Poe, Emerson and, later, Whitman), both as a unity of pictures and words and as a form of occulted knowledge, Lindsay's "hieroglyphs" would also seem to echo or to anticipate a whole gamut of accounts of cinematic representation. These accounts combine, or create a space between, word and image, and include Jean Epstein's references to film as Egyptian hieroglyphics and Eisenstein's writings on the filmic ideogram, extending also to writers of the Frankfurt School, notably Kracauer and Adorno with their interest in "mass-cultural hieroglyphics."
</p>

<p>
In <i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i>, as in his subsequent writings on cinema, particularly <i>The Progress and Poetry of the Movies </i>(unpublished in his lifetime), and in his poetry, Lindsay spelled out his vision of modern America (with its advertisements, bill-boards, newspaper photographs, sign-writings) as "a hieroglyphic civilization far nearer to Egypt than to England" (<i>AMP</i>, 12).<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>  He analyzed a set of Egyptian hieroglyphs, their Roman letter equivalents, and their equivalents in "the moving-picture alphabet,"and wrote that "It is sometimes out of the oldest dream that the youngest vision is born." The photoplay audience that uses "the hieroglyphic hypothesis in analyzing the film before it, will . . . . find a promise of beauty in what have been properly classed as mediocre and stereotyped productions" (<i>AMP,</i> 121).
</p>

<p>
Lindsay's concept of the "hieroglyph" often appears to be interchangeable with that of "symbol," and <i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i> attempted to produce a fixed and universal lexicon. The most interesting result of Lindsay's hieroglyphic preoccupations was, perhaps, his reading (in <i>The Progress and Poetry of the Movies</i>) of <i>The Thief of Bagdad</i>, a 1924 film starring Douglas Fairbanks, which reworked the tales of the Arabian Nights. He found there, in Michael North's words, "a self-reflexive parable of the hieroglyphic ancestry of the movies. The three treasures on which the drama turns&#x02014;a magic crystal, a flying carpet, and a golden apple&#x02014; . . . are self-reflexive representations of the powers added to human experience by photography: the power of the crystal to see far away, of the carpet to travel to distant places, of the apple to revive the dead."<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>  This conjoining of myth and medium can also be found in Lindsay's preoccupation with an "originary" transformative power of the film, continued into narrative cinema, as in his fascination with fairy-tales in which inanimate objects come to life and stasis becomes motion. At points in his texts, Lindsay sought to conjure, through his discourse, the still images of the art gallery into cinematic movement and life. At such moments, he seemed to be emulating, in his narrative, the powers of those late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century presenters of projected images, whose shows would depict the interplay between stasis and motion, the sudden animation of the still image, and the metamorphoses (of objects and spatial relations) that movement, or the appearance of movement, could effect.

I quoted earlier Lindsay's model of "conversation" in the cinema, as a way of illustrating the claim that early film critics were film explainers of a kind. Lindsay's is a highly performative text: "And so my commentary, New Years' Day, 1922, proceeds, using for points of more and more extensive departure the refrains and old catch-phrases 

<b></b>

of books two and three" (<i>AMP</i>, 5). After the publication of <i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i>, he began to give film lectures as well as poetry readings, and on occasions the two modes would be combined. He referred repeatedly to "proving" his theoretical arguments on a film as it was screened. In <i>The Progress and Poetry of the Movies</i> he gave an exhaustive reading of <i>The Thief of Bagdad</i>, writing: "If Douglas Fairbanks will not consider it presumption, I would say that his film proves my book [<i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i>] and my book proves his film" (<i>PPM, </i>172). His review of M&#x000FC;nsterberg's <i>The Photoplay: A Psychological Study</i> described it as an "unintentional guide book to the newest photoplay experiment, [D. W. Griffith's] <i>Intolerance</i>"; he recommended to his readers two screenings of <i>Intolerance</i> between two readings of M&#x000FC;nsterberg's book.<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>  "Conversation," for Lindsay, was thus a reference to the running commentary of the film spectator as explainer and the explanatory discourse of the film critic and theoretician. It was also connected to the "hieroglyphic" language of the film. As Lindsay wrote: "Moving objects, not moving lips, make the words of the photoplay" (<i>AMP,</i> 110).
</p>

<p>
In <i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i> (which Lindsay called "an open letter to Griffith and the producers and actors he has trained" [<i>AMP,</i> 124]) photoplays are divided into three kinds. The Photoplay of Action (the simplest example of which would be the chase-film) is defined as Sculpture-in-motion. The Intimate Photoplay (the film of <i>Enoch Arden</i> is the example here) is Painting-in-Motion. The Photoplay of Splendor (fairy splendor, crowd splendor&#x02014;as in D. W. Griffith's <i>The Birth of a Nation</i>&#x02014;patriotic splendor, religious splendor) is <i>Architecture-in-motion</i>. The three types (Action, Intimacy, Splendor) were further correlated with pantomime, personal gesture, and the total gestures of crowds respectively. If a literary analogue were required, Lindsay suggested, his readers might think in terms of the dramatic, the lyric and the epic, but the overarching schema mapped the moving picture onto the visual and plastic arts. "This book," he wrote, "tries to find that fourth dimension of architecture, painting, and sculpture, which is the human soul in action, that arrow with wings which is the flash of fire from the film, or the heart of man, or Pygmalion's image, when it becomes a woman" (<i>AMP</i>, 21).
</p>

<p>
As in the art criticism and aesthetic theories of the eighteenth-century aestheticians Joachim Winckelmann and Gotthold Lessing (whose <i>Laoco&#x000F6;n </i>[1766] was repeatedly invoked in early writing about film, primarily in discussions of film's relationship to the other arts), sculpture was represented as arrested movement. Lindsay wrote: "An occasional hint of a Michelangelo re or gesture appears for a flash in the films . . . Suppose the seated majesty of Moses should rise, what would be the quality of the action ? . . . Is it not possible to have a Michelangelo of photoplay sculpture?" (<i>AMP, </i>73&#x02013;4). The relationship between stasis and movement translated into the desire to put (or the fantasy of putting) into motion the still, or stilled, tableau or sculpture and the momentary stilling of the moving picture into beautiful scenes: "Action Picture romance," Lindsay wrote, "comes when each hurdle is a tableau, when there is indeed an art-gallery-beauty in each one of these swift glimpses: when it is a race, but with a proper and golden-linked grace from action to action, and the goal is the most beautiful glimpse in the whole reel" (<i>AMP, </i>27).

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
What was the relationship of the "glimpse" of beauty and the "flash" of fire to the question of the still and the moving image? Lindsay's concept of Beauty, as in his "Gospel of Beauty," was central to his understanding of democracy and religion, part of his "subscription to the remedial impact of visual beauty."<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>  It was also inseparable from, and complicated by, his desire for female beauty. "I am the one poet," he wrote in the opening pages of the 1922 edition of <i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i>, "who has a right to claim for his muses Blanche Sweet, Mary Pickford and Mae Marsh" (all of whom were early Biograph actresses) (<i>AMP</i>, 4). These "muses," then, come to re or embody the new Muse, the Tenth Muse, the Muse of film.
</p>

<p>
"Why do the people love Mary [Pickford]?," asked Lindsay:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Because of a certain aspect of her face in her highest mood. Botticelli painted her portrait many centuries ago when by some necromancy she appeared to him in this phase of herself . . . The people are hungry for this fine and sacred thing that Botticelli painted in the faces of his muses and heavenly creatures. Because the mob catch the very glimpse of it in Mary's face, they follow her night after night into the films.

"Glimpse" is an interesting word. We can say that something "glimpses": it shines faintly or intermittently, it glimmers or glitters&#x02014;thus the moon "glimpses" between the trees. Or we can say that we catch a "glimpse" of the moon between the trees. In fact, we tend to abbreviate this and say that we "glimpse" the moon between the trees, though it is in fact the moon doing the glimpsing, not us. In the context of early writing about film, ambiguities in subject-object relations and in the hierarchy of the various "looks" of the film (of the camera, actor, spectator), in addition to the anthropomorphizing of the object-world effected by the film, were connected to the representation of the cinematic image as a revelation, as in Elie Faure's "Cineplastics" essay or Virginia Woolf's "The Cinema," in which she wrote that: "Sometimes at the cinema, in the midst of its immense dexterity and enormous technical proficiency, the curtain parts and we behold, far off, some unknown and unexpected beauty. But it is for a moment only."<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>  Beauty, like <i>photog&#x000E9;nie</i>, (and, as I have suggested, <i>photog&#x000E9;nie</i> is in a sense "Beauty") thus appears to have a temporal dimension, defined, as it was for Epstein, as a value on the order of the second. It could be found, as it would often seem to be for Lindsay, in the cinematic image as a composition, a tableau, or as an interval.
</p>

<p>
In <i>The Progress and Poetry of the Movies</i>, Lindsay wrote of American modernity, with its "extreme fanaticism in the worship of raw light and raw action":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
I would venture upon another proverb: "Time must alternate with Eternity." Let me go farther into the parable, and say: "The sun makes time, makes machinery"; by it we regulate every watch and every newspaper, every railway schedule, every factory time-clock&#x02014;all those things that cut our nerves up into bits, 1/16 of an inch, no shorter, no longer . . . Action and speed and blazing light must alternate with moments of mellowness and rest. Even between each heart-beat, there is a split-second of absolute rest, which the American spirit would deny. It is the American idea to destroy that split-second of rest, which is between every heart-beat . . . No one to whom the moon is sufficiently dear will permit his nerves to be chopped into little pieces 1/16 of an inch long, and no longer, nor his time chopped into little pieces 1/16 of a second long, and no longer.

This image was taken up later in Lindsay's manuscript in a brief discussion of Chaplin's artistry, located in his films' "intimate passages, some of them not longer than the split second between every heart-beat, but long enough to give the touch of eternity in time, the hint of moonlight interrupting broad sunlight" (<i>PPM</i>, 271). The heart-beat (and we might recall here the heartbeat which concludes Gert Hofmann's <i>The Film Explainer</i>)was a way of giving human, bodily measure to mechanized modern time and to cinematic time (filming or projection at sixteen frames a second). For Lindsay, film would seem to be both continuous with the world of "action and speed and blazing light" and resistant to it, in its imagined creation of "rests" or intervals, whose identity overlapped with that of the passages through which "beauty" could be "glimpsed." The rhythms of modernity are heterogeneous and plural.
</p>

<p>
His account finds a curious echo in the late twentieth-century writings of Paul Virilio, in which the contrast between modernity and postmodernity is often predicated on the idea that the greater the speed of the image, the more absolute the loss of a contextualized time, and in which we find a nostalgia for a slower speed of projection/representation. Charting the shift from "truth 16 times a second" in the chronophotography of the nineteenth-century pioneer Jules-Etienne Marey to film's "truth 24 times a second" (as proclaimed by Jean-Luc Godard), Virilio writes: "the development of high technical speeds would result in the disappearance of consciousness as the direct perception of phenomena that inform us of our own existence." The destruction of human consciousness, Virilio suggests, comes with the closure of the interval, temporal and spatial, between the representation and what it records.<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Writing of the "beautiful picture" in the first decades of film history, in the context of a discussion of documentary cinema, the avant-garde film maker and theorist Hans Richter argued that its advent "marked the cinema's first direct overtures to the artistic climate of the period&#x02014;to the tradition of the bourgeois arts . . . The cinema took over painting&#x02014;and the poetry of the painted image took over the cinema." The creation of the "beautiful" image, Richter suggested, came at the expense of "a closeness to reality," producing a "contradiction between beautiful image and social task."<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>  The claims for "beauty" in Lindsay's writings (as in Freeburg's and M&#x000FC;nsterberg's) were clearly linked to the granting of a high art status to film, in the ways in which Richter critiques. Nonetheless, it would seem that, for Lindsay in particular, "beauty" was also credited with the "social task" of giving human measure to modern time, and of penetrating the seductive surfaces of modernity. In Lindsay's <i>The Progress and Poetry of the Movies</i>, the "glimpse" (of beauty) was contrasted, though the distinction was not absolute, with the "magical glitter" that created a continuum between the film, the plate glass windows of commodity culture and the glass architecture of the modern city:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Now this impression of looking into a crystal, which gives a magical glitter to everything within it, is the impression a true movie should convey . . . The first story of the principal streets is becoming all glass. It is not the glass itself that is desirable in the eyes of the American. It is the film of light upon the surface of the glass which has become his luxury . . . This madness of the crystalline is getting to be more and more a habit of the American eye.

<p class="noIndent">

While "the glimpse" and "glitter" are both forms of "beauty," the former was not held to be collusive with a commodified modern time and modern vision. In this sense the "glimpse of beauty" in the film could be said to anticipate some of the perceived functions of a montage aesthetic, which disrupts surfaces (through fragmentation, collision or the creation of new conceptual relationships) and "awakens" the spectator.
</p>

<p>
In his foreword to <i>The Art of Photoplay Making</i> , Victor Freeburg wrote that his study was based on lectures delivered at Columbia University between 1915 and 1917 and on the newspaper articles he wrote for the <i>New York Times</i> and other publications. He suggested that his readers have three books to hand: Epes Winthrop Sargent's <i>Techniques of the Photoplay</i> <i>, </i>Hugo M&#x000FC;nsterberg's <i>The Photoplay</i> and Vachel Lindsay's <i>The Art of the Moving Picture</i>, "which makes it perfectly clear that a motion picture, if properly thought out and manufactured, will contain the kind of beauty which we used to look for only in paintings and sculpture."<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>  The preface to <i>Pictorial Beauty on the Screen</i>  pursues the theme: "If I look upon a motion picture as a kind of substitute for some stage play or novel, it seems to me a poor thing, only a substitute for something better; but if I look upon it as something real in itself, a new form of pictorial art in which things have somehow been conjured into significant motion, then I get many a glimpse of touching beauty, and I always see a great range of possibilities for richer beauties in future examples of this new art. Then I see the motion picture as the equal of any of the elder arts."<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Though less idiosyncratic and less overtly polemical than Lindsay's film writings, Freeburg's two books were also attempts to both describe and prescribe for an aesthetics of cinema, taking a classical and formalist approach to the nature of art and the question of beauty, and giving unity the highest aesthetic value. "What the photoplay world needs at present," Freeburg wrote, "is more definite canons of criticism" (<i>TAPM</i>, 5). Such canons, he implied, were particularly to be desired given that "the momentary, flashing nature of exhibition and the psychology of the crowd give the spectator little opportunity or desire to exercise his intellectual faculties" (<i>TAPM</i>, 18). Moreover, they would help to secure for film its enduring qualities: "Let us constantly remember that if our photoplay is to become a classic it must possess beneath the attractive surface which appeals to the crowd the permanent values of illuminating truth, universal meaning, and unfading beauty" (<i>TAPM</i>, 25). Freeburg's account of film and its significance was intended to produce a counter-discourse to that of popular and commercial cinematic attractions, particularly as they were constructed in the movie and fan magazines. Thus his theories dissolved actors and "stars" into shape and shadow&#x02014;"We are merely thinking of [actors] as moving shapes upon a screen" (<i>PBS, </i>44)&#x02014;while he insisted that the film director was "the legitimate master in movie making" (<i>PBS, </i>154), as creator and artist.
</p>

<p>
The interplay between mobility and fixity, "movement" and "moment," stasis and fluency, underlies <i>The Art Of Photoplay Making</i>. The arts, Freeburg argued, can be divided into two categories: the static forms of the painter, sculptor and architect, which depend upon simultaneity and co-existence, and the "fluent" arts of the dancer, the orator and the musician, in which movement is "consecutive." Cinema, in his account, 

<b></b>

is concerned with both static and fluent forms. There is a quality of movement in film radically different to that of the other visual and plastic arts. "The visible stimuli" in painting, photography, sculpture or architecture "do not vanish while you look at them. They are there as long as you look, will be there tomorrow, and will remain constantly present to the eye as long as the art object endures." "But the motion picture is an ever originating series of ever vanishing aspects. And the composition of the photoplay is a combination of no-longer-seen pictures with being-seen-pictures with not-yet-seen pictures. In other words, the cinematic composition appeals simultaneously to the memory, the perception and the expectation of the beholder" (<i>TAPM</i>, 67).
</p>

<p>
Freeburg drew extensively in his film writings on contemporary research in physiological aesthetics and "the psychology of beauty," in which aesthetic preferences, for shape, color and form, were the subject of scientific and psychological experiment. The work of Ethel Puffer (author of <i>The Psychology of Beauty</i> [1907] and a student and, subsequently colleague, of Hugo M&#x000FC;nsterberg's) was a strong influence on both Freeburg's and M&#x000FC;nsterberg's film writing. For Puffer, "the beauty of an object lies in its permanent possibility of creating the perfect moment. The experience of this moment, the union of stimulation and repose, constitutes the unique aesthetic emotion."<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>  She explored the extent to which perceptions of balance and symmetry in pictures were determined by acts of "attention," a concept, central to late nineteenth- and twentieth-century psychology, also at the heart of M&#x000FC;nsterberg's theories of film and aligned by him with the filmic device of the close-up. Research in these areas, as explored in C. W. Valentine's <i>Experimental Psychology of Beauty</i> (referred to by Freeburg), was extended to the question of "suggested movement": "It seems possible," Valentine writes, "that pleasure may be found in the <i>suggestion</i> of movement by a line, if that suggestion is of the right kind."<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup> This is echoed in Freeburg's formulation "that movement in a photo-play may come from other things besides motions" (<i>PBS, </i>124).
</p>

<p>
In discussing the question "what is beauty?" in <i>The Art of Photoplay Making, </i>Freeburg referred his reader to the work of the writer, art historian and aesthetician Vernon Lee (the pseudonym of Violet Paget) and in particular to her study <i>The Beautiful </i>. In Lee's definition, which Freeburg quoted: "Beautiful means satisfactory for contemplative, ie <i>for reiterated perception</i>" (<i>TAPM</i>, 27). "The very essence of contemplative satisfaction," Lee continued, "is its desire for such reiteration."<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>  There are strong echoes here, too, of <i>Laoco&#x000F6;n</i>, in which Lessing wrote of the "single moment in ever-changing nature" to which the painter and sculpture are restricted; the moment must therefore be as suggestive as possible, while avoiding gestural excess. It is not, Lessing specified, "merely to be given a glance but to be . . . contemplated repeatedly and at length."<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>  Freeburg, borrowing Lee's (and Lessing's) definitions, attempted to redefine the cinematographic in the terms of satisfied contemplation, reiterated perception, and thus Beauty. He sought out "repetition" through formal, spatial relations, repeated within individual shots and across the span of the film, and connected repetition in the photoplay with the use of the theme or motif in musical composition. "The photoplay," Freeburg wrote in <i>Pictorial Beauty on the Screen</i>, "needs repetition, especially because of the fact that any pictorial motion or moment must by 

<b></b>

its very nature vanish while we look . . . from our minds as well as from the screen." Repetition with difference was a way of "fix[ing] these fleeting values" without risk of monotony (<i>PBS, </i>107).
</p>

<p>
"Repetition," for Freeburg as for Lindsay, also became a question of repeated viewings of a single film. Lindsay wrote in <i>The Progress and Poetry of the Movies</i> of watching <i>The Thief of Bagdad </i>twenty times, while Freeburg asked rhetorically (in a coded reference, perhaps, to Vachel Lindsay's re for the most beautiful cinematic tableau; "the breaking of the tenth wave upon the sand" [<i>AMP</i>, 111]):
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">

Has any reader of this book gone to see the same photoplay ten times? And if so, why? Was it because of some irresistible, undying lure in the content of that photoplay or in the pictorial form of that content? Did you go of your own free will? Did you ever make a sacrifice to see it the tenth time? If so, then you have known the calm joy of a reserve power in the newest of the arts.

<p>
"Reserve" was a central and multiply determined term, signifying decorative simplicity and "restraint," a containment, rather than an expenditure, of the spectator's psychical and physiological "energy," and "the emotion which comes over us at the overwhelming discovery that a given masterpiece of art has a wealth of beauty that we can never hope to exhaust." "Reserve," in Freeburg's arguments, also functioned as a counter to the "speed" that defined filmic movement and the "jazz" of the screen: "The hysterical extravagance of the movies is further illustrated in the breathless speed which so often characterizes every moving thing on the screen . . . It has nothing of that abiding joy which comes from the consciousness of restrained energy in art" (<i>PBS, </i>189&#x02013;90).
</p>

<p>
Rhythm, pictorial values, restraint, slowness of movement, "dynamic repose" (<i>PBS, </i>153), reserve and repetition were all represented as ways of holding back the speed and inexorable forward movement of the projected film, which came to stand for the relentless drive and "shock" effects of modernity itself. Speed, quick close-ups, "large violent movements on the screen" (<i>PBS, </i>38) and stark contrasts between black and white tones "hurt the eyes," producing "pictorial hysterics" (<i>PBS, </i>36). Acts of "attention," the work (or play) of "our eyes and minds" (<i>PBS</i>, 51), could, to an extent, Freeburg suggested, fix the fleeting instant, arresting the moment, arresting beauty: "At such times the whole pattern on the screen becomes as static as a painting, and its power or weakness, its beauty or lack of beauty, may be appreciated much as one would appreciate a design in a painting" (<i>PBS</i>, 51). Freeburg lamented, however, the impossibility of "rests," "blank periods" and "intervals" in cinematic projection and the absence in the film of visual equivalents to those silences, of varying lengths, which he held to be the most powerful aspects of musical rhythm and composition (<i>PBS</i>, 125).
</p>

<p>
"One would get a sense of movement," Freeburg wrote, "even if every scene in a photoplay were itself a fixed picture held for a few seconds on the screen" (<i>PBS, </i>124). The relationship between "moment" and "movement" was at the heart of his film theories: "Try to recall the pictorial aspects of the action in a play you saw years ago. What do you recall? Moments or movements? Rarely a movement, more often a moment. The psychology of this emphasis is usually simple enough. There was a 

<b></b>

momentary pause of the object just after completing, or just before beginning a movement" (<i>TAPM</i>, 31).
</p>

<p>
The "pause of the object" is in no way to be identified with the cut or the interval between film frames. To a significant extent, Freeburg sought in his film aesthetics an alternative line of development in moving picture technology, based on the pictorial tradition of the tableau, and running counter to contemporary celebrations of mechanization and speed.<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>  Freeburg also attempted to disaggregate "movement" as mere mechanical motion from "movement" as connected to sensation and emotion, setting in train a contrast between motion and emotion that became a recurrent trope in the writing about cinema of the 1920s.
</p>

<p>
Vernon Lee's <i>The Beautiful</i> made one brief reference to the "cinematographic" in tandem with the "kaleidoscopic," as ways of describing a succession of aspects connected to non-aesthetic (practical, scientific) responses, as in a landscape "which is swished over by the mental eye as by an express train, only just enough seen to know what it was, or perhaps nothing seen at all, mere words filling up gaps in the train of thought" (<i>B, </i>13). Film itself, it would seem, did not re on her conceptual horizon. In <i>The Beautiful</i>, Lee outlined a theory of aesthetics and empathy (drawing on the work of Theodor Lipps). "Dramas," she wrote, "enacted by lines and curves and angles, take place not in the marble or pigment embodying those contemplated shapes, but solely in ourselves, in what we call our memory, imagination and feeling" (<i>B, </i>80&#x02013;1). She was substantially concerned with the question of "movement," and with the contrast between "the locomotion of things" and "the empathetic movement of lines" which, in her account, lay at the heart of the aesthetic experience. <i>The Beautiful</i> thus presented a moving world without the felt necessity of the moving image.
</p>

<p>
Lee's physiological aesthetics provide a connection to the theories of Hugo M&#x000FC;nsterberg, with whose work in the fields of aesthetics and psychology Lee was intensely, though at times critically, engaged. M&#x000FC;nsterberg, who left Germany for the U.S. in 1892 when William James invited him to take charge of the psychological laboratory at Harvard (where his students included the young Gertrude Stein) was centrally concerned with the psychology of vision and perception, though his extensive publications also included work on aesthetics, American culture, and the "applied psychology" of law, industry and advertising.
</p>

<p>
M&#x000FC;nsterberg published his account of the "new art" of the film, <i>The Photoplay: A Psychological Study, </i>in 1916. It was written during the summer of 1915, when M&#x000FC;nsterberg's personal and professional situation, as a patriotic German living in the U.S., was becoming increasingly untenable. In 1916, M&#x000FC;nsterberg died of heart failure at the age of fifty-three. As his daughter and biographer Margaret M&#x000FC;nsterberg wrote of <i>The Photoplay</i>: "In this new study M&#x000FC;nsterberg sought distraction for himself from the wearing anxieties caused by the international stress, and at the same time hoped to make the imagination of the public link his name with a more serene interest."<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
M&#x000FC;nsterberg may have represented his "conversion" to the moving pictures as of recent date, but the preoccupations he brought to his writings about film were not.<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>  <i>The Photoplay</i> drew on a number of his longstanding interests; optical technologies and 

<b></b>

the physiology and psychology of perception; the philosophy of attention; the relationship between "inner" and "outer" realities; a neo-Kantian "aesthetic of isolation" and an affirmation of eternal and absolute values in art. These were all areas on which he had written extensively. He brought them to his analysis of an art which was defined on the basis of its newness, and whose departure, as he presented it, from existing aesthetic and, in particular, theatrical conventions became the essence of its independence: "We want to study the right of the photoplay, hitherto ignored by aesthetics, to be classed as an art in itself under entirely new mental life conditions."<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The significant evolution and aim of the cinema tended, M&#x000FC;nsterberg began by suggesting, towards the provision of "a real substitute for the stage," its democratized version, and the reproduction of "the theatre performance without end." Yet it becomes clear that he perceived the true development of the photoplay as a departure from both the theater and the reproduction of reality. The moving pictures can produce a "rapid change of scenes" impossible, he argued, on the stage; the possibility of "allowing the eye to follow the hero and heroine continuously from place to place"; the ability to be "simultaneously here and there"; "a rapidity of motion which leaves actual men behind" (<i>TP, </i>60&#x02013;1). As readers, we are gradually led from the valuation of realism to that of illusionism: "Every dream becomes real, uncanny ghosts appear from nothing and disappear into nothing, mermaids swim through the waves, and little elves climb out of the Easter lilies" (<i>TP, </i>61).<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
Yet even while "unheard of effects" were reached, the photoplay still "showed a performance . . . as it would go on in the outer world" (<i>TP</i>, 61). An entirely new perspective was reached, M&#x000FC;nsterberg argued, with the introduction of the close-up, which "leaves all stagecraft behind." It is at this juncture that the photoplay becomes "a new art which long since left behind the mere film reproduction of the theatre and which ought to be acknowledged in its own aesthetic independence. . . . A new aesthetic cocoon is broken; where will the butterfly's wings carry him?" (<i>TP</i>, 63). In his account of the evolution of the moving picture, then, the photoplay emerged into newness, after an embryonic period in which it was still to an extent in thrall to drama on the stage. It was, he suggested, "an independent art, controlled by aesthetic laws of its own, working with mental appeals which are fundamentally different from those of the theatre" (<i>TP, </i>64). Newness thus became synonymous with aesthetic autonomy.
</p>

<p>
In his section on "The Psychology of the Photoplay," M&#x000FC;nsterberg devoted separate chapters to "Depth and Movement," "Attention," "Memory and Imagination" and "Emotions," categories that echoed the chapter topics of William James's <i>The Principles of Psychology</i>. His interest lay here in "the mental processes which this specific form of artistic endeavour produces in us" (<i>TP</i>, 65). In his discussion of depth in the moving pictures he drew a sharp distinction between our "knowledge" that the objects on the screen have only two dimensions, and our "immediate impression" that they have depth: "We have no right whatever to say that the scenes which we see on the screen appear to us as flat pictures." As he wrote:

</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
<i>Depth and movement alike come to us in the moving picture world, not as hard facts but as a mixture of fact and symbol. They are present and yet they are not in the things. We invest the impressions with them.</i> The theater has both depth and motion, without any subjective help; the screen has them and yet lacks them. We see things distant and moving, but we furnish to them more than we receive; we create the depth and the continuity through our mental mechanism.

"<i>They are present and yet they are not in the things.</i>" In M&#x000FC;nsterberg's argument, we give more than we receive, and film spectatorship entails an encounter between an abundance of inner processes and "the world of impressions." "The best," he wrote, "does not come from without" (<i>TP</i>, 79). This view contrasts strikingly with those detractors of cinema for whom moving-image consumption was perceived as purely passive, as in T. S. Eliot's strictures in his essay "In Memoriam: Marie Lloyd," in which he wrote that, with the decay of the music-hall, the working-man goes to the cinema "where his mind is lulled by continuous senseless music and continuous action too rapid for the brain to act upon, and will receive without giving, in that same listless apathy with which the middle and upper classes regard any entertainment of the nature of art."<sup><a name="REF44" href="#FOOT44">44</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
M&#x000FC;nsterberg focused on those aspects of film technique which were also part of its "evolution." In his account, "depth and movement" were the primary attributes of the photoplay, and were inseparable from its double nature; it has and it does not have depth and movement. To this must be added&#x02014;as the photoplay began to add to its repertoire of representations&#x02014;"much more than the simple impression of moving and distant objects" (<i>TP</i>, 79). The close-up was to be understood as an "objectivation" of the most central of the internal functions "that create the meaning of the world around us"; that is, attention. The "cut-back" (a form of flash-back) is analogous to the workings of memory: "It is as if the outer world itself became moulded in accordance with our fleeting turns of attention or with our passing memory ideas" (<i>TP</i>, 90). "Gradual transitions . . . somewhat symbolize the appearance and disappearance of a reminiscence," while the rapid succession of scenes in the photoplay appear to us as simultaneously present, "fusing in our field of vision, just as they are brought together in our own consciousness" (<i>TP</i>, 92).
</p>

<p>
The last chapter in the section on psychology focused on emotions. In the structure of the text, the chapter on the "Emotions" in fact divides and connects the sections of the book on "psychology" and "aesthetics." M&#x000FC;nsterberg hypothesized a future for film in which, for example, (and along the model of a psychological experiment) a rocking camera would give to every motion "an uncanny whirling character," creating in "the mind of the spectator unusual sensations which produce a new shading of the emotional background" (<i>TP, </i>107). He thus sent, for a moment, an embodied, corporealized perception into whirling, vertiginous space before returning to the "laws" of aesthetics&#x02014;"isolation" and "detachment."
</p>

<p>
The final section of <i>The Photoplay</i> is an argument for aesthetic value as the overcoming of reality (<i>TP, </i>114): <i>"The work of art shows the things and events perfectly complete in themselves, freed from all connections which lead beyond their own limits, that is, in perfect isolation</i>" (<i>TP</i>, 117). "<i>The photoplay tells us the human story by overcoming </i>

<b></b>

<i>the forms of the outer world, namely, space, time, and causality, and by adjusting the events to the forms of the inner world, namely, attention, memory, imagination and emotion</i>"(<i>TP, </i>129). "We annihilate beauty when we link the artistic creation with practical interests and transform the spectator into a selfishly interested bystander" (<i>TP, </i>137). One question to be posed about M&#x000FC;nsterberg's text is whether his study of film was a further example of the way in which his psychophysiological preoccupations appeared in tandem with his idealist aesthetics, or whether cinema was perceived, and embraced, as the means by which the tensions between the two could finally be resolved.
</p>

<p>
M&#x000FC;nsterberg's study of film was more concentrated on questions of editing (and, by implication, on the issue of the spectator's engagement with filmic <i>narrative</i>) in the photoplay than Freeburg's writings, though both writers were concerned with models of spectatorial absorption and "attention." M&#x000FC;nsterberg shared with Lindsay a fascination with film's ability to produce the most rapid of alternations and alterations in space and time, through such devices as close-ups, parallel editing and dissolves; Lindsay, in his 1925 study, <i>The Progress and Poetry of the Movies</i>, quoted M&#x000FC;nsterberg extensively, and the film hieroglyph took on the aspect of the close-up. M&#x000FC;nsterberg also wrote far more positively than Freeburg of filmic speed and motion: "Not more than one sixteenth of a second is needed to carry us from one corner of the globe to the other, from a jubilant setting to a mourning scene. The whole keyboard of the imagination may be used to serve this emotionalizing of nature" (<i>TP, </i>103).
</p>

<p>
"Beauty" for M&#x000FC;nsterberg was not, as it was for Lindsay and Freeburg, "glimpsed" in those intervals which were, in Lindsay's words, "a pulse of the rhythm in the silence-of-time that we call the motion picture" (<i>PPM</i>, 201). For M&#x000FC;nsterberg, unlike Freeburg, the "unnatural rapidity" of the photoplay was represented as energizing, "heighten[ing] the feeling of vitality in the spectator" (<i>TP, </i>153). The film, in his account, moves to the measure of our own "fluttering and fleeting" mental states (<i>TP, </i>127), and beauty would seem to inhere in this symbiosis, and not in the attempt to arrest time and motion.
</p>

<p>
While the writers I have discussed do not mention the work of Henri Bergson in their film writings, his rejection of the "cinematographic mechanism of thought" in <i>Creative Evolution</i> would appear to be a highly significant conceptual context. Bergson argued that the cinematographic model spatializes and segments time, rather than understanding time as a vital flow into which human subjectivity could be inserted. As I have noted, Lindsay and Freeburg's counters to the "mechanical" movement of the cinematic frame were the pictorial image or tableau that could momentarily arrest time and the interval as the glimpse of beauty, while M&#x000FC;nsterberg postulated a mode of perception inextricably intertwined with our "mental mechanism." Moreover, his account of the filmic "cut-back," and its counterpart in the work of the mind, is suggestive of the concept of "thinking backwards" for which Bergson argued, claiming, in <i>Creative Evolution</i>, that such a process ran entirely counter to the relentless forward motion of the cinematic apparatus and that it reversed "the bent of our intellectual habits."<sup><a name="REF45" href="#FOOT45">45</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
In the closing paragraph of his text M&#x000FC;nsterberg engaged with the question of "modern beauty," in his assertion that film "is a new form of true beauty in the turmoil of a modern age, created by its very technique and yet more than any other art destined to overcome outer nature by the free and joyful play of the mind" (<i>TP, </i>160). 

<b></b>

</p>

<p>
For all M&#x000FC;nsterberg's emphasis on flux, on the "fleeting" and "passing" that we have come to associate with modernist conceptions of time, identity and experience, and on the part played by human consciousness in shaping the operations of the film, an "aesthetic of isolation" continued to lie at the heart of his theories. This was also central to the writings of a number of his contemporaries, for whom cinema offered a world which duplicated our own, but which precluded the possibility of our interventions into it. Released from the demands of active and practical response, it was argued, we "see" more clearly.<sup><a name="REF46" href="#FOOT46">46</a></sup>  There is an anticipation here of the writings of the philosopher Stanley Cavell on cinema, particularly in his book <i>The World Viewed, </i>in which he explored the wish, particular to modernity, "for that specific simultaneity of presence and absence which only the cinema will satisfy."<sup><a name="REF47" href="#FOOT47">47</a></sup> 
</p>

<p>
The focus on "beauty," shared by Lindsay, Freeburg and M&#x000FC;nsterberg (and central to the avant-garde French film theory of the same period) was rarely pursued in subsequent film aesthetics. Indeed, as in the case of Hans Richter, quoted earlier, it was often perceived to be at odds with cinematic realism, or, as in the case of the Hungarian film theorist B&#x000E9;la Bal&#x000E1;zs, with the motion that defined film. Writing of "Dangerous Beauty," Bal&#x000E1;zs asserted:
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
Over-beautiful, picturesque shots are sometimes dangerous even if they are the result of good camera work alone. Their over-perfect composition, their self-sufficient closed harmony may lend them a static, painting-like character and thereby lift them out of the dynamic stream of the action. Such beauty has its own centre of gravity, its own frame and does not reach beyond itself to the preceding and the subsequent. "<i>Je hais le mouvement qui d&#x000E9;place les lignes</i>," wrote Baudelaire in his sonnet on beauty. But the film is art in motion.<sup><a name="REF48" href="#FOOT48">48</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
The pictorial tradition in film and in film criticism has been largely written out of the debates and the histories, and the work of the critics discussed in this article was overlooked for many decades, though it resonated throughout the film criticism of the 1920s, often without acknowledgement. Recent modernist studies, with their tendency to equate film and montage aesthetics, have found little place for the writing of these early critics and theorists. Yet among the many interesting aspects of this early work is that, <i>contra</i> Bal&#x000E1;zs, it was precisely an attempt to bring the terms of "beauty" together with those of "motion," the multiple rhythms of modernity, temporality ("the preceding and the subsequent," in Bal&#x000E1;zs's phrase) and the mass or democratic art of the cinema.
</p>

<p>
This would seem to be of particular relevance now, when cultural theory is demonstrating not only a fascination with late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century models of time and space but also a desire to reclaim the category of beauty, for ethics as well as aesthetics. Isobel Armstrong's <i>The Radical Aesthetic, </i>for example,includes a chapter entitled "And Beauty? A Dialogue," in which she argues that, for Adorno, beauty is not a thing but "a <i>want, or wanting. </i>Beauty conjures wanting because it is a promise of the as yet unsayable, a fleeting promise of new possibilities, of scarcely envisioned openings in experience emancipated from the world of exchange."<sup><a name="REF49" href="#FOOT49">49</a></sup>  Elaine 

<b></b>

Scarry's recent manifesto for beauty, entitled <i>On Beauty and Being Just</i>, argues that the desire for the replication of beauty sponsored not only the idea of eternity, "the perpetual duplicating of a moment that never stops," but also the "idea of terrestrial plenitude and distribution":
</p>

<blockquote class="extract">
<!--_extract-->
The first flash of the bird incites the desire to duplicate not only by translating the glimpsed image into a drawing or a poem or a photograph but simply by continuing to see her five seconds, twenty-five seconds, forty-five seconds later&#x02014;as long as the bird is there to be beheld . . . Pater tells us that Leonardo, as though half-crazed, used to follow people around the streets of Florence once he got "glimpses of it [beauty] in the strange eyes or hair of chance people." Sometimes he persisted until sundown. This replication in the realm of sensation can be carried out by a single perceiver across time . . . or can instead entail a brief act of perception distributed across many people.<sup><a name="REF50" href="#FOOT50">50</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p class="noIndent">
The terms deployed by Armstrong and Scarry, as for others engaged in a recuperation of the concept of beauty, resonate strongly with those of early film criticism, and suggest that its interest for us might well ramify beyond its immediate historical context.

Critics who have discussed this aspect of Lindsay's work include Rachel O. Moore and Nick Browne. Moore's study, <i>Savage Theory: Cinema as Modern Magic</i> (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2000) looks at the "primitivism" inherent in Lindsay's film writings; Browne's article, "American Film Theory in the Silent Period: Orientalism as an Ideological Form," <i>Wide Angle</i> 11.4 (October 1989), notes the complexity of the "universal language" myth of cinema at a time of mass working-class immigration and a substantially immigrant and working-class audience for the cinema.
