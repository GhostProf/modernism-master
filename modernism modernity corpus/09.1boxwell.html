Social Drama Queens
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
Pity the drag queens who perform for unreceptive audiences. Two cases
from World War I are worth recalling from the pages of the London tabloid
<i>The News of the World</i>; both illustrate the gender disruption
associated with modern warfare. The popular weekly newspaper took note
of some "strange antics" occurring in June 1918. Victor Wilson, who,
as the headline announced, "IN FEMALE ATTIRE / MASQUERADED AS GIRL TO
HAVE FUN WITH SOLDIERS," created enough of a sensation to merit a short
report in the paper, but his local impact in the Edinburgh area must have
been even more sensational. Wilson went looking for love in all the wrong
places. But on one particular outing, he was oblivious to the fact that
while a soldier on his own might have been susceptible to a pick-up,
propositioning two or more soldiers in a group would almost certainly
invite a homophobic response. Here is the report in full:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
The strange antics of Victor Wilson, a Dundalk Labour Exchange official,
who is alleged to have been in the habit of masquerading as a young woman,
with the object of having fun with soldiers, resulted in his appearance
yesterday before the local magistrates. Although the accused was dressed
in ladies' garments, and wore a hat and veil, and attempted to attract
the khaki-clad lads, 3 of thelatter deposed that, becoming suspicious,
they informed the local constabulary. P[olice] C[onstable] Quinn then
assumed military uniform, and going to Castletown Railway Bridge, kept
the defendant under observation, eventually entering into conversation



with the supposed "lady" who, becoming uneasy at the turn of events,
tried to bolt. Quinn blew his whistle, and the 3 soldiers aided him
in arresting Wilson, who was alleged to have offered 5 s[hillings] to
let him off. After other evidence the accused was returned for trial
at Louth Assizes, bail being allowed.
<sup><a name="REF1" href="#FOOT1">1</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
Wilson's entrapment by the police and military gives some indication of
the anxiety about transgressive male sex/gender identity and behavior
which the pressures of war might exert on secure notions of masculinist
and patriarchal culture. His transvestite forays into cross-class
homosexual encounters ended in his apprehension and exposure at the
hands of the authorities and the objects of his desire, working-class
soldiers in uniform. Such would have been the fate of many men whose
outlaw desires were stimulated by the enticing spectacle of massed male,
uniformed flesh during the Great War.

<p>
Wilson's masquerade was, however, not as wholly dysphoric as another
case trumpeted in the tabloid approximately two weeks later (18 June
1918). Readers were treated to the pitiful spectacle of "THE EFFEMINATE
SOLDIER / DESERTER WHO LOVES TO WEAR BEAUTIFUL DRESSES." Without
implicating Frederick Wright as a homosexual, <i>The News of the World</i>
informed its titillated readers that he appeared in court in women's
attire at Highgate, London and was charged, on remand,



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
as an idle and disorderly person found in female attire, and further with
being an absentee from the Royal Fusiliers. [The] Accused, after first
denying that he was a man, admitted that he had masqueraded under the
name of Kathleen Woodhouse and had adopted the disguise to escape from
the Army. He said that he disliked soldiers and soldiering; in fact,
everything manly. He added that he wished he had been born a woman,
as he loved wearing beautiful dresses.
<sup><a name="REF2" href="#FOOT2">2</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
<i>The News of the World</i> reported that this spectacular case of gender
dysphoria had previously attempted suicide, been rejected by his family
"because of his effeminate ways," and was remanded "to await an escort"
back to his regiment. The judge gruffly remarked, according to the report,
"that he did not suppose he would be of much use in the Army. In the
meantime the police might put him into proper garb. 'I should not send
him to the Army in this condition'" (ibid.).

<p>
Ironically, Wright's garb was not necessarily improper: had fate more
fortuitously intervened, he could have been of much use to the British
ting forces as one of a corps of drag artists performing in camp
and shipboard theatricals that were officially sponsored by the military
during the Great War.
<sup><a name="REF3" href="#FOOT3">3</a></sup>
  His failed flight from masculinity, male bonding, and militarism
  stands as a poignant attempt to desert from precisely what the civilian
  Wilson found so dangerously alluring in male homosocial arrangements in
  wartime. Yet these dissenters from sex/gender norms, however disastrous
  their performances in drag, were two of countless actors in a social
  drama spotlit, with blinding intensity, by the pressures of World War
  I, which was the first significant war following the establishment
  of the male homosexual as a separate class of being. This drama was
  what Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick called the "chronic, now endemic crisis of

<b></b>

homo/heterosexual definition, indicatively male, dating from the end of
the nineteenth century."
<sup><a name="REF4" href="#FOOT4">4</a></sup>
  If we cast this crisis in metaphorically theatrical terms, the
  homo/hetero schism in male identity and relations had become a
  phenomenon by the time of the Great War.

<p>
As anthropologist Victor Turner has theorized at length, the defining
sense that culture is theatrical is heightened by the "social dramas"
that constantly emerge, even traumatically erupt, from the surface of
social life.
<sup><a name="REF5" href="#FOOT5">5</a></sup>
  Social dramas expose the subcutaneous levels of the social structure
  and both activate and reveal a culture's conflictual relations and
  associations based on such determinant factors as gender, class,
  division of labor, race, ethnicity, and so forth. Turner limns
  the social drama as consisting of four phases: breach (the forcing
  of antagonisms into the open); recognition of crisis; redress; and
  resolution/conclusion (<i>RT,</i> 10). The problematic breach in male
  homosociality manifests itself as a crisis during the Great War which,
  in Turner's conceptualization of the social drama, is redressed by the
  kind of machinery that attempts to "seal up punctures in the social
  fabric" (ibid.). Forms of redress intended to resolve or forestall
  conflict may either take juridical or ritual means (like the theatre)
  that have a "therapeutic" intention.

<p>
Wilson's frantic evasion of arrest and his hysterical bribery attempts,
and Wright's melodramatic suicide attempt and outrageous cross-dressed
appearance in court, inspire me to consider them as exemplary, but
fatally misdirected (or undirected), drama queens in the social
drama being played out in World War I. What they lacked was the
proper stage upon which to conduct the kind of transgressive behavior
punitively redressed by the unflattering glare of juridical and mass
media spotlights on the home front. The irony, I will demonstrate, is
that certain cultural apparatuses during the Great War did not merely
facilitate the connotative articulation of polymorphously perverse
desires, but actually put riotous cross-dressing onto stages close to
the front lines. Indeed, the unprecedented spectacle of innumerable
soldiers and sailors cavorting in frocks became a system of popular
cultural production institutionally fabricated, and even necessitated,
by the rupture of the homosocial continuum in 1914.

<p>
Theatre behind the front lines during the war drew both euphoric and
dysphoric sustenance from the tortuous and highly-panicked slippage
between prescribed identification and proscribed desire in homosocial
arrangements. The theatrical stage was the site where the pleasures
and anxieties of same-sex relations could be made manifest, embodied
and enacted as public spectacle for the gaze of those experiencing
the crisis of male-male relations. In Turner's terms, theatre, as a
ritual mode of redress, is a cultural mechanism by which a viewer is
able to confront, comprehend, and respond to this crisis. "By means of
such genres as theatre . . . performances are presented which probe
a community's weakness," as a means of resolving the conflicts which
underscore the social drama represented on stage (<i>RT,</i> 11). Behind
the curtain-as-veil, aberrant male-male desires could be staged in an
effort to "solve" the crisis of male bonding spotlit by the war's impact.

<p>
In this essay I investigate how the crisis of male-male bonds during
the war was given "redress" in theatrical terms via the ubiquity of
cross-dressing in the spirit of

<b></b>

carnivalesque and camp. Most striking about the phenomenon of officially
sanctioned transvestism during the war is the degree to which it
was an expression, however problematic, of crossing the homo/hetero
divide. Cross-dressing by soldiers on stage demonstrates how a theatrical
form can make sense of the crisis being enacted. I argue that the
glorious--but hugely problematic--excess of male cross-dressing in mass
troop entertainments flirted with the possibility of repairing schisms
in the homosocial continuum in ways that were wholly untenable in the
aftermath of the war. The discursive production of homosexuality in modern
British culture was, to a significant degree, dependent on the theatrical
performance of "perverse" desires, identities, and styles by bodies
on stage. Popular musical comedy performed by soldiers and sailors had
the potential both to challenge and to confirm the "logic" of normative
heterosexuality within male social arrangements. Cross-dressing on stage
ritualistically desublimated and resublimated the array of inhibitive
repressions structuring male bonding during the war. How audiences reacted
to this challenge to what was otherwise sublimated and repressed, and
how it took on a kind of cultural imperative, are my subjects.

<p>
The 22nd Divisional Theatre's presentation of Oscar Straus's operetta
<i>The Chocolate Soldier</i> in the summer of 1918, just behind the
front lines in eastern France, necessitated the enactment of a range of
women's parts by soldiers in the 22nd. All the female roles were assumed
by men, including the pretty "rival" Mascha, played by Second Lieutenant
T. F. Sampson of the Cheshire Regiment, and the ingenue Nadina, played by
Private T. Wardle, also of the R.A.M.C. The program for the production
lists the names of the male chorus members who were required to sing as
"Officers, Soldiers, Peasants and Bridesmaids, etc." The synopsis on the
back page of the program suggests that the performance required men to
enact convincing desire for other men (in drag) in an elaborate comic
plot reveling in mistaken identities, concealed bodies, and feigned
"flirtations" that "yielded affection." Throughout, the hero Bumerli's
"youthful mien and carriage" is admired by the "women" in the plot:
Nadina, her cousin Mascha, and her mother Aurelia. The program note
concludes: "The sentiment of 'The Chocolate Soldier' is evolved by the
love affairs of Bumerli and Nadina, Mascha and Alexis."
<sup><a name="REF6" href="#FOOT6">6</a></sup>

<p>
Remarkably, the 22nd's elaborate staging of gender-transitivity in the
midst of the carnage of trench warfare was quite unexceptional. British
theatre during the Great War bears out Marjorie Garber's contention that
cross-dressing does not merely inhabit the margins, but also "the very
heart of public, institutional, and mainstream structures."
<sup><a name="REF7" href="#FOOT7">7</a></sup>
  As Garber surmises,



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
Whatever the specific semiotic relationship between military uniforms and
erotic fantasies of sartorial gender, the history of cross-dressing within
the armed services attests to a complicated interplay of forces, including
male bonding, acknowledged and unacknowledged homosexual identity,
carnivalized power relations, the erotics of same-sex communities, and the
apparent safety afforded by theatrical representation. [<i>VI,</i> 55-6]

<b></b>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The open predilection for, and appreciation of, cross-dressing by the
British during World War I was not, therefore, just a subversive or
"secret" form of transgressive "release." Rather, it was also a seemingly
mandated form of ludic experimentation that was structured by the crisis
of the homo/hetero binary within homosocial formations. The cross-dressed
entertainments permitted the creation of a quasi-utopian space where
the traumatic undercurrents of this social drama could receive at least
partial salutary psychic and cultural propitiation, however much it
was expressed in misogynist, racist, and homophobic terms. In other
words, it is possible to argue that if the male homosocial continuum
was wholly unmarked by rupture, the spectacle of cross-dressed soldiers
in a theatrical site would not (need to) exist. Certainly, World War
I was marked by an unprecedented efflorescence of cross-dressing in
institutionalized military "performance."
<sup><a name="REF8" href="#FOOT8">8</a></sup>

<p>
Military-social historian J. G. Fuller has established that at least
eighty percent of the divisions that served in the active war theatres
(western and eastern fronts) sustained an established theatrical
subunit. This was most often referred to, in suitably carnivalesque
terms, as the "concert party," made up of enlisted men and their junior
officers, many of whom had theatrical and entertainment backgrounds
before conscription, enlistment, or commissioning.
<sup><a name="REF9" href="#FOOT9">9</a></sup>
  By the end of 1917, division and battalion concert parties were
  "practically universal" (<i>TM,</i> 96). That this institutionalization
  of theatre became so rapidly entrenched suggests that hegemonic forces
  tolerated, if not encouraged, the outbreak of carnival. An extensive
  culture of popular theatrical performance served as a vital component
  in the formation of esprit de corps. There was little attempt made to
  censor content and "officer attendance, and often participation, gave
  their implicit sanction to the proceedings" (<i>TM,</i> 102). Despite
  the fact that much satire was directed at the officers, they "accepted
  the comic strictures offered from the stage; they did not stand on
  their dignity; they were 'alright' at bottom, simply men doing their
  job" (ibid.). The concert parties enabled officers and the other ranks
  to foster esprit de corps, a carefully circumscribed release of class
  tensions permissible in the hazardous proximity to the front lines.

<p>
The concert party became a preeminent homosocial ritual affirmed in
the discourse of military regulation. A 1917 pamphlet issued by the
General Staff took note of organized "evening entertainments" as a way
of improving morale.
<sup><a name="REF10" href="#FOOT10">10</a></sup>
  In May 1918, <i>Hints on Training,</i> issued by the XVIII Corps,
  positively recommended the establishment of regular divisional theatre
  (<i>TM,</i> 109). Theatre supplemented organized competitive athletics
  and games as a recreational method of building "true soldierly spirit."
<sup><a name="REF11" href="#FOOT11">11</a></sup>
  A bottom-up cultural dynamic, concert parties had first evolved early
  in the war in YMCA huts, or spontaneously in the open among soldiers at
  rest or awaiting troop movement. "Once the idea took hold," however,
  "authorities put considerable effort into supporting it. Numbers of
  troupes were usually exempted from all but light duties, becoming
  full-time entertainers" (<i>TM,</i> 95). Designated battalion
  entertainment funds supplemented a nominal admission charge, and
  considerable assets were spent on relatively elaborate costuming
  and set design, as many photographs of troupes reveal. Indeed, the
  war was an incessant "show"; Fuller notes that "no period of rest or
  reserve was

<b></b>

without its ad hoc concerts, at which soldiers would perform, singing,
reciting, conjuring, doing comedy, or ventriloquy" (<i>TM,</i> 99). Thus
the British experienced the war in self-consciously performative terms,
as Paul Fussell points out.
<sup><a name="REF12" href="#FOOT12">12</a></sup>
  He does not, however, mention the startling frequency with which
  military men appeared in drag. Such appearances were the eruptive
  manifestation of a matrix of theatrical and sexually dissident
  subcultures that had been evolving for centuries, but which, for the
  first time on a mass scale, emerged as a preeminent form of theatre
  produced by and for men in homosocial formations.
<sup><a name="REF13" href="#FOOT13">13</a></sup>

<p>
That drag was a potentially transgressive form of theatrical
presentation during the war did not go unnoticed by <i>Punch.</i>
The working classes at theatrical play were depicted in situations
that at least suggested the idea of homosexual acts performed by men
in masquerade who dressed up to play out heteronormative romantic
situations. The best articulation of this is "Mabel's" pop-eyed panic
in the cartoon published in the 22 May 1918 issue (<a name="1"
HREF="9.1boxwell_res.html#1"> 1</a>). The idea that
cross-dressing could encompass the performance of erotic "acts" between
men was the source of much anxiety-laden humor that was conveniently
displaced onto the working classes, stereotypically represented as
phobic and buffoonish grotesques. In a 21 June 1916 <i>Punch</i> cartoon
(<a name="2" href="9.1boxwell_res.html#2"> 2</a>),
Edwin Morrow expresses anxiety about the transformation of sex and
gender norms in terms of transvestism and perverse gestures, stances,
and costuming. Focused on the "posing" cross-dressed soldier who has
"degenerated" from an ideally masculine and ramrod-stiff Victorian avatar,
this cartoon simultaneously revels in and denounces the carnivalesque
spirit. The cartoonist attempts to recuperate for heterosexual norms the
transformative degeneration of "John" into "Jack" by indicating that
the series of photographic souvenirs has been exchanged between Jack
and his sweetheart "Susie" (formerly "Susannah"), herself the distaff
version of gender/sex inversion in masculine uniform.
<sup><a name="REF14" href="#FOOT14">14</a></sup>
  Morrow's transformations absolve the cross-dressers of any taint
  of same-sex perversion, as Jack and Susie have each become the
  heterosexually desired Other to the heterosexual self. But his anxiety
  betrays itself at another level. Ever protective of a conservative
  vision of Britain, he uses the "startling contrast" of sex/gender
  <i>bouleversement</i> to demonstrate how thoroughly vulgar the
  modern war is compared to more noble and formal nineteenth-century
  heterosexual romantic gestures. Traditional standards of decorum and
  gender "style" (apparent in the photos' settings) are under siege, and
  <i>Punch</i> uses comedy to stave off reactionary fears about debased
  forms of popular culture that perform a terrifying restylization of
  bodies in wartime. Foremost among these debased cultural practices
  is theatre, with its tenacious traditions of sexual deviance,
  cross-dressing, and ribald comedy.

<p>
That men cross-dressed to entertain other men in the midst of
war was the source of some discomfiture to the arbiters of British
culture. <i>Punch</i> assured its readers that drag did not necessarily
connote homosexual desire or identity (however much it prompted acceptable
expressions of panic among working-class performers like "Mabel"). But
such reassurance was itself governed by the connotative association
between homosexuality and cross-dressing that had been established in
the popular imagination by the outbreak of World War I. This association
could be mined for humor.

<b></b>

Thus the 22nd's presentation of <i>The Chocolate Soldier</i> was
half-mockingly, half-nervously performed, as the program announced,
"With Apologies." Similarly, division Pierrot Troupe leeringly risked
queering itself in the program for its Christmas 1915 all-male pantomime,
<i>Babes in the W(Censored),</i> when it explained that in Act IV, "all
sorts of scenes are seen in this scene--except for the obscene--which
is kept for the Dressing Room." The pun on "scene" depends, necessarily,
on the audience's ability, or willingness, to fantasize about the nature
of the perversion energizing the performance and the comedy.

<p>
Even outside of theatrical environments, the case of Victor Wilson was
typical in establishing the convergence of transitivities of gender
performance and (homo)sexual desires in terms of costuming, gestures,
and acts. The retributive and surveillant forces of the police and
mass media successfully converged in another "GRAVE SCANDAL." "MAN'S
ALLEGED MASQUERADE AS ANOTHER MAN'S WIFE," was the headline of <i>The
Illustrated Police News</i> of 20 July 1916. The story recounted the
"well-deserved punishment" of two years at hard labor for Robert Couthard,
alias "Jennie Gray," the lover of James Blake, alias "James Gray." This
perverse travesty of the heteronormative marriage ritual was the "cover,"
as the tabloid put it, for these outlaws in leading their

<b></b><b>[Begin Page 9]</b>



<blockquote>

immoral life and permitting the house off Lime Street [in Liverpool],
which they occupied as Mr. and Mrs. James Gray, to be used for immoral
traffic.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Detectives Alexander and Lanty deposed they watched the house occupied
by [Couthard and Blake] from May 30 to June 8. Couthard, whose clever
make-up caused both the officers to believe that he was a woman, took
numerous men to the house. When the house was raided on June 8, and the
arrests effected, a considerable sum of money was seized,
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
from theft and blackmail, it is implied.
<sup><a name="REF15" href="#FOOT15">15</a></sup>
  The case of Gray and Gray was an especial outrage to the forces of
  law and order. Couthard's criminal and quite successful ("clever")
  "masquerade" was inspired not simply to lure unsuspecting men to
  a homosexual fleecing, but also by the transgressive pleasures
  of exploiting undecidability through appearance ("make-up") and
  costume. There was no question by 1916 that cross-dressing signified
  sexual outlawry, which was especially threatening to Alexander and
  Lanty. Taking over a week to decipher Couthard's "act," the police seem
  to have had difficulty marking the differences between an alluring
  woman and a male homosexual; he must have exercised a destabilizing
  impact on the surveillant gaze of officialdom. <i>The Illustrated
  Police News</i> recited the (unnamed) judge's stern lecture to the
  defendant: "I think it is a great calamity that a man like you should
  be allowed to be at large. Had I the power I would take great care
  that you should not be at large again; but unfortunately I have not
  that power."
<sup><a name="REF16" href="#FOOT16">16</a></sup>
  The judge asseverated that, thirty years after the Labouch&egrave;re
  Amendment criminalized homosexuality, the cross-dressed homosexual's
  appearance was enough to signify otherwise unarticulable acts of
  gross indecency that merited the maximum punishment of two years at
  hard labor. Couthard was thus imprisoned (however "insufficiently")
  not simply for crimes against another person, but for advertising
  his perversions so ostentatiously--yet so very undecidably--in the
  performance of petty crimes.

<p>
Within a specifically theatrical field of signification, too, the
indelible, if not always acknowledged, connotations between gender-bending
and sexual perversity were drawn before and during the Great War. For
example, the volcanically sensational trial of Noel Pemberton Billing in
June 1918 forced into the open the "secret" of perversions at the heart
of such private theatrical performances as Maud Allan's impersonation
of Wilde's <i>Salom&eacute;</i>.
<sup><a name="REF17" href="#FOOT17">17</a></sup>
  Pemberton Billing insisted that any participant in theatre outside the
  official censorship restrictions imposed by the Lord Chamberlain's
  Office was ipso facto a pervert, vicariously reveling in criminal
  sexual practices "enacted" (however symbolically) by performers on
  stage, or "instigated" by directions from the text.
<sup><a name="REF18" href="#FOOT18">18</a></sup>
  In his opening remarks at the trial, Pemberton Billing announced that



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
I shall have to bring evidence that in many other cases pantomime is used
by people who lack courage, or who are not sufficiently debased to take
the risk of the crimes [of sodomy and gross indecency] in real life,
and I shall have to satisfy the jury that in this case the passion for
the head of John the Baptist is a clear case of this practice.
<sup><a name="REF19" href="#FOOT19">19</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
In this paranoiac scene, theatre was only surrogate
homosexuality. Pemberton Billing's performance theory was ultimately
persuasive to the jury precisely because it exploited the never fully
spoken acknowledgment that theatre was the appalling sanctuary of

<b></b>

homosexuality. This association had been culturally ingrained and
discursively reproduced since at least the sixteenth century, and
reinforced "interrelated traditions by which the homosexual came to be
characterized as effeminate and the actor ranked as homosexual."
<sup><a name="REF20" href="#FOOT20">20</a></sup>

<p>
In the period closer to the Great War, the discursive construction of
homosexual identity was predicated on such an association between theatre,
cross-dressing, and illicit male-male erotic pleasure.
<sup><a name="REF21" href="#FOOT21">21</a></sup>
  The Boulton-Park scandal of 1871 definitively linked homosexuality,
  the world of the theatre, and transvestism.
<sup><a name="REF22" href="#FOOT22">22</a></sup>
  This link was reconfirmed at the Wilde trial a quarter-century later,
  when it was revealed that many of the male prostitutes with whom Wilde
  consorted had cross-dressing predilections and subsisted on the fringes
  of the West End theatre world. John Watson Preston, a leading light of
  the London homosexual demimonde in the late nineteenth century, "held
  openly transvestite parties, one of which was raided by the police."
<sup><a name="REF23" href="#FOOT23">23</a></sup>
  This raid precipitated the arrest of Alfred Taylor, one of Wilde's
  cicerones in the subculture. At the trial, the police deposed that
  women's clothes, a wig, and a brooch were found in Taylor's rooms
  after his arrest, all of which were held to be incriminating evidence
  of his perverted tendencies.
<sup><a name="REF24" href="#FOOT24">24</a></sup>

<p>
The delineation of the homosexual as a "separate species" at the end of
the nineteenth century depends on the scrutiny of the well-established
effeminate cross-dressers at the center of a theatrical and bohemian
homosexual metropolitan demimonde in Anglo-American culture.
<sup><a name="REF25" href="#FOOT25">25</a></sup>
  Before Boulton and Park's scandalous performances came to light, two
  men together, in conventional male clothing, would not have aroused any
  suspicion about their sexual orientation or preferences. Cross-dressing
  signaled to the medical and legal communities a new type of male
  sexual being. "In the early stages of concept formation about
  homosexuals," Moe Meyer shows, "acts of cross-dressing became,
  at times, the only distinguishing feature with which to identify
  homosexuals; consequently, many scientists believed that transvestites
  constituted the entire social subgroup" ("UW," 76). And pointing to
  the conclusions reached by George Chauncey's analysis of homosexuality
  in the American navy during World War I, he argues that "it was not
  sexual activity that labeled a man homosexual but his choice and use
  of particular signifying gestures of social role enactment" ("UW,"
  77). As Marjorie Garber demonstrates, "the history of transvestism
  and the history of homosexuality constantly intersect and intertwine,
  both willingly and unwillingly. They cannot simply be disentangled"
  (<i>VI,</i> 131). Thus, cross-dressing did not necessarily guarantee
  itself as a signifying practice of homosexuality; but certainly, by
  the time of the Great War, it could not be divorced from connotations
  of sexual perversity and aberrant desires.

<p>
In the connotative realm male military drag performances take
on their most acute significance and the full implications of
homosexuality manifest themselves within a dominant, militarist, and
heterosexist culture that forbids any open display of male-male erotic
desire. D. A. Miller has explored the signifying potential of "the shadow

<b></b>

kingdom of connotation" for the representation of proscribed desires in
a given dramatic context.
<sup><a name="REF26" href="#FOOT26">26</a></sup>
  He asserts that connotation is the dominant signifying practice
  of homophobic cultures, which insistently suppress or negate overt
  representation. Either as intended by the producer or received by the
  audience, connotation can exercise an uncontrollable force, for it
  "has the advantage of constructing an essentially insubstantial
  homosexuality," with "the corresponding inconvenience," for
  heteronormativity, "of tending to raise the ghost all over the place"
  ("AR," 125).

<p>
By 1914 female impersonation both neutralized and energized the
possibility of male homosexuality as a threat within authorized
forms of male homosocial desire. This dual power derives from the
connotative possibilities of drag that instigated a project of quasi
confirmation by refusing to delegitimate theatre's and drag's suspect
traditions. This refusal was itself a source of entertainment. The troupe
aboard <i>H.M.S. Calliope</i>, for example, included the song "So Pretty
a Gentleman Need Never Want a Lady" in its revue <i>One Damned Thing
After Another</i> , a flirtatious and highly suggestive gesture
acknowledging the desirability of men in uniform and the superfluity of
heterosexual courtship rituals in all-male environments. The multiple
entendre of such military theatricality, stemming from its music hall
roots, provided both the traditions and formal structure to elaborate
riotous connotation around the slippages between sex, gender, and
sexual orientation. The program for <i>Babes in the W(Censored)</i>
informed audiences that the ingenue, Marian Machree, was "Necessary in
the show for the Prince to carry on with. Compree?" Of course, this is
an effort to affirm heterosexual romance; but because the romance is
enacted by two soldiers it severely disrupts the "heterosexual matrix,"
to use Judith Butler's term.
<sup><a name="REF27" href="#FOOT27">27</a></sup>

<p>
The ever-present possibility that drag has ludic potentialities depends on
the dynamics involved in staging and reception. Because drag was situated
in both a long-standing tradition of carnivalesque entertainments and in
a more recent one of subcultural homosexual formations, male transvestic
theatre performances during the Great War operated in--and incited--a
complex circuit of encoding and decoding. In turn they expanded the
range of desiring gazes and proliferated scopophilic pleasures. Drag
could be transferred to the front lines because its subversive potential
(enabling gay subcultural forms to flourish within and exploit homosocial
arrangements) went hand in hand with its conservative and misogynistic
ability to shore up normative arrangements of sex, gender, and sexuality
in an acutely homophobic context. Because so much material originally
performed by women was recontextualized from contemporary music halls,
revues, and operettas on the home front, and staged in all-male
theatrical locations on the front lines, the process of resiting and
reciting this material affirmed the slippage and connotation upon which
drag capitalized. For example, "Miss" P. R. Morgan, a male member of
the Royal Navy's <i>Timbertown Follies</i> traveling revue, was a hit
with his performance of the popular song "I'll Make a Man of You,"
first performed by a female singer in <i>The Passing Show</i> at the
London Hippodrome in the autumn of 1914.
<sup><a name="REF28" href="#FOOT28">28</a></sup>
  A jingoistic but naughtily suggestive appeal to women to use their
  sexual wiles to shame men into enlisting, the verse praises feminine
  powers of persuasion:

<b></b>



<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
I teach the tenderfoot to face the powder
<br />
That adds an added lustre to my skin,
<br />
And I show the raw recruit how to give a chaste salute,
<br />
So when I'm presenting arms he's falling in.
<br />
It makes you almost proud to be a woman
<br />
When you make a strapping soldier of a kid.
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
But the idea of a sexually aggressive woman recruiting and "initiating"
new soldiers for the military would certainly have taken on additional
valences when performed by a man for the delectation of other men. For the
queer comedic possibilities of Morgan's performance at the front lines
could only have had cultural relevance against a backdrop of spotlit
cross-dressing homosexuals like Victor Wilson, who had a fetishistic
and promiscuous yen for men in uniform. Here is the song's refrain:


<blockquote>
<!--_poetry-->
On Sunday I walk out with a soldier.
<br />
On Monday I'm taken by a tar,
<br />
On Tuesday I'm out with a baby Boy Scout,
<br />
On Wednesday a Hussar,
<br />
On Thursday I gang oot wi' a Scottie,
<br />
On Friday the Captain of the Crew.
<br />
But on Saturday I'm willing, if you'll only take a shilling,
<br />
To make a man of any one of you.
<sup><a name="REF29" href="#FOOT29">29</a></sup>
<!--_/poetry-->
</blockquote>

<p>
At one level, the requirement for soldiers in drag to perform as public
spectacle in homosocial formations was a seemingly unquestioned--and
rather unexceptional--extension of esprit de corps. But while the
spectacle of a soldier in drag functioned according to the "safety
valve" model of cathartic ritual, the form and content of the drag
performer's "act," strongly dependent as it was on multiple entendre,
close physical contact with other men (both in and out of drag), and
the illusion of eroticized, idealized, and objectified femininity,
disrupted the boundaries that contained the act as a necessary release
in an all-male environment. A spectator's desiring and approving gaze on
a soldier in drag was not simply a matter of pleasure in a "surrogate"
woman; rather, his gaze was directed at an effeminate-acting man in drag,
a fellow soldier in his own military organization. Not a woman, but
another soldier here enacted the unstable role of desired and desirable
"woman." Indeed, as Fuller notes, many soldiers preferred watching men
in drag to "real" female performers, many of whom were able to tour the
front lines, but were not respected since they were outsiders to the
homosocial formation (<i>TM,</i> 106).

<p>
Military theatrical cross-dressing was, therefore, a perfect instantiation
of connotation--the practice, as Miller puts it, in which "insinuations
could be at once developed and denied, where . . . one couldn't be sure
whether homosexuality was being meant at all, but on the chance that
it was, one also learned, along with codes that might be conveying it,
the silence necessary to keep about their deployment" ("AR," 125). Early
modern gay popular culture found its surprisingly secure refuge on stage
in the Great War. Records of wartime courts martial made it clear that
officially-sanctioned paramilitary

<b></b>

theatricals were thickly populated by "perfectly charming and very
affectionate" cross-dressing gay men.
<sup><a name="REF30" href="#FOOT30">30</a></sup>
  The rich connotative possibilities of drag enabled the spectator to
  decode what was seen and heard on stage according to what Garber calls
  an "erotics" of interpretation (experienced individually and as part of
  a collective audience) that may be both enjoyable and anxiety-ridden
  while remaining never fully cognate within a homophobic interpretive
  economy (<i>VI,</i> 158).



<h3>
<!--_a-head-->
There's Nothing Like a Dame
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
The ambiguities that marked cross-dressing on the military stage arose
from varying stylistic traditions that had already evolved in the history
of female impersonation by 1914. Put simply, drag took two divergent
forms, mimicry and mimesis, which governed the interpretive decoding of
the act.
<sup><a name="REF31" href="#FOOT31">31</a></sup>
  Mimicry was most visibly embodied in the pantomime "dame" tradition, a
  comedic effort to render the female form in its most hypercarnivalized
  manner: the grotesque, oversized, and voracious body of the raddled,
  "ugly" woman presented on stage out of a misogynistic animus. There
  was no attempt to eroticize the impersonated female body in this
  tradition. Indeed, there was no effort made to "pretend" that this was
  an idealized female body being impersonated. In the grotesque-burlesque
  strain of female impersonation there was never an attempt to convey
  a plausible illusion of the sex being "aped." A perennial component
  of Victorian and Edwardian British music hall, pantomime, and farce,
  the burlesque mimicry of the dame tradition pervaded the military
  camp and shipboard revues during the war. <i>Cinderella,</i> a
  pantomime staged by "The Workshops Entertainers" of the Royal Army
  Medical Corps in December 1916, permitted at least three men to
  cross-dress as the Fairy Godmother and the Ugly Sisters (the title
  role of Cinderella was taken by one Lance Corporal Kay and played
  in the mimetic tradition). Donning the dame's grotesque persona
  was, in effect, a "safe" (de-eroticized) form of cross-dressing
  theatricality, in which desire for the impersonator was drained away
  by the gynephobic comedic motive of restoring sex and gender norms. As
  Laurence Senelick points out, the dame tradition in British theatre
  allowed female impersonation but "offered minimal threat to standard
  gender identities" ("BGT," 80). There was no sexual allure intended
  by the cross-dresser participating in this tradition, only mockery of
  the dame's deluded fantasies that "she" was sexually alluring to other
  men on stage or in the audience. The tradition was maintained because,
  as a late nineteenth-century commentator remarked, "a man in female
  garb is apt to appear awkward and ungainly," and fatally "unsexed."
<sup><a name="REF32" href="#FOOT32">32</a></sup>

<p>
But another tradition of female impersonation was well established by
the time of the Great War, one in which sexual appeal was very much
foregrounded. The desire for mimesis in female impersonation was a
strenuous, but illusionistic, effort to align the body of the female
impersonator as closely as possible to the body of an erotically alluring
woman. Lance Corporal Kay as Cinderella would have had to adhere to
this tradition in order to offset the three dames in the pantomime who
provide necessary comic relief. The photographs of the diminutive and
attractive Kay in the Workshops

<b></b>

Entertainers' program depict an ideal recruit for the part. Thus the
Prince's and the Page's songful declarations of adoration and fidelity
("If You Were the Only Girl in the World" and "They Didn't Believe Me")
were not intended as mockery, but had ripe connotative possibility.

<p>
Kay's mimetic portrayal of Cinderella exemplified what Senelick refers
to as "glamour drag." Glamor drag differs from the grotesque mimicry
of the dame tradition in its insistence on representing ("imitating")
idealized femininity as closely as possible.
<sup><a name="REF33" href="#FOOT33">33</a></sup>
  Senelick traces the tradition of mimesis to the 1860s, when
  a burgeoning homosexual subculture first gained notoriety and
  public visibility in the Boulton-Park scandal. In the glamor drag
  tradition that had evolved in the last third of the nineteenth century,
  "homosexual men as well as heterosexual transvestites could experiment
  with gender shuffling in a context that won them approbation
  and indulgence; the audience could savor sexually provocative
  behavior because it had been neutralized by the transvestism"
  ("BGT," 93). While Senelick may be correct in allowing for drag's
  neutralizing possibilities, it would be incorrect to deny the
  concomitant possibility that glamor drag can inspire an eroticized and
  identificatory response on the part of the viewer. The glamorous drag
  artist or female impersonator did not exaggerate disparities between
  male and female bodies, but rather attempted to minimize them. Glamor
  drag became ubiquitous for the first time behind the front lines
  during the Great War. And if anything, the special circumstances of
  mass homosocial formations in that context threw into sharp relief
  the wildly unpredictable potential of drag for articulating male-male
  desires across the entire continuum of homosocial desire.

Over the Top Performances
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
The panicked, vehement tone adopted by John Brophy and Eric Partridge
in their lexicon, <i>Songs and Slang of the British Soldier</i> ,
gives us grounds for suspicion of their denial of a homoerotic charge
inhering in the spectacle of glamor drag. Defining "leg-show" as the
general term for "vaudeville entertainment," the doughty lexicographers
assert, "Probably no other generation will ever be able to guess at
all the excitement and pleasurable atmosphere of naughtiness generated
between 1914 and 1918 by the word legs."
<sup><a name="REF34" href="#FOOT34">34</a></sup>
  They hastily assure us that the term refers to "female legs, of course;
  the other sort were not considered" (ibid.). Their unconvincing postwar
  recuperation of wartime entertainments flies in the face of the sheer
  enormity of cross-dressed theatrical performance during the war.

<p>
Recorded responses to the frequent sight of male body parts (both clothed
and unveiled) attest to the effectiveness of the mimetic power of male
glamor drag during the war. A typical response to mimetic impersonation
of idealized femininity was Major R. S. Cockburn's appraisal of "Kitty
O'Hara" in the 55th Divisional Theatre Company revue <i>Thumbs.</i>
Cockburn wrote to his brother that "Kitty O'Hara--a young girl of
infinite charm and beauty, was prettier than most girls whom you see
on the London stage. It was impossible to think of her as anything else
but a delightful flapper."
<sup><a name="REF35" href="#FOOT35">35</a></sup>
  But he recovers his credulity, recognizing the reality of O'Hara's
  masculine body: "She

<b></b>

was really an ordinary, simple Canadian lad of some twenty years who had
been 'over the top' nine times" (ibid.). Lieutenant G. Harvard Thomas,
in training at the 3rd Army Infantry School in January, 1918, informed his
parents about the division's Christmas pantomime, <i>Dick Whittington</i>:
"It was far and away the best I have seen out here. The boy who took the
part of the girl acted so well that it was very difficult to believe it
was actually a man" (qtd. in <i>IW,</i> 155). Closer to the front, the
Gaiety Theatre players of the 26th Division presented a repeat season of
their version of <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> as their Christmas 1917 pantomime
to appreciative Army audiences in Macedonia. The theatre program quotes
from a review of the previous years' performances, suggesting a very
willing desire both to suspend disbelief and to delight actively in the
proliferation of gender and sex misalignments, which connote transgressive
sexuality:



<blockquote>
<!--_extract-->
In addition to a brilliant male chorus, there is a "beauty chorus," whose
dancing is again a credit to Sergt. Drury. The title-role is played by
P[rivate] Peter Upcher in the accepted principal boy style, and as Susan,
Lance-Corpl. Billie Blowey uses a remarkable soprano voice to advantage.
<sup><a name="REF36" href="#FOOT36">36</a></sup>
<!--_/extract-->
</blockquote>

<p>
The dizzying spectacle of Upcher playing a rugged male character (Crusoe)
in conventional pantomime terms (as a young woman) romancing a man
portraying a young woman (Blowey) properly allowed for all kinds of
polymorphous desire and erotically-charged decodings to flourish. The
"principal boy" in British pantomime is a "breeches role" enacted by a
young woman, which would suggest that Upcher's audiences would have had
ample opportunity to objectify his/her legs.

<p>
Obviously carrying on its own successful tradition of glamor drag,
the following year the Gaiety Theatre mounted a new production of a
revue entitled <i>Delightful,</i> an Orientalist extravaganza set in
"Baghdad," in which the ladies of the harem were played by seminaked men;
by men, moreover, who were crossing the boundaries of both sex and race,
and drawing on the minstrel tradition that informs British popular
theatre. The revue staged a carnivalesque scene in another same-sex
erotic space: the harem. The program informs us that "the Harem favorite,
Louana Lou" was played by Private W. Abbott, whose "Eastern Dance" was
"arranged by Private J. Davies."
<sup><a name="REF37" href="#FOOT37">37</a></sup>
  The chorus members were required to portray both "Soldiers and Ladies
  of the Harem" (ibid.). (Presumably eunuchs were beyond the pale.) It
  is possible to surmise that female impersonation in this company,
  at least, was not completely dependent on the dame tradition. In
  order for the harem scene to work, the emphasis would most likely
  have been on glamor, particularly during the choreographed dance
  numbers. <i>Delightful</i> staged a T. E. Lawrentian fantasy of the
  sexual availability of the oriental Other, here simultaneously male
  and female.

<p>
Fuller correctly argues that the appeal of soldiers in drag "shows the
intensity of the desire to believe," which sustains the power of mimesis;
but he errs in insisting that such a desire was fully comprehensible
only in heterosexual terms. In his view, drag flourished to provide a
heterosexually-affirming fantasmatic substitute in the absence of the
opposite sex in wartime. Eric Hiscock's memoir <i>The Bells of Hell</i>
 seconds

<b></b>

this explanation by observing that "judging from the way [the men] sat
and goggled at the drag on stage it was obvious that they were indulging
in delightful fantasies that brought them substantial memories of the
girls they had left behind them in London, Manchester, Glasgow, wherever."
<sup><a name="REF38" href="#FOOT38">38</a></sup>

<p>
Yet the complex dynamics of men objectifying other men as women does
not occur completely within a heterosexual matrix. Soldiers in frocks
were not, as Hiscock and Fuller suggest, simply mimetically-reproduced
surrogates for the women they left behind. As Kate Davy perceptively
observes, "Female impersonation, while it certainly says something about
women, is primarily about men, addressed to men, and for men."
<sup><a name="REF39" href="#FOOT39">39</a></sup>
  Operating within circuits of male homosocial desire, the fetishization
  of cross-dressed male bodies drew upon differing dynamics of
  identification than the objectification of female bodies would
  have necessitated. At the very least, the successful performance
  and reception of hyperfemininity in glamor drag exceeded the
  erotic allure contained in--and expressed by--the body of a "mere"
  woman. A more revealing, but wonderfully ambivalent, explanation
  for the mass-acceptance of drag was made by H. C. Owen in his memoir
  <i>Salonica and After</i> : "it all seems to show that English
  beauty is essentially masculine."
<sup><a name="REF40" href="#FOOT40">40</a></sup>
  He may well have intended to define female beauty in masculine terms,
  to suggest that British women were at their most beautiful when they
  most looked like men. The slippage that inheres in the statement
  effectively eradicates women's existence: male beauty not only
  exists, but cannot be conceived of in anything other than "masculine"
  terms. Thus there was an ineradicable trace of homoeroticism at the
  heart of drag during the Great War.

<p>
Nonetheless most conventional responses to the spectacle emphasize
the verisimilitude possible in drag. There was an unshakable belief
that men could successfully fulfil the act of embodying the other sex
(in some kind of one-to-one correspondence) that indicates a hunger for
the carnivalesque and redressive capabilities of cross-dressing as an
outlet for frustrated heterosexual desires.

<p>
Drag had more radical potential than this, however. In reality, the
spectacle does not involve the simple suspension of disbelief that
the "woman" is actually a man. Rather, a simultaneous and coterminous
process of avowal and disavowal never loses sight of the fact that the
female impersonator is always-also a man, never not-just a woman. As
Mark Simpson notes, drag is always a pretense, "an ecstasy of surfaces"
that focuses intense scopophilic attention to an "assumed" female body
in order to distract attention away from its male reality.
<sup><a name="REF41" href="#FOOT41">41</a></sup>
  A man watching another man in drag must, at some level,
  self-reassuringly avow that the "woman" has a penis. But this act of
  speculation threatens to put the male spectator beyond the boundaries
  of the heterosexual matrix.

<p>
Moreover, in a military environment like that of the Great War, drag
satisfies the psychic demands for a defense against war's potential
unmanning of the male body. This potential unmanning fosters the kind
of castration anxiety that makes men extraordinarily receptive to the
ritual possibility of defending themselves against the loss of "manhood"
through the fetishistic opportunities afforded by drag.
<sup><a name="REF42" href="#FOOT42">42</a></sup>
  The transvestite permits the spectator and the performer to "play"
  at giving up the phallus in order

<b></b>

to recover (the illusion of having) the phallus. Thus there is always
a simultaneous acknowledgment that what the man in drag has pretended
to surrender is always really there. In a fundamental way, a psychic and
social dynamic of same-sex identification exists between the performer and
the spectator in the homosocial realm of theatrical cross-dressing. The
drag performance activating incoherent desires in wartime environments
cannot fully or predictably recuperate the act for heterosexual
surrogacy. The inchoate nature of the signifying processes coupled
with anxiety-laden psychic forms of spectator-performer identification
ultimately helped to seal the ruptures between homosexuality and
heterosexuality as well as those between desire and identification.

Carnivalizing Homosocial Desire
<!--_/a-head-->
</h3>



<p>
So far I have argued for the utopian possibilities of the social drama and
delighted in the spectacle of an endorsed homosocial ritual that was so
very patently--but also tantalizingly, elusively--constituted by elements
of "perversion." It is possible to regard the polymorphously perverse
performativity of much military theatre during the Great War in the way
that Richard Dyer conceives of modern popular entertainment. However
much implicated in commercial and politically conservative imperatives,
popular theatrical forms like music hall, revue, pantomime, operetta,
and historical pageant did not unproblematically reproduce the dominant
heterosexual matrix in which male homosocial desire was supposed to
operate. Rather, cross-dressing provided, according to the logic of
redress in the social drama, a "solution" to the crises inhering in a
ruptured homosocial continuum. Dyer sees entertainment as both escape and
wish fulfillment, two fundamentally utopian motivations that express a
culture's sense that "things could be better, that something other than
what it is can be imagined, and may be realized."
<sup><a name="REF43" href="#FOOT43">43</a></sup>
  If there was, at some level, a yearning to repair the schisms in the
  continuum that had been discursively produced by the time of the Great
  War, British men in military formations established a space in which
  to escape from confining definitions and proscribed desires. Dyer
  notes that entertainment does not prescribe a "model" of a utopian
  world; "Rather utopianism is contained in the feelings it embodies"
  (<i>OE,</i> 18). Entertainment, he asserts, "presents, head-on as
  it were, what utopia would feel like rather than how it would be
  organized. It thus works at the level of sensibility" (ibid.).

<p>
I want to contend (to second Dyer) that the proliferation of soldiers
and sailors in frocks hardly provided a model of a homo-utopian world
in which the homosocial continuum was restored to some pristine state,
a mythic realm of Theban bands and unashamed soldier-lovers. This would
have been, by 1914, utterly unsustainable. Yet the expression, through
drag, of a male homosocial community less marked by anxiety about the
troubling intimacy of male-male desires and identifications must have
answered to the felt inadequacies of a homophobic society that legally
enforced same-sex social arrangements. As Dyer puts it, "to be effective
the utopian sensibility has to take off from the real experiences of the
audience. Yet to do this, to draw attention to the gap between what is
and what could be, is, ideologically speaking, playing with

<b></b>

fire" (<i>OE,</i> 25-6). There is no question that the spectacle of
soldiers in frocks flirted with dangerous and submerged desires and
anxieties that it only insufficiently clarified and purged. Yet the
cathartic and abreactive staging of transvestic expressions of same-sex
desire, drawing on the subcultural forces that were otherwise alien
to bourgeois, militarist, and heterosexist institutions, permitted
the appearance of marked ambiguity and the emergence of liminal spaces
between breaks in the homo/hetero divide. Those unfortunates excluded
from the therapeutic performance, like "THE EFFEMINATE SOLDIER," Frederick
Wright, the "DESERTER WHO LOVES TO WEAR BEAUTIFUL DRESSES," were pitiful
victims of an otherwise wholly destructive social drama. That Wright and
Victor Wilson had the misfortune to cavort on an unsanctioned "stage"
to a hostile "audience" does not give us cause to posit a completely
dysphoric vision of the cultural processes of maintaining homosexual panic
within the terms of homosocial desire. After all, the transgressive and
disruptive could still be tantalizingly glimpsed out in the limelight on
other, safer stages, however much those stages may have been constructed
on risky foundations. Yet this sanctioned disorder served all the more
to restore the boundaries that provided for the necessary exclusion of
transgressive forces in the formation of social and sexual identity in
postwar British society. This social drama of the homo/hetero divide
would go on to have a very long and successful run.

Drag was pervasive in popular British culture at large during the Great
War (as it seems to be, perdurably); moreover, within theatrical locales,
cross-dressed women were a vital part of dominant forms of popular
culture: viz. the 22 July 1917 theatre page of the weekly [London]
<i>Sunday Pictorial,</i> which announced: "A Male Impersonation:
Next week's first night will be <i>What a Catch!</i> at the Duke of
York's. Mr. Lupino Lane will play principal male, though he may find a
keen rival in Miss Ruby Miller, who will be seen in masculine attire"
(B11). However, the gender upheavals denoted by cross-dressing would have
taken on additional significance in the context of the mass spectacle
of women in military uniform during the war.

<i>NFA,</i> 7. The Puritans, in particular, had expressed their enmity
to the theatrical in terms of deviant sexuality; Phillip Stubbes, in
<i>Anatomie of Abuses</i>  fulminated against the playhouse as the
resort of sodomites: "Everyone brings another homeward of their way, very
friendly, and in their secret conclaves covertly they play the Sodomite or
worse" (qtd. in <i>NFA,</i> 8). William Prynne, in a 1632 denunciation of
the theatre, asserted that "the putting on of women's array (especially to
act a lascivious, amorous lovesick play upon stage) must needs be sinful,
yea abominable; because it not only excites many adulterous filthy lusts,
both in the actors and spectators . . . but likewise instigates them to
self-pollution and that unnatural Sodomitical sin of uncleanness." Qtd. in

an Obsession</i> (London, Thames and Hudson, 1979), 94.

The theatre archives of the Imperial War Museum reveal that some
especially convincing "glamour drag" soldier-divas created a kind of
star system and entire productions were built around these "stars." For
example, one lavishly illustrated <i>Play Pictorial</i> from the war
years featured "The Crumps," an unnamed division's concert party. Their
production of "On the Staff" starred one Private Purkiss, who in scene
after scene is the focus of attraction; e.g. the scene entitled, "The
Arrival of a Lady Upsets the Major." Judging by the photographs Purkiss
was astonishingly effective.

I should emphasize that since theatrical drag seems to occur within
all male homosocial milieux, castration anxiety might seem, rather
strangely, to be endemic to patriarchy's self-created comfort zones. On
a more serious note, the effects of "unmanning" are more immediately and
literally visible in war zones, which may account for the sheer ubiquity
of theatrical cross-dressing in the military at war, at least since
1914 (see B&eacute;rub&eacute;, 67-97). And as many feminist critics
have pointed out (from Virginia Woolf in <i>Three Guineas</i> forward),
military uniform is itself a kind of drag, a costume instantiating and
subverting gender norms.
